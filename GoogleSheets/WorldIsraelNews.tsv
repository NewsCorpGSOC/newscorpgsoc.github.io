IDF kills terrorists who murdered six Israeli hostages in tunnel	The IDF retrieved the bodies of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, Eden Yerushalmi, 24, Ori Danino, 25, Almog Sarusi, 25, Alexander Lobanov, 32, and Carmel Gat, 40, in Rafah last month. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari revealed that the IDF eliminated two terrorists who held the six murdered Israeli hostages whose bodies were recovered in late August. The IDF retrieved the bodies of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, Eden Yerushalmi, 24, Ori Danino, 25, Almog Sarusi, 25, Alexander Lobanov, 32, and Carmel Gat, 40, in Rafah. They were shot in the head execution-style just two days before their bodies were discovered by security forces. Hagari reported that 'troops from the 162nd Division identified two terrorists emerging from an underground tunnel shaft in the Tel al-Sultan area and eliminated them during an encounter.' He explained that the IDF was able to determine that the two neutralized terrorists were the ones who held the six murdered hostages by taking DNA samples from the equipment recovered after they fled and matching them with DNA collected in the tunnels where the hostages were held. 'Based on the findings and the information available to us, these terrorists that were killed were the same terrorists who were in the tunnel where the bodies of the six hostages were discovered,' said Hagari. 'The findings show they were there when they were murdered, and we are investigating their involvement in the murder. Should we obtain further information, we will first update the families and then the public,' Hagari added. Hagari concluded by saying the IDF will 'pursue and reach everyone responsible for this heinous murder, and we will not stop until we reach them all.' In addition to establishing the time of death and the cause of death, the forensic examinations showed that the hostages had suffered from neglect, that they had not bathed for a lengthy time, and that they had sustained severe injuries, which were later treated. The remains of the six captives were found without the benefit of intelligence information when a unit of IDF soldiers were traversing a tunnel under Rafah.

IDF announces new security restrictions for northern Israel	The restrictions apply to civilians from Haifa northward. By i24 and Algemeiner Staff Israel’s Home Front Command is issuing new security restrictions on civilians applying from the Haifa area and northward, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Spokesperson Daniel Hagari announced on Saturday. Hagari said educational institutions and workplaces are permitted to operate if an adequate shelter is nearby and can be reached in time. The official also announced restrictions on gatherings: Up to 30 people outdoors and 300 people indoors. The changes are unfolded as the IDF scales up its airstrikes against Hezbollah sites and rocket launchers in Lebanon.

Israel considers scrapping 200 shekel bill	Israel’s move is largely driven by its desire to combat black money transactions within the Arab sector. By Jewish Breaking News Israel may be on the verge of eliminating its largest banknote as part of an ambitious plan to combat crime. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated this massive economic reform during a Thursday meeting of the Subcommittee on Advancing the Fight Against Crime in the Arab Sector. At the meeting, he reportedly directed the Finance Minister and the Governor of the Bank of Israel to evaluate the feasibility of cancelling the 200 shekel note. According to Arutz Sheva, a plan is being drafted by a team of nine economists that proposes gradually phasing out the note. It would begin with the next printing cycle, followed by a brief transition period allowing citizens to exchange their existing 200 shekels. Within a few years the bill will be eliminated entirely. Israel’s move is largely driven by its desire to combat black money transactions within the Arab sector. Like most money laundering schemes, these illicit financial dealings frequently rely on high-value banknotes for their convenience and anonymity. However, some financial experts are warning of massive blowback from phasing out the 200 shekel note. They argue that sophisticated criminal networks will simply adapt by shifting to foreign currencies or more opaque digital alternatives. Meanwhile, small businesses, street vendors, and elderly individuals who rely on cash transactions will face financial exclusion. Furthermore, the costs of transitioning to a more cashless society, including investments in new payment infrastructure and public education, could be substantial.

IDF eliminates 16 Hezbollah Radwan commanders	Ibrahim Aqil was the top commander of the Radwan force and was planning an invasion of Galilee. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Friday, the IDF eliminated 16 top Hezbollah Radwan force commanders, including the leader Ibrahim Aqil. Israel's military operation targeted the Radwan Force commanders meeting in the basement of a building in the Dahieh neighborhood of Beirut. Aqil was the top commander of the Radwan force and was planning an invasion of Galilee. Ahmed Wahbi, head of the Radwan training unit, was also eliminated. Wahbi was also heavily involved in planning the Galilee invasion and, according to the IDF, was 'advancing Hezbollah’s entrenchment in southern Lebanon while attempting to improve the organization’s ground combat capabilities.' Other terror Radwan commanders killed in the operation included Hassan Hussein, commander of special forces in the Aziz regional division; Samer Halawi, commander of the coastal region; Abbas Muslimani, commander of the Qana region; Abdullah Hijazi, commander of the Ramim Ridge region; Muhammad Reda, commander of the Khiam region; Hassan Madi, commander of the Mount Dov region; Hassan Abd al-Satar, head of operations; Hussein Hadraj, chief of staff; Mohammad al-Attar, commander of the training department; and Mahmoud Hamad, a senior operations officer. Concerning the operation, the IDF said, 'These Radwan terror commanders were plotting an attack and invasion into Israel's territory for years and were ready to carry out the plans at a moment's notice when given the order.' 'Aqil and the other commanders eliminated in the strike were responsible for planning and executing hundreds of terror attacks against Israelis, including the planned invasion of the Galilee,' the IDF announced. Hezbollah, which doesn't always acknowledge the elimination of their leaders, confirmed that Aqil and others had been killed and said his body had been recovered from under the rubble. The attack on Friday further damaged Hezbollah's leadership and capabilities after massive explosions of walkie-talkies used by terrorists. The beeper explosions wounded thousands of terrorists and killed 37.

By TPS A short while ago, an Israeli airstrike targeted a building in Beirut, according to initial reports killing senior Hezbollah official Ibrahim Aqil. According to Alma Research and Education center, Aqil, also known by his aliases Al Haj Abdul Khader and Haj Tahsin, was a prominent figure in Hezbollah’s military structure. He served on the group’s Jihad Council and was responsible for overseeing Hezbollah’s air and ground units, including the elite Radwan forces. Aqil’s significance in the organization traces back to his involvement in attacks against American targets in Lebanon in 1983, alongside notorious operative Imad Mughniyeh.

Aqil reportedly had faced internal criticism recently over his handling of military operations during the ongoing war. According to the Department of State website, the U.S. government offers a reward up to 7 million dollars for information leading to his capture, citing his involvement in past terrorist activities. While Israeli officials await Hezbollah’s formal acknowledgment of Aqil’s death, Hezbollah-affiliated media have issued instructions not to spread rumors to avoid 'playing into the enemy’s hands.'

IDF and security forces eliminate terrorist leader in Judea and S...	Shadi Zakarneh was killed alongside other terrorists by an IAF strike on his vehicle after Shin Bet saw him traveling in Qabatiya. By World Israel News Staff On Thursday, the IDF and Israel's security forces (Shin Bet) eliminated a terror leader who planned numerous attacks in Northern Samaria. Shadi Zakarneh was killed alongside other terrorists by an IAF strike on his vehicle after Shin Bet saw him traveling in Qabatiya. The strike that killed Zkarneh also eliminated two other terrorists in the vehicle and a strike on an additional vehicle killed three others. The second vehicle was laden with explosives, and the strike caused multiple blasts. As part of the operation, four wanted security forces arrested terrorists. Troops from the elite Dudevan unit killed four terrorists during the battle and confiscated weapons belonging to the terrorists. The United Nations General Assembly is slated to vote on a new draft resolution that would, if passed, demand Israel ethnically cleanse Judea and Samaria of its Jewish population. The text of the draft calls explicitly for the end of Israel’s presence in Judea and Samaria and a full withdrawal of military forces and Israeli civilian populations,' Channel 12 reported Monday. The draft resolution will be placed on the General Assembly’s docket during its upcoming 79th session, slated to open on Tuesday. According to Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon, the General Assembly will vote on the resolution sometime next week. In addition to demanding Israel terminate its military and civilian presence in Judea and Samaria, the resolution calls on U.N. member states to impose sanctions on Israeli leaders and to adopt arms embargos on the Jewish state. In a statement late Sunday night, Danon excoriated the Palestinian Authority mission for submitting the draft, and called on the General Assembly to reject the proposal. 'The resolution calls, among other things, for the end of an Israeli presence in ‘the Palestinian territories’ within six months, the IDF’s withdrawal from ‘the territories,’ a halt to ‘settlements,’ and the return of [Palestinians] ‘to their land’. 'If this resolution passes in the General Assembly, especially on the one-year anniversary of the October 7th massacre — the deadliest attack against Jews since the Holocaust — it will be a reward for terrorism and a message to the world that the barbaric slaughter of children, the rape of women and the kidnapping of innocent civilians is a worthwhile tactic.' 'I call on the General Assembly to reject this disgraceful resolution outright, and instead adopt a resolution condemning Hamas and calling for the immediate release of all hostages. Let it be clear: nothing will stop Israel or deter it from its mission to bring home the hostages and eliminate Hamas.'

The deadly pager operation in Lebanon is no laughing matter. Or i...	A man dressed as an Orthodox Jew sits behind a table reading Honest Shlomo’s discount pagers. By Andrew Silow-Carroll, JTA First came the explosions. Then came the jokes. Within minutes of news that several members of Hezbollah were killed and hundreds wounded by pagers that had been doctored to explode en masse, allegedly by Israel, Jews on social media shared memes celebrating the operation and mocking its targets. Examples: A man dressed as an Orthodox Jew sits behind a table reading 'Honest Shlomo’s discount pagers.' A pager’s message reads '72 Virgins,' a reference to the concept that Muslim martyrs will be rewarded with 72 maidens in heaven. Some attributed the message to 'Moti Rola,' a spurious Hebrew name riffing on the Motorola brand. Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah, takes a call from a follower boasting that he found a good deal on the electronic devices. And because the pagers were presumably in the pockets of Hezbollah operatives, castration was a popular theme. One cartoon shows a dead Hezbollah man arriving in heaven to greet his virgins, who gasp at his missing genitals. The jokes continued on Wednesday, with news that walkie-talkies wired to explode had killed at least 25 in Lebanon. 'No more walkie. No more talkie,' wrote David Hazony, director and fellow at the Z3 Institute for Jewish Priorities, on X. The taunting memes and jokes came as a war on another front, in Gaza, grinds on; as negotiations over a ceasefire and efforts to free the Israeli hostages are at a standstill; and as Israel is still reeling from the murder of six hostages earlier last month who were seemingly on the verge of their rescue. For some, the humor is a release valve, celebrating what feels like a rare, clear Israeli 'win' in its second-front battle against an enemy that has fired rockets into the country’s evacuated north on a near-daily basis. For others, however, the mockery crosses a line, and violates a traditional Jewish ethic that discourages undue rejoicing over the deaths of one’s enemy. Laughing also became harder for some as it became clear that while the attacks were a long-planned operation designed to target Hezbollah operatives, others had been harmed, including children who were killed. Sometimes, both sentiments are being felt simultaneously. For Rabbi Ariel Rackovsky, of Congregation Shaare Tefilla, an Orthodox synagogue in Dallas, the memes were both humorous and troubling. 'Candidly, I thought they were hilarious,' he said in an interview. 'From the perspective of Jewish tradition, certainly for Israelis to be engaging in dark humor is absolutely a legitimate way to deal with stress.' Dear Hezbollah,There’s no other way. A little humor. The memes coming out are crazy. pic.twitter.com/yVhjk5alUi &mdash; Nancy Mako (@NancyMako) September 18, 2024 He quoted rabbis, including the 19th-century Modern Orthodox pioneer Raphael Samson Hirsch and Daniel Z. Feldman, a leading rabbi at Yeshiva University’s rabbinic seminary, who said humor is an appropriate response to stress. 'But at the same time, after that perhaps initial reaction, I think that is worth being a little more circumspect,' continued Rackovsky, who posted on Facebook about his ambivalence. 'After all, our tradition does teach us that we should not celebrate excessively over the downfall of our enemies.' The emotion he endorsed in his Facebook post was 'gratitude' to God for the success of the operation. 'We should absolutely be thankful to God, but maybe not hand out candies, and not just because the optics of that are not great,' he said. Rackovsky may have been referring to another widely shared video, of Israelis handing out candy in Jerusalem following the operation in Lebanon — a gesture often reported in Arab communities after terror attacks in Israel. In response to that video, Ori Riddleman, an X user with 8,500 followers, asked in Hebrew, 'When did the phenomenon begin that we began to imitate the behavior of terrorist organizations?' On this and other issues, Judaism has multiple perspectives, as was pointed out on X by Rabbi Josh Yuter, an Orthodox rabbi based in Israel. He weighed in on the debate over the memes by re-upping a four-year-old Twitter thread referring to a number of contradictory sources, from an admonition in Proverbs ('If your enemy falls, do not exult…') to a seeming endorsement in Psalms (​​'The righteous man will rejoice when he sees revenge…'). 'I remind everyone that conflicting perspectives regarding rejoicing over the downfall of one’s enemies are attested in rabbinic literature, with some sources being deliberately misinterpreted,' Yuter added on Wednesday. Sara Yael Hirschhorn, a historian who writes widely about Israel, put the operation and the reactions in the context of pro-Palestinian activists and human rights bodies that justify the attacks by Hamas and Hezbollah on Israeli civilians as 'resistance.' 'I don’t take glee in death, but if Western ‘morality’ has now decided that terrorists can kill Jews/Israelis as ‘resistance’ but not BE killed by state actors as internationally recognized terror organizations,' she tweeted, 'where are we as both an ethical universe and international system?!' #Hezbollah #pager memes please. pic.twitter.com/rdC9z9l1kA &mdash; Jacob Faturechi (@Jacobionite) September 17, 2024 The debate over rejoicing seemed to have cost at least one X user his job. Howard Feldman, who wrote about local politics for News24, a news service in South Africa, posted on the social media site Tuesday calling the attacks 'genius' and 'very cool' for their precision. He also joked, 'From the liver to the knee …' — a reference to the Palestinian nationalist slogan 'From the river to the sea.' A few hours later he posted a letter from News24’s editor in chief terminating his column and explaining, 'News 24 can in no way be associated with writers who glorify violence, which you did in my opinion.' Feldman responded: 'And just like that @News24 have shown me who they are…' Gallows humor is a core aspect of Israeli society and 'sick' jokes cropped up on Israeli social media even in the weeks after Oct. 7. On television, YouTube and social media, Israelis shared jokes about their own fears, what they saw as a propaganda war against Israel and Jews and the failures of their own government. And yet little of this humor was directly about the war in Gaza or the grim conditions on the ground there, noted Benji Lovitt, a Jerusalem-based comedian who has co-written a book about Zionism and Israeli culture. 'I didn’t see much humor about Gaza because it’s war, many people in Gaza have died and many, many are suffering,' he said. 'It doesn’t matter who you want to blame, but you don’t want to punch down and make fun of people in Gaza.' By contrast, he said, Hezbollah has been launching missile strikes on Israel for 11 months, and the electronics attacks are seen as surgically targeting its operatives and rebuking criticism that Israel’s bombing in Gaza has been indiscriminate. 'We are laughing because we believe it’s a clear example of punching up,' said Lovitt. 'And it’s an amazing story. I think people are laughing because they’re celebrating Israeli innovation. 'And it’s been a crappy year. People need to laugh.' The post The deadly pager operation in Lebanon is no laughing matter.

Trump calls Hezbollah beeper explosion operation ‘Amazing and sad...	Trump: 'That was a real operation; there's no doubt about it.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In an interview with NewsMax, former President and Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump praised the beeper detonation operation against Hezbollah and IRGC terrorists as 'amazing' while at the same time characterizing the attack as 'sad.' Like many others commenting on the event, Trump stressed the uniqueness of the operation and said, 'No one has ever seen anything like it. It is amazing. It's so sad in so many ways but amazing.' Trump added, 'Look, they're fighting to win. They're both fighting to win. No one has ever heard of or seen such a thing. That was a real operation; there's no doubt about it.' document.createElement('video'); During the Presidential debate with Democratic Candidate Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump grilled Harris on the sincerity of her expressed support for Israel. He noted that she had skipped Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyhau’s July address to Congress – an event she was meant to preside over as vice-president. 'She hates Israel. She wouldn’t even meet with Netanyahu when he went to Congress to make a very important speech. She refused to be there because she was at a sorority party of hers,' Trump said of Harris. 'If she’s president, I believe that Israel will not exist within two years from now, and I’ve been pretty good at predictions,' he said. Trump noted that less than a month before October 7th, the Biden administration chose to unfreeze billions of dollars in Iranian assets as part of a prisoner exchange deal. 'Iran has $300 billion because they took off all the sanctions that I had,' Trump said. 'Iran had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah or any of the 28 different spheres of terror, and they are spheres of terror, horrible terror.' Iran was 'broke,' he continued. 'Now, they’re a rich nation, and now what they’re doing is they’re spreading the money around. Look at what’s happening with the Houthis and Yemen.' Trump said that the world is teetering on the edge of a devastating global conflict, and that lack of American leadership is exacerbating the danger.

Hostage families call on UNICEF to protect Israeli children capti...	We need international organizations, including UNICEF, to reach them there, in Gaza, to check on them, to take care of them,' said Tomer Keshet, a cousin of Yarden Bibas. By Sveta Listratov, TPS The families of Israeli hostages re'We need international organizations, including UNICEF, to reach them there, in Gaza, to check on them, to take care of them,' said Tomer Keshet, a cousin of Yarden Bibas.ached out to UNICEF in a bid to gain the release of two children still being held in Gaza. In a letter to Ted Chaiban, Deputy Executive Director of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Professor Aron Troen, a public health expert and member of Israeli Association of Public Health Physicians, urged the agency to uphold its mandate of protecting children by advocating for the immediate release of child hostages. Among the 101 hostages being held by Hamas are five-year-old Ariel Bibas and one-year-old brother, Kfir, who were taken captive with their parents, Yarden and Shiri from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7. 'UNICEF’s raison d’être is to protect the welfare of children everywhere… Yet, they have been largely ineffectual and passive in protecting the human rights of Israeli children,' Troen told The Press Service of Israel. He stressed that three million Israeli children are suffering from the effects of the ongoing conflict, many of whom are displaced, living under the constant threat of rocket attacks, or dealing with trauma. Tomer Keshet, a cousin of Yarden Bibas, recounted to TPS-IL a meeting with UNICEF representatives, including Director Catherine Russell, in Jerusalem on April 15. 'We told her in detail about the day they were kidnapped, about the family, the kids. We want them not to be just numbers on a list, but real people,' Keshet recalled. 'Ariel looks shy but has the energy of a red-haired kid. And Kfir was so tiny when we last saw him, and by now he has spent more time in captivity than living as a free man.' Russell tweeted of that meeting that the families 'shared devastating accounts of captivity, loss & heartbreak,' adding 'All the hostages must be released immediately.' The tweet, Keshet told TPS-IL, was 'a step in the right direction, but it’s not enough.' 'We need international organizations, including UNICEF, to reach them there, in Gaza, to check on them, to take care of them. The kids cannot spend almost a year in a tunnel. They cannot.' The Bibas children were last seen in a video filmed by Hamas showing Shiri Bibas holding Ariel and Kfir in her arms covered by a blanket and surrounded by armed terrorists. In late November, 110 Israelis and foreign nationals were released as part of a week-long truce between Israel and Hamas, including 37 Israelis who were 18 or younger. While most of the women and children were freed, Shiri, Ariel and Kfir were not among those returned. Hamas claimed the Bibas children and their mother were dead but never provided evidence. After the hostages were freed, Israel denounced Hamas for branding brothers Yigal and Or Yaakov, ages 12 and 16 respectively, with a motorcycle exhaust pipe to prevent their escape, and drugging the children when moving hostages from one location to another. Troen’s letter criticized The International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations for not visiting Israeli child hostages even once to ascertain their conditions, noting, 'This appalling failure to address their fundamental human rights and health needs has had disastrous consequences.' The letter also raised the situation of other Israeli children who lost their parents. For example, Troen’s nephew, 16-year-old Rotem Mathias, was shot during Hamas’s attack on Kibbutz Holit on October 7. While Rotem survived, his parents did not. Troen also denounced UNICEF’s imbalanced criticism of Israel. 'We frequently see statements and reports regarding the suffering of civilians and children in Gaza, but we don’t see the same urgency for the hostages or the three million children in Israel enduring this protracted war,' he told TPS-IL. This imbalance, Troen said, has created 'a profound sense of neglect and frustration in Israel.' At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

US officials admit that Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal unlikely ...	No deal is imminent,' one of the U.S. officials said. 'I’m not sure it ever gets done.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Despite making hopeful remarks about an imminent hostage deal and ceasefire in Gaza for weeks, US officials are finally admitting privately that such an agreement is unlikely before US President Joe Biden leaves office, the Wall Street Journal reports. At the same time, US officials said they would continue to pursue a peace agreement to avoid an escalation of tensions that could spread beyond the region. Although US officials acknowledge that they could encourage the warring parties on '90 percent' of the agreement, several sticking points between Hamas and Israel prevent a deal from proceeding. 'No deal is imminent,' one of the U.S. officials said. 'I’m not sure it ever gets done.' Top-level officials in the White House, State Department, and Pentagon cited the number of type of Palestinian prisoners Hamas wants to be released in exchange for hostages and Israel's desire to maintain control of the Philadelphi corridor on the border between Gaza and Egypt as two main reasons for the impasse. Many officials are frustrated with Hamas's intransigence and habit of making more demands without then saying 'yes' even when the demands are fulfilled. These officials have wondered if Hamas wants a deal or is pretending to negotiate to bolster its image. Other officials are impatient with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's insistence that Israel maintain control of the Philadelphi corridor. 'There’s no chance now of it happening,' an official from an Arab country said.'Everyone is in a wait-and-see mode until after the election. The outcome will determine what can happen in the next administration.' John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman, told reporters Wednesday that chances of a deal were 'daunting.' Although there were times an agreement seemed imminent, 'we aren’t any closer to that now than we were even a week ago.' Biden administration officials are dismayed that the absence of a hostage release deal and ceasefire agreement by the time the President leaves office could leave a stain on his legacy.

‘Uncommitted’ group won’t endorse Kamala Harris, Muslim voters al...	Recent polling suggests that Muslim American voters are increasingly flirting with the possibility of casting a ballot for Green Party candidate Jill Stein over Harris. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner A prominent anti-Israel political group announced that it will not endorse Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 US election despite Harris’s extensive outreach to the Arab American community. In a statement released on Thursday, the 'Uncommitted National Movement' criticized the Harris campaign for not agreeing to meet with Palestinian American families to discuss the possibility of implementing an arms blockade on Israel and a permanent ceasefire in Gaza if elected to office in November. The group claimed that its decision not to issue an endorsement of Harris came after months of pleading with the Democratic nominee and current US vice president to adopt anti-Israel positions on her policy platform. 'For months, we have urged Vice President Harris to shift her Gaza policy so we could mobilize voters in key states to save lives and our democracy,' the group wrote. The group also griped about the Democratic National Convention’s (DNC) refusal in August to allow a Palestinian American to speak from the event main stage. 'The DNC and the vice president’s campaign fumbled even a small gesture to unite our party ahead of November by rejecting the simple request for a Palestinian American speaker. Now, the vice president’s campaign is courting Dick Cheney while sidelining disillusioned anti-war voices,' Uncommitted wrote. Despite refusing to throw its support behind the Democratic nominee, the group also warned about the dangers of electing former US President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican nominee, back into the White House, suggesting that he will intensify the so-called 'genocide' against Palestinians in Gaza. The organization also asserted that Trump will persecute 'pro-Palestinian activism in the US.' The movement also urged its supporters to refrain from voting for a third party candidate, arguing that it would assist Trump in his quest to regain the Oval Office. 'We must block Donald Trump, which is why we urge Uncommitted voters to vote against him and avoid third-party candidates that could inadvertently boost his chances, as Trump openly boasts that third parties will help his candidacy,' the group wrote. The Uncommitted movement’s decision to formally withhold support from Harris came on the heels of US Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), the only Palestinian American woman in Congress, publicly refusing to endorse the Democratic nominee while speaking to a crowd at the Congressional Black Caucus annual convention last week. During the event, Tlaib claimed that her constituents 'don’t want blood on my hands' and believe Harris will continue the policies that have allowed the war in Gaza to persist. Recent polling suggests that Muslim American voters are increasingly flirting with the possibility of casting a ballot for Green Party candidate Jill Stein over Harris, in part due to frustration over US policy toward Israel and Gaza. A new poll from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) revealed that 40 percent of Muslim voters in Michigan plan on voting for Stein. Harris trailed Trump with Muslim voters in Michigan, 18 percent to 12 percent, the poll found. Stein, a far-left political figure, has aggressively courted the Arab American vote since launching her campaign. During public appearances, she frequently dons the keffiyeh — a traditional Arab headdress that, since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October, has become a sign of support for the Palestinian cause — and refers to the conflict as a 'genocide.' Stein has also claimed that Hamas’s Oct. 7 slaughter of 1,200 people throughout southern Israel was justified as an act of so-called 'self defense.' In lieu of supporting a candidate for the upcoming presidential election, the Uncommitted movement encouraged the public to engage in 'anti-war organizing.' The refusal of the prominent pro-Palestinian group to endorse Harris was the latest blow to the Democratic nominee’s efforts to court Arab American voters. On Tuesday, the Harris campaign unveiled a set of new digital ads targeting the heavily Arab American city of Dearborn, Michigan. The ads included clips of Harris expressing sympathy for civilians in Gaza and vowing to 'not be silent.' The DNC, where Harris officially became the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee, hosted a panel on 'Palestinian Human Rights' for the first time in history, in which activists accused Israel of committing a 'genocide' in Hamas-ruled Gaza. Though Harris has voiced support for the Jewish state’s right to existence and self defense, she has also expressed sympathy for far-left narratives that brand Israel as 'genocidal.' The vice president has additionally often criticized Israel’s war effort against the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas in Gaza.

US warplanes, ships and troops ready in the Middle East if the co...	Here’s a look at the U.S. military presence in the Middle East. By The Associated Press The U.S. has kept an increased military presence in the Middle East throughout much of the past year, with about 40,000 forces, at least a dozen warships, and four Air Force fighter jet squadrons spread across the region both to protect allies and to serve as a deterrent against attacks, several U.S. officials said. As attacks between Israel and Hezbollah sharply spiked this week, worries are growing that the conflict could escalate into an all-out war, even as Jerusalem keeps up its nearly yearlong fight against Hamas terrorists in Gaza. Hezbollah says Israel crossed a 'red line' with explosive attacks on its communications devices and vowed to keep up the missile strikes it’s launched since fellow Iranian-backed terrorist group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, setting off the war in Gaza. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant — who has spoken repeatedly this week to U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin — has declared the start of a 'new phase' of the war, shifting its focus to the northern front against Hezbollah in Lebanon. So far, the U.S. hasn’t signaled a troop increase or change as a result of the latest attacks, and there is already a beefed-up force in the region. 'We’re confident in the ability that we have there right now to protect our forces and should we need to come to the defense of Israel as well,' Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Thursday. A military official said the additional resources have helped as the U.S. patrols various conflict areas, including operations targeting the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, defending Israel and countering threats from Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have targeted commercial ships in the Red Sea and launched ballistic missiles at Israel. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to describe U.S. troop movements and locations. Here’s a look at the U.S. military presence in the Middle East: Troops Normally, about 34,000 U.S. forces are deployed to U.S. Central Command, which covers the entire Middle East. That troop level grew in the early months of the Israel-Hamas war to about 40,000 as additional ships and aircraft were sent in. Several weeks ago, the total spiked to nearly 50,000 when Austin ordered two aircraft carriers and their accompanying warships to stay in the region as tensions roiled between Israel and Lebanon. One carrier strike group has since left and moved into the Asia-Pacific. The beefed-up presence is designed both to help defend Israel and protect U.S. and allied personnel and assets. Navy warships are scattered across the region, from the eastern Mediterranean Sea to the Gulf of Oman, and both Air Force and Navy fighter jets are strategically based at several locations to be better prepared to respond to any attacks. Warships The U.S. is back to one aircraft carrier in the region. Austin has extended the deployment of carriers several times in the past year so that on a few occasions, there has been the rare presence of two at once. American military commanders have long argued that the presence of a formidable aircraft carrier — with its array of fighter jets and surveillance aircraft and sophisticated missiles — is a strong deterrent against Iran. The USS Abraham Lincoln and its three destroyers are in the Gulf of Oman, while two U.S. Navy destroyers are in the Red Sea. The USS Georgia guided missile submarine, which Austin ordered to the region last month, had been in the Red Sea and remains in U.S. Central Command, but officials declined to say where. There are six U.S. warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, including the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship with the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard. And three Navy destroyers are in that area. About a half dozen of the F/A-18 fighter jets from the USS Abraham Lincoln have been moved to a land base in the region. Officials declined to say where. Aircraft The Air Force sent in an additional squadron of advanced F-22 fighter jets last month, bringing the total number of land-based fighter squadrons in the Middle East to four. That force also includes a squadron of A-10 Thunderbolt II ground attack aircraft, F-15E Strike Eagles and F-16 fighter jets. The Air Force is not identifying what countries the planes are operating from. The addition of the F-22 fighter jets gives U.S. forces a hard-to-detect aircraft that has a sophisticated suite of sensors to suppress enemy air defenses and carry out electronic attacks. The F-22 also can act as a 'quarterback,' organizing other warplanes in an operation. But the U.S. also showed in February that it doesn’t have to have planes based in the Middle East to attack targets. In February, a pair of B-1 bombers took off from Dyess Air Force Base in Texas and flew more than 30 hours in a roundtrip mission in which they struck 85 Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force targets in Iraq and Syria in response to an attack by IRGC-backed militias that killed three U.S. service members.

Trump holds 10-point lead over Harris with New York Jews, poll fi...	The poll indicates that some Jewish voters could be fleeing the Democratic Party over frustrations stemming from Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war and surging antisemitism. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump holds a commanding lead over her Democratic opponent Kamala Harris among New York Jewish voters in the 2024 election, according to the latest Siena College poll. The poll found that Jewish New Yorkers prefer Trump, who previously served as the 45th US president, over Harris, the current vice president, by a margin of 54 percent to 44 percent when including third-party candidates. If the US presidential election were held today and it was just a two-person race, the figures would only change slightly, with Trump beating Harris among Jewish voters in the Empire State by a margin of 54 percent to 46 percent. Conducted from Sept. 11-16, the findings suggest that Trump has made significant inroads with the Jewish community. Additional polling data from Siena indicates that Jewish voters are rapidly warming up to Trump as Election Day in the US inches closer. Trump led Harris 50 percent to 49 percent among Jewish New York voters in August, according to Siena College. In June, Jewish voters preferred then-presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden over Trump 52 percent to 46 percent. Trump’s favorability among Jewish voters has also significantly increased in recent months, according to the polling data. In July, 44 percent of Jewish voters indicated a 'favorable' view of Trump and 52 percent indicated an 'unfavorable' view of the former president. That number has surged since then, with 52 percent of Jewish voters revealing a 'favorable' view of Trump and 48 percent revealing an 'unfavorable' view of the Republican nominee in the latest poll. The poll represents the latest indication that at least some Jewish voters could be fleeing the Democratic Party, potentially over frustrations stemming from the Biden administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war and surging antisemitism within traditionally-liberal institutions. The data also indicates that Harris possesses notably weaker support among New York Jews than Biden, potentially suggesting dissatisfaction over the vice president’s positions on Israel or a lack of trust that she will forcefully defend the Jewish state’s interests. Trump has made numerous overtures to the Jewish community in recent months, attempting to win over a significant share of the traditionally-liberal voting bloc. He has delivered speeches at various events catered toward the Jewish community, including the Republican Jewish Coalition. The former president also co-hosted an event focusing on antisemitism at his Trump National Golf Club Bedminster alongside prominent Jewish donor Miriam Adelson. The former president has touted his former administration’s support for Israel as a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign. During his single term in office, Trump recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a strategic region on Israel’s northern border previously controlled by Syria. He also moved the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, recognizing the city as the Jewish state’s capital. The Trump administration also helped to broker the Abraham Accords, which normalized Israel’s relations with four Arab countries in 2020. Evidence of Trump’s success in wooing Jewish voters has been replicated by other polls. A July survey conducted by pollster Richard Baris showed that Jewish voters nationally prefer Harris over Trump by a margin of 52.7 percent to 45.9 percent. However, a poll commissioned by the Jewish Democratic Council of America released earlier this month found that 72 percent of Jewish Americans plan on casting a ballot for Harris and 25 percent are poised to do the same for Trump.

Austin: US support for Israel ‘unwavering’ amid Iran threats	Gallant said that he discussed with Austin the 'strategic, regional picture,' and briefed the Pentagon chief 'on IDF operations in the southern and northern arenas, focusing on Israel’s defense against Hezbollah threats. By JNS U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke overnight Wednesday with his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant to review regional security developments. Austin 'reiterated unwavering U.S. support for Israel in the face of threats from Iran, Lebanese Hezbollah, and Iran’s other regional partners,' and 'emphasized the U.S. commitment to deterring regional adversaries and efforts to de-escalate tensions across the region,' according to a readout provided by Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder. The secretary also 'reaffirmed the priority of achieving a Gaza ceasefire deal that will bring home hostages held by Hamas, and an enduring diplomatic resolution to the conflict on the Israel-Lebanon border that will allow civilians on both sides to return to their homes.' Gallant said that he discussed with Austin the 'strategic, regional picture,' and briefed the Pentagon chief 'on IDF operations in the southern and northern arenas, focusing on Israel’s defense against Hezbollah threats. 'I expressed my appreciation to the Secretary for his unwavering commitment to Israel’s security and contribution to the U.S.-Israel alliance,' the minister said. During a telephone conversation on Monday, Gallant told Austin that time was running out for an agreed-upon de-escalation with Hezbollah. 'The possibility of a settlement in the north is passing. Hezbollah continues to tie itself to Hamas. The direction is clear,' said Gallant. On Thursday morning, eight people were wounded when two anti-tank missiles fired from Lebanon struck the Ramim Ridge area of Israel’s Upper Galilee. On Wednesday, in the second wave of such incidents, communications devices used by Hezbollah terrorists exploded across the group’s stronghold in Beirut and in Southern Lebanon. According to Lebanon’s Health Ministry, at least 20 Hezbollah operatives were killed and some 450 were wounded. On Tuesday, more than 2,700 Hezbollah members were wounded and at least 12 were killed across Lebanon when their pagers exploded, with the terrorist organization saying it held Israel 'fully responsible.' Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attacks.

Defense Minister Gallant says he is ‘unfamiliar’ with ‘one-shot’ ...	IDF official Nitzan Alon said Gal Hirsch, who presented the deal to US officials, 'was never a part of the negotiating team.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Maj.-Gen. (res.) Nitzan Alon, the IDF official overseeing the issue of captives said they were not familiar with the 'one-shot' deal that negotiator Gal Hirsch reportedly submitted to US officials. Although Hirsch has been described as a negotiator on behalf of the hostages, Alon said he was 'never a part of the negotiating team.' Alon told N12, 'The proposal that Gal Hirsch submitted to the US is not known to the negotiating team; Hirsch was never part of the negotiating team.' Gallant said he was also unfamiliar with the plan. KAN News reported earlier Thursday that Israeli officials had met with their US counterparts and had agreed to a framework that would see the release of all the hostages at once, an immediate cessation of hostilities in Gaza, and a safe exit for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and his deputies. The proposal also includes the release of dangerous Palestinian prisoners from Israeli custody, the demilitarization of Gaza, and the establishment of a new governance system for the region. However, the specifics of these components remain undisclosed. An Israeli official told KAN, 'Due to difficulties in negotiations and the ticking clock regarding the abductees' lives, we wish to propose a 'secondary plan' that would shorten the stages and allow for a faster agreement. This will happen if Sinwar leaves and ends the war. It will also help us achieve the goals of the war while enabling the Hamas leadership in Gaza to leave safely.' However, the new information that Alon and Gallant were unfamiliar with and not connected with the plan was met with disappointment and outrage from the Hostage and Missing Persons Families Forum, and they called out Gal Hirsch for falsely raising expectations that the plan was approved and going forward. 'Gal Hirsch has once again chosen to carry out a cynical, cheap, and disgraceful manipulation at the expense of the hostages, their families, and the people of Israel. This is a deception aimed at thwarting the new American initiative for the release of the hostages and ending the war in Gaza.' The Hostage and Missing Persons Families Forum also blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government for the lack of a deal and accused him of 'abandoning the hostages.'

Hezbollah leader admits Israel dealt ‘a heavy blow’ with beeper e...	Nasrallah: 'We undoubtedly suffered a major security and humanitarian blow, unprecedented in the conflict and maybe in the history of mankind.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Thursday, Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah admitted that the explosion of beepers that killed dozens and wounded thousands of terrorists was a 'major blow.' He said, 'We undoubtedly suffered a major security and humanitarian blow, unprecedented in the conflict and maybe in the history of mankind.' Nasrallah added, 'We were hit hard, but that's the situation in war. We understand that the enemy has technological supremacy. Especially since it is supported by the US and the West.' Israel has not taken responsibility for the pager explosions, and the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden Administration had no involvement in the attacks. He continued, 'When we are in conflict, we bet on Jihad, on attrition. We had many victories until now.' Nasrallah added that he is determined that Hezbollah 'won't be knocked down' by the the beeper explosions. 'We will be ready to overcome all of the threats and attempts in the future,' he said. The terror leader said that the pager explosions, 'crossed a red line' and was tantamount to a 'declaration of war.' 'Israel crossed all the red lines by detonating thousands of pagers. This could be called a declaration of war,' he said. Although the pagers were in the hands of terrorists, Nasrallah claimed that the explosions caused substantial civilian casualties, including women and children, claims which have not been substantiated. 'The devices exploded in unison in the hospitals as well. As a result of the aggression, dozens were killed, including women and children, and thousands were injured. The true numbers will come with time,' he said. 'This is an act of terror, massacre, genocide,' Nasrallah said. However, in his next sentence, Nasrallah admitted the pagers belonged to terrorists and not civilians and explained, 'More than 4,000 pagers were distributed to the organization's operatives.' Nasrallah threatened Israel that residents of the north would not be able to return to their homes and that Hezbollah would continue their attacks in the region. 'We tell Netanyahu, Gallant (the Defense Minister), and the Israeli military - you won't succeed in returning the residents of the north to the north, do what you want, you won't succeed.' Since October 8th, 2023, Hezbollah has fired missiles almost daily into the north, and 60,000 residents have been evacuated. Nasrallah said the only thing that will stop the terror group from attacking northern Israel is a ceasefire in Gaza. 'The only way is to stop the aggression and the war against the people of Gaza and the West Bank, without that there's nothing. Not an escalation, not eliminations, and not a full war,' he said.

Security expert reveals how Iran recruits Israeli agents	Maman knew that the discussions’ goal was to 'advance assassination attacks' on Israeli officials, the Shin Bet said. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Following the arrest on Thursday of 73-year-old Israeli Moti Maman from Ashkelon on charges of spying against Israel for Iran, security officials reveal how terror states like Iran recruit Israelis, sometimes unwittingly, sometimes with full awareness of the crime. Maman was detained in a joint operation between the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) and the Israel Police's Lahav 433 National Crime Unit. The businessman, who spent a significant amount of time in Turkey, became acquainted with Iranian agents who recruited him to carry out surveillance activities, such as photographing public places in Israel. Maman knew that the discussions’ goal was to 'advance assassination attacks' on Israeli officials, the Shin Bet said. Iranian officials also asked the Israeli if he could help recruit assassins to kill Iranian dissidents living in exile in the West. Maman demanded an advance payment of one million dollars before carrying out any missions on behalf of Iran. That request was denied, but the Iranians compensated Maman for participating in the meetings with 5,000 euros. Maariv spoke to Lior Ackerman, Head of National Resilience at the Institute for Policy and Strategy at Reichman University and Chairman of the New People's Council, about how Iran and terrorist organizations recruit Israelis. 'Iran's efforts at recruiting Israeli agents and instructing them to operate within Israel are not new. For years, Shin Bet has foiled numerous plots, thwarted incidents, and made arrests. Shin Bet succeeded on many occasions in stopping the incidents before they caused damage.' In many cases, the Israelis targeted are unaware of the motives of the people they meet online, and Iran often tries to contact vulnerable people through fake profiles on social media. 'The Iranians frequently operate through social media and use fake profiles. They have often recruited Israelis who were naive to gather information for them.' However, Maman's current case doesn't appear to be an example of Iran recruiting an unwitting agent through social media. 'This case is unusual because it involves locating a specific Israeli and recruiting him to assist in carrying out actual attacks within Israel in exchange for money. ' 'He was even taken to meetings in Iran. Clearly, this is not a case of an innocent citizen who didn't know what he was doing.'

‘We need to bring another blow’: Northern Israeli residents react...	Northern residents were forced to evacuate their homes when Hezbollah began launching rockets and drones in October. By Anna Epshtein, TPS In the lobby of the Jerusalem Royal Hotel, despair mixed with hope for evacuated residents of the northern community of Shlomi as they watched news reports of Hezbollah’s exploding communication devices on Wednesday. They hope that the 'pager attack,' as they referred to it, is the beginning of a new phase of war with Hezbollah they have been calling for so they can safely return to their homes, they told The Press Service of Israel. Thousands of Hezbollah operatives were injured when their pagers and walkie-talkies blew up on Tuesday and Wednesday. Hezbollah said 32 of its people were killed, a number that has not been independently verified. 'It was good to hear,' Inbar Ben Arush, a manicurist and a mother of two, tells TPS-IL. 'And don’t get me wrong, I am not happy about the war. I was a leftist before October 7, but my conceptions have changed. We don’t have a partner for peace there. We tried for almost a year to find some diplomatic solution. And we know too well that without a serious army operation in Lebanon, we won’t be able to get back home,' she adds while setting up a table for a manicure. Sitting nearby with her knitting, Mazal Hakim asks, 'How long can you live in a hotel? It’s good for three days, maybe a week. We have been here for almost a year. We broke here, became sick. Almost all of the grown-ups.' At another table, Braina Wasserman plays a card game with her teenage granddaughter. The game is called 'touch' and it’s not clear who is winning. Braina tells TPS-IL she has been playing this for hours with the kids from Shlomi because 'It helps the time pass.' As a boy aimlessly walks his bicycle back and forth near the table, Braina tells TPS-IL, 'It’s not nice to be happy about somebody’s death, but I was happy. For what they did to us, they do not deserve mercy.' Braina does not believe the 'pager attack' will get her home any time soon. 'I know I’ll be here for the holidays, and maybe for another year, too,' she says. Rosh HaShanah, the Jewish new year, begins on October 2 at sundown. Meir Navon, a retired naval officer, is on the phone trying to obtain a shofar, a ram’s horn traditionally blown during the High Holidays. Evacuees pray in an improvised synagogue in the lobby. 'After this attack, the enemy is on the floor, and we can’t let him stand up again. We need to bring another blow, and then another one, until he is destroyed,' Navon told TPS-IL. 'I was disappointed that after the attack Israel did not start a ground operation in Lebanon immediately. We are too merciful,' he adds. Meir’s friend, Mahluf Tubul nods in agreement. One of the founders of Shlomi in the 1950s, Tubul remarks, 'If Israel does not enter the war in the north, we will lose it.' On Monday, the Security Cabinet updated its official war goals to include the secure return of 60,000 evacuated northern residents to their homes. Northern residents were forced to evacuate their homes when Hezbollah began launching rockets and drones in October. Hezbollah leaders have said they will continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. The attacks have so far killed 26 civilians and 20 soldiers on the Israeli side. According to figures released by the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) Hezbollah fired 1,307 rockets at northern Israel in August, an average of 40 rockets daily. Since October 8, Hezbollah has launched more than 6,700 rockets and drones. Israeli officials have been calling for Hezbollah to be disarmed and removed from southern Lebanon in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War. Israel’s three other official war goals are the eradication of Hamas’s military and governing capabilities, the return of all hostages, and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Report: Israel proposes ‘one-shot’ deal to end Gaza war	In a statement, The Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged the Israeli government to publicly endorse the plan.

2 injured as Hezbollah drone hits moshav in northern Israel	Town in northwestern Israel struck by Hezbollah suicide drone, leaving two injured hours after Hezbollah missile attacks injured eight. By World Israel News Staff Two people were injured in a drone strike on northern Israel Thursday afternoon, hours a series of missile attacks left at least eight people injured. The drone attack was carried out by Hezbollah terrorists operating out of southern Lebanon, and struck Ya'ara, a moshav in the northwestern Galilee near the Lebanese frontier. A separate drone strike was reported near the northeastern Galilee town of Beit Hillel, sparking a blaze outside of the moshav. 'A short while ago, a UAV was identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory and falling adjacent to Beit Hillel,' an IDF spokesperson said Thursday afternoon. 'Israel Fire and Rescue Services are currently operating to extinguish a fire that erupted as a result of the fragments. No injuries were reported. No fragments were identified falling inside the area of the community.' 'Additionally, an explosive UAV was identified falling adjacent to the community of Ya'ara. No fragments were identified falling in the area of the community.' The drone strikes come just hours after a pair of missile attacks by Hezbollah terrorists on northern Israel left eight people injured. Two anti-tank missiles were fired from southern Lebanon Thursday morning, hitting the Ramim Ridge of the Upper Galilee. Of the eight victims injured in the attacks, two are listed in moderate-to-serious condition. The IDF responded to the missile attacks with artillery fire aimed at the launch site. The Israeli Air Force overnight Wednesday struck Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure in seven areas of Southern Lebanon, the military said on Thursday morning. Buildings used by the Iranian terrorist proxy were hit in the areas of Chihine, Taybeh, Blida, Meiss, El Jabal, Aitaroun and Kfarkela. In addition, a Hezbollah weapons storage facility was struck in the area of Khiam.

Norwegian striker for Rosenborg soccer club rebuffs nearly one million dollars offered by Maccabi Haifa, rejecting 'blood money' to play for Israeli team. By World Israel News Staff A Norwegian soccer player turned down an offer by an Israeli soccer club, citing the ongoing war between Israel and the Hamas terror organization, accusing the soccer team of offering him 'blood money.' Maccabi Haifa, based in northern Israel, had sought to sign 28-year-old Trondheim-native Ole Christian Hammerfjell Sæter, currently a player with the Rosenborg Ballklub soccer team. Hoping to secure Sæter on their roster prior to the end of the Israeli Premier League's transfer window, Maccabi Haifa offered 850,000 Euros ($950,000) to Rosenborg to sign the forward. On Wednesday, however, Sæter publicly ruled out the possibility of joining Maccabi Haifa - or any other Israeli team - saying that playing with an Israeli soccer club violated his 'values,' referencing the ongoing war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas and castigating the IDF's policies in the coastal enclave. 'I will not represent a country that perpetuates insecurity and evil with the killing of innocent people,' Sæter said. 'No amount of money can buy my values. I choose humanity over blood money. Even if I were offered billions, I wouldn’t move there.' 'I am confident in my values and happy to stand by what I believe is right. I don’t want such money in my account. There are people there who can’t live safely in their own homes. It’s quite insane. There’s no way I will represent a country that acts like that.' In 2023, Sæter, who is one quarter Pakistani by heritage, hinted that he might consider playing on Pakistan's national soccer team, uploading an image of himself wearing a Pakistani jersey to X.

Mossad established fake electronics company to plant bombs in Hez...	Hungarian electronics company which licensed out Taiwanese brand was reportedly established by Israeli operatives for the Mossad operation against Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff The company responsible for manufacturing the pagers involved in the wave of explosions targeting Hezbollah terrorists in Syria and Lebanon was established by Israeli operatives as part of the Mossad operation to target the Iranian-backed Lebanese terror group, The New York Times reported Wednesday. Thousands of Hezbollah members were wounded and at least 32 killed in a pair of bombing attacks Tuesday and Wednesday, in which thousands of pagers and hand-held radios simultaneously detonated across Lebanon and Syria, apparently the result of Israeli sabotage. Hezbollah had ordered the devices as part of its plan to evade Israeli tracking through modern cellular devices. It appears, however, that the pagers ordered by Hezbollah and distributed to its members were in fact supplied by a shell company which had been established by Israel's Mossad, according to the Times report. The pagers in question, AR-924 model devices bearing the Gold Apollo brand, were manufactured by an outside party which had licensed the Taiwan-based company's brand. On Wednesday, Gold Apollo founder and president Hsu Ching-Kuang told reporters that the Hungarian company BAC was responsible for the pagers' manufacture. 'The product was not ours. It was only that it had our brand on it,' Hsu said. 'We may not be a large company, but we are a responsible one,' the Gold Apollo president said, expressing surprise that the pagers could be rigged with explosives and detonated. 'This is very embarrassing.' Hsu added that BAC’s payments to Gold Apollo for use of its license were 'very strange,' saying the payments originated in the Middle East. According to the Times report, as Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah became increasingly concerned by Israel's ability to track the movement Hezbollah terrorists and sought alternative communications methods, Israeli security intelligence officers began making preparations for the operation which culminated in the attacks Tuesday and Wednesday. At least three separate shell companies were established for the purposes of the operation, three intelligence officials said, adding that BAC served a number of customers in order to establish and maintain its cover, manufacturing 'a range of ordinary pagers.' While the first pagers were delivered to Hezbollah in the summer of 2022, production was accelerated dramatically in February, which thousands of devices delivered this summer.

‘You dared to strike at Israel, now they’ve sent you back 1,000 y...	United Arab Emirates strategic analyst blasts Iranian-backed terror groups, mocks Hezbollah after it suffered two waves of bombing attacks. By World Israel News Staff A journalist and strategic analyst focusing on Middle Eastern affairs from the United Arab Emirates took aim at Iranian-backed anti-Israel terrorist groups Wednesday, castigating them for the attacks on Israel on October 7th, and mocking Hezbollah after a pair of apparent Israeli attacks left thousands of terrorists injured. Amjad Taha, author of The Deception of the Arab Spring, excoriated Hamas and Hezbollah in a tweet Wednesday night, while cheering a pair of attacks - widely attributed to Israel - targeting Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon and Syria. 'You dared to strike at a smart and courageous nation on October 7th—committing genocide, kidnapping their children, and violating their women,' Taha wrote. 'You thought they would fall, but they rose again, returning after 11 months to correct what had only momentarily slipped—their intelligence. Now, they will send you back 1,000 years, to a time without technology, where a ringtone feels like a death knell and a beep is a nightmare.' Taha praised Israel for accomplishing what he dubbed a 'victory' for 'all who stand against terror.' 'You will be haunted by your own shadow, too afraid to use any technology, cut off from the advanced world. And they will defeat you—not with bullets or tanks, but through the unbreakable will of brave, intelligent people.' 'Over a simple cup of coffee, with one decisive click, they will seal your fate, and the fate of anyone who dares harm their children. This is a nation the world respects. Lebanon—Hezbollah's pager attacks and today's V82 strike are not merely military victories; they represent a triumph for the Middle East over radicalism—a victory not only for Israel but for all who stand against terror.' In another tweet Wednesday, Taha castigated Hezbollah for its involvement during the Syrian civil war, celebrating Israel's targeted attacks on Hezbollah operatives - detonating pagers and hand-held radios on Tuesday and Wednesday. 'Once again, Israel's remarkable fireworks light up Lebanon, as Hezbollah members gather to bury their 'pagers 1' victims—only for 'Pager 2' to begin, burying the burriers.' 'Today, new communication systems, vehicles, and locations tied to Hezbollah—the same group responsible for slaughtering innocent babies, raping women, and committing genocide in Syria—are targeted.' 'This terrorist organization, which has displaced millions of Muslims, Arabs, Jews, and Christians from northern Israel by attacking hospitals and schools, is being systematically dismantled. Many admire Israel's effective methods in eliminating these savage terrorist animals in Lebanon.' A long-time critic of Hezbollah, in June, Taha compared the terrorist group to Nazi Germany. Hezbollah, Taha said, is 'not different than the Nazis.'

Israel proposes alternative hostage deal with Hamas	Details include all hostages to be released at once in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, Hamas leaders to be exiled, and a multinational force to oversee the ‘day after.’ By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel has sent the United States a new deal it is willing to conclude with Hamas that would free the hostages and end the war all in a single phase, Israel's Hebrew-language press reported Thursday. The main sticking points in the current proposal revolve around its three stages. Israel fears that Hamas would backtrack after releasing only the first group of hostages, and has refused the terrorist group's demand for the IDF to leave the Philadelphi Corridor, a critical security zone. In the new deal, all the hostages would be released at once and an as-yet unknown number of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails would be freed. In addition, safe passage to a third country will be guaranteed for Hamas head Yahya Sinwar, which he had recently insisted be part of a deal, and for all terrorists who want to leave Gaza, which could number in the thousands. The process of demilitarization, meaning the destruction of Hamas huge arsenal of weapons, would commence immediately upon their departure and the concomitant withdrawal of Israeli military forces from the Strip. A multinational force would oversee Gaza’s disarmament and, eventually, its reconstruction. The supervising countries were not identified by name. There are reportedly several options, such as a combination of American and Sunni Arab states. If the deal is not executed within the listed time frame, the proposal states that the IDF will be allowed to return and recommence the war. The government’s coordinator on the hostage issue, Gen. (res.) Gal Hirsch, has already presented the plan to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which reacted positively to the idea. 'We welcome [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu's new outline: a one-shot deal and the end of the fighting,' the Forum said in a statement. 'A one-shot deal that includes all 101 abductees is the wish of all Israeli citizens in general and the families of the abductees in particular&#8230;. The prime minister must lead with courage, determination and speed the proposal he formulated.' Several families of male civilian and soldier hostages, who were to be released only in the second stage of the current plan, had opposed it because they feared that Hamas would renege after the first stage and murder those who were still left in their hands. According to Kan News, hostage families are demanding that the prime minister give voice to his new proposal at the opening of the UN General Assembly next week, which he is scheduled to address on September 26.

Teamsters buck Kamala as Harris becomes first Democratic presiden...	The Teamsters, one of the country's largest unions, has historically supported Democratic candidates for president. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon Vice President Kamala Harris became the first Democratic presidential nominee not to receive the Teamsters endorsement in nearly 30 years, with the union declining to back a candidate after a strong majority of its rank-and-file members voted to endorse former president Donald Trump. The union made the announcement Wednesday, saying its 'extensive member polling showed no majority support for Vice President Harris and no universal support among the membership for President Trump.' Just one hour earlier, however, it released that polling, which found that 59.6 percent of Teamsters voted to endorse Trump, compared with 34 percent who backed Harris. The poll was conducted following the Republican and Democratic conventions. Its results were confirmed by a second poll that ran from Sept. 9 to Sept. 15, in which members again backed Trump over Harris, 58 percent to 31 percent. The Teamsters, one of the country's largest unions, has historically supported Democratic candidates for president. The lack of endorsement makes Harris the first Democratic presidential candidate not to receive the union's backing since 1996, when the union declined to endorse candidates Bill Clinton and Robert Dole. Before then, they last declined to endorse a Democrat in 1988. In a Wednesday afternoon press release, Teamsters president Sean O'Brien said the union's polling showed 'no majority support for Vice President Harris and no universal support among the membership for President Trump,' suggesting the union applied different standards to the two candidates. 'We strongly encourage all our members to vote in the upcoming election, and to remain engaged in the political process,' O'Brien said. 'But this year, no candidate for President has earned the endorsement of the Teamsters’ International Union.' When releasing the membership polling, O’Brien said the Teamsters’s 2024 endorsement would be 'the most inclusive, democratic, and transparent Presidential endorsement process in the history of our 121-year-old organization.' Before President Joe Biden’s exit from the campaign, polling data from April 9 to July 3 indicated that union members preferred Biden at 44.3 percent, while Trump garnered 36.3 percent.

Khamenei reaffirms Iran’s ban on competing against Israeli athlet...	Last year, Iran’s Weightlifting Federation imposed a lifetime ban on Iranian professional weightlifter Mostafa Rajaei for shaking hands with an Israeli athlete. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei restated the country’s long-established ban on competing against Israelis while on Tuesday addressing Iranian athletes who competed in the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic competitions in Paris. Khamenei also called on Iranian officials to compensate athletes who withdraw from matches to avoid facing an opponent from Israel, Iran International reported. He said Iranian athletes are making a 'sacrifice' by pulling out of competitions against Israelis because of their national and religious beliefs, and they need to be recognized and supported by Iranian officials, according to the Tehran Times. The Iranian leader further accused the governing body of the Olympics and Paralympics of displaying a 'double standard' by banning Russia from both international competitions, because of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, while allowing Israel to still compete despite the raging war between the Jewish state and the Hamas terrorist organization that orchestrated the Oct. 7 deadly terrorist attacks across southern Israel. The Iranian regime backs Hamas and has for years provided the terrorist organization with arms, funding, and training. Khamenei then accused Israel of killing 41,000 people in the Gaza Strip, a death toll announced by the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health that cannot be independently verified and does not distinguish between civilians and terrorists. Even the United Nations, a vocal critic of Israel’s war effort, has cited erroneous figures in the health ministry’s reported deaths. The Israeli military said last month that it had killed 17,000 terrorists in Gaza since the beginning of the war against Hamas on Oct. 7. 'Something else that was noticeable this year in the Olympic Games was the double standard of the countries that decide on issues concerning international sports. They truly demonstrated that duel, biased policies govern what they do,' Khamenei claimed during his speech on Tuesday. 'They ban a certain government or country from participating because it started a war somewhere. But with regard to the Zionist regime, which has killed thousands of children and over 41,000 people in less than a single year, they don’t ban it from the Games. This is a double standard. They are being biased.' 'They say sports shouldn’t be mixed with politics, yet they are the ones who exhibit and demonstrate the most politically biased behavior in sports,' he added. Iran’s policy against competing head-to-head with Israeli athletes goes back to 1979. Iranian athletes are often pressured by their coaches and Iranian sports federations to either pull out of matches or intentionally lose to avoid competing against an opponent from Israel. 'Our athlete refuses to compete or play against a Zionist opponent, and because of this, they pay a price. We must not neglect the well-being of this athlete,' Khamenei said on Tuesday. He then stressed that the Iranian government has an obligation to assist with the financial needs of these athletes. Ahead of the Olympic Games in Paris this summer, Israel’s foreign minister warned France of an Iranian-backed terrorist plot to attack Israeli athletes competing in the Olympics. Some athletes in Israel’s Olympic delegation also had their personal information hacked and published online, and Israel’s National Cyber Directorate concluded that Iranian hackers were responsible for the leak. Last year, Iran’s Weightlifting Federation imposed a lifetime ban on Iranian professional weightlifter Mostafa Rajaei for shaking hands with an Israeli athlete at the World Masters Championships in Poland. The head of Iran’s weightlifting federation described his actions as 'unacceptable and unforgivable.'

Belgian minister condemns Israeli attack on Hezbollah as ‘terrori...	Deputy Prime Minister of Belgium 'strongly condemns' Israeli pager attacks that wounded thousands of Hezbollah operatives and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps soldiers in Syria and Lebanon, calling the attacks terrorism. By World Israel News Staff A Belgian deputy prime minister castigated Israel's pager attacks on Hezbollah terrorists and soldiers in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps this week, denouncing the bombings as terrorism. On Wednesday, Petra De Sutter, one of Belgium's seven incumbent deputy prime ministers, a member of the far-left Groen (Green) Party and the first transgender government minister in Europe, called for an international investigation into the waves of bombing attacks against Hezbollah and the IRGC. 'I strongly condemn the massive terror attack in Lebanon and Syria, which injured thousands of people. A brutal escalation of violence.' 'Silence is not an option. An international investigation is called for. The bloodshed must end.' Later on Wednesday, the European Jewish Association took aim at De Sutter's comments, noting her failure to condemn Hezbollah attacks on Israeli civilians. 'Hezbollah and its operatives have been attacking Israel every day, firing hundreds of missiles and drones indiscriminately at civilians,' said EJA chairman Rabbi Menachem Margolin, according to a report by Israel National News. 'Calling the pager operation a terror attack is the world upside down.' 'The Deputy Prime Minister’s social media has failed to even mention the Hezbollah missile attack on 12 Israeli Druze children, murdered by a Hezbollah missile in July.' 'It has also failed to condemn Hezbollah’s constant missile and drone attacks on Israeli civilians.' 'Regrettably it is clear that Belgium’s Deputy Prime Minister has completely lost her moral compass.' At least 32 people were killed and over 4,000 more injured in Lebanon, with at least 19 killed and hundreds injured in Syria, after pagers and hand-held radio units used by Hezbollah operatives and their allies in the IRGC exploded in a pair of attacks Tuesday and Wednesday. Israel has yet to comment on the incidents, but is widely suspected of orchestrating the attacks on the pro-Iranian terror group.

Israel launches first autonomous bus pilot on public roads	The trial includes testing the bus in various road, visibility, and weather conditions and assessing its response to pedestrians, other vehicles, traffic circles and unforeseen road events. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel’s Ministry of Transportation gave its approval for the country’s first pilot autonomous bus to operate on a public road along a regular urban route. The ministry authorized Imagry, a Haifa-based autonomous driving software company to begin testing an autonomous bus on public roads in the northern city of Nahariya. 'Israel is at the forefront of global development in vehicle and transportation technologies,' said Transportation Minister Miri Regev. 'Our office has become an incubator for Israeli technology and hi-tech companies alongside companies from around the world, in the fields of smart transportation, which upgrade the travel experience, help reduce congestion on the roads and, above all, contribute significantly to road safety and the preservation of human life.' In partnership with public transportation operator Nativ Express, the electric bus will run an eight-km route beginning and ending at the Nahariya Mall and passing through the city’s busiest areas. The trial includes testing the bus in various road, visibility, and weather conditions and assessing its response to pedestrians, other vehicles, traffic circles and unforeseen road events. Additionally, the bus’s electric motor allows it to travel up to 200 kilometers on a single charge. The autonomous bus, which can accommodate up to 32 passengers, is equipped with an electric ramp to assist wheelchair users. 'The test of the first autonomous bus on a public road marks a historic breakthrough, which brings Israel to the global forefront of smart and safe transportation. The Israeli developments not only improve the travel experience, but form an infrastructure for reducing traffic congestion and increasing road safety,' said Dror Bin, CEO of Israel’s Innovation Authority. 'The next challenge is to turn the vision into a full reality, where the autonomous buses will function completely: from automatic payment collection to adapted solutions for the disabled. What was yesterday science fiction, today becomes a reality on Israel’s roads,' he added.

Bernie Sanders, AOC – Israel is breaking international law	The senator will introduce next week Joint Resolutions of Disapproval in Congress to block future arms sales to Israel. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt) and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, called Israel out Wednesday for allegedly breaking international humanitarian law as it wars against the terrorists attacking the country. The two leading anti-Israel legislators focused on two separate fronts. Sanders cited on the ongoing battle against the Hamas terrorists who began the war on October 7 by invading Israel, murdering 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage, with 101, both alive and dead, still held in captivity in the Gaza Strip. While saying in his Senate speech that Israel 'had an absolute right to respond to the Hamas attack,' he accused Jerusalem of 'bombing indiscriminately' and cited Hamas statistics that 'more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed.' Hamas does not differentiate between combatants and non-combatants’ deaths. The IDF says over a third of those dead are terrorists. Sanders ignored the fact that a two-to-one civilian to soldier death rate in war is an incredibly low number that is acceptable to every army. Calling Congress’ approval of $10 billion in military aid to Israel an act of 'U.S. complicity' in breaking international law as it helps Jerusalem 'buy more of the bombs and weapons they are using to wage war against the Palestinian people,' he announced that next week he would introduce Joint Resolutions of Disapproval to block $20 billion in additional sales that the Biden administration approved last month. If a foreign arms sale is deemed a violation of human rights provisions in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and Arms Export Control Act, these Resolutions are the only way Congress has to block them. The vote would have to pass both Houses and not be vetoed by the president, which is currently considered a highly unlikely scenario. Meanwhile, Ocasio-Cortez accused Israel of 'unequivocally' violating international law after thousands of beepers and walkie talkies owned by Hezbollah members exploded in Lebanon in two separate incidents Tuesday and Wednesday. 'Israel’s pager attack in Lebanon detonated thousands of handheld devices across of a slew of public spaces, seriously injuring and killing innocent civilians,' the progressive 'Squad' member wrote on X. 'This attack clearly and unequivocally violates international humanitarian law and undermines U.S. efforts to prevent a wider conflict.' Several thousand terrorists were injured, hundreds of them seriously, and at least two dozen were killed by the devices which were on their person. According to initial Lebanese reports, two young children are among the dead in the attacks for which Jerusalem has not admitted responsibility. Ocasio-Cortez demanded 'a full accounting of the attack, including an answer from the State Department as to whether any US assistance went into the development or deployment of this technology.' The U.S. immediately denied having any connection to the sophisticated, remote-controlled strike on the Iranian terror proxy.

Iran recruited Jewish Israeli for Netanyahu assassination plot	Iranian intelligence met with an Israeli businessman, who demanded $1 million to carry out various tasks for Tehran. By World Israel News Staff The Shin Bet foiled an Iranian plot to assassinate high-profile figures in Israel, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the intelligence agency announced in a media statement on Thursday. After Hamas politburo head Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran - an act which was widely attributed to Israel, but for which Jerusalem has not officially claimed responsibility - Iran sought to kill an Israeli leader in retaliation. Iranian intelligence also considered killing Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar, and former prime minister Naftali Bennett, the Shin Bet said. Iran recruited a Jewish-Israeli businessman living in Turkey as part of their plot, smuggling him twice into Iran to discuss carrying out missions for the Islamic regime in exchange for payment. The Israeli businessman, 73, had lived in Turkey for long periods of time. Tehran was said to have made contact with the man via Turkish businesspeople. The Israeli, who has not been publicly named, was arrested last month. A gag order on reporting about the pending criminal case against him was recently lifted. During his visits to Iran, which occurred in April and August 2024, the Israeli met with high-level Iranian intelligence officials. He was asked to engage in surveillance activities, such as photographing public places in Israel. The Israeli knew that the discussions' goal was to 'advance assassination attacks' on Israeli officials, the Shin Bet said. Iranian officials also asked the Israeli if he could help recruit assassins to kill Iranian dissidents living in exile in the West. The Israeli demanded an advance payment of one million dollars before carrying out any missions on behalf of Iran. That request was denied, but the Iranians provided 5,000 euros in compensation to the Israeli for participating in the meetings. Through his attorney, the businessman claimed that the major security incident was a misunderstanding. The man said that he was tricked into entering Iran, and that he had only done so to meet with an Iranian businessman regarding wholesale purchases of fruits, vegetables, and spices. He was surprised by the presence of Iranian intelligence officials, and their interest in obtaining his assistance in an assassination plot, he said.

Lebanon FM: ‘We’re afraid, we don’t want this war’	We are against war in Lebanon, we are in a scary moment,' says country's foreign minister. By World Israel News Staff Lebanon's foreign minister said that two days of consecutive attacks, which saw electronic devices belonging to Hezbollah members and operatives detonate, have rattled the country and left residents fearing an all-out war between the terror group and Israel. 'There's no doubt, this is a scary moment,' Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib told CNN in an interview on Wednesday evening. 'We are afraid of war, and we don't want any war.' The lawmaker said that he viewed the blasts, which injured around 3,000 people and killed at least 24, as unprecedented escalation. The Jewish State has not commented on the explosions, but responsibility for the blasts has widely been attributed to Israel. Bou Habib downplayed Hezbollah's near-daily bombardment of Israeli communities and military assets in northern Israel, referring to the terror group's attacks as cross-border 'skirmishes.' After the explosions, Bou Habib said, 'now we're talking about a war. This is an introduction to a war.' The politician called on the international community to prevent Israel from launching an all-out war against Hezbollah, which would likely result in great devastation throughout Lebanon. 'We are against war in Lebanon,' Bou Habib claimed. 'The government of Lebanon does not want war. So we need the help of the United Nations and the United States in order to reach some kind of peace in south Lebanon.' Bou Habib made no mention of the Lebanese government's enabling of Hezbollah, nor the UN's failure to enforce a resolution which dictates that Hezbollah cannot station fighters south of the Litani River. For months, the U.S. has been attempting to broker a diplomatic solution to the conflict which would see Hezbollah pledge to abide by that geographic boundary. The terror group has refused to budge, causing the Biden administration to pressure Israel to cede land to appease Hezbollah and end the fighting;.

Netanyahu: UK gov’t ‘undermining’ Israel, encouraging Hamas	Netanyahu blasts UK's arms embargo announced just days after hostages were executed, saying the move 'sends a horrible message to Hamas.' By World Israel News Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed the UK government on Wednesday, blasting a recent moves by the country's ruling left-wing party such as arms embargo and tacit support for an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant which may be issued against him and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. 'After the October 7 Hamas massacre, the previous British government was clear in its support. Unfortunately, the current government is sending mixed messages,' Netanyahu told UK outlet the Daily Mail. Netanyahu was particularly focused on the move to strip export licenses from UK-based weapons manufacturers providing arms to Israel. 'They say that Israel has the right to defend itself, but they undermine our ability to exercise that right both by reversing Britain’s position on the absurd allegations made by the ICC prosecutor against Israel and by blocking weapons sales to Israel as we fight against the genocidal terrorist organization that carried out the October 7 massacre.' He noted that news of the arms embargo became public just 'days after Hamas executed six Israeli hostages, sending a horrible message to Hamas.' The premier also mentioned the possibility of ICC warrants, which the UK's previous conservative government had staunchly opposed. 'The Labour ­Government decided to drop its challenge to the preposterous ICC arrest warrants that were requested by the ICC prosecutor against the prime minister and the defense minister of Israel,' Netanyahu said. 'If the arrest warrants are issued against the leaders of the only democracy in the Middle East, it will compromise the ability of all democracies in the world to fight terrorism, including Britain,' he warned. Netanyahu ended on an optimistic note, expressing confidence in an eventual Israeli victory over terror. 'Just as Britain’s heroic stand against the Nazis is seen today as having been vital in defeating barbarism, so too will history judge Israel’s stand against Hamas and Iran’s axis of terror. Israel will win this war and secure our common future,' Netanyahu said.

Number of Hezbollah terrorists killed or wounded by beepers likel...	The estimation is that there are many dozens of dead, if not more.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Although the official number indicates that a dozen Hezbollah terrorists have been killed over the last two days by exploding pagers, it is most likely higher than what has been reported. Ronen Bergman, who writes for the New York Times and Yediot Ahronoth, says the number of people killed by the beeper explosions is higher than the reported 12 yesterday and 14 today. 'The estimation is that there are many dozens of dead, if not more,' he said. In addition, the mission caused massive damage to Hezbollah's Radwan unit, which has lost much of its leadership. Israel has not commented on the deadly explosions, which are widely attributed to Israel. The offensive on Tuesday involved the spontaneous explosion of thousands of beepers used by Hezbollah terrorists, wounding thousands and killing over a dozen, according to reports. Additional injuries and deaths occurred on Wednesday in Lebanon and in Syria, where 19 IRGC terrorists were killed and 150 were injured. A former commander of British military forces in Afghanistan, Colonel Richard Kemp, praised the beeper offensive against Hezbollah as 'precise and discriminatory' and effective at weakening the morale and capacity of the Lebanese terror group. Israel’s outsmarting them with this terror attack has led to Hezbollah’s 'demoralization.' Kemp also praised the mission because it effectively targeted only terrorists and limited civilian casualties. 'It’s hard to think of a more precise and discriminating method of attack than detonating pagers known to be specifically assigned to individual terrorists, using devices that limit the potential for collateral damage.' He added that the exploding beepers were intended only for terrorists who are 'legitimate and lawful targets for attack as Israel seeks to defend its citizens from violent aggression,' he said. Kemp added that three distinctive characteristics of the mission made it particularly effective. First, the mission resulted in extensive damage to Hezbollah, second it engendered anxiety in Hezbollah members and may discourage others from joining and third, it has humiliated Hezbollah on the world stage.

Former commander calls beeper offensive against Hezbollah ‘precis...	Exploding beepers were intended only for terrorists who are 'legitimate and lawful targets for attack as Israel seeks to defend its citizens from violent aggression.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The former commander of British military forces in Afghanistan, Colonel Richard Kemp, praised the beeper offensive against Hezbollah as 'precise and discriminatory' and effective at weakening the morale and capacity of the Lebanese terror group. The offensive on Tuesday involved the spontaneous explosion of thousands of beepers used by Hezbollah terrorists, wounding thousands and killing over a dozen. Additional injuries and deaths occurred on Wednesday in Lebanon and in Syria, where 19 IRGC terrorists were killed and 150 were injured. Kemp told Israel National News that three salient factors make the beeper mission uniquely effective. 'First, it will have done immense damage to the terrorist organization, taking a large number of its fighters and leaders out in one go. Plus, of course, it severely undermines their communications capability,' Kemp said. He added, 'Second, it will have intimidated Hezbollah, potentially frightening some members into leaving the group or scaring off recruits from joining.' Kemp explained, 'The psychological impact will be enormous, with every Hezbollah terrorist now fearing that almost everything he owns or touches, including cars, guns, laptops, radios, and other electrical items, could potentially be weaponized against them.' He added the constant anxiety Hezbollah members may feel now is a 'far cry from the supposed glory of battlefield martyrdom they were promised.' In addition, Hezbollah may retreat from the notion of a full-scale offensive against Israel since now they realize their terror group operations and technology have been infiltrated. 'Third, it has humiliated Hezbollah, a terrorist organization that struts its power on the world stage, presenting itself as one of the strongest armies in the Middle East.' Israel's outsmarting them with this terror attack has led to Hezbollah's 'demoralization.' Kemp also praised the mission because it effectively targeted only terrorists and limited civilian casualties. 'It’s hard to think of a more precise and discriminating method of attack than detonating pagers known to be specifically assigned to individual terrorists, using devices that limit the potential for collateral damage.'

UN bans Israel’s right to self-defense, calls for removal of Jews...	Only 14 countries, including the United States, joined Israel in opposing the resolution. By Mike Wagenheim, JNS Jerusalem’s Old City and Jude and Samaria must be judenrein within a year, according to a Palestinian-drafted resolution, which the U.N. General Assembly passed on Wednesday. The resolution, which passed by a 124-14 margin with 43 abstentions, is meant to give force to a July advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice, which declared Israeli presence to be illegal in any area over the 1949 armistice line. More than 40 countries sponsored the resolution, which was the first that Palestinians filed after being granted unprecedented privileges, for a non-U.N. member, earlier this year. The resolution calls on the Israel Defense Forces to withdraw completely from Judea and Samaria, eastern Jerusalem and Gaza within 12 months, which means evacuating all Jewish communities beyond the armistice line, including Jerusalem’s Old City. It also bans arms sales to the IDF of any equipment that would be expected reasonably to be used in the territory over the 1949 lines and calls for a boycott of all products produced by Jews in those areas. The resolution text lacks any mention of Israeli security concerns, historic ties to the lands or Hamas’s terror attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. The vote came after a day of debate on Tuesday. Argentina, Czechia, Fiji, Hungary, Malawi, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Tonga, Tuvalu and the United States joined Israel in opposing the resolution. Notably, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, Ukraine and Australia were among those who abstained. General Assembly resolutions have no legal force, but the resolution’s passage on Wednesday is expected to be used in international courts and other fora to seek additional action against the Jewish state. It is widely expected that the Palestinians will request that the U.N. Security Council take up the issue. Security Council resolutions are binding, but the United States would be expected to thwart such an effort, including with its veto power. ‘Further fuel on worldwide antisemitism’ Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, called it 'a shameful decision that backs the Palestinian Authority’s diplomatic terrorism.' He added that the General Assembly 'continues to dance to the music of the Palestinian Authority, which backs the Hamas murderers.' Before the vote, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres told reporters he would back the implementation of the resolution should it pass. Seth Riklin and Daniel Mariaschin, president and CEO respectively of B’nai B’rith International, said that the international nonprofit is 'appalled' by the 'atrocious' resolution. 'B’nai B’rith International strongly condemns the U.N. General Assembly’s passage of the first resolution officially sponsored by Palestinians days after they became the first non-member state group further upgraded to many member state privileges at the U.N. General Assembly, despite the world body’s own rules and practices,' the duo stated. 'Coming from an assembly in which Arab and other pro-Palestinian governments wield an automatic majority to annually condemn Israel more than all other countries combined, the motion is unprecedented in its shamelessly one-sided endorsement of Palestinian claims and political demands, and further erodes the U.N.’s credibility as a serious contributor to promoting conflict-resolution and universal human rights,' they added. 'Shame on all countries that enabled this atrocious affront to justice and peace as part of the latest UNGA ’emergency session’ on the Middle East that does nothing to help seriously address and settle the emergency,' Riklin and Mariaschin said. Arsen Ostrovsky and Nadav Steinman, CEO and board chair respectively of the International Legal Forum, stated that 'today, simply put, the United Nations has become the diplomatic arm of Hamas' and that the resolution 'is just the latest in a litany of obscenely one-sided anti-Israel resolutions at the U.N. since Oct. 7.' 'All it does is reward the murderers, rapists and abductors of Hamas while pouring further fuel on worldwide antisemitism and eroding whatever remaining credibility of the already problematic and politicized International Court of Justice, upon which this resolution is meant to be based,' they added. 'Ultimately, peace will only prevail when Hamas is defeated and the hostages are released, not through tiresome antics and pyrrhic Palestinian ‘victories’ at the U.N.'

Finland’s president defends decisions to buy Israeli arms, not re...	President Alexander Stubb, who took office in March, has defined his and Finland’s new foreign policy stance as 'values-based realism.' By Reuters and The Algemeiner Finland’s President Alexander Stubb defended his country’s decision to buy arms from Israel despite the war in Gaza, saying it had no link to Finland’s unwillingness to recognize an independent Palestinian state at the present time. Finland is acquiring a ground based, high altitude, missile defense system called David’s Sling from Israel. Helsinki considers the system a high priority for its own defense due to neighboring Russia’s ongoing missile attacks on civilian and military targets in Ukraine. Stubb, who took office in March, has defined his and Finland’s new foreign policy stance as 'values-based realism,' which he has said was about 'achieving things in the world as it is,' instead of 'promoting only the world how I want to see it.' In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, Stubb said the time was not right to recognize a Palestinian state, even though its Nordic neighbors, Sweden, Iceland, and most recently Norway, have done so. 'In the case of Israel and Palestine, values-based realism is prevalent in our thinking on the recognition of Palestine in the sense that we want that recognition, not if, but when it happens, to have an impact towards a two-state solution and a peaceful solution,' he said. Last month, Stubb told Finnish diplomats that Finland’s recognition of a Palestinian state was 'a matter of time' and that the right time would be picked strategically to promote peace in the Middle East. He said the decision had 'nothing to do with' the arms deal with Israel. 'In that one, I only look at realism, in other words, the fact that we need those weapons. So that’s when I look at Finnish security.'

More Hezbollah comms devices explode across Lebanon, killing 14	At least one of the blasts took place in the vicinity of a funeral for terrorists killed on Tuesday. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS More communications devices used by Hezbollah terrorists exploded on Wednesday afternoon across the group’s main stronghold in Beirut and in Southern Lebanon, Reuters reported, citing a security source. According to Lebanon’s Health Ministry, at least fourteen Hezbollah operatives were killed in the latest series of device explosions. In addition, some 400 terrorists were said to have sustained wounds. At least one of the blasts took place in the vicinity of a funeral for terrorists killed on Tuesday, when thousands of Hezbollah pagers detonated all over the country, according to eyewitness reports. The Hezbollah devices that exploded late Wednesday afternoon are hand-held walkie-talkies, a Lebanese security source told Reuters. Axios cited sources familiar with the matter as saying that the radios, which were booby-trapped in advance by Israeli intelligence, were part of the terror group’s emergency communications systems that were supposed to be used during a conflict with the Israel Defense Forces. תיעוד | פיצוץ מכשיר בביירות בזמן הלווית אחד ממחבלי חזבאללה שחוסלו אתמול@Doron_Kadosh pic.twitter.com/rT6dlmutpb &mdash; גלצ (@GLZRadio) September 18, 2024 On Tuesday, more than 2,700 Hezbollah operatives were wounded and at least 12 were killed across Lebanon when their pagers exploded, with the terrorist organization saying it held Israel 'fully responsible.' Speaking at a Wednesday funeral for several of the terrorists killed the day prior, Hezbollah executive council head Hashem Safieddine vowed a 'bloodily unique revenge' against the Jewish state, local reports said. 'Tomorrow, the leader of Hezbollah will speak and all will be revealed,' Safieddine said. 'We will be in a new situation and a new confrontation with this enemy.' The Israel Defense Forces declined to comment on Tuesday’s incident, which came just hours after the Israeli Cabinet added the return of citizens displaced from their homes in the north to the country’s war goals, bringing a potential major clash with Hezbollah closer to reality. Iran-backed Hezbollah has attacked Israel nearly daily since Oct. 8, firing thousands of rockets, missiles and drones. The attacks have so far killed more than 40 people and caused widespread damage. Tens of thousands of civilians remain internally displaced due to the violence. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein this week that displaced Israelis will not be able to return home without strong military or diplomatic action against Hezbollah. Netanyahu 'made it very clear that it will not be possible to return our residents without a fundamental change in the security situation in the north,' Netanyahu’s office stated after a Monday meeting in Tel Aviv. Jerusalem will 'ultimately do what is necessary to safeguard its security and return the residents of the north securely to their homes,' he vowed.

Holocaust mass grave found in Belarusian town	Estimates suggest that between 3,000 and 4,000 Jews from Stresyn and neighboring towns fell victim to the Holocaust. By Jewish Breaking News A small Belarusian town now stands as a sobering testament to the Holocaust’s devastation after the discovery this week of a mass grave holding Jewish victims. Once home to a thriving Jewish community, Stresyn and its surrounding Gomel region bore witness to the Holocaust’s devastation. In 1939, Jews comprised nearly 30% of the area’s population, with around 40,000 residents. While many managed to flee before the Nazi occupation in 1941, those who remained faced confinement in three ghettos with staggeringly high mortality rates. Estimates suggest that between 3,000 and 4,000 Jews from Stresyn and neighboring towns fell victim to the Holocaust. Among the 23 bodies found on Tuesday were those of 12 adults and 11 children, the youngest barely a year old and the oldest child just seven. While the remains showed no obvious signs of execution, the discovery of keys and a corroded rifle bullet within the burial site hints at the horror experienced by Stresyn’s Jewish community during the Final Solution. Local authorities suggest that these individuals likely succumbed to the inhumane conditions within the ghetto, where Jewish residents were forcibly relocated after having their property looted by the invading Nazis. According to state news agency Balta, a local resident uncovered the remains during routine agricultural work nearly 15 years ago. Despite widespread community knowledge about the ghetto’s Jewish victims, the grave’s existence curiously remained unreported until now.

John Fetterman slams ‘anti-Israel’ UN experts for censuring Weste...	The most outspoken of the UN experts on Monday was Francesca Albanese, the UN’s notoriously controversial special rapporteur on the human rights situation in the Palestinian territories. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner US Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) lambasted 'anti-Israel' UN human rights experts for censuring Western countries on Monday over their continued support for Israel despite what they described as a genocide in Gaza. 'These so-called ‘experts’ have consistently revealed their anti-Israel bias and a censure from one of them is a badge of honor,' Fetterman posted on X/Twitter. 'No apologies and zero conditions for any essential support for Israel.' Fetterman also posted a picture from a news story reporting on the warnings from the UN experts. These so-called ‘experts’ have consistently revealed their anti-Israel bias and a censure from one of them is a badge of honor. No apologies and zero conditions for any essential support for Israel. pic.twitter.com/YMZUOYmw1J &mdash; Senator John Fetterman (@SenFettermanPA) September 16, 2024 The most outspoken of the UN experts on Monday was Francesca Albanese, the UN’s notoriously controversial special rapporteur on the human rights situation in the Palestinian territories. 'Shockingly, in the face of the abyss reached in the OPT [Occupied Palestinian Territories] … most member states remained inactive at best, or actively aiding and assisting Israel’s criminal conduct,' Albanese told a press conference in Geneva. 'I think it’s unavoidable for Israel to become a pariah in the face of its continuous, relentless, vilifying assault of the United Nations, on top of millions of Palestinians.' Israel has denied such allegations, noting the extensive lengths to which its military has gone to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza, where Hamas often places its military targets within or underneath civilian targets such as schools and hospitals. Though Fetterman campaigned as a progressive, he has surprisingly emerged as a staunch ally of Israel in the months following Hamas’s Oct. 7 terrorist attacks. Fetterman has repeatedly condemned anti-Israel voices within his own party in the US Congress, as well as elite universities for tolerating what he has characterized as antisemitic and anti-Israel hate speech on their campuses. Fetterman’s criticism came as Brown University in Rhode Island received backlash over its decision to host Albanese for a discussion on the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The Ivy League university hosted Albanese, an Italian lawyer, for a talk on Monday titled 'Anatomy of a Genocide: A Failure of the International System?' The roughly hour-and-a-half discussion centered on the international community’s response to Israel’s ongoing defensive military operations in Hamas-ruled Gaza. Toward the beginning of the discussion, Albanese decried Israel’s military campaign as the 'monstrosity of this century.' 'To justify the protection of their security, Israel continues to take land from the Palestinians, subjugate the Palestinians, and impose conditions of life that result in humiliation and indignities,' Albanese said during the livestream. Though Albanese insisted that she has repeatedly condemned Hamas’s Oct. 7 slaughter of roughly 1,200 people and kidnapping of 251 others in southern Israel, she said she believes the Jewish state’s response has been disproportionate. As Albanese has done many times before, she accused Israel of targeting schools, hospitals, designated safe zones, and using starvation as a weapon against the population. Israel has denied such accusations, noting its efforts to evacuate areas before it targets them and to warn residents of impending military operations with leaflets, text messages, and other forms of communication. However, Hamas has in many cases prevented people from leaving, according to the Israeli military. Another challenge for Israel is Hamas’s widely recognized military strategy of embedding its terrorists within Gaza’s civilian population and commandeering civilian facilities like hospitals, schools, and mosques to run operations and direct attacks. Nonetheless, Albanese condemned Israel’s allies, saying they 'should have changed course of action,' citing concerns over the humanitarian conditions in Gaza. 'Instead they have continued to give Israel financial, economic, and political support and courage, and this is the failure of the system,' Albanese said. She expressed gratitude toward students and university faculty members who have participated in anti-Israel demonstrations against Israel’s so-called 'genocidal' war in Gaza. Albanese’s participation in an official Brown University event drew widespread backlash from members of the school’s academic community. Over 2,400 members of the Brown community signed a letter urging the school to disinvite the controversial UN expert. Albanese has been widely criticized for exhibiting an apparent bias against Israel. Albanese has an extensive history of using her role at the UN to denigrate Israel and seemingly rationalize Hamas’s attacks on the Jewish state. In the months following Hamas’s brutal Oct. 7 assault on the Jewish state, Albanese has accused Israel of enacting a 'genocide'against the Palestinian people in revenge for the Oct. 7 attacks. The United Nations has recently launched a probe against Albanese over allegedly accepting a trip to Australia funded by pro-Hamas organizations. She has called on the UN to expel Israel, comparing the Jewish state to apartheid-era South Africa.

19 Iranian soldiers killed, 150 injured in pager bombings, Israel...	Israel's pager bombing attack on Hezbollah also impacted Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces in Syria, killing 19 and wounding 150. By World Israel News Staff At least 19 soldiers in Iran's paramilitary Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were killed and roughly 150 more were injured in pager explosions in eastern Syria, according to Arabic media reports Wednesday. On Tuesday, thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah operatives across Lebanon detonated simultaneously in a mass attack attributed to Israel. Eleven people were killed and roughly 4,000 injured in the explosions in Lebanon. According to a report by the Saudi-based Al Hadath outlet on Wednesday, however, the pager bombings also killed 19 members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps stationed in the Deir Ez-Zur province of eastern Syria. In addition, some 150 other Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps members were injured, Al Hadath reported. Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was among those injured in the attack, reportedly being completely blinded in one eye and partially blinded in the other. While Iran initially downplayed the severity of his injuries, The New York Times reported that not only was Amani blinded, but that he lost one eye in the attack, while the other was seriously damaged, leaving him with extremely limited vision. Hossein Soleimani, who heads the IRGC’s news website Mashregh, confirmed on X that Amani had been seriously wounded, several hours after the blasts. 'Unfortunately the injuries sustained by Iran’s ambassador were extremely severe and in his eyes,' Soleimani wrote, acknowledging the severity of Amani's injuries. Some 500 Hezbollah operatives were also blinded, either partially or entirely, as a result of the pager explosions, Al Hadath reported. Media reports after Tuesday’s attack implicated Israel’s Mossad, amid claims its agents implanted miniature explosive devices inside a shipment of thousands of pagers bound for Lebanon’s Hezbollah five months ago. Israel is widely believed to be behind the operation but remains silent and has not acknowledged responsibility.

Dozens of Israeli ministers and Coalition MKs demand Israeli take...	The 27 coalition members urged the prime minister to adopt the 'Generals’ Plan' of a group of generals designed to put real pressure on Hamas. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Dozens of MKs and ministers from the coalition wrote a letter Wednesday urging the prime minister to back a plan written by a group of generals that calls for a full Israeli takeover of northern Gaza in order to put real pressure on Hamas and win the war. The 27 ministers and Coalition members have asked Benjamin Netanyahu to convene the security cabinet and adopt the 'Generals’ Plan' that had been presented to the public by the Commanders and Reserve Soldiers Forum a few weeks ago. 'The recent cabinet decision regarding the permanent presence of our soldiers in the Philadelphi Corridor requires, in our opinion, a strategic complement with another action,' they wrote. The Generals’ Plan was written by respected reserve IDF commanders, including Generals Giora Eiland (former national security adviser and ex-head of IDF Operations), Gershon Hacohen (former commander of the IDF military colleges) and Avi Mizrachi (ex-head of Central Command). The proposal says that the approximately 300,000 Palestinian residents in the northern section of the Strip, including Gaza City and its environs, should be given a week’s warning to evacuate along two humanitarian corridors secured by the IDF. This is about 40% of the coastal enclave, and has been surrounded by the IDF for many months already. It would be declared a closed military zone, Eiland said in an explanatory video released earlier this month, and 'nothing would be allowed in.' The result would be that 'The 5,000 Hamas fighters in this area can then either decide to surrender or die of starvation.' If they decide to fight instead, the IDF would be able to deal with them. Losing the whole north, Eiland noted, 'will create real pressure' on Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, 'who will understand that what happened [there] can happen later, whether in Rafah or other places' in Gaza. Another part of the plan is for the army to take over all food and aid distribution to the civilian population instead of the current situation in which Hamas confiscates it all by force, both for its own use and to enrich itself to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars by selling what had been donated for free in order to keep Gazans from supposed starvation. As the MKs’ letter stated, Hamas’ control of the humanitarian aid 'gives it full control over the population [and] over the recruitment of fighters, in addition to strengthening its fighting forces and bringing in enormous economic profit.' In recapping the main points of the plan, those who signed the letter stated that they believe, as these generals do, that these are the steps that will enable the government to finally achieve its stated war goals of rescuing the hostages, destroying Hamas’ ability to govern, and ensuring that Gaza will not threaten Israel in the future.

Rosh Hashanah bombing targeted former Israeli defense minister	Iranian-backed terror group Hezbollah attempted to assassinate former Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon in failed Rosh Hashanah bombing attack in Tel Aviv. By World Israel News Staff A terrorist cell operated by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah organization in Lebanon attempted to assassinate a former Israeli Defense Minister and ex-IDF chief of staff in a bombing attack during the Rosh Hashanah holiday last year, Israeli police revealed on Wednesday. The plot targeted Moshe Ya'alon, chief of the IDF General Staff from 2002 to 2005, who later entered politics on the Likud ticket, serving as Defense Minister before bolting the party and joining Benny Gantz's Blue and White. According to police, Hezbollah terrorists operating out of Lebanon directed a nine-member terrorist cell inside of Israel, made up of eight Arab-Israelis and controlled by a single Lebanese handler. The nine cell members were originally enlisted by their Hezbollah handler for weapons smuggling last summer. According to the investigation, conducted by Israel Police and the Shin Bet internal security agency, the cell members were initially told they would be smuggling drugs into Israel from Lebanon. Communicating with their Hezbollah handler via the Whatsapp social media platform, two cell members collected nine packages from a designated collection point along the border barrier. Later, however, the two cell members found that the packages contained weapons, rather than drugs. The weapons included rifles, pistols, and anti-personnel mines. On August 31st, Hezbollah instructed the cell to purchase remote-control cameras, with one cell member ordered to leave his vehicle parked at Tel Aviv's Hayarkon Park. On September 1st, a member of the cell assembled a makeshift bomb using the anti-personnel mine and the remote-control cameras, with the goal of enabling the cell to watch a live feed of the bomb, waiting for the target to approach before remotely detonating it. Eleven days later, three days before the planned bombing, the device was retrieved from a hiding place and brought to Tel Aviv. On September 15th, the bomb detonated prematurely at 6:30 a.m., forcing one of the cell members to flee to the Beit Hanina neighborhood in Jerusalem with the aid of a second cell member. Both cell members were arrested en route to Jerusalem later that day, with six others arrested during the subsequent investigation. According to the Shin Bet and Israel Police and based on interrogations of the suspects, the cell members had planned to kill Ya'alon during his daily jog through Hayarkon Park on the eve of the Rosh Hashanah holiday. All eight of the arrested suspects have been indicted on terror charges, while the ninth member of the has been charge in absentia.

Taiwanese electronics company denies it manufactured pagers used ...	Gold Apollo claims it was not responsible for manufacturing the pagers which were apparently modified by Israeli agents and used to bomb thousands of Hezbollah terrorists. By World Israel News Staff A Taiwanese electronics company denied Wednesday that it was involved in the manufacturing of pagers used by Hezbollah terrorists and detonated in a mass attack on Tuesday, injuring thousands of operatives in the Iranian-backed group. Media reports after Tuesday's attack implicated Israel's Mossad, amid claims its agents implanted miniature explosive devices inside a shipment of thousands of pagers bound for Lebanon's Hezbollah five months ago. According to an analysis by Reuters of images of pagers destroyed in Tuesday's attack, the devices were manufactured by Taiwan's Gold Apollo. However, on Wednesday, Gold Apollo founder and president Hsu Ching-Kuang told reporters outside of the company's headquarters in New Taipei that his company was not involved in manufacturing the devices. 'The product was not ours. It was only that it had our brand on it,' Hsu said. 'We may not be a large company, but we are a responsible one,' the Gold Apollo president said, expressing surprise that the pagers could be rigged with explosives and detonated. 'This is very embarrassing.' In a statement issued by Gold Apollo, the company claimed that the AR-924 model pager was manufactured by Budapest-based company BAC Consulting, and that Gold Apollo had licensed its brand to BAC Consulting. Gold Apollo had granted permission to 'BAC to use our brand trademark for product sales in specific regions, but the design and manufacturing of the products are entirely handled by BAC,' the company said. Reuters reported Wednesday that it was unable to contact BAC after Tuesday's bombing. Hsu said BAC's payments to Gold Apollo for use of its license were 'very strange,' saying the payments originated in the Middle East.

Invasion soon? IDF moves thousands of troops to northern border	Elite IDF division transferred to Lebanon border, amidst threat of all-out war between Israel and the Hezbollah terror group. By World Israel News Staff Amid sky-high tensions between Israel and the Hezbollah terror group, the Israeli army announced on Wednesday that it is deploying tens of thousands of troops to the northern border. The move comes one day after an alleged Mossad and IDF intelligence operation saw the simultaneous detonation of thousands of beepers belonging to Hezbollah members in Lebanon and Syria, killing at least nine and wounding some 3,000. The IDF said that it was transferring the elite 98th Division, numbering some 10,000 to 20,000 troops, to the border with Lebanon. The units within the 98th Division include paratroopers, artillery units, and commandos. Previously, the 98th Division was stationed in Khan Younes in central Gaza, but withdrew from the area in August. The 98th Division will join the 36th Division and numerous reserve units, which have been stationed along the northern border for months. In recent days, Israeli officials have signaled that the IDF is gearing up for an intensive military offensive against Hezbollah. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant both hinted to the Biden administration's envoy to the Middle East, Amos Hochstein, that time had run out for a diplomatic solution to end the fighting with Hezbollah. For more than 11 months, Hezbollah has bombarded communities and military assets in northern Israel with near-daily barrages of missiles, rockets, and explosive drones. At least 60,000 Israelis were displaced from their homes due to the ongoing aerial assaults. Tens of thousands more, who were not evacuated from their homes, live under constant threat of Hezbollah aggression. On Monday, the security cabinet officially declared the return of displaced northern to their home as a goal for the ongoing war. Former IAF commander Ori Gordin said that Israel will need to create a buffer zone in southern Lebanon, in order to protect residents of northern Israel and to prevent the Hezbollah terror group from operating in the region.

Republican senators lobby Latin America to vote against UN resolu...	As UN General Assembly debates Palestinian Authority draft resolution ordering Israel to ethnically cleanse Judea and Samaria of Jews within one year, Republican senators lobby Western hemisphere powers to reject the proposal. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The United Nations General Assembly held hearings Tuesday on a draft resolution submitted by Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian Authority's envoy to the U.N., demanding Israel vacate Judea and Samaria within one year, and calling on countries around the world to impose arms embargoes on the Jewish state. The General Assembly is slated to vote on the draft resolution Wednesday, after the body debated the measure a day earlier. If passed, the current version of the non-binding resolution would demand Israel remove not only its military presence in Judea and Samaria but also ethnically cleanse the area of its roughly half a million Jewish residents. Republican senators protested the proposed resolution Tuesday, issuing a joint statement penned by Florida's Marco Rubio, calling the measure a 'absolute disgrace that rewards terrorism.' 'This proposal introduced by the Palestinian delegation, ahead of the United Nations’ General Assembly, is an absolute disgrace that rewards terrorism. It is a clear insult to the Jewish people and anyone who understands history,' the letter reads. 'As we approach the one-year anniversary of the barbaric terrorist attack by Hamas and affiliated Palestinian terrorist groups against innocent Israeli civilians, which involved murder, mutilation, and sexual violence, the international community must unequivocally unite against this evil, one-sided effort to delegitimize Israel.' 'Instead of proposing biased and counter-productive initiatives, which will do nothing to advance a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, the international community must focus its energy and resources on ensuring Hamas and other terrorist groups are completely destroyed. We must remain firm to ensure every single hostage held by these terrorists is safely returned to their loved ones.' The letter was signed by Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Rick Scott (R-FL), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY),Tim Scott (R-SC), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Jim Risch (R-ID), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), John Kennedy (R-LA), John Hoeven (R-ND), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Ted Budd (R-NC), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Pete Ricketts (R-NE), J.D. Vance (R-OH), John Barrasso (R-WY), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Josh Hawley (R-MO), James Lankford (R-OK), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Mike Braun (R-IN), John Thune (R-SD), Roger Wicker (R-MS), John Cornyn (R-TX), and Katie Boyd Britt (R-AL). In addition to the letter condemning the draft resolution, Senator Rubio penned letters to two Latin American leaders - Argentinian President Javier Milei and Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader - urging them to vote against the measure in the General Assembly. 'The resolution…calls on countries to not legally recognize Israel’s presence in the Palestinian areas, enforce sanctions on Israeli officials, cease the transfer of arms to Israel that could be used in the Palestinian areas and to avoid establishing diplomatic missions in Jerusalem,' Rubio wrote. 'These are severe demands that aim to destroy the independence of the Middle East’s only democracy. All democracies should oppose these adverse ambitions.'

Gazans beginning to regret October 7th invasion – poll	Only 39% still back the decision to attack Israel on October 7, while PA Arabs sharply differ, with 64% standing behind it. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A Palestinian poll published Tuesday shows that for the first time in nearly a year of fighting, only a minority of Gazans still support Hamas’ October 7th invasion of Israel. The Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR) survey showed that only 39% still backed the invasion, a massive drop of 18 percentage points from the last survey three months ago. Among Palestinian Authority (PA) Arabs, the decision to attack still enjoys 64% support, although this number reflects a drop of 13 points since the last poll, conducted in June. Taken together, a slight majority of 53% still say that Hamas was correct to invade. The PCPSR noted that this support 'does not necessarily mean support for Hamas and does not mean support for any killings or atrocities committed against civilians,' citing the statistic that almost 90% of the public does not believe that Hamas forces committed 'the atrocities depicted in videos taken on that day.' Instead, Palestinians back the attack because they believe that it 'put the Palestinian issue at the center of attention and eliminated years of neglect at the regional and international levels,' the Center said. This does not necessarily translate to an expectation that Hamas will win the war against Israel, although again there is a sharp dichotomy between the Gazans who are experiencing it, and PA Arabs who are not. While in June the conviction that Hamas would ultimately be victorious was split almost evenly among Gazans, with 48% believing this was true, the latest poll shows a hard drop to 28%. PA Arabs are much more optimistic, with 65% saying Hamas would win, although this does reflect a drop of 14 points from the last poll. The contrast continued with the question of who will control Gaza after the war, with 37% of Strip residents (down from 46%) and fully 70% of PA Arabs saying Hamas will continue to rule the coastal enclave. When asked whom they prefer to govern them, similar numbers said Hamas, while overall 20% chose the PA, 12% preferred international forces, and four percent said the IDF. The survey also asked respondents to grade their satisfaction with how regional actors are supporting them. Yemen came first by a large margin with 69%, most probably on the basis of the missile attacks on Israel by the country’s Houthi terrorists. Hezbollah, which has launched some 8,000 rockets, UAV and other airborne threats at Israel since October 8 to support Hamas, came in second, at 44%. Qatar, which has supported Hamas with billions of dollars over the years and is now acting as a mediator in negotiations for a hostages-for-ceasefire deal, was a close third at 43%. Iran only received an approving nod from 33%, which is a 16-point drop from June. This, said the polling agency, 'seems to be due to the belief of the overwhelming majority (76%) that it will not retaliate for the assassination of [Hamas political head] Ismail Haniyeh on its soil.' Armed struggle was considered the most effective way to gain a state by 48%, a drop of six points from June. The three-month drop was extremely sharp in Gaza, however – a whopping 20 points. Negotiations were a distant second at 30%, although this represented a five point rise. The PCPSR said it conducted its survey by telephone or tablet in areas of the Gaza Strip where there was no fighting currently going on, but noted that it excluded the quiet northern section due to technical difficulties. In all, 1,200 people were surveyed, 790 in the PA and 410 in Gaza. The margin of error was 3.5%.

US denies involvement in pager attack on Hezbollah	Israel did not give US advance notice of mass pager attack on Hezbollah terrorists, Biden administration official says, distancing US from the attack. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration on Tuesday distanced itself from the apparent mass pager bombing attack, attributed to Israel, against thousands of members of the Iranian-backed Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah, claiming that the U.S. was neither involved in the attack nor did the U.S. have any prior knowledge of it. Speaking with reporters at a press briefing Tuesday, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the administration was still looking into the attacks, but emphasized that the U.S. played no role in them, adding that Israel did not disclose its plans to the administration prior to the attack. 'We are gathering information on this incident,' Matthew said. 'I can tell you that the U.S. was not involved in it, the U.S. was not aware of this incident in advance.' 'We’re collecting information in the same way that journalists are across the world to gather the facts about what might have happened.' Miller expressed concern the attack could lead to greater escalations between Israel on one hand and Hezbollah and Iran on the other, and called on all parties to reach a 'diplomatic solution.' 'We are always concerned about any type of event that may cause further escalation. And it remains our message to both Israel and to other parties that they need to do everything they can to try and reach a diplomatic resolution.' Reiterating the Biden administration's support for a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, Miller said an agreement between Israel and Hamas could pave the way for a 'resolution' on Israel's northern border. 'Go back to the fundamental issue we face here which is very difficult to get a diplomatic resolution in the north absent a resolution to the conflict in Gaza, absent a ceasefire in Gaza, which is why we continue to push for that ceasefire because we think it’ll help make it much easier to reach a resolution.'

‘Use it or lose it’ – Israel forced to use mass pager attack pree...	Hezbollah terrorists were reportedly close to uncovering Israel's modifications to the terror group's pagers, forcing Israel to preemptively use the mass attack. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israel's attack on thousands of Hezbollah terrorists across Lebanon and Syria Tuesday had originally been planned to take place only in the event of a full-scale war on the Israel-Lebanon border, three U.S. officials claim, and was only carried out amid concerns the terror group was close to revealing Israel's modifications to the electronic beepers used in the attack. On Tuesday, thousands of pager devices issued to Hezbollah operatives and associates detonated en masse, killing eleven and injuring roughly 4,000. The devices reportedly exploded as part of a large-scale attack conducted by Israel's Mossad, which is claimed to have implanted miniature explosive devices in the Hezbollah pagers five months ago, prior to their delivery to Lebanon. However, according to three U.S. officials cited in a report by Axios Wednesday, the pager attack had been held in reserve by Israel, and was slated for use only if a full-scale war broke out between Israel and Hezbollah. Recently, however, Israeli intel officials came to believe that the Iranian-backed Lebanese terror group was close to discovering the modifications to the pagers, forcing Israel to either activate the devices immediately, or lose its capability. 'It was a use it or lose it moment,' one U.S. official explained, saying that Israel had informed the U.S. of its reasoning for the timing of Tuesday's attack. According to a former Israeli official cited by Axios, the operation had been planned as an opening salvo in a potential full-scale war with Hezbollah, crippling the terror group's leadership and sowing chaos in its ranks at the outset of the war. A separate report by Al-Monitor claimed that two Hezbollah terrorists had recently raised concerns regarding the group's pagers over the past few days, sparking fears in Israel's intelligence community the explosive devices were on the verge of discovery.

Iranian ambassador blinded by Hezbollah beeper blast – report	Iranian ambassador's injuries prove clear link between Iran and the Hezbollah terror group. By World Israel News Staff Iran's ambassador to Lebanon was seriously wounded during the coordinated explosion of beepers used by Hezbollah members on Tuesday, with international media reports indicating that he was left blinded by the blast. According to a New York Times report, Ambassador Mojtaba Amani lost one eye in the explosion. His surviving eye was seriously damaged, leaving him with extremely limited vision. In a brief statement on Tuesday, the Iranian government admitted that Amani was wounded in the incident, but downplayed the severity of his injuries and said he was 'in good general condition' after being treated at a hospital. That false narrative was repeated by Amani's wife, Narges Ghadirian, who wrote on X that her husband was 'slightly injured, but thank God he is all right and the danger has passed.' Some unconfirmed reports are reporting that the Iran ambassador to Lebanon Mojtaba Amani has been injured in his eyes after checking his beeper potentially making him blind. We will confirm as we know. pic.twitter.com/biXkeE192I &mdash; Open Source Intel (@Osint613) September 17, 2024 Hossein Soleimani, who heads the IRGC's news website Mashregh, confirmed on X that Amani had been seriously wounded, several hours after the blasts. 'Unfortunately the injuries sustained by Iran’s ambassador were extremely severe and in his eyes,' Soleimani wrote. Tehran is planning to repatriate Amani on an emergency flight for additional medical care at a hospital in Iran. The fact that Amani was in possession of a beeper that exploded demonstrates the deep ties between Iran and the Hezbollah terror group. Two members of the IRGC confirmed to the New York Times that the beepers were only used by Hezbollah operatives and members. Iran is a long-time patron of Hezbollah, providing them with training, funding, and weapons for use against Israel. But Iran has often claimed that Hezbollah is not their proxy group, characterizing them as an Islamic resistance organization fighting for Lebanon, rather than at the behest of Tehran. Lebanon and Iran have blamed Israel for the explosions, which killed at least 9 people and injured some 3,000 more. Israel has refused to comment on the incident.

4 IDF soldiers killed, 6 wounded in Gaza fighting	Combat paramedic is first female soldiers to be killed in battle in the Strip. By World Israel News Staff Four Israeli soldiers were killed during the ongoing fighting against the Hamas terror group in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, the IDF announced in a media statement after their families were informed. They were named as Captain Daniel Maimon Toaff, 23, of Moreshet, Sergeant Agam Naim, 20, of Mishmarot, Sergeant Amit Bachari, 21, of Yoshivia, and Sergeant Dotan Shimon, 21, of Elazar. According to a report from Hebrew-language Mako news, investigators believed the four were killed by an explosive device, either hurled by terrorists at a building in which they were standing, or a booby-trap within the building that detonated when they entered. Toaff, Bachari, and Shimon were all combat soldiers in the Givati Brigade's Shaked Battalion stationed in the southern Strip. Naim, who was a paramedic, is the first female soldier to be killed in the Gaza Strip since the ground invasion began in late October 2023. 'We don't believe it. She was the most charming girl, beloved by all, a friend. She loved the role, she was extremely dedicated' to serving as a combat paramedic, said Ofek, a high-school friend of the late Naim, told Mako. 'Who could imagine? This is heart-breaking.' In the same incident in which the four were killed, an additional five soldiers were wounded and evacuated to hospitals in Israel. Three of them are listed as being in serious condition. Also on Tuesday, in a separate incident also in the southern region the Strip, another Givati soldier was seriously wounded in battle. The Israel death toll in the ground invasion now stands at 348, including a civilian contractor who was killed and Amnon Zamora, a police officer who was killed during the hostage rescue operation that freed Noa Argamani, Shlomi Ziv, Andrey Kozlov, and Almog Meir Jan.

American Jew sentenced to death for role in foiled coup in Congo	Zalman-Polun is now also the target of conspiracy theories that claim he is a CIA and Mossad agent sent to destabilize the Congolese government. By Jackie Hajdenberg, JTA An American Jew is facing the death penalty for his involvement in an attempted political coup in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in late May. Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun — a Washington, D.C.-area native and father of three — was one of three Americans and 37 people total sentenced to death Friday in the DRC over an attempt in May. The failed coup was led by Christian Malanga, a onetime used car salesman and gold miner who sought to overthrow the country’s president, Félix Tshisekedi. Six people were killed in the coup attempt, parts of which were livestreamed, and Malanga was later shot and killed by the Congolese army while resisting arrest. Zalman-Polun, who pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute marijuana in the United States a decade ago, was reportedly a gold mining business associate of Malanga’s. The other two Americans who were sentenced to death are Marcel Malanga, the son of Christian Malanga, and Tyler Thompson. Zalman-Polun was at the presidential palace before coup leader Christian Malanga was shot dead, according to photos and videos taken that day. Zalman-Polun and the other Americans were caught on the banks of the Congo River as they were trying to escape, according to NPR. They claimed at trial that they were forced to participate in the coup at gunpoint. Zalman-Polun reportedly had been living in South Africa with his family for the past several years. Before that, the family lived in Washington, D.C., where they were members of the Washington Hebrew Congregation, when their first child was born in 2017, according to announcements distributed by the Reform synagogue. Zalman-Polun is now also the target of conspiracy theories that claim he is a CIA and Mossad agent sent to destabilize the Congolese government. Users on X have been sharing a photo of Zalman-Polun and Christian Malanga taken outside of Golan Spy Shop, a technology and security supply store in Tel Aviv, saying that it is proof that they were trained by Israeli forces. Congolese law gives the men five days to appeal their sentences. The country reinstituted the death penalty last year. The U.S. State Department has not declared Zalman-Polun and the other two Americans wrongfully detained, the Associated Press reported, making it unlikely the American government will try to arrange their release. In May, just hours after the attempted coup, U.S. Ambassador to the Democratic Republic of the Congo Lucy Tamlyn condemned the coup and the involvement of American citizens. 'I am shocked by the events of this morning and deeply concerned by reports of U.S. citizens allegedly being involved,' Tamlyn wrote on X. 'Please be assured that we will cooperate with DRC authorities to the fullest extent possible as they investigate these criminal acts and hold accountable any U.S. citizens implicated in criminal acts.' Zalman-Polun is not the first Jewish intersection with the DRC’s tumultuous politics. Moise Katumbi, whose father was a Jewish refugee from Greece during the Holocaust, has faced ongoing efforts to block him from running for office, most recently last year when a rival pursued a law that would bar candidates whose parents were not both Congolese; Jewish groups abroad condemned the law as antisemitic. The rival ran against Tshisekedi, the subject of the coup attempt, and received less than 1% of the official vote.

Mossad planted explosives in Hezbollah’s beepers 5 months ago, de...	On Tuesday, at least eleven were killed, and 4,000 people were wounded in Lebanon when beepers exploded simultaneously. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News According to Sky News Arabia, sources report that Mossad ensured explosives were implanted into the pagers and heated them remotely, causing them to detonate. On Tuesday, at least 11 were killed, and 4,000 people were wounded in Lebanon when beepers exploded simultaneously. Most of those killed or injured were Hezbollah terrorists. The report indicates that PETN, a highly explosive material, was implanted in the batteries of the beepers. The weight of the PETN explosives was less than 20 grams, and it is believed they were obtained and implanted 5 months ago. This was possible only through close cooperation with the manufacturer, who must have consented to the supply chain disruption. In an interview with Ma'ariv, Oleg Brodt, Director of Research, Development, and Innovation at Ben-Gurion University's Cyber Labs, explained, 'Many attacks occur by compromising the supply chain. Like a beeper, an electronic device contains numerous components, and each could be infected with malware.' He added, 'This malware could be designed to raise the device’s temperature, cause a malfunction, ignite it, or even trigger an explosion.' Brodt explained, 'In such cases, it’s essential to make the changes to the device without raising suspicion during the quality inspection.' Once implanted on the batteries of the beeper, the explosives were detonated by heating them up remotely. This might have been done using a 'kill switch,' as it is called in the cyber world. The kill switch is software designed to detonate a device at a certain time. It can be set off using a code word or even gibberish. 'It’s possible to set up a non-standard message—something unusual or even gibberish—broadcast to hundreds or thousands of devices simultaneously, causing simultaneous ignition and explosion,' Brodt explained. 'The radio waves the device receives are translated into a unique message that triggers a chain of events leading to the explosion.'

A Reuters journalist saw 10 terrorists bleeding from injuries in Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiya, a main stronghold of Hezbollah. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS More than 4,000 Hezbollah terrorists were wounded and at least eleven were killed across Lebanon on Tuesday when their communication devices exploded, Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad confirmed. Approximately 200 Hezbollah terrorists were in critical condition in 100 different hospitals, Beirut’s health minister announced about three hours after the explosions were first reported at 3.30 p.m. local time. A Reuters journalist saw 10 terrorists bleeding from injuries in Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiya, which is the main stronghold of Hezbollah. A security source told Qatar’s Al Jazeera that explosions occurred across Lebanon—not only in Beirut but also in the Beqaa Valley and the south. Senior Hezbollah officials were said to have been wounded in the blasts. Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was also wounded in one of the explosions, Tehran’s semi-official Mehr outlet reported.

In its first official statement on the incident, Hezbollah announced that the pager explosions, 'the causes of which are still unknown,' killed at least three of its members, while wounding a large number of others. Shortly thereafter, the terrorist organization issued a statement that it held the Jewish state 'fully responsible for this criminal aggression.' Lebanese media affiliated with Hezbollah had attributed the incident to the Israel Defense Forces, claiming the mysterious blasts were caused by a hack of the terrorist group’s internal communications networks. The Wall Street Journal said the pagers were part of a new shipment that the terror group received in recent days. A Hezbollah official suggested that 'malware' may have caused the pagers to heat up and explode. Another Hezbollah terrorist official in Lebanon cited by Reuters called the alleged computer hack by Israel the 'biggest security breach so far.' The IDF declined to comment on the incident, which came just hours after the Israeli Cabinet added the return of citizens displaced from their homes in the north to the country’s war goals, bringing a potential major confrontation with Hezbollah closer to reality.

Syria built clandestine atomic reactor, says Israeli nuclear chie...	In March, IAEA director Rafael Grossi visited Syria for talks with Syrian leaders about the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel’s atomic chief warned that Syria has built an undeclared nuclear facility in remarks at the International Atomic Energy Agency’s conference in Vienna on Tuesday. 'Syria, which built an undeclared, clandestine nuclear reactor at Deir al-Zour, optimized for plutonium production, has been in non-compliance with its safeguards obligations for over a decade,' said Moshe Edri, Director General of Israel’s Atomic Energy Commission. 'Syria has recently followed the footsteps of its close ally, Iran, and is pretending to cooperate in good faith with the Agency, while not admitting the full facts, and not providing true answers to the Agency’s questions. The international community should stand behind the IAEA with a goal towards receiving clear, full, explanations from Syria, once and for all.' In March, IAEA director Rafael Grossi visited Syria for talks with Syrian leaders about the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. It was the first visit by an IAEA official to Syria since 2011 when international nuclear inspectors fled the country during the Syrian Civil War. Grossi’s visit sought to revive an investigation into a nuclear facility at Deir al-Zour destroyed in an Israeli airstrike in 2007. Israel did not confirm responsibility for the airstrike until 2018. Edri also called on the international community to take stronger measures against Iran’s nuclear program. 'Iran continues to be the main source of regional instability, and poses a threat to peace and security worldwide. This reality requires the full attention of the international community, now more than ever before. There is no doubt that Iran conducted a military nuclear program aimed to produce several nuclear weapon devices,' said Edri. An IAEA report in May concluded that Iran possesses a significant stockpile of uranium enriched to more than 60% purity, far higher than the 3.67% necessary for a civilian nuclear program. Nuclear weapons require uranium enriched to 90% purity. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in July that Iran’s breakout time to produce enough weapons-grade material for a nuclear weapon is 'probably one or two weeks.' Said Edri, 'Iran continues to advance this program by gaining relevant technology and knowledge, along with fissile material in alarming amounts. Iran has been conducting covert nuclear activities in undeclared sites for many years. The Agency has found concrete evidence of these activities, including the use of undeclared nuclear material and equipment. Despite repeated resolutions by the Board of Governors, Iran has continuously failed to provide technically credible explanations regarding these activities, and continues to deceive the Agency and the international community.' He added, 'Moreover, Iran continues to develop, test and deploy long-range ballistic missiles, and supports terrorist organizations throughout the Middle East, including the Houthi terrorist group that is a significant security threat to the freedom of navigation, and to the global trade routes. A nuclear-armed Iran, equipped with delivery systems, is not an option that Israel, or the world, can, or should tolerate.'

Federal loopholes allow China to buy land near sensitive ports, l...	Chinese Communist Party-tied companies own at least 384,000 acres of American agricultural land, a 30 percent increase since 2019. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon China and other foreign adversaries are still permitted to purchase U.S. land near sensitive Coast Guard facilities, ports, and Energy Department labs, exposing national security gaps that lawmakers say enable hostile regimes to conduct espionage operations on American soil. The Treasury Department's Committee of Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the central body responsible for approving land sales to foreign entities, moved to 'significantly expand' its jurisdiction in July, allowing it to review real estate transactions near 50 military and other sensitive sites. That expanded list, however, does not include locations such as 'national laboratories, maritime ports, and critical telecommunications and energy infrastructure,' all of which remain vulnerable to foreign spy operations, according to Reps. Greg Murphy (R., N.C.) and John Moolenaar (R., Mich.). The oversight, the lawmakers say, reflects 'significant gaps in our national security screening regime for land purchases near national security sites.' Their concern comes as China works to ramp up its influence operations and 'wreak havoc' on American infrastructure, efforts that have made combating Chinese land purchases a major political issue in states across the country. 'Coast Guard facilities, Department of Energy National Labs, among other locations, remain off CFIUS’s list of sensitive sites and are thereby vulnerable to foreign adversary exploitation,' Murphy and Moolenaar, who chairs the House Select Committee on China, wrote in a Monday letter to the Treasury Department. 'These loopholes must be closed, and closed quickly. Allowing our adversaries to have potential access to these sites poses risks to both our economic and national security, especially as we see companies with ties to hostile nations continue to increase their investments in the U.S.' Chinese Communist Party-tied companies own at least 384,000 acres of American agricultural land, a 30 percent increase since 2019, though poor federal oversight means the number could be higher. This accounts for nearly $2 billion in holdings, planting Beijing and its interests across the American heartland. Lawmakers from both parties have been sounding the alarm about CCP land purchases for some time, leading CFIUS and other federal agencies to more stringently police Beijing’s land acquisition near some military sites. But as the Treasury Department finalizes its new rule to extend CFIUS’s blacklist to include 50 military installations across 30 states, Murphy and Moolenaar say more must be done to address several critical loopholes. 'Because CFIUS land purchase regulations are not retroactive, land purchases made prior to a site being listed are exempt from CFIUS review,' the lawmakers noted in their letter. Even if federal authorities move forward with expanded restrictions, China’s past land purchases would be immune from scrutiny. 'Xi Jinping would never allow Americans to buy land next to sensitive Chinese bases,' Moolenaar told the Washington Free Beacon. 'Unfortunately, current U.S. policy all too often rolls out the red carpet for CCP land purchases.' CFIUS is not currently examining any restrictions on China’s land purchases near Coast Guard hubs and Energy Department labs, giving the CCP room to pivot to these sites as the American government focuses on restricting land buys near military installations. Murphy and Moolenaar say there is a solid 'national security case for including Coast Guard and other facilities' in CFIUS’s blacklist, given the Coast Guard's chief role in policing America’s maritime boundaries. In June, for instance, several Russian ships sailed within 30 miles of the coast of Florida, prompting the Coast Guard to monitor these activities. A month later, Chinese military ships entered the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone off the coast of Alaska, again drawing a response from the Coast Guard. If Chinese entities owned land near Coast Guard facilities, they could potentially surveil the Coast Guard’s response to national security situations and gain valuable information about how the United States monitors its borders. 'While CFIUS coverage includes many military bases and other sensitive areas, U.S. Coast Guard facilities, National Laboratories, some maritime ports, and critical telecommunications and energy infrastructure are not included,' Murphy told the Free Beacon. 'This leaves the United States vulnerable to hostile nations and malicious actors. We cannot allow bad actors to purchase land in America to harm us.'

By JNS An Israeli aerial strike on Monday killed the head of Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s rocket and missile unit in the Rafah area of southern Gaza. Ahmed Aish Salame al-Hashash was embedded and operating inside the humanitarian zone in Khan Yunis when he was eliminated in the precision attack, according to the Israel Defense Forces.

'The terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip continue to systematically abuse civilian and humanitarian infrastructure to carry out terrorist activities and attacks on Israeli civilians,' the IDF statement concluded. 'The IDF will continue to operate against the terrorist organizations in defense of the State of Israel.' Soldier seriously wounded A reserve soldier in the IDF’s 846th Battalion, Givati Brigade, was seriously wounded during combat operations in the southern Gaza Strip, the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit said on Tuesday morning. He was evacuated to a hospital for treatment and his family was notified. IDF’s 5th Brigade deployed to Gaza’s Netzarim Corridor The Israel Defense Forces’ 5th Infantry Brigade has been stationed in the Netzarim Corridor that splits the Gaza Strip between north and south, the army announced on Monday. It is the second time the brigade has operated in the coastal enclave since Israeli forces entered the territory on Oct. 27. The brigade’s first tour of duty entailed protecting Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip in the first days of the war and ridding them of terrorists, before months of combat in the areas of Beit Hanun, Kherbat Ahzaa and the central corridor. The brigade falls under the command of the 252nd Division, which in recent months has been operating against Hamas and working to expand the axis dividing the northern and southern Strip. 'In the last few days, the brigade’s fighters completed a series of training and exercises at the Ground Forces Training Center (GTC). The forces carried out training and exercises in warfare in open and built-up areas and raised their operational competence in preparation for their mission in the center of the Gaza Strip,' the IDF said. 'In addition, the forces completed logistical preparation and held mobility, supplies and immediate medical response training in preparation for the fighting.'

Hezbollah plot to assassinate former Israeli security chief foile...	The Lebanese terror group had planned to bomb a former Israeli security official using a Claymore mine. By World Israel News Staff The Iran-backed Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah plotted to assassinate a former senior Israeli security official using an anti-personnel mine, the Shin Bet internal security agency revealed Tuesday. The Shin Bet announced Tuesday afternoon that a former senior Israeli security official, whose identity remains barred from publication, was to have been targeted by Hezbollah terrorists in the next few days, using a remotely-detonated Claymore mine. 'As part of an operation by the General Security Service, a bomb attack on behalf of Hezbollah was foiled, which was targeted against a former senior official in the security system and was planned to be carried out in the coming days,' the Shin Bet said. According to the Shin Bet, the explosive device was linked to a cellular phone, allowing the bomb's handlers in Lebanon to observe when the target approached the mine and then detonate it remotely. The bomb was similar to another explosive device found in Hayarkon Park last September, planted as part of another Hezbollah plot to kill an Israeli official. Shin Bet officials believe that the same Hezbollah cell is behind both failed bombing attempts. 'Operational preparation and the activity of the forces prevented the attack in the final stages of implementation,' the Shin Bet said. 'The target of the attack has been updated by the security forces and is being updated accordingly.' 'The Shin Bet, together with its partners in the security system, will increase and operate with all the capabilities available to it to monitor and thwart Hezbollah's terrorist activities.' Six months before the Hayarkon Park bombing attempt, Hezbollah terrorists infiltrated into northern Israel and placed a bomb near Megiddo Junction, seirously injuring the driver of a passing vehicle.

‘World cannot tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran,’ warns top nuclear o...	Director-General of Israel's nuclear commission warns Iran still evading IAEA scrutiny, using undeclared nuclear materials. By World Israel News Staff Israel's top nuclear official warned the International Atomic Energy Agency Tuesday not to permit Iran to acquire nuclear weapons, saying that complacency vis-a-vis a nuclear-armed Iran is 'not an option' for the world. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Director General Moshe Edri addressed the 68th International Atomic Energy (IAEA) General Conference in Vienna on Tuesday, and commented on the regional challenges facing the State of Israel, highlighting both Iran and Syria, both of which he accused of not honoring their international commitments in this field. Edri emphasized that Iran's nuclear program, which continues to evade full scrutiny by the IAEA, poses a threat not only to Israel but to global stability. 'Iran continues to be the main source of regional instability, and poses a threat to peace and security worldwide. This reality requires the full attention of the international community, now more than ever before.' 'There is no doubt that Iran conducted a military nuclear program aimed to produce several nuclear weapon devices. Iran continues to advance this program by gaining relevant technology and knowledge, along with fissile material in alarming amounts.' Edri noted that Tehran has thus far flouted IAEA requirements, operating secret nuclear facilities while refusing to provide an honest accounting of its nuclear activities. 'Iran has been conducting covert nuclear activities in undeclared sites for many years. The Agency has found concrete evidence of these activities, including the use of undeclared nuclear material and equipment.' 'Despite repeated resolutions by the Board of Governors, Iran has continuously failed to provide technically credible explanations regarding these activities, and continues to deceive the Agency and the international community.' Most egregiously, Edri added, the Iranian government continues to develop and produce ballistic missiles clearly intended to serve as delivery mechanisms for nuclear weapons. 'Moreover, Iran continues to develop, test and deploy long-range ballistic missiles, and supports terrorist organizations throughout the Middle East, including the Houthi terrorist group that is a significant security threat to the freedom of navigation, and to the global trade routes.

Britain to mandate Holocaust education, says PM	British PM Keir Starmer says his government will require all schools to include Holocaust education, citing Hamas October 7th invasion of Israel and subsequent surge in antisemitism as proof of need for curriculum change. By World Israel News Staff Every school in Britain will be required to include Holocaust education in its curriculum, Prime Minister Keir Starmer pledged Monday. Speaking during the annual Holocaust Education Trust dinner in London Monday evening, Starmer warned of rising antisemitism in Britain, and vowed to combat the growing trend, comparing it to his efforts to push back on anti-Jewish bigotry within the Labour Party. The event, which drew some 500 attendees, featured British Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, and a number of Holocaust survivors and their families. 'Just as I fought to bring my party back from the abyss of antisemitism, I will do the same in leading the country,' Starmer said. Under the new national curriculum standards being set by the government, Starmer said, British students will hear recorded testimonials from Holocaust survivors. 'Even schools who do not currently have to follow the national curriculum will have to teach the Holocaust when the new curriculum comes in,' Starmer continued. 'For the first time, studying the Holocaust will become a critical, vital part of every single student’s identity. And not just studying it, learning from it too and above all, acting on its lessons.' Starmer said that the surge in antisemitism following the October 7th invasion of Israel demonstrated the dire need for changes to the school curriculum to combat anti-Jewish sentiments. 'Over 1,000 people were massacred by Hamas, for the very same reason: because they were Jewish.' 'We say ‘never again’ and yet in the last year we’ve seen record levels of antisemitism right here in Britain.' Starmer condemned the overt antisemitism displayed at some anti-Israel rallies since October 7th, warning that it was a sign of 'hatred marching on our streets.'

‘Nothing justifies’ Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas, says UN S...	Secretary-General Antonio Guterres claims devastation of Gaza during war against Hamas constitutes 'collective punishment,' calling it unparalleled in recent history. By World Israel News Staff The secretary-general of the United Nations accused Israel of carrying out 'collective punishment' against Palestinian Arabs living in the Gaza Strip, saying 'nothing justifies' the way the current war against the Hamas terror organization is being waged. Speaking with AFP on Monday, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the Hamas invasion of Israel on October 7th and the taking of over 250 hostages, but added that not even Hamas atrocities justify Israel's current war in Gaza. 'It is unimaginable, the level of suffering in Gaza, the level of deaths and destruction have no parallel in everything I've witnessed since [becoming] Secretary-General,' Guterres said Monday. 'We all condemn the terror attacks made by Hamas, as well as the taking of the hostages, that is an absolute violation of international humanitarian law.' 'But the truth is that nothing justifies the collective punishment of the Palestinian people, and that is what we are witnessing in a dramatic way in Gaza.' 'Accountability should be a must,' Guterres said regarding collateral damage, saying both Israel and Hamas were guilty of 'serious violations.' Turning to efforts to reach a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, Guterres lamented that the talks 'are endless,' adding that it would be 'very difficult' to achieve a breakthrough. Guterres has frequently criticized Israel over its handling of the war in Gaza. Last week, the Secretary-General blasted the IDF after the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) claimed that six of its employees were killed in a pair of Israeli airstrikes in the city of Nuseirat in central Gaza. 'What’s happening in Gaza is totally unacceptable,' Guterres tweeted. 'A school turned shelter for around 12,000 people was hit by Israeli airstrikes again today.' 'Six of our UNRWA colleagues are among those killed. These dramatic violations of international humanitarian law need to stop now.' Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the UN, fired back, noting UNRWA’s extensive links to terrorist groups, including Hamas, and suggesting the six UNRWA employees killed were themselves terrorists. 'What is ‘unacceptable,’ Antonio Guterres, is the fact you refuse to recognize reality and continue to distort it,' tweeted Danon. 'Terrorists operating out of civilian buildings previously used by UNRWA are not ‘innocent.’ It is unconscionable that the UN continues to condemn Israel in its just war against terrorists, while Hamas continues to use women and children as human shields.'

Blinken heads to Egypt for talks on Israeli control of Philadelph...	Most of the holdup in a potential hostage deal allegedly centers around control of the Gaza-Egypt border, which has been Hamas’ weapons pipeline and is now in Israel’s hands. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is coming to Egypt Tuesday to hold discussions on the one of the main issues holding up a hostage deal with Hamas – control over the Philadelphi Corridor, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. Citing 'an official in the region,' the report said that Blinken’s trip is being made 'to reassure Israel over its concerns that Hamas can smuggle weapons across' the Egyptian-Gazan border, which the IDF and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have called Hamas’ oxygen pipeline in terms of military resupply. Since taking the Corridor over several months ago, the Israeli army has discovered – and blown up – dozens of smuggling tunnels running from the Egyptian side into the Gazan city of Rafah, some large enough for trucks that can carry missiles as well as tons of cement for terror tunnel construction. Netanyahu has declared that Israel must control this nine-mile-long line or else Hamas will easily rearm, rebuild, and become a new 'existential' threat to the Jewish state within a few years’ time. Most of the Israeli public agrees that holding the Corridor is of utmost importance to Israel's security. Hamas refuses to sign off on a hostages-for-ceasefire-and-prisoners agreement unless the IDF withdraws, both from the southern line and the Netzarim Corridor that the army built in central Gaza that stretches to the Mediterranean Sea in order to cut the Strip in half. Although Cairo is considered by the U.S. to be a faithful mediator in the hostage talks, it has sided with Hamas in strenuously opposing an Israeli presence on its border with Gaza. Egypt has not acknowledged its total failure to prevent the wholesale Palestinian smuggling that is considered the main reason Hamas could become a major and immediate security threat to Israel, as it proved on October 7, when the terrorist organization led an invasion in which they and other Gazans massacred 1,200 people, the vast majority of them civilians. The paper pointed out that Blinken’s visit follows last week’s announcement that the U.S. would be providing Egypt with its full annual military aid package of $1.3 billion, overruling a Congressional directive that conditioned some of the funding on Cairo improving its human rights record, which is still considered deplorable by experts in the field. A State Department spokesperson said that the decision to restore the last $320 million of the package was 'important to advancing regional peace and Egypt’s specific and ongoing contributions to U.S. national security priorities, particularly to finalize a ceasefire agreement for Gaza' and help end the Israel-Hamas war. It is unknown whether Blinken will tie the Americans’ generosity to a request that Egypt soften its stance on the Philadelphi Corridor and persuade Hamas to do so as well, in order to get a deal done that will see the release of at least some of the live hostages still remaining in Hamas captivity over 11 months after they were abducted. President Joe Biden has repeatedly stated that freeing the hostages remains one of his top priorities. The ceasefire that would be part of the deal would also seemingly stop a possible Israel-Hezbollah war, as the Lebanese Shiite terrorists have said they would stop their constant rocket attacks on Israel if the fighting stops in Gaza. Jerusalem has made increasingly threatening noises in recent days to restore quiet in its northern region by invading Lebanon to push Hezbollah away from the border, as 60,000 Israelis are still evacuated from their homes for their safety, an untenable position for any government. Blinken’s trip to Cairo is in accord with the U.S. position that diplomatic means can prevent such a war, which it fears could turn into a wider, regional conflict that includes Hezbollah’s master, Iran.

Inside IDF’s plans for tech-heavy border fence on Jordanian front...	Installing hundreds of monitoring devices and the establishment of a new Eastern Command are parts of the first phase of the project. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The IDF has developed a detailed plan for fully safeguarding the Jordanian border and will present it to the Finance and Defense ministries in the coming days for funding approval, Ynet reported Tuesday. In the first, immediate phase of the plan, hundreds of monitoring and observation instruments will be placed along a 400-kilometer stretch from Eilat to Hamat Gader at the southern tip of the Sea of Galilee. The radars and cameras will be installed on high poles, to detect illicit attempts to cross the border either by terrorists or smugglers. When such an attempt is detected, fast mobile forces will be sent to the suspicious area. It is 'possible,' said the report, that some soldiers will use gliders or other airborne vehicles to arrive and attack quickly. An upgraded physical barrier is also included in the plan, as currently there is nothing blocking the border in the entire desert (Arava) area, and in other places, such as the Jordan Valley, the barrier consists only of a decades-old, rusty and low fence. The formation of a completely new, Eastern division that will guard Israel’s longest land border is also in the works. A unique element in the plan is to have one of the brigades in the division consist of ultra-Orthodox men serving in the Jordan Valley, which would put them in close proximity to their yeshivas (learning institutions) in the Jerusalem area. This single, unified Command would ostensibly be more effective than the current situation, where a mix of reservist and regular battalions belonging to two different Commands – Southern and Central – rotate in and out of various domains along the border. The estimated cost of the project is somewhere between the NIS2.5 billion invested in the high fences strewn with technological means of detection along the Egyptian border that stopped the infiltration of tens of thousands of illegal migrants, and the NIS4 billion barrier down the length of the Gaza Strip, which was built both above and below the ground in order to stop terror tunnels from crossing into Israel. While the Gaza barrier was largely successful in stopping smuggling attempts, criminals make constant runs at the 220km-long Sinai fence, with the IDF acknowledging that has not been able to stop a majority of them, due to the sparseness of its forces there. Most, but not all, of the southern gangs are running drugs, not guns. The Jordanian border, however, has recently become a huge conduit for all kinds of weapons, including advanced rifles and explosives. According to the report, the 'regular' smuggling routes have been taken over by the Iranian Quds Force, which is eager to turn Judea and Samaria into a serious terror challenge for Israel as well as a real threat to take over the Palestinian Authority. The explosives in particular are a worry for the IDF, as the Palestinians in such terror centers as Jenin have mastered the tactic of planting bombs along and underneath streets where they expect IDF forces to travel, and they are much more powerful and deadly than the homemade, fertilizer-based ones of the past. Over the last three years, the army and police have stepped up their anti-smuggling operations, and hundreds of attempts have been foiled, with the confiscation of thousands of weapons. 'But for every such thwarting, there are at least three to five smuggling operations that are successful, and we don't know about them,' one security official said.

‘This is madness’ – US furious over Netanyahu plan to fire defens...	Biden administration furious over potential cabinet shake-up, says Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'would be crazy' to replace Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration is furious over an expected move by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to fire Defense Minister Yoav Gallant - with whom he has repeatedly butted heads - and replace him with New Hope party chairman Gideon Saa'ar. 'Replacing a defense minister during a war for political reasons is an act of madness, especially when it's a defense minister with military experience,' a senior American diplomat fumed to Hebrew-language news outlet Channel 12 on Monday, following reports about the likely change in Netanyahu's cabinet. Another Biden administration official told Axios that Netanyahu 'would be crazy' to replace 'an experienced minister of defense like Gallant amid a war in Gaza and as Israel might be heading towards a possible all out war in Lebanon.' Former defense minister Benny Gantz also lashed out against Netanyahu regarding the anticipated move, saying at a conference on Tuesday morning that the premier is 'endangering Israel’s security during a war.' The Biden administration has enjoyed a close relationship with Gallant, whom they felt was a counterweight to more hawkish political leaders in Netanyahu's coalition, such as Public Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir of the Otzma Yehudit party. Washington likely views Gallant being replaced as another step towards a large-scale military confrontation with Hezbollah, following an announcement that the return of displaced northerners to their homes has officially been added as a goal for the ongoing war. The U.S. has been intensely pressuring Israel to refrain from launching a high intensity military campaign against the Lebanon-based terror group until after the November presidential elections. But according to a Channel 12 report, both the political and defense establishments feel that the tit-for-tat attacks which have defined much of the fighting with Hezbollah over the past 11 months aren't sufficient for deterring the terror group, and that the chances of a diplomatic solution to the conflict are slim.

‘Is this guy part of a conspiracy?’ Florida Sheriff questions whe...	The former president’s golf schedule had not been publicly disclosed. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon A Florida sheriff is raising questions about whether the attempted assassination of Donald Trump is part of a broader conspiracy. The sheriff, William Snyder of Martin County, Fla., noted that the would-be assassin is not a Florida resident and that the former president's movements on Sunday were not broadcast in advance. 'How does a guy from not here get all the way to Trump International, realize that the president, former president of the United States, is golfing, and is able to get a rifle in that vicinity?' Snyder said Monday. The former president’s golf schedule had not been publicly disclosed. 'I think that’s the question the FBI, the Secret Service are laser-focused on today. Is this guy part of a conspiracy? Is he a lone gunman?' Snyder continued. 'If he’s part of a conspiracy, then this whole thing really takes on a very ominous tone.' The suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, allegedly camped at Trump’s West Palm Beach golf course with food, a digital camera, and a loaded rifle with a scope for around 12 hours before the Secret Service spotted him, according to cell phone data obtained by authorities. A Secret Service agent opened fire after noticing the muzzle of a rifle protruding from shrubbery about 400 yards from where Trump was playing. The suspect fled in a vehicle but was apprehended in less than an hour. The incident follows a similar security lapse two months ago, when 20-year-old Thomas Crooks evaded Secret Service detection for at least 20 minutes and nearly assassinated Trump at a July 13 rally in Pennsylvania. Routh, charged Monday with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, appeared to smile and laugh at least three times while speaking to his attorney before the hearing began, Fox News reported. The charges carry a maximum prison sentence of 20 years. The post 'Is this guy part of a conspiracy?'

Israel returns body of Allenby Crossing terrorist to Jordan	Israeli officials have not commented on the return of al-Jazi’s body. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel returned the body of a Jordanian national who killed three Israelis in a terror attack at a border crossing, Jordan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed on Tuesday morning. The terrorist, 39-year-old Maher Diab al-Jazi, shot and killed three Israelis at the Allenby border crossing, near Jericho, after approaching the cargo area in a truck from the Jordanian side. He exited the vehicle during an inspection and began firing at guards, who returned fire, killing Al-Jazi. Following the attack, Israel temporarily closed its three other land crossings. Israeli officials have not commented on the return of al-Jazi’s body. The Allenby crossing is primarily used by Palestinians in Judea and Samaria to travel to Jordan. Israeli travelers use border crossings in Eilat and the northern Jordan Valley. The victims were identified as Yohanan Shahouri, a 61-year-old father of six from Ma’ale Efraim, 65-year-old Yuri Birnbaum, of Moshav Naama near Jericho, and Adrian Marcelo Podmesser, a resident of Ariel. All three worked at the crossing. Approximately 70% of the Jordanian population is Palestinian, and Hamas enjoys wide popularity. However, the terror group’s alignment with Iran makes its relations with Amman tense. Since the start of the Gaza war, a surge of anti-Israel protests has erupted across Jordan, especially in the capital Amman and other major cities. Ordinary Jordanians celebrated the attack with fireworks and distributing sweets.

Courts: Judea and Samaria towns cannot bar Palestinian workers	Before the war, some 200,000 Palestinian workers were employed throughout the Jewish state, including 30,000 in Judea and Samaria. By JNS Elected local officials in Israeli communities throughout Judea and Samaria do not have the legal right to block Palestinian laborers from entering their communities if the military allows their employment, Israeli courts have confirmed in a series of recent cases, Israel Hayom reported on Sunday. In a case brought by a group of Arab workers against the city of Efrat in Judea’s Gush Etzion region, a judge ruled that the municipality’s blanket ban on the entry of Palestinian Authority residents was illegal. 'Starting next Tuesday, in accordance with the army’s decision and the court ruling, construction workers will resume their activities within Efrat,' Mayor Dovi Shefler said in a message to residents last week. In a conversation with Israel Hayom on Monday, Shefler noted that the court ruled that local officials in Judea and Samaria 'do not have the authority to make the military’s instructions stricter.' Srugim, an Israeli news site catering to the religious Zionist community, reported that at least three other towns received similar rulings in recent months. A settlement reached in a Jerusalem court some five months ago following litigation between the town of Ma’ale Efrayim in the Jordan Valley and four construction companies likewise stated that the IDF would have the final say regarding the admission of P.A. laborers. While the military banned Palestinians from working in Jewish towns throughout Judea and Samaria in the initial months following Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre, Maj. Gen. Yehuda Fox, the then-head of the IDF Central Command, in late 2023 lifted the access restrictions for industrial zones. During the court proceedings, attorneys representing four development companies argued that Ma’ale Efrayim should allow P.A. workers to enter again, claiming that the IDF decision regarding industrial zones should also apply to construction sites in the town’s new neighborhood. Last week, Knesset member Zvi Sukkot (Religious Zionism Party), in a letter to the IDF demanded that the military cancel its policy, noting it forces communities to let in workers despite security concerns. 'The communities must admit Palestinian laborers, even if they express explicit opposition to their entry,' Sukkot noted in a letter to IDF Central Command head Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth. 'Palestinians are banned from entering inside the Green Line due to the security threat; in Judea and Samaria, they have to let them in, even if the communities oppose it.' Before the war, some 200,000 Palestinian workers were employed throughout the Jewish state, including 30,000 in Judea and Samaria. Two surveys last year found that some two-thirds of Palestinians in Judea and Samaria support the Oct. 7 attacks, in which around 6,000 Hamas-led terrorists broke through the Gaza border, murdered some 1,200 people, wounded thousands more and took more than 250 captive. Plans to readmit Palestinians to Jewish communities have been met with dismay by many Israelis. A poll taken in Eli, a town of some 4,500 inhabitants in the Binyamin region of Samaria, showed that 82% of residents oppose their entry, regardless of added security measures.

‘Israel needs to change’ – Biden admin. hits IDF over killing of ...	Preliminary investigation into the killing of a Turkish-American activist during a riot in Samaria 'does not exonerate' IDF soldiers, says State Department, demanding Israel 'change its policies' for use of force. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Biden administration chided the Israeli military Monday over civilian deaths in the ongoing war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and over the death of a dual Turkish-American citizen during a riot in Samaria. Speaking with reporters during a press briefing on Monday, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that Israel's military must tighten its rules of engagement and policies on the use of force, citing the deaths of humanitarian aid workers in the Gaza Strip as a result of a mistaken IDF airstrike, and the fatal shooting of 26-year-old Turkish-born International Solidarity Movement (ISM) activist Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi. Eygi was fatally wounded during a Palestinian Arab riot in the town of Beita, south of Nablus (Shechem) in Samaria on September 7th. The IDF has acknowledged that Eygi was likely killed by 'indirect and unintended IDF fire which was aimed at a main instigator' of the riots. During Monday's press briefing, Miller downplayed a preliminary investigation into the shooting, saying the Biden administration did not view its results as exonerating the IDF soldiers involved. 'You look at the initial findings and they already tell you that something went tragically wrong and you had the killing of an American citizen that never should have occurred,' Miller said. 'So when I hear people hold&#8230; the initial findings up as if they somehow exonerated Israeli security forces, they very much do not. And at least in our point of view they very much do not exonerate them. They reveal the need for a number of changes, and we have made clear that’s what needs to happen.' Miller repeatedly called on Israel to change its use of force regulations, noting that the administration has already pressed Jerusalem on the issue. 'Israel needs to change its policies, and we have made that quite clear,' Miller continued, before referencing the April 1st IDF drone strike which hit an aid convoy in Gaza, killing seven aid workers from the U.S.-based World Central Kitchen organization. 'When it comes to the World Central Kitchen strike we made clear that they need to change their deconfliction measures and worked with the UN to get new deconfliction measures in place. Now, those aren’t perfect. We continue to see strikes that result in the death of humanitarian workers; continue to see strikes in Gaza that lead to the tragic, tragic deaths of civilians.' Gaza 'is a very difficult place in which to conduct a military campaign because you have a terrorist organization that embeds itself and hides itself behind civilians, which is why it’s the United States that is at the forefront of pushing for a ceasefire. And when it comes to actions in the West Bank, it’s the – why it’s the United States that’s pushing for changes to the – to Israeli rules of engagement.'

Return of displaced northerners officially declared a war goal	Netanyahu tells U.S. official that while Israel appreciates American support, it will 'do what is necessary' to safeguard citizens, security of the state. By World Israel News Staff Israel appeared to take an additional step towards launching an intensive military campaign against Hezbollah, as the national security cabinet announced that the return of evacuated residents of the north as an official goal for the ongoing war. Following the October 7th terror onslaught, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defined the aims of the war as returning all of the hostages kidnapped by Hamas, dismantling Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and ensuring that the terror group never again poses a security threat to the Jewish State. Ensuring the safe return of those forced from their homes near the border with Lebanon has now been added to the list of war objectives, as Israeli officials signal that the IDF is preparing for a large-scale offensive against Hezbollah. Since October 8th, Hezbollah has launched near-daily salvos on northern Israeli communities and military assets. The barrages of rockets, missiles, and explosive drones forced the evacuation of at least 60,000 Israelis from their homes adjacent to the Lebanese border. Tens of thousands of northerners, who were not displaced, have been living under the constant threat of Hezbollah aggression for almost a year. The U.S. has been intensely pressuring Israel to hold off on the campaign until after the November presidential elections, according to Hebrew-language media reports. However, it's unclear if Israel will abide by that timeline. The Biden administration's special envoy to the Middle East, Amos Hochstein, traveled to Israel on Monday and met with several Israeli officials, including Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, in what appeared to be a last-ditch effort to persuade Israel to avoid decisive military action. 'The Prime Minister made it very clear that it will not be possible to return our residents without a fundamental change in the security situation in the north,' read a summary of the meeting published by the premier's office. 'Prime Minister Netanyahu said that while Israel appreciates and respects the support of the U.S., it will – ultimately – do what is necessary to safeguard its security and return the residents of the north securely to their homes.'

Netanyahu to address UN amid rising Middle East tensions	Netanyahu’s speech is expected to touch on the Abraham Accords and prospects for further peace deals, possibly hinting at progress with Saudi Arabia. By Jewish Breaking News Amid heightened tensions in the Middle East, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will address the United Nations General Assembly next week. He will depart for New York next Tuesday to meet with world leaders on the sidelines of the assembly followed by his address on Friday afternoon. Netanyahu’s 11th appearance at the UN comes as the Palestinian Authority is pushing for sweeping measures against Israel, including calls for an arms embargo and sanctions. A draft resolution circulated by the PA urges Israel to withdraw from Judea and Samaria within six months and calls for the removal of approximately 500,000 Israeli citizens living in these territories. In response, Foreign Minister Israel Katz has instructed his team to prepare retaliatory measures if the PA violates the Oslo Accords. These reportedly range from freezing funds to cutting security ties with Ramallah. While the exact content of Netanyahu’s speech remains to be seen, it’s likely to cover several key areas. Besides outlining Israel’s historical right to Judea and Samaria, the Prime Minister will likely provide updates on Israel’s humanitarian efforts in Gaza as well as its efforts in dismantling Iran’s regional terror proxies. As in previous years, Netanyahu’s speech is expected to touch on the Abraham Accords and prospects for further peace deals, possibly hinting at progress with Saudi Arabia. Israeli technological innovations in fields like water conservation, agriculture, and medicine are expected to be highlighted as well.

War in Gaza fuels surge in psychiatric drug prescriptions	Southern Israeli communities experienced a 33% increase in antidepressant use and a 25% rise in sleeping pill consumption. By Jewish Breaking News A concerning new study highlights a significant increase in psychiatric drug use in Israel since the start of the war in Gaza. Presented at the Israeli Society for Quality in Medicine’s annual meeting in Tel Aviv on Sunday, the research from the Meir Medical Center reveals a 50% increase in anti-anxiety medication purchases and a tripling of narcotic pain reliever acquisitions among the general population. Among the southern Israeli communities hit the hardest on October 7 by Hamas’ brutal massacre, the crisis is even more pronounced with a 200% increase in anti-anxiety drug purchases and a 250% rise in narcotic pain reliever use. These areas also experienced a 33% increase in antidepressant use and a 25% rise in sleeping pill consumption. Research leader Dr. Hornik-Lurie of Meir warns that urgent action is needed to prevent addiction, especially among high-risk groups. 'The risk factors for the consumption of all four families of drugs after October 7th are older age, living in the Gaza Envelope on October 7th, living in a peripheral area, and being female,'she explains. 'We observed an alarming increase in the consumption of anti-anxiety drugs and a spike in the use of narcotic pain relievers after the outbreak of the war. We suggest conducting further studies that will examine the long-term effects of the war on the entire population and the residents of the surrounding area, in particular.'

US trade with Iran jumped last year as Tehran wreaked havoc acros...	The United States has repeatedly bypassed sanctions to help Iran access upwards of $100 billion in cash resources, money that lawmakers say is fueling Tehran’s aggression in the Middle East. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon American trade with Iran jumped 43 percent last year, reaching more than $81 million at a time when Tehran’s hardline regime ramped up its terrorist efforts and wreaked havoc across the Middle East, according to a non-public State Department report provided to Congress and reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon. The significant jump in trade relations suggests the Biden-Harris administration is bypassing tough American sanctions on Tehran in order to stimulate its flagging economy and provide the hardline regime with a financial lifeline. The United States imported $22.3 million in goods from Iran in 2023 and exported $59 million, accounting for $81.3 million in total trade between the countries, according to the State Department report, which was submitted to Congress earlier this week. Overall trade between the United States and Iran rose by more than $24 million from 2022 to 2023, marking a 43 percent increase, according to figures published in the report. At the same time, Iranian trade with China, one of its closest allies, fell by 7 percent over the same period, indicating the Biden-Harris administration is picking up some of the slack. The report also omitted statistics on Russia’s trade with Iran, with the State Department saying these figures could not be produced. The report, which is unclassified but not disseminated publicly, is driving concerns on Capitol Hill, with GOP critics seeing it as further evidence of the Biden-Harris administration’s bid to boost diplomacy with Tehran as it wages a multi-front war on Israel. The United States has repeatedly bypassed sanctions to help Iran access upwards of $100 billion in cash resources, money that lawmakers say is fueling Tehran’s aggression in the Middle East, including Iran-backed terror group Hamas's Oct. 7 attack on the Jewish state. 'It’s no surprise that the Iranian regime was able to engage and pay for increased trade with the U.S., and to bolster their economy more broadly,' Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told the Free Beacon. 'Indeed, regime outlets have been bragging that trade with the U.S. has doubled again in the first quarter of 2024. Iran then uses their financial and economic strength to conduct terrorism around the world, including terrorism directly targeting Americans.' U.S. trade with Iran primarily consists of 'agricultural goods, medicine, and medical devices,' according to a footnote in the State Department’s report. These exports are facilitated through licenses granted under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, which eased trade restrictions on humanitarian goods. Imports from Iran are allowed by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which has the power to waive certain sanctions for national security reasons. The State Department declined to comment on its findings and would not provide further information about the nature of U.S. trade with Iran, including exactly what goods are being exchanged. A State Department official directed the Free Beacon to the U.S. Trade Representative’s office, but they did not respond to a request for comment with similar questions. In addition to the United States, Iranian trade with the United Kingdom jumped by 66 percent from 2022 to 2023. This includes $116 million in imports from Iran and $76 million in exports, according to the report, which does not detail exactly what goods are being exchanged. 'Since the last reporting period,' the State Department wrote, 'overall G20 trade with Iran decreased 14 percent, representing a $5 billion decrease.' The increase in trade between the United States and United Kingdom appeared to be an outlier from the overall trend in 2023. Additionally, 'Saudi Arabia nearly quadrupled its trade with Iran from $5 million to $24.8 million,' indicating the historically chilly relationship between the two regional powers is thawing in some respects. While Iran’s trade with China fell slightly from 2022 to 2023, it still 'makes up 48 percent of Iran’s trade with the G20,' according to the report. Republicans such as Cruz say the findings suggest the United States is easing its trade embargo on Iran. 'The Biden-Harris administration has done everything they can to flood the Ayatollah with cash and facilitate the regime’s ability to finance terrorism,' the senator said. 'They’ve refused to enforce sanctions, waived other sanctions, and worked with banks around the world to free up and transfer Iranian assets.' Iran’s oil revenues, a key source of cash for the regime, have topped more than $90 billion since the Biden-Harris administration came to power and began easing sanctions on Tehran’s energy sector. The administration has also repeatedly issued a sanctions waiver that permits Iraq to pay Iran for electricity imports representing around $10 billion for the regime. It is believed this cash helps Tehran finance its regional terror proxies, including Hamas and Hezbollah, which are both still waging war on Israel.

Germany not barring arms sales to Israel, says lawmaker	Member of German parliament denies report claiming Berlin has imposed de facto arms embargo on Israel. By World Israel News Staff A recent report accusing the German government of imposing a de facto arms embargo on Israel was false, a member of the German national parliament claimed Monday. Over the weekend, Germany's Bilt newspaper reported that Berlin has consistently refused to permit weapons sales to Israel, or responded to requests for arms export permits with indefinite delays, effectively blocking new weapons sales to the Jewish state. For instance, an IDF request for an export permit enabling it to purchase thousands of tank shells has simply been ignored by Berlin thus far, the report claimed. 'The growing concerns are the reason why fewer approvals are being granted, even if no one wants to say it out loud,' an official working fora representative on the German Federal Security Council told Profil Magazine. As a result, weapons sales to Israel have plummeted this year, dropping from 300 million Euros in 2023 to just 14 million in 2024. A conservative lawmaker in the German Bundestag, however, denied the report, telling Israel Hayom that after looking into the report's claims, he found no evidence of a deliberate effort to prevent arms sales to Israel. 'After consulting with my office, we have no knowledge of any companies being denied security export licenses to Israel,' Klaus-Peter Willsch, a member of the center-right Christian Democratic Union said during a trip to Israel Monday. Willsch said he backed arms sales to Israel, comparing support for Israel against Hamas to Germany's support for Ukraine in its ongoing war against Russia. 'I endorse exports to Israel, just as I support exports to Ukraine. Both hold significant importance.'

Netanyahu poised to fire Defense Minister Gallant and replace him...	Sources close to the prime minister say he is on the verge of firing Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and is preparing to bring in a party from the Opposition to bolster his government. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is poised to dismiss Defense Minister Yoav Gallant (Likud) from his government, and bring in a party from the Opposition to bolster the Coalition, Kan Hadashot reported Monday. Citing an official in the Prime Minister's Office, the report claimed that Netanyahu is prepared to fire Gallant 'within a short time,' as talks progress between the ruling Likud party and the New Hope. Members of Netanyahu's inner circle are reportedly nearing an agreement with New Hope chief and former Justice Minister Gideon Sa'ar to bring the four-MK faction into the government, expanding its narrow majority. Sa'ar, a former member of the Likud and longtime rival of Netanyahu, bolted the Likud in 2020 to form the New Hope party, which later formed an alliance with Benny Gantz's Blue and White party. The talks, which reportedly continued through the night from Sunday to Monday, are being brokered by Justice Minister Yariv Levin (Likud), a figure relied upon by both Sa'ar and Netanyahu. The inclusion of the New Hope faction in the government would better position Netanyahu to pass a new proposed draft law, reinstating draft deferments for full-time yeshiva students over the objections of Gallant and several other Likud faction members. Netanyahu is under growing pressure to pass the bill, mollifying his ultra-Orthodox allies Shas and United Torah Judaism, and potentially ending a political crisis caused by the Supreme Court's striking down of the previous draft law in 2017. On June 25th, the Supreme Court handed down a precedent-setting ruling ordering the army to immediately draft 3,000 ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students who had hitherto benefited from the long-running draft deferment policy, which has offered annual exemptions to full-time yeshiva students. After multiple extensions of the 2015 law, which was struck down by the court in 2017, Supreme Court justices ruled unanimously that the no more extensions would be granted and that the government must work with the military to draft thousands of ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students and end social benefits to families of those who refuse to appear at draft centers. Ultra-Orthodox lawmakers have demanded the government pass a new law largely restoring the status quo ante, while Defense Minister Gallant and several other Likud members have called for major changes to the draft deferment system. Over the past few weeks, Shas and UTJ have threatened to topple the government if the issue is not addressed. Netanyahu is also reportedly frustrated with Gallant's handling of the war in Gaza and the ongoing conflict on Israel's northern border. The prime minister, according to sources close to Netanyahu cited in a report by Kan Hadashot, clashed repeatedly behind closed doors recently with Gallant, accusing him of not taking decisive action against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. 'If Gallant tries to block a [major military] operation, he will be replaced,' Netanyahu's confidants were quoted as saying. Sa'ar is reportedly seeking the Defense Ministry portfolio, though Netanyahu is said to be trying to retain the Defense portfolio for the Likud, and offer instead the Foreign Ministry portfolio, currently held by Israel Katz (Likud). Talks between the Likud and the New Hope reportedly include proposals to also offer a ministerial position to former minister Ze'ev Elkin, another former member of the Likud.

Palestinians pay $800 for ‘donated’ tents: How Hamas uses humanit...	Hamas’s methods for maintaining control over aid distribution are reported to include severe punitive measures against those who attempt to bypass their control. By Baruch Yedid, TPS Despite Gaza’s widespread devastation, Hamas continues paying salaries to its gunmen and civil servants partly through taxing and diverting humanitarian aid and distributing food vouchers — with the help of clans, criminal groups and so-called 'People’s Committees.' An Israeli security official told The Press Service of Israel, 'Hamas’ governance situation in the northern Gaza Strip is suffering from progressive necrosis,' adding that humanitarian aid appears to be 'intensive treatment' for the terror group. This perspective highlights the complexity of the situation in Gaza, where aid intended to alleviate the suffering of civilians is instead helping to sustain Hamas’s grip on power. Last week, Hamas managed to pay full salaries to its fighters and partial salaries to thousands of its 27,000 civil servants, TPS-IL has learned. This was done despite the heavy financial burden it places on the terror group, highlighting its determination to maintain its grip on Gaza. However, the continued financing of its war with Israel has raised concerns about the sources of this funding. Reports indicate that Hamas uses a variety of methods to gather revenue, including the imposition of 'transit taxes' on aid trucks carrying food, water, medicine, tents, blankets, and other goods into the Strip. According to testimonies, Hamas operatives in civilian clothes set up surprise checkpoints along key routes leading from the border crossings into Gaza. At these roadblocks, truck drivers are forced to pay hefty sums ranging from 50,000-100,000 shekels ($13,400-$27,000) or relinquish up to 50 percent of their cargo’s contents. In one reported instance, Hamas members seized 200 gas cylinders from a single truck, leaving only a small number behind — a profit of tens of thousands of dollars for the terror group. Charging $800 for ‘Donated’ Tents Beyond direct taxation, Hamas has been accused of confiscating humanitarian aid. Testimonies reveal that Hamas operates through a network of local clans and gangs that control main roads and intercept aid shipments. They then transfer this aid to Hamas warehouses, essentially creating a parallel economy. In return for their cooperation, these gangs receive monthly payments, reportedly around $10,000, ensuring a steady flow of goods to Hamas-controlled areas, including its tunnel network. This diversion extends to shelter and food aid as well. Tents sent from Arab countries intended to provide shelter for displaced Palestinians are reportedly being sold by Hamas at a cost of around 3,000 shekels ($800) per family. Food supplies, which include essentials delivered by trucks from various international donors, are looted and sold at inflated prices, sometimes 20 to 30 times their original cost. One report mentions that the price of a pack of cigarettes has soared to an astonishing $1,200. Hamas distributes food vouchers and coupons primarily through mosques under its supervision. According to several accounts, these distributions are carefully managed to benefit Hamas loyalists and their families. To enforce this system, Hamas deploys secret police units in shelters for displaced persons, ensuring that food and aid supplies are not accessed by unauthorized individuals. Hamas’s methods for maintaining control over aid distribution are reported to include severe punitive measures against those who attempt to bypass their control. Witnesses recount incidents in which residents caught with stolen goods were either killed or publicly humiliated. For incident, Hamas hung a resident of the Nuseirat refugee camp for allegedly stealing food. In another layer of control over humanitarian aid, Hamas receives support from organizations known as the 'People’s Committees' or the 'Emergency Committees.' These groups, comprising local clans, have agreements with Hamas allowing them to keep a portion of the aid arriving in Gaza while transferring the rest to Hamas. 'We didn’t know from the beginning to what extent the treatment of the humanitarian issue is a decisive element in the management of the war,' a senior Israeli political official told TPS-IL. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Hamas, Houthis open offices in Baghdad	Thomas Juneau, a professor of international relations at the University of Ottawa, told the Times that Iran wants its proxies to coordinate more closely. By JNS Hamas and the Houthis have recently established offices in Iraq. The offices, which opened in June, testify to Iraq’s shift towards the Iranian camp in Tehran’s conflict with Israel and the United States. Since the U.S. military invasion to remove Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein 21 years ago, the country has maintained an 'uneasy balance' between its Iranian neighbor and America, The New York Times reported on Sunday. That balance has increasingly turned in Iran’s favor as Tehran has funded sympathetic forces inside Iraq as part of its effort to build an unbroken arc of Shi’ite power stretching west to Lebanon and south to Yemen. The Hamas representative in Baghdad is Mohammed al-Hafi, a member of the terrorist group’s bureau for Arab and Islamic Relations. The Houthi representative in Iraq is Abu Idris al-Sharafi. He has received an especially warm reception in Iraq, the Times said. The two offices are a concrete indication of the transformation of Iraqi politics since Hussein’s ouster. He suppressed Islamic movements, whether Sunni or Shi’ite, viewing them as a threat to his power. Shi’ites were exiled, imprisoned or executed. Today, Shi’ite parties dominate Iraqi politics, and Iran has pushed Iraq’s government to recognize Shi’ite militias. (The Hamas representative’s security detail is provided by one such militia, Kata’ib Hezbollah, the Times noted.) Shi’ite forces have formed political parties, gaining enough seats in the 2021 election to select the prime minister. Faced with the Shi’ite’s rise, Iraq’s leadership could do little but agree when Hamas and the Houthis requested to open offices. 'Some Iraqi government officials, according to two of the people who spoke to The New York Times, say privately they are not thrilled about their new guests but did not have the power to block them given the sway of the Iraqi political parties with ties to Iran,' the paper reported. Officially, Iraq has denied a move towards Iran. Thomas Juneau, a professor of international relations at the University of Ottawa, told the Times that Iran wants its proxies to coordinate more closely. There is 'a growing institutionalization of relations between Iran’s partners in the Axis of Resistance,' he said. Tehran has created a joint operation room and held regular meetings to bring proxy leaders together. 'Iran has appeared to encourage its proxies from different countries to share military skills and even coordinate on targets,' the Times reported. These efforts have 'intensified' since Oct. 7, Juneau said. Rashid al-Azzawi, chairman of the Iraqi Islamic Party, a Sunni Islamist party, said the war in Gaza has won sympathy for Hamas from Iraqis across all religions. Hamas is seen as fighting for 'a humanitarian cause,' he stated.

Israel ‘preparing for long war’ with Hezbollah – Report	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signaling that Israel is ready for a large-scale confrontation with the Lebanon-based terror group. By World Israel News Staff As the chances of a ceasefire with the Hamas terror group in Gaza continue to fade, Israel is viewing an all-out war with Hezbollah as inevitable and is taking steps to prepare, according to Hebrew-language media reports. An anonymous security official told Channel 12 News on Friday that Israel 'should gear up for a long war' on the northern front. During a security cabinet meeting last Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly said Israel would soon need to engage in a 'large-scale confrontation' with Hezbollah. He expressed pessimism over the likelihood that Hezbollah's near-daily bombardments of communities and military assets in northern Israel could be stopped via a diplomatic agreement. Over the past 11 months, Hezbollah has caused at least 1 billion shekels in damages to homes in border areas, as well as forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of Israelis who lived near the Lebanese border. Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant were said to have disagreed over the impact of a war with Hezbollah on Gaza. Gallant warned that a war in the north would necessitate the withdrawal of troops from the Gaza Strip in favor of placing them in Lebanon, which would reduce pressure on the Hamas terror group. The premier disagreed, saying he believed a simultaneous war in Lebanon would have little effect on Gaza, Channel 13 News reported. Netanyahu also pushed for the security cabinet to add the return of northern residents as an official goal of the ongoing war - a move that would signal Israel's intention to launch a decisive military campaign against Hezbollah, rather than continue the tit-for-tat attacks that have so far defined the conflict. Ynet reported that Netanyahu will travel to New York in late September in order to address the UN General Assembly, using the visit to drum up international support for an Israeli offensive against Hezbollah. Washington is reportedly pressuring Israel to delay attack plans until after the November 5th presidential election, but it's unclear if Israel will abide by that timeline.

Hamas chief Sinwar thanks Hezbollah leader for ‘your blessed acti...	Sinwar also thanked Nasrallah for expressing condolences for the death of Ismail Haniyeh. By The Algemeiner and Reuters Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar thanked the leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah for his group’s support in the conflict with Israel, Hezbollah said on Friday, in the first reported message since Sinwar became Hamas’s overall leader in August. The Iran-backed Hezbollah has been waging attacks on Israel for nearly a year in a conflict across the Lebanese-Israeli border that has been taking place in parallel to the Gaza war. Hezbollah says its attacks aim to support the Palestinians. 'Your blessed actions have expressed your solidarity on the fronts of the Axis of Resistance, supporting and engaging in the battle,' Sinwar told Nasrallah, according to Hezbollah‘s al-Manar broadcaster. Sinwar has not appeared in public since the Oct. 7 attacks, and is widely thought to be running the war from tunnels beneath Gaza. It was the second time this week he is reported to have sent a letter. Hamas said on Tuesday he had sent one congratulating Algerian President Abdulmadjid Tebboune on his re-election. Hezbollah is the most powerful faction in an alliance of Iran-backed groups known as the Axis of Resistance, which have also entered the fray with attacks from Yemen and Iraq in support of Hamas during the Gaza war. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are internationally designated terrorist groups which receive funding, weapons, and training from Iran. Hezbollah has pummeled northern Israeli communities almost daily with barrages of drones, rockets, and missiles from southern Lebanon, where it wields significant political and military influence, since the start of the Gaza war between Israel and Hamas in October. About 80,000 Israelis have been forced to evacuate Israel’s north during that time due to the unrelenting attacks. Most of them have spent the past 11 months living displaced in hotels in other areas of he country. Nonetheless, in the early days of the Gaza conflict, former Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal hinted at frustration over the scale of Hezbollah‘s intervention, thanking the group but saying 'the battle requires more.' Over the last year, Israel has killed around 500 Hezbollah fighters, including its top military commander Fuad Shukr. The toll is greater than Hezbollah‘s losses in its 2006 war with Israel. Hezbollah has said it had no advance knowledge of the Oct. 7 attack, which Sinwar masterminded. Sinwar also thanked Nasrallah for a letter he sent expressing condolences for the death of Ismail Haniyeh, the former Hamas leader killed in Tehran in July in an assassination widely believed to have been carried out by Israel. The hostilities across the Lebanese-Israeli border have forced tens of thousands of people to leave both sides of the frontier. The risk of escalation has loomed large. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Tuesday that Israeli forces are near to fulfilling their mission in Gaza and their focus will turn to the Lebanon border. Israeli leaders have said they would prefer to resolve the conflict through an agreement that would push Hezbollah away from the border. Hezbollah has said that it will continue fighting as long as the Gaza war continues.

Gal Gadot joins Israeli President Herzog’s ‘Voice of the People’ ...	The virtual event on Sunday will feature a live conversation between Herzog and Gadot, who will talk about Jewish pride and perseverance. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Israeli actress Gal Gadot will take part in a virtual event on Sunday that will mark the launch of Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s global initiative 'Voice of the People.' The initiative is a global Jewish council that aims to build 'a stronger, resilient Jewish community that will inspire and impact future generations.' It hopes to unite Jews from around the world and have them work together on addressing challenges affecting Jewish people worldwide. Herzog announced the initiative in August, and it is being lead by The President’s House as well as the World Zionist Organization, the Jewish Agency for Israel, and philanthropic supporters. The virtual event on Sunday will feature a live conversation between Herzog and Gadot, who will talk about Jewish pride and perseverance, according to Jewish News. The online event will also include a conversation between journalist Tamar Ish-Shalom and Daniel Lifshitz, who is the grandson of released Hamas hostage Yocheved Lifshitz, and Oded Lifshitz, who has remained in Hamas captivity since Oct. 7. There will also be a musical performance by Michal Greenglick, the sister of the late IDF soldier Shaul Greenglick. He was killed fighting Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip in December 2023 mere weeks after auditioning for the Israeli television singing competition 'The Next Star.' 'Our Jewish culture is one that celebrates the living vitality of discourse,' said Herzog. 'It is our responsibility to deepen the conversation between us — to come together and have honest discussions about vital issues facing the Jewish people. To develop the next generation of committed Jewish leaders, who will bring their gifts and their talents to preserving our precious peoplehood.' The 'Voice of the People' initiative has 150 members — 50 from Israel, 50 from the United States and Canada, and 50 from around the world. The members are selected for a two-year term. The initiative also has 10 fellows as well as appointed mentors.

European airlines resume operations to Israel	With Iran’s imminent threat of retaliation for the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh not materializing, a growing list of international carriers have steadily been returning to Israel. By Jewish Breaking News Virgin Atlantic has announced it will restart its service to Tel Aviv just ahead of the High Holidays. The British carrier will initially operate one daily flight between London Heathrow and Tel Aviv beginning on September 25, down from its pre-Oct. 7 schedule of two daily flights. Bookings are now available on the airline’s website, with connection options to destinations in the United States. Virgin Atlantic plans to utilize larger aircraft on this route compared to its competitor British Airways, which currently employs narrow-body Airbus A321 planes for its Tel Aviv service. To address ongoing security concerns, the airline will implement a brief stop in Cyprus for crew changes. Passengers will remain on the aircraft during this stopover. However, the return leg will operate as a non-stop flight from Tel Aviv to London. With Iran’s imminent threat of retaliation for the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh not materializing, a growing list of international carriers have steadily been returning to Israel. Lufthansa Group recently restarted operations to Israel after a month-long hiatus. The group, which includes Lufthansa Airlines, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Swiss, and Eurowings, will operate between six Western European destinations and Tel Aviv. Other airlines that have resumed service include Ethiopian Airlines, Wizz Air, Bulgaria Air, Aegean, Air Europe, Iberia, Tarom, and LOT Polish Airlines. However, some European carriers still remain cautious. Ryanair has announced it will not resume flights to Israel until at least the end of October. The return of international flights is seen as a positive step for Israel’s tourism industry, which has been severely impacted by the ongoing war against Hamas. Financial experts estimate the war’s economic impact at 198 billion shekels ($53 billion), with reduced growth forecasts for the remainder of 2024. As more airlines return to the market, competition on popular routes is expected to increase. Currently, El Al holds a monopoly on direct flights between Tel Aviv and New York, with high demand leading to premium fares for return tickets during the holiday season. Travelers are advised to check the latest travel advisories and entry requirements before booking flights to Israel as the security situation remains unstable.

Israeli tech thrives despite conflict, raises $7.8B in private fu...	The report also noted that private funding trends in Israel and the US 'closely mirrored' each other, with both ecosystems experiencing similar declines after October 2023. By Noah Michaeli, TPS While certain sectors of the Israeli economy have suffered small declines over the past year of war, the country’s tech ecosystem remains strong and continues to develop, according to a report released on Thursday. 'If you look at indicators of health in the different sectors, it’s a story of resilience,' Avi Hasson, CEO of StartUp Nation Central told The Press Service of Israel. Startup Nation Central, which released the report, is a Tel Aviv-based non-profit that promotes Israeli startups and innovation. 'The money raised this year is similar to previous years and mirrors the trend of what we’re seeing in the US,' he explained. 'One would expect that with all the extra load, due to the war, we would see an underperformance. But we haven’t.' The report details the impact of the attack and subsequent war on Israel’s tech ecosystem. According to the report, despite the ongoing war and global funding challenges, Israel’s tech sector raised $7.8 billion across 577 private funding rounds — a small 4% decline from the $8.2 billion recorded in the same period last year. 'This resilience indicates the continued confidence of investors in the long-term potential of Israel’s innovation landscape,' the report said. Meanwhile, mergers and acquisitions reached $9.6 billion across 73 deals, slightly down from $10.6 billion the previous year. The business software and cybersecurity sectors led this activity, with notable exits such as WalkMe’s acquisition by SAP and Run’s acquisition by Nvidia. The report also noted that private funding trends in Israel and the US 'closely mirrored' each other, with both ecosystems experiencing similar declines after October 2023. 'Israel’s funding levels initially dropped to 66% by February 2024, while the U.S. saw a more moderate decline to 87%. Both ecosystems rebounded by May, with Israel recovering to 152% and the U.S. to 158% of their October levels,' the report said. Another finding of the report related to business continuity. 'The conflict has forced 24% of companies to relocate some of their operations, and 44% reported shortages in human capital. Despite these challenges, 54% of companies remain confident in their ability to grow in the coming year, particularly in the cybersecurity and business software sectors, the report said. All About Demand Hasson told TPS-IL that one of primary reasons Israeli hi-tech has not suffered despite the difficulties is demand. 'Unlike tourism, the demand for Israeli hi-tech didn’t go down due to the war. As long as you can deliver, you’re ok,' Hasson explained. He noted that 90% of Israeli hi-tech is software, not physical hardware produced in a factory, meaning that disruptions from the war are less important. He added that the vast majority of Israeli hi-tech is not in the north or south, the hardest-hit regions of the country. One trend that the report does note, however, is that due to rising uncertainty, investors are now tending to go to the lower-risk sectors and are therefore risk averse to earlier-stage startups. 'Much more attention is now on mega rounds, on later-stage companies, than there was before,' he explained adding that while it may be getting harder to be a beginning-stage business, this is a global trend. While there is an increasing desire to avoid risk, for some sectors, this is not necessarily a negative development. Hasson cited an emergence of many companies and VC startups in the defense sector, while companies focusing on rehabilitation and mental health are also doing well. While acknowledging that there is definitely nervousness on the part of investors, Hasson is highly optimistic. 'What we’re seeing is simply a reflection of the fact that what Israel can offer the world is unique,' Hasson said.

Canada blocks $60 million arms sale to Israel	In 2022 alone, Canada exported $21 million worth of military equipment to Israel. By Jewish Breaking News Canada has announced the immediate suspension of 30 arms shipments to Israel, citing concerns over alleged ‘genocide’ in Gaza. 'Our policy is clear: We will not have any form of arms or parts of arms be sent to Gaza. Period,' Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said at the Liberal caucus retreat in Nanaimo, B.C. 'How they’re being sent and where they’re being sent is irrelevant.' The suspension extends beyond just Canadian companies. A Quebec-based subsidiary of Virginia’s General Dynamics had been tapped to produce explosive mortar cartridges for Israel in a $61.1 million deal orchestrated by the US government last month. This means, not only will Israel not be receiving these vital pieces of ammunition to defend herself from annihilation, all permits approved before January 8 when Canada initially announced a halt on arms sales to Israel, will now be reviewed. Up until Tuesday’s announcement, Canada had an estimated maximum of $136 million in approved Israeli military permits. In fact, Israel has historically been one of the top recipients of Canadian arms exports. In 2022 alone, Canada exported $21 million worth of military equipment to Israel. According to CBC News, the National Council of Canadian Muslims is behind the grassroots movement to leave the Jewish State defenseless, claiming Israel has a ‘well-documented pattern of human-rights violations’ in Gaza and Judea and Samaria. 'Over the last few weeks alone, Israel attacked at least seven schools. They add to the long list of schools, hospitals, refugee camps, and places of worship hit since October, many of these crowded with displaced civilians sheltering from the violence,' a joint letter by the Arab lobbying organization reads. 'Canada is prohibited from exporting arms if those transfers would be used to commit serious crimes under international law, including disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks.'

Israel to bar Al Jazeera reporters	After shutting down Al Jazeera operations in Israel, the Israeli government announces plans to withdraw press credentials for reporters working on behalf of the Qatar-based media outlet. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli government is set to ban journalists working for the Qatar-based media outlet Al Jazeera from operating inside of Israel, the Government Press Office announced Thursday afternoon. In a statement, the GPO said that press credentials would not be issued to Al Jazeera reporters and presenters, and that all previously issued journalist passes would be nullified. 'The Government Press Office is revoking the GPO cards of Al Jazeera journalists working in Israel, following the unanimous government decision in May to shut down the channel in Israel and prohibit its broadcasts.' Government Press Office Director Nitzan Chen defended the decision, calling Al Jazeera a 'threat' to Israeli soldiers. 'This is a media outlet that disseminates false content, which includes incitement against Israelis and Jews and constitutes a threat to IDF soldiers,' said Chen. 'Therefore, the use of GPO cards in the course of the journalists' work could in itself jeopardize state security at this time of military emergency.' The revocation of GPO cards will be subject to a hearing and will include Al Jazeera journalists and broadcasters in both Hebrew and Arabic, but will not include the channel's producers and photographers. The revocation will be valid for as long as the Knesset legislation and the temporary order are in force. In April, the Knesset passed legislation enabling the Communications Minister to temporarily shut down media outlets during wartime should they be deemed a threat to national security. A month later, Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi announced plans to shutter Al Jazeera and revoke the agency’s press credentials. Since then, the government has moved to draft legislation that would, if passed, enable the permanent banning of Al Jazeera.

Israel barring Palestinian Authority chief from Gaza – report	Egypt reportedly gives green light to Mahmoud Abbas to visit Gaza Strip - so long as Israel approves his entry, which Jerusalem has thus far refused to do. By World Israel News Staff Israel is barring the chairman of the Palestinian Authority from visiting the Gaza Strip - part of a bid by the P.A. to bolster its standing in the coastal enclave as a prelude to restoring control over the area - Kan Reshet Bet reported Tuesday morning. According to the report, the Palestinian Authority has sought the assistance of Egypt in securing P.A. chairman Mahmoud Abbas' entry into the Gaza Strip via the Rafah Crossing on the Sinai-Gaza border. Citing a foreign Arab diplomat, the P.A. also reached out to Israel to facilitate Abbas' visit. Egypt reportedly responded to the Palestinian Authority's request by expressing a willingness to cooperate, on condition that Israel approves the P.A. chief's visit. Cairo also said that it would be willing to open the Rafah Crossing, which has been closed with few exceptions since the war began on October 7th, to enable Abbas and his entourage to enter from the Egyptian border. The Egyptian government reportedly backs Abbas' visit as part of its overall policy of backing the Palestinian Authority's bid to restore its control over the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian Authority governed most of the Gaza Strip from the P.A.'s formation in 1994, and ruled over all of Gaza from Israel's withdrawal in 2005 until 2007, when Hamas seized control of the Strip. Following the Hamas invasion of Israel on October 7th, the P.A. has demanded that Israel return control over Gaza to it. The Biden administration has endorsed the P.A.'s position; on condition Ramallah undertakes significant political reforms. Egypt has protested Israel's plans to retain control over the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border, including the Rafah area, even after the current war.

Iran vows ‘nightmare’ attack on Israel	Israel is 'shaking' in fear of Iran's expected vengeance for the Ismail Haniyeh assassination, said IRGC head Hossein Salami. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Iran continued its war of words with Israel Sunday, with a top military commander threatening a 'nightmare' attack on the Jewish state, Al-Arabiya reported Monday. At a meeting in Yasuj, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander Hossein Salami claimed that Israel’s leaders and people are frightened of Iran’s promised vengeance for Hamas political head Ismail Haniyeh being assassinated in July in the heart of a well-guarded compound in Tehran by an explosive planted in his bedroom. The success greatly embarrassed the Islamic Republic and it immediately blamed Israel, although Jerusalem never took public credit for the assassination of one of its key enemies. 'The nightmare of Iran's inevitable response is shaking Israel day and night,' Salami said. Warning that Iran’s response will be 'painful and different' than expected, he added, 'The usurping Zionist regime and its allies should not think that they will be struck and run away. Rather, they should realize that they will be struck and will not be able to run away. They will receive great lessons and learn not to play with the lion's tail.' Iran’s leaders have threatened vengeance many times since Haniyeh was eliminated, although they have been careful to state that it would come at a time of their own choosing. When attempting to avenge the IAF elimination of several of its top military men in Damascus in early April, the mullahs launched more than 300 missiles at Israel less than two weeks later. Almost none of them got through an aerial defense that included the militaries of the U.S., Great Britain, France and Jordan as well as Israel. Practically no damage was caused by the few that landed, and there was only one injury, of a young girl who recovered after a few months in the hospital. One possible scenario could be that Iran unleashes its top terror proxy, Hezbollah in Lebanon, to go all out against the Jewish state. So far, the Shiite terrorists have launched over 7,000 rockets, missiles, UAVs and other airborne projectiles over the border to support Hamas in its war with Israel, forcing the evacuation of some 60,000 Israelis from border communities. However, Hezbollah was also prepared to fire over a thousand rockets at once some two weeks ago, in what was seen as a possible Iranian-ordered revenge attack, but the IDF destroyed all the launchers in a pre-emptive strike. Still, it is believed to have some 140,000 rockets left in its arsenal, and many more trained fighters than Hamas. Israel has been on high alert in the north since the beginning of the war, keeping a substantial number of troops there and sending its air force to strike innumerable Hezbollah targets in Lebanon almost daily in response to the terrorists’ launches. There are many voices in Israel calling for an all-out attack on Hezbollah because it is untenable that the terrorists have succeeded in shutting down a whole area of the country for almost a year. The U.S. is trying to defuse the situation by using diplomatic means, believing that all-out war in the north could turn the conflict into a regional one and be 'catastrophic.'

Iran ‘certain’ to take revenge on Israel for Haniyeh killing, sen...	No doubt about it,' says deputy chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps: 'Revenge is certain.' By World Israel News Staff Iran is still planning a major retaliatory action in response to Israel's killing of a top Hamas terrorist in Tehran over a month ago, a senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officer said over the weekend. Speaking at a ceremony marking his promotion, Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Naqdi, the deputy commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said that despite more than a month passing since the assassination of Hamas politburo chief Ismail Haniyeh in a targeted killing attributed to Israel, Iran remains intent on avenging the late Islamist leader's death. 'Revenge is certain, and we have made it clear on multiple occasions,' Naqdi said. 'There is no doubt about it. The retaliation must happen at the right time to be effective.' Naqdi hinted that the planned retaliatory plot is already in motion, without providing details. During his address, Naqdi also condemned the U.S. over Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. 'The U.S. is complicit in the atrocities in Gaza,' Naqdi said. 'America is the only sponsor and supporter of these crimes, and they invite the prime minister of the child-killing Zionist regime to the American Congress, and for five minutes they clap and whistle for the child-killing prime minister of the Zionist regime and stand forty times.' Haniyeh was killed in an explosion in his vacation home in Tehran on July 31st, after he traveled to Iran ahead of the inauguration of President Masud Pezeshkian. Within hours of the killing, Iran threatened to avenge Haniyeh's assassination with attacks on Israel. However, in mid-August, senior Iranian officials hinted that an Iranian retaliation could be avoided should Israel and Hamas reach a ceasefire deal in talks brokered by Qatar and Egypt.
