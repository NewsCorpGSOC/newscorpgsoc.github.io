‘Nobody wants to die’ – Trump says Iran ‘very nervous,’ ready for...	President Trump blasts Obama's 2015 Iran nuclear agreement as 'the dumbest deal,' says Iran cannot be allowed to achieve a nuclear capacity, with only a new deal or Israeli airstrikes capable of preventing them from achieving it. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump warned that Iran must be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons either through a new deal to replace the 2015 nuclear agreement, or airstrikes on the country's atomic facilities. Speaking with Fox News on Monday night, the president said that while he preferred to resolve the issue via negotiations, he will not allow Tehran to acquire nuclear weapons. 'Everyone thinks Israel, with our help or our approval, will go in and bomb the hell out of [Iran],' Trump said. 'I would prefer that not happen. I'd much rather see a deal with Iran where we can do a deal, supervise, check it, inspect it, and then blow it up or just make sure that there's no more nuclear.' Trump went on to deride the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), signed by the Obama administration, as 'the dumbest deal.' 'By the way, that would have expired by now. That was a road to a nuclear weapon. It was a short-term deal,' Trump said of the JCPOA's sunset clause, under which certain restrictions would automatically end after 10 years. 'You can't make a deal with just a few years on it. That deal would be expired by now. Think of it. And they would have a legal right to have a nuclear weapon.' 'You cannot allow Iran, or just about anybody else, by the way, but especially Iran, because they are very militant. You can't allow them to have a nuclear weapon.' Trump claimed that Iran's leadership is 'very concerned' over Tehran's increasing isolation regionally and internationally, following Israeli airstrikes last year, the new sanctions imposed by the Trump White House and the loss of key allies over the past six months including the Assad regime, Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah, and Hamas' Yahya Sinwar. 'But there's two ways of stopping them, with bombs or with a written piece of paper. And I'd much rather do a deal that's a deal that's not going to hurt them.' 'I think that Iran is very concerned. I think that Iran is very frightened, to be honest with you, because their defense is pretty much gone.' 'They've had some very bad moments. The whole thing with the [Hezbollah] pagers was a disaster for them. The pagers, you know what I'm talking about.' 'It was a horrible thing, but it was, you know, it knocked out a lot of leadership like nobody's ever seen before. But I think Iran is very nervous. I think they're scared. I think Iran would love to make a deal, and I would love to make a deal with them without bombing them.'

Arab Israeli murder rate 3rd highest in developed word – Study	Arab Israelis face a murder rate rivaling that of Mexico and Colombia, with no signs of slowing down. By World Israel News Staff The murder rate among Arab Israelis is one of the worst in the developed world, with the number of killings per 100,000 people nearing that of Mexico, a recent study found. According to a study published by the Taub Center, a Jerusalem-based nonprofit organization focusing on Israeli societal issues, 233 Arab Israelis were murdered in 2023, the most recent year in which full data was available. Notably, the number of Jewish victims of homicide during that same year (those killed in criminal incidents, rather than terror attacks) was just 66, akin to the murder rate in Switzerland. 'Israeli Arabs, with a current rate of 11.1 homicides per 100,000 people and 43.9 homicides per 100,000 people aged 20‒34, climb to the 3rd highest position, far surpassing the U.S. and trailing only Mexico and Colombia,' wrote researchers from the Taub Center in the study. 'From a sociological perspective, this makes sense,' they added. 'A culture of violence tends to spread and become entrenched, as has happened among the Arab population in recent years, and violence tends to increase, especially during periods of instability in the country, as we have been experiencing in Israel over the past year.' Arab Israelis have long complained that the Israeli police have neglected their communities, but suggestions to use Shin Bet resources and other alternatives to clamp down on murders have been rejected by the sector's leadership. Police often are unable to prosecute murder cases involving Arab victims, even when they are able to identify the perpetrators, because members of the community are typically unwilling to testify in court or cooperate with the authorities. 'We are committed to taking decisive action against crime and violence using all available resources to increase security in the Arab community,' the Israel Police said in a media statement to Hebrew-language outlet Globes. 'Over the past year, we have prevented dozens of murders by intercepting criminals before they could carry out their plans, thwarted weapons smuggling, and seized thousands of illegal weapon, each one potentially saving lives. The Police Commissioner has ordered an increase in forces and the use of all necessary tools to locate and arrest violent offenders who pose a threat to public safety.'

NY Times Oct. 7th war coverage ‘distorted, imbalanced’ – Study	Data analysis finds that the New York Times presented Palestinian death statistics without mentioning Hamas fighters killed battling IDF troops, glossed over murders of Israeli civilians in terror attacks and bombings. By World Israel News Staff A data analyses of some 1,500 articles about the October 7th massacres and subsequent Israel-Hamas war published by the New York Times revealed that the media outlet presented a narrative to its readership that downplayed Israeli suffering and focused little on Hamas atrocities. The study was conducted independently by Edieal Pinker, a professor and deputy dean at the Yale School of Management, and published in SSRN, a journal for research papers that have not yet undergone peer review. 'Little mention is made of Israeli casualties post-October 7 or of Palestinian acts of violence post-October 7, even as Israel and Hamas were locked in intensive combat over the eight months of the study period,' the study said, according to a Times of Israel summary. 91 percent of the articles published by the Times on the conflict did not mention Israeli casualties sustained after October 7th, glossing over the fact that dozens of civilians were murdered in terror attacks and by Hezbollah and Hamas bombings. 'The reporting does not give the reader a full understanding of how the war is being experienced by Israelis,' the study said. The study also noted that only 10 percent of articles published by the outlet specified that Hamas fighters were killed during battles with Israeli troops, though they mentioned the deaths of Palestinians. There were more than 10 weeks in which no Times articles acknowledged Hamas members fighting Israel, giving readers the impression that all reported Palestinian deaths were of civilians. In a statement to the Times of Israel, the New York Times defended its reporting of the war. A spokesman from the outlet claimed that the newsppaer had 'covered this war with more rigor than virtually any other U.S. news organization, reporting on the conflict from all angles,' claiming it had published reports on 'previously unknown details about the atrocities committed by Hamas' and the 'ferocious military campaign led by the Israeli government.' The newspaper also claimed that their 'editors make careful and deliberate choices about every story we publish to ensure our language, framing, prominence and tone remain true to our mission of independent journalism.' Notably, the Times statement did not directly acknowledge or address any of the data-based points around its coverage that were highlighted in the study.

US: All IDF soldiers must withdraw from Lebanon by next week	Israel’s withdrawal remains on the existing timeline, and they did not request an extension,' says Trump administration official. By World Israel News Staff The United States expects Israel to withdraw all of its troops from southern Lebanon by next week, Trump administration officials confirmed on Monday. 'Israel’s withdrawal remains on the existing timeline, and they did not request an extension' for troops to remain in southern Lebanon later than February 18th, U.S. National Security Council Spokesperson Brian Hughes told The Jerusalem Post. In late November, Israel and Lebanon signed a truce, pushed by the Biden administration, which was originally scheduled to end on January 27th. That agreement required the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanese territory by the end of January. Shortly after President Donald Trump was inaugurated in late January, Israel was granted an extension until February 18th, allowing IDF soldiers to remain on Lebanese soil. At the time, Israel said that Lebanon had not held up its end of the bargain, with Hezbollah terrorists remaining south of the Litani River and the Lebanese Army failing to deploy en masse to the region and root out Hezbollah operatives, which constitute a violation of the ceasefire. But although displaced residents of northern Israel have still not been able to return home due to the ongoing threat from Hezbollah, Washington still expects Israel to withdraw by the February deadline. Channel 12 News reported on Monday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked Trump to permit Israeli troops to remain at a number critical strategic posts in southern Lebanon until further notice. Netanyahu is reportedly arguing that the Lebanese Army is not able to stop Hezbollah from regrouping in the area, and that the terror group will once again resume positions directly adjacent to the Israeli border when Israeli troops are withdrawn. According to the report, Israel wants to station soldiers at five locations near the border, within Lebanese territory, creating a buffer zone that will protect residents of northern Israel.

Trump issues ultimatum to Hamas with deadline to release all host...	Trump's remarks were made shortly after Hamas revealed that the planned release of hostages scheduled for February 15 had been suspended indefinitely due to what it described as an Israeli 'violation' of the ceasefire terms. By World Israel News On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump issued a strong warning to Hamas, stating that the ceasefire agreement should be canceled if all hostages held in Gaza are not released by noon on Saturday. 'If all the Gaza hostages aren't returned by Saturday at 12:00 p.m., I would say cancel the ceasefire. Let all hell break loose,' Trump said, adding, 'Israel can override it.' Trump's remarks were made shortly after Hamas posted an announcement on its Telegram account, revealing that the planned release of hostages scheduled for February 15 had been suspended indefinitely due to what it described as an Israeli 'violation' of the ceasefire terms. Following the announcement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held consultations with top security officials and rescheduled a cabinet meeting originally set for Tuesday evening to take place on Tuesday morning instead. In its statement, Hamas described the delay in releasing hostages as a 'warning' to Israel and mediating nations, aiming to pressure Israel into strict adherence to the ceasefire agreement. The terror group accused Israel of failing to fulfill key obligations, citing violations such as delays in allowing displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, attacks involving shelling and gunfire, and failure to deliver agreed humanitarian aid. 'Over the last three weeks, the leadership of the resistance has monitored the enemy's violations and non-compliance with the terms of the agreement. From delaying the return of displaced persons to northern Gaza Strip, and attacking them by shelling and shooting in various areas of the Strip, to not bringing aid equipment in all its forms as agreed, while the resistance has fulfilled all its commitments,' a Hamas spokesperson stated. In response, the Israeli government issued a statement: 'The terrorist organization is responsible for the violations. Members of the delegation who returned from Qatar this morning stated that Hamas’s actions jeopardize the continuation of the deal.' Israel’s Defense Minister, Israel Katz, also condemned Hamas’s decision, saying: 'Hamas’s announcement that it will halt the release of Israeli hostages is a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement. I have instructed the IDF to maintain the highest level of readiness for any possible scenario in Gaza and to ensure the defense of communities near the border. We will not allow a return to the reality of October 7th.'

Hamas official threatens: ‘October 7th was just a prelude’	On Monday, Hamas announced it would pause hostage releases, citing alleged 'Israeli violations' of the agreement. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Khaled al-Qa'id, one of the few remaining Hamas leaders, claimed a military victory in Gaza and warned, 'October 7th was just a prelude.' He stated, 'The October 7 attack was merely a prelude to the complete liberation of the entire Land of Israel from Jewish control.' Al-Qa'id declared Hamas’s victory in the Gaza war, saying it was 'made possible by the unity of the Palestinian people with the fighting forces and the resilience of those who remain steadfast on their land, refusing to leave.' He also thanked Iran for supporting Hamas and supplying weapons to the terror group. Al-Qa'id asserted that Palestinians are not afraid of Israel and that Hamas is prepared to fight until 'victory or death.' On Monday, Hamas announced it would pause hostage releases, citing alleged 'Israeli violations' of the agreement. In response, the Israeli government issued a statement: 'The terrorist organization is responsible for the violations. Members of the delegation who returned from Qatar this morning stated that Hamas’s actions jeopardize the continuation of the deal.' On Thursday, Hamas called on Arab countries to reject U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to relocate Palestinians from Gaza and take control of the territory during reconstruction. The group also urged Arab nations to convene an emergency summit to counter what it described as Trump’s 'displacement project.' Hamas claimed that Washington’s position on the Gaza Strip signaled a U.S. intention to occupy the territory. 'We do not need any nation to govern the Gaza Strip, and we reject replacing one occupation with another,' the group stated. 'We urge Arab countries to resist pressure from Trump and stand firm in rejecting the displacement plan,' Hamas added. Last week, during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump announced that his administration intends to relocate the entire population of the Gaza Strip to third-party countries. The U.S. would then assume control of the enclave for rehabilitation and reconstruction.

Israel responds to Hamas’s threat to cancel hostage deal	Defense Minister Katz: 'Hamas’s announcement that it will halt the release of Israeli hostages is a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Monday, Israel responded to Hamas’s announcement that it would suspend the hostage release deal, stating that Hamas, not Israel, had violated the agreement. A Hamas spokesman on Monday accused Israel of breaching the ceasefire agreement and claimed that the IDF had targeted Palestinians in Gaza. In response, the Israeli government issued a statement: 'The terrorist organization is responsible for the violations. Members of the delegation who returned from Qatar this morning stated that Hamas’s actions jeopardize the continuation of the deal.' Israel’s Defense Minister, Israel Katz, also condemned Hamas's decision, saying: 'Hamas’s announcement that it will halt the release of Israeli hostages is a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement. I have instructed the IDF to maintain the highest level of readiness for any possible scenario in Gaza and to ensure the defense of communities near the border. We will not allow a return to the reality of October 7th.' Katz referred to an incident on Sunday in which the IDF fired warning shots at a crowd of Gazans who violated the ceasefire agreement by entering the buffer zone and approaching Israel’s border near Kibbutz Nahal Oz. According to media reports, three people were killed in the incident. Following the event, Katz stated: 'Israel’s security stance on Gaza remains firm: Anyone entering the buffer zone does so at their own risk. There will be no tolerance for those who pose a threat to IDF forces, the border region, or nearby communities.' Regarding Hamas's decision to halt hostage releases, the Prime Minister's Office reassured families, saying: 'All hostage families were updated this evening following Hamas’s announcement. They were assured that the State of Israel remains fully committed to the agreement and views any violation of it with utmost seriousness.' Otzma Yehudit Chairman MK Itamar Ben Gvir urged the government to respond to the cancellation of the hostage releases with a full-scale assault on Gaza, 'from the air and the ground,' and to halt all deliveries of humanitarian aid. Ben Gvir declared: 'We must resume the war and destroy them!'

PA plots to compensate terrorists after pretending to cancel ‘pay...	The 'pay-for-slay' program refers to the PA's policy of providing financial support to terrorists who carry out attacks against Israelis. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Although Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas signed a decree on Monday to end the notorious 'pay-for-slay' program, which compensates terrorists, payments are expected to continue from another source. The 'pay-for-slay' program refers to the PA's policy of providing financial support to terrorists who carry out attacks against Israelis. Although Abbas indicated he was ending this program, Wafa reported that the payments are merely being transferred from the Ministry of Social Development to the National Palestinian Economic Empowerment Institution, an entity under PA control. Additionally, families of terrorists will remain eligible for financial aid under the same criteria as needy families. A decision was made to allow Israel to cease its policy of deducting tax funds from payments to terrorists and their families. Hamas condemned the PA’s apparent cancellation of the program, stating, 'We condemn his decision to cancel the payments to the families of the prisoners, the dead, and the wounded, and to abandon the national cause at a time when our people and the resistance forces are working to safeguard the rights of the released prisoners and to ensure their lives.' Before this decision, there was already a downward trend in the payments terrorist families received for attacks. According to research, the Palestinian Authority’s payments under the 'pay-for-slay' program decreased by 30 to 40% in 2024, despite an expected increase. Col. (res.) Adv. Maurice Hirsch, a senior researcher at the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs, identified several factors contributing to this decline. First, bureaucratic difficulties have arisen since Red Cross representatives have been barred from visiting prisons. Second, Hirsch stated, 'The economic pressure on the Palestinian Authority has reached an unprecedented level. According to new data from the Finance Ministry, Israel has deducted approximately NIS 3 billion from PA funds as of November 2024.' A third factor is the ongoing war in Gaza, which has disrupted the transfer of funds and the documentation required to access them.

Isolated, starved, burned, gagged: hostages’ testimony reveals Ha...	The former hostages reported being interrogated and burned, leading one of them to collapse. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The emaciated appearance of the three hostages released on Saturday was a testament to the severe abuses they suffered at the hands of their Hamas captors. Or Levy, Ohad Ben Ami, and Eli Sharabi reported being isolated in tunnels, hung upside down, burned, starved, gagged, deprived of daylight, and subjected to psychological torture. They also witnessed similar treatment of other hostages who were slated for release. 'They treated us like animals,' one of the three released hostages said. The former hostages reported being interrogated and burned, leading one of them to collapse. The three men were forced to endure days without food while their captors taunted them and ate in front of them, finally providing only one stale pita to share among several hostages. Hamas captors often put a cloth around their mouths and gagged them, making it seem as though they were going to suffocate them. Sigi Cohen, mother of hostage Eliya Cohen, said that released hostages informed her that her son had been chained and confined to a tunnel, had not seen sunlight during his entire captivity, and was given very little food. They also reported that Cohen had been tortured by being hung by his feet upside down and burned with a metal object. In addition to the torments he endured in captivity, Cohen has an untreated bullet wound that he sustained on October 7th. Hostage Alon Ohel, whose family received information that he was alive, reported that he had also been chained, starved, and was suffering from medical neglect after sustaining a shrapnel wound and a severe eye injury. Ohel's family has released a statement advocating for his liberation. They wrote, 'Tomorrow, Alon will spend his 24th birthday in Hamas captivity. We urge the prime minister, the cabinet, and the Israeli government—time is running out. The second phase of the deal must proceed to bring all the hostages home. It is your moral obligation to do everything possible to save Alon and the others.'

The event marked the first such celebration under Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who took office after Ebrahim Raisi’s death in a helicopter crash in May 2024. By JNS Tens of thousands of Iranians gathered in Tehran on Monday to mark the 46th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, which led to the overthrow of the U.S.-backed shah and the establishment of Iran’s theocracy, the Associated Press reported. The event occurred amid economic struggles caused by U.S. sanctions and escalating tensions with Washington following President Donald Trump’s return to office and renewed 'maximum pressure' sanctions campaign. Protesters carried anti-American and anti-Israeli banners, with some calling for Israel’s destruction. The rally also showcased military displays, including missile replicas. Iran is celebrating the 46th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. I hope this is their last celebrate. pic.twitter.com/0RHHBR38ZD &mdash; Eli Afriat (@EliAfriatISR) February 10, 2025 Over the past year, Iran launched unprecedented direct missile and drone attacks against Israel. Iran’s Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, also attacked Israel, escalating the conflict. However, Israel and its allies intercepted most of the Iranian strikes, which were followed by Israeli retaliatory attacks that significantly damaged Iran’s air defenses and weapons production sites. The war with Hezbollah ended with a ceasefire in November, while negotiations continue over a three-phase truce with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The event marked the first such celebration under Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who took office after Ebrahim Raisi’s death in a helicopter crash in May 2024. Meanwhile, Trump told The New York Post on Saturday that he favors resolving the Iran nuclear issue diplomatically rather than through military action. However, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Friday dismissed the idea of talks with the United States, saying, 'Negotiating with such a government should not be done.'

Knesset bill seeks to replace ‘West Bank’ with ‘Judea and Samaria...	West Bank,' although more common in modern parlance, has a recent provenance, having been coined by Jordan, which controlled the area for a short time (1948-1967), in an attempt to erase the area’s historic Jewish connection. By JNS Israel’s Ministerial Committee for Legislation on Sunday approved a Knesset bill to replace the term 'West Bank' with 'Judea and Samaria' in Israeli government documents. 'Judea and Samaria are an inseparable part of the historic homeland of the Jewish people,' the bill states. 'The most decisive events in our history took place in these regions, where our forefathers, prophets, sages and kings established their capital and kingdom. 'In contrast, the term ‘West Bank,’ which originated in a period of foreign rule, reflects a colonialist perspective that ignores the deep historical connection of the Jewish people to its land,' it adds. Committee chairman Simcha Rothman, who introduced the bill, told JNS: 'Semantics are important because through incorrect terminology, the lie wins. You have to describe reality correctly and tell the truth, and this is the first step to correcting the reality.' 'Judea and Samaria' is an ancient term. Judea derives from the name of the Kingdom of Judah, founded in 934 B.C.E., the source of the term 'Jews.' 'Samaria' comes from the ancient city of Samaria, capital of the northern Kingdom of Israel, an independent realm made up of the Hebrew tribes of Reuben, Simeon, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Manasseh and Ephraim; now known as the 10 Lost Tribes, who were taken into captivity by Assyria around 720 BCE. 'West Bank,' although more common in modern parlance, has a recent provenance, having been coined by Jordan, which controlled the area for a short time (1948-1967), in an attempt to erase the area’s historic Jewish connection. The Romans had an identical purpose when in 135 BCE, after defeating the Second Jewish Revolt, they renamed the Roman province of Judaea (an area larger than present day Judea) 'Syria Palaestina' (from which the modern term 'Palestine' comes). They wanted to sever the Jewish connection to the land. Palaestina referenced the Philistines, a people who lived along the coast but had disappeared by the 6th century BCE. 'As chairman of the Constitution Committee, we often get laws that replace terms with more ‘correct’ terms, and I thought that instead of chasing the culture of political correctness, it was time for us to chase after [our own history] for once,' Rothman told JNS. His timing was also influenced by the change in administration in the United States. The 'new administration and the new Congress [are] committed to the historical truth, that the Land of Israel belongs to the people of Israel,' he said. He noted parallel legislative efforts in the United States. U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.) have both introduced bills requiring 'all official U.S. documents and materials to use the historically accurate term ‘Judea and Samaria’ instead of the ‘West Bank.'' On Feb. 29, Tenney, in a statement on her website announcing her bill, said, 'The Israeli people have an undeniable and indisputable historical and legal claim over Judea and Samaria.' Cotton, announcing his bill on Feb. 4, said, 'The Jewish people’s legal and historic rights to Judea and Samaria goes back thousands of years. The U.S. should stop using the politically charged term West Bank to refer to the biblical heartland of Israel.' There has been some debate in the coalition about Rothman’s bill. In Sunday’s committee discussion, Shlomo Karhi of the Likud Party, who serves as Communications Minister, suggested that it would be better for the coalition to focus on sovereignty rather than semantics. 'It’s dealing with something that we intend to solve in a completely different way,' said Karhi, according to Kan News. Rothman told JNS however that the difference of opinion wouldn’t affect the bill’s passage. 'Even Karhi’s words did not come as an opposition to the law, but as a statement and a hope, which I myself join, that sovereignty will soon be applied and this law, like other laws that I am promoting myself, together with my colleagues in the Land of Israel Lobby, will become redundant,' he said. Rothman said that he 'definitely' expects the bill to pass.

Trump says no right of return for Palestinians in Gaza under his ...	It comes as he has ramped up pressure on Arab states, especially U.S. allies Jordan and Egypt, to take in Palestinians from Gaza. By The Associated Press President Donald Trump said Palestinians in Gaza would not have a right to return under his plan for U.S. 'ownership' of the war-torn territory, contradicting other officials in his administration who have sought to argue Trump was only calling for the temporary relocation of its population. Less than a week after he floated his plan for the U.S. to take control of Gaza and turn it in 'the Riviera of the Middle East,' Trump, in an interview with FOX News' Bret Baier that was set to air on Monday, said 'No, they wouldn’t' when asked if Palestinians in Gaza would have a right to return to the territory. It comes as he has ramped up pressure on Arab states, especially U.S. allies Jordan and Egypt, to take in Palestinians from Gaza. 'We’ll build safe communities, a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is,' Trump said. 'In the meantime, I would own this. Think of it as a real estate development for the future. It would be a beautiful piece of land. No big money spent.' Arab nations have sharply criticized the Trump proposal, and Trump’s latest words were released a day before he is set to host Jordan’s King Abdullah II at the White House on Tuesday. After Trump's initial comments last week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Secretary of State Marco Rubio respectfully insisted that Trump only wanted Palestinians relocated from Gaza 'temporarily' and for an 'interim' period to allow for debris removal, the disposal of unexploded ordinance and reconstruction. Trump last week didn't rule out deploying U.S. troops to help secure the territory but at the same time insisted no U.S. funds would go to pay for the reconstruction of Gaza, raising fundamental questions about the nature of his plan.

Anti-Trump think tanks rake in millions from taxpayers for ‘virtu...	Republicans have criticized both think tanks over their central roles in what’s been dubbed the 'censorship-industrial complex,' a network of university and think tank researchers that worked closely with federal agencies to censor content on social media. By Chuck Ross, The Washington Free Beacon Federal agencies have awarded nearly $50 million over the past four years to the Aspen Institute and the Atlantic Council—well-funded liberal think tanks which between them boast 50 donors who have given them at least $1 million—for projects that include a $6 million program to provide 'virtual exchanges' for students in the Middle East, and $300,000 to host a conference to empower women in Saudi Arabia. The grants are but two examples of the taxpayer funds that flow to the country’s biggest think tanks. The State Department, USAID, and Department of Defense have awarded $15.3 million in grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts to the Atlantic Council since 2021, and $32.6 million to the Aspen Institute over the same span, according to federal spending records. Taxpayer support for two deep-pocketed institutions could draw fresh scrutiny as the Trump administration—largely through the Department of Government Efficiency, the government unit led by Elon Musk—is scouring the federal government’s books for signs of fraud and wasteful spending. Trump this week moved to shut down USAID, an independent agency that has long worked with the State Department, over its funding for foreign aid programs deemed to be wasteful and nonessential. The Aspen Institute and the Atlantic Council, among the largest think tank recipients of taxpayer funding, have received tens of millions of dollars in donations from an impressive roster of corporations, tech billionaires, philanthropies, foreign companies, and governments. In 2023 alone, the Atlantic Council received 12 donations of at least $1 million each from Meta, Goldman Sachs, the government of the United Arab Emirates, and the Rockefeller Foundation, according to its donor list. The Aspen Institute disclosed that 38 donors gave at least $1 million in 2023, including Walmart, Google, the Ford Foundation, and the philanthropies of billionaires Bill Gates and Mike Bloomberg. Both organizations could present ripe targets for the administration’s cost-cutting measures, for not just their sizable warchests, but also their hostilities towards President Donald Trump. 'There is absolutely no reason that these research projects at the Atlantic Council and Aspen Institute should have even been considered for a government grant,' said Parker Thayer, an investigator at Capital Research Center, a watchdog group that recently launched the DOGE Files to track federal spending. 'Not only are the projects plainly ridiculous wastes of taxpayer money, but both organization have more than a few mega-donors to be getting along with.' Like many Beltway think tanks, the Aspen Institute and the Atlantic Council have been highly critical of Trump’s policies, both domestic and foreign. Aspen Institute president Dan Porterfield said Trump 'fomented' the 'deadly insurrection' at the Capitol on Jan. 6. Katie Couric, the former TV journalist and co-chair of Aspen Institute’s Commission on Information Disorder, has called Trump a 'fascist' and compared a Trump campaign rally at Madison Square Garden last year to a 'Nazi event.' Republicans have criticized both think tanks over their central roles in what’s been dubbed the 'censorship-industrial complex,' a network of university and think tank researchers that worked closely with federal agencies to censor content on social media. In September 2020, the Aspen Institute organized a 'tabletop' exercise with journalists from the New York Times, and Washington Post, and executives from Facebook and Twitter to draft a plan for how to respond to a hypothetical scenario in which Russia leaked documents stolen from Hunter Biden, according to documents uncovered by reporter Michael Shellenberger. Many of the participants—most notably Twitter—censored an accurate New York Post story about Biden’s laptop in Oct. 2020. The Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab is led by Graham Brookie, who served on the National Security Council in the Obama administration. In October 2020, Brookie claimed Trump’s 'entire strategy' in the campaign that year was 'based on process disinformation in this election.' Days later, Brookie dismissed reports of Hunter Biden’s laptop as 'unverified misinfo.' He cheered Twitter’s ban of Trump’s account and 'influencers of the far right' after the Jan. 6 Capitol riots as a 'welcome' decision. The State Department awarded the DFRLab a $64,000 grant in September to host two workshops at the U.S. embassy in Vienna on 'countering foreign information manipulation and interference,' and $250,000 the same month for a project to counter disinformation in Moldova, according to spending records. Other grants to the think tanks could land in the cost-cutters’ crosshairs. On Jan. 1, the State Department gave the Atlantic Council $500,000 for a project slated to run through Oct. 2026, to 'promote responsible trade' in the western Balkans—a region that includes Serbia and Albania—in order to 'support the region’s alignment with a Euro-Atlantic path.' The State Department’s $6 million contract with the Aspen Institute in September will help fund an online exchange program with students and young people in North Africa and the Middle East, to teach them about 'civic engagement,' 'climate change and sustainability,' and other topics. The program involves the use of recorded messages exchanged between students in different countries. In 2021, USAID struck a five-year, $9 million agreement with the Aspen Institute to 'promote investment in Guatemalan entrepreneurs and innovators.' Aspen selected one program participant that will help 'rural communities increase investment capability and access new markets for specialty mushroom, honey, and coffee products.' In many cases, American taxpayers are funding programs that involve the think tanks’ major foreign donors. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates—where the Atlantic Council held State Department-funded women’s empowerment conferences—are some of the think tank’s biggest donors. The Saudi-owned Aramco Americas and King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center donated $400,000 to the Atlantic Council in 2023, and the Emirates gave $1.85 million the same year. The State Department gave $40,000 to the Atlantic Council last year for a study and presentation on the threats posed by Russia’s 'shadow fleet' to Denmark. The Danish embassy donated at least $100,000 to the Atlantic Council in 2023. A spokesperson for the Atlantic Council said the State Department has paused funding for a small number of its projects regarding Chinese and Russian influence in response to Trump's executive order to reevaluate foreign aid spending. 'If these sorts of programs are discontinued, the biggest beneficiaries will be America’s adversaries, who are eager to expand their influence in key regions,' the spokesperson said. 'However, the vast majority of our work continues as planned, and we remain committed to delivering on our mission of galvanizing U.S. leadership and engagement in the world, in partnership with allies and partners, to shape solutions to global challenges. The Aspen Institute did not respond to a request for comment.

Digital warfare ‘has reached every home in Israel’ says cyber saf...	Fraud and online scams comprised 17.6% of total helpline reports, followed by cases of sexual harassment at 11.5%. By Pesach Benson, TPS The Israeli Internet Association reported a sharp rise in cyber incidents targeting Israeli citizens in its annual report, released on Monday. The report, based on the activities of the Association’s Safe Internet Helpline, noted unprecedented levels of cyberattacks, fraud and breached social media accounts. 'The war in the digital arena and on the networks has reached every home in Israel,' the report said. Data from the report showed that 45% of all calls to the helpline this year concerned cyber-related issues, a significant increase from 36% last year. Among the most frequent reports were incidents involving hacking into social media accounts, which accounted for 27% of all calls. A notable shift has occurred in the platforms most frequently reported for fraud and cyberattacks. For the first time, WhatsApp has taken the top spot, with 21.7% of complaints directed at the messaging platform. Facebook, which previously held the leading position, followed closely with 19% of complaints. Instagram ranked third with 15.6% of reports. Complaints related to Telegram have also increased sharply, reaching 4.1% of total reports. In the Arab sector, TikTok has emerged as a major concern, with 15% of complaints from that community directed at the platform. The helpline recorded approximately 1,100 calls related to hacking and account takeovers this year, representing a 20% increase compared to the previous year. Fraud and online scams comprised 17.6% of total reports, followed by cases of sexual harassment at 11.5%. Impersonation and privacy violations accounted for 10.9% of complaints, while reports of false and misleading content about the war made up 10.6%. The war has played a role in the escalation of cyber threats, with digital attacks and harassment becoming more prevalent across various online platforms. The Israeli Internet Association has taken steps to combat harmful online content by submitting hundreds of removal requests to digital platforms. Facebook received the highest number of requests, with 322 submissions, and responded positively to 98% of them. TikTok, which received 137 requests, removed 95% of the reported content. The association has successfully facilitated the removal of offensive content in 94% of all cases reported by users. 'This is further evidence that the war has reached the doorsteps of all citizens of the country through the digital arena,' said Edan Ring, the Association’s Vice President of community and social affairs. 'Attempts to attack and harass citizens on the cyber front have grown by tens of percent in the past year. The Israeli Internet Association has succeeded in removing offensive content on the leading platforms in 94% of the requests and continues to help citizens report and remove offensive content. But the first line of defense against attacks must be the citizens themselves – by increasing protective measures such as two-step verification and passwords, reporting directly to the platforms and the helpline, and increasing vigilance and caution in cyberspace as well,' Ring added.

Hamas accuses Israel of ceasefire violations and says it will del...	The next exchange was scheduled for Saturday, releasing three Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. By The Associated Press A Hamas spokesman on Monday accused Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement with the group, including targeting Palestinians in Gaza with airstrikes, and said that next Saturday's hostage release would be delayed. A Hamas spokesperson said Monday that the group will delay the next hostage release after accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement. Israel and Hamas are in the midst of a six-week ceasefire during which Hamas is releasing dozens of the hostages captured in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The sides have carried out five swaps since the ceasefire went into effect last month, freeing 21 hostages and over 730 prisoners. The next exchange was scheduled for Saturday, releasing three Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Abu Obeida, the spokesperson for Hamas’ military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, accused Israel on Monday of systematically violating the ceasefire agreement over the past three weeks, and said Saturday's release would be delayed. 'The resistance leadership has closely monitored the enemy’s violations and its failure to uphold the terms of the agreement,' Abu Ubaida said. 'This includes delays in allowing displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, targeting them with airstrikes and gunfire across various areas of the Strip, and failing to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid as agreed.'

Trump: US will be ‘buying and owning’ Gaza	US might allow Middle Eastern allies to develop parts of Gaza Strip, says Trump, but America will 'own it,' and ensure Hamas 'doesn't move back.' By World Israel News Staff The United States will be 'buying' and 'owning' the Gaza Strip, President Donald Trump said over the weekend, emphasizing that while America's Middle Eastern allies could play a role in Gaza's rehabilitation and reconstruction, the U.S. would retain ownership of the territory. Trump made the comments while speaking with reporters on board Air Force One on Sunday, en route to New Orleans ahead of the Super Bowl. The president said his administration is 'in no rush' to implement his plan, but doubled-down on his previous claims that the U.S. will 'own' Gaza. 'I’m committed to buying and owning Gaza. As far as us rebuilding it, we may give it to other states in the Middle East to build sections of it, other people may do it, through our auspices,' Trump said, adding that the U.S. would ensure Hamas does not attempt to return to the coastal enclave. 'We’re committed to owning it, taking it, and making sure that Hamas doesn’t move back.' 'Think of it as a big real estate site, and the United States is going to own it, and will slowly, very slowly, we’re in no rush, in development. We're going to bring stability to the Middle East.' The president said that in its present condition, Gaza was a 'demolition site.' 'It'll be reclaimed. It'll be leveled out, fixed up. There won't be anybody there. Hamas won’t be there. We'll be building through other of the very rich countries in the Middle East, they'll be building some beautiful sites for the people, the Palestinians, to live in. They'll be living in harmony and peace, relatively, for the first time in hundreds of years.' Trump said the plan was ensure the safety of Palestinian civilians, and suggested he may be open to permitting some to move to the United States. 'We’re gonna take care of the Palestinians and make sure… they’re not murdered.'

KLM and Ryanair return to Israel with budget-friendly fares	As for North American passengers, United Airlines announced it will resume flying to Israel starting March 15, while Delta Airlines will resume service from New York-JFK to Tel Aviv on April 1. By Jewish Breaking News The summer of 2025 will bring more than just heat to Israel, as European aviation giants make their long-awaited return to Ben Gurion Airport with fares that seem almost too good to be true. Both Ryanair and KLM made significant announcements on Sunday regarding their return to Israeli skies post-Oct. 7. For Israeli travelers itching to explore Europe, Ryanair’s return comes with an enticing array of 23 destinations. Italy takes center stage with seven different routes, while those dreaming of Greek getaways can choose between Athens, Thessaloniki, and, starting in June, the charming coastal city of Chania. German-bound passengers haven’t been forgotten either, with flights to Berlin, Baden-Baden, and Memmingen all on the roster. A quick hop to Paphos, Cyprus, will set travelers back just €37 one-way, while those looking to venture further can reach Bucharest for €45, Vienna for €46, Budapest for €48, or Malta for a mere €50. Round-trip deals are equally attractive, with April flights to Rome available for €140, Berlin for €150, and Athens for €160. However, these introductory prices are expected to shift with demand and season. Meanwhile, KLM’s evening departures from Amsterdam at 9:10 PM, arriving in Tel Aviv in the early hours, and return flights leaving at 4:45 AM, offer more than just a direct link to the Netherlands. The Dutch carrier’s network opens up connections to 270 destinations through its Schiphol airport hub, which will significantly expand travel options for Israeli passengers. As for North American passengers, United Airlines announced it will resume flying to Israel starting March 15, while Delta Airlines will resume service from New York-JFK to Tel Aviv on April 1.

At USAID, funding for terror-tied groups and internal hostility t...	Under Samantha Power, former president Joe Biden's pick to run USAID, agency officials fought pro-Israel policymaking at the State Department, often urging their colleagues at Foggy Bottom to pare down statements that praised the Jewish state. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon As the Trump administration works to shutter the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), current and former U.S. officials who worked closely with the embattled aid group say they watched for years as it funneled millions of dollars to anti-Israel advocacy groups and entities linked to terrorism. That funding caused internal friction across multiple administrations, according to those who spoke with the Washington Free Beacon. In some cases, USAID fought to conceal how taxpayer funds were spent. And when it came to Israel, officials recalled battling USAID over funding for groups that worked to undermine the Jewish state or maintained ties to terror organizations. 'For those who believe in a strong U.S.-Israel relationship, elements of USAID have been problematic for years,' said one former State Department official who worked with USAID during the Biden administration. 'There was even a lack of embarrassment among some USAID staffers about being associated with terrorist organizations.' Some of the terror-tied funding initiatives are publicly known. In November 2022, for instance, USAID awarded $100,000 to a Palestinian activist group whose leaders hailed the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a designated terror group. Just six days before Hamas's Oct. 7 assault on Israel, USAID handed $900,000 'to a terror charity in Gaza involved with the son of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.' USAID's hostilities toward the Jewish state, however, ran deeper than the agency's grantmaking. Under Samantha Power, former president Joe Biden's pick to run USAID, agency officials fought pro-Israel policymaking at the State Department, often urging their colleagues at Foggy Bottom to pare down statements that praised the Jewish state, former officials said. In 2021, during a period of conflict with Hamas, Power herself refused to meet with Israel's ambassador unless Israel reached a ceasefire with the Iran-backed terror group. The decision put Power at odds with the White House National Security Council, which had signed off on the meeting, emails obtained by the Free Beacon show. Years later, in September, Power's USAID accused Israel of deliberately blocking Gazan aid deliveries, which Hamas is known to steal for its own use and for black market sales that fund its terror activities. USAID staffers went as far as to urge the Biden State Department to end military aid to Israel. Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken rejected the request. 'They weren't even in line with some of the Biden administration's policies,' the State Department official who worked under Biden and Blinken told the Free Beacon. 'It's more than just problematic grants to anti-Israel organizations. It's also their role in the internal approval processes and statements within the administration. There's an entire bureaucratic process they're a part of. They carry out their obstructionist ideology on that front as well.' The rogue nature of USAID under Power has motivated the Trump administration's push to dismantle the agency. During his recent trip to El Salvador, Secretary of State Marco Rubio described a longstanding 'frustration' with the agency, which he called 'completely unresponsive.' The 'level of insubordination,' Rubio said, 'makes it impossible to conduct a sort of mature and serious review that I think foreign aid writ large should have.' Federal investigations lend credence to that assessment. A January memo from Inspector General Paul Martin, for example, noted that the agency 'does not maintain a comprehensive internal database of subawardees.' In other words, the foreign entities that work with a primary grantee on a USAID project often go unreported, impeding the ability of agency investigators to vet 'fraud allegations,' according to the memo. Such allegations often include the diversion of taxpayer-funded aid to terrorist organizations. In a November report, for example, Martin 'identified deliberate interference and efforts to divert humanitarian assistance' by foreign terrorist organizations, including 'systemic coercion of aid workers by FTOs' and 'FTO influence over beneficiary selection.' Those diversion efforts are particularly pronounced in Hamas-controlled Gaza. A February report from the Middle East Forum think tank found that USAID had awarded 'millions of federal dollars' to 'organizations directly in Gaza controlled by Hamas.' In one Biden-era case, USAID funded an 'educational and community center in Gaza' controlled by a local group called the Unlimited Friends Association. The association openly collaborated with Hamas, inviting the terror group's officials to its office and boasting of U.S.-funded projects in Hamas-controlled newspapers. In 2021, its director called for Jerusalem to be cleansed 'from the impurity of the Jews.' A separate report, released in January by Israeli research organization NGO Monitor, outlined millions in USAID funding for two nonprofits—Mercy Corps and American Near East Refugee Aid—that 'have closely coordinated with a Gaza-based ministry, run by a senior Hamas official identified by the U.S. Treasury Department as previously responsible for part of Hamas’ smuggling operation.' When it resumed funding for the Palestinians in 2021, the Biden State Department issued an internal warning that there was a 'high risk' Hamas would steal U.S. aid. But information about terror-tied grant recipients in Gaza and elsewhere came mostly from watchdog groups. When members of Congress pressed USAID on those grants, they were often obstructed. In a letter sent to Rubio last week, Sen. Joni Ernst (R., Iowa) detailed USAID's 'willful sabotage of congressional oversight.' The agency, she wrote, falsely claimed that certain grants were classified in a 'desperate attempt to limit congressional oversight of public information.' Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) described similar interactions with USAID staffers. In some cases, he told the Free Beacon, USAID 'refused to disclose what groups were getting money and gave tens of millions in American cash to be distributed without American supervision.' 'Before and after Oct. 7, USAID flowed uncountable hundreds of millions of dollars toward Hamas that enabled it to launch the attack and keep battling Israel afterwards,' Cruz said. 'The full story of USAID funding Hamas is vast and much of it was done in secret.' U.S. officials involved in foreign policy emphasized in interviews with the Free Beacon that, despite its many issues, USAID does fund essential work providing medicine and other lifesaving aid. Rubio has made similar statements, expressing his desire to continue funding programs 'providing food or medicine or anything that is saving lives and is immediate and urgent.' Over time, however, 'more and more money flowed to groups and organizations whose work is contrary to the interests of the United States,' one official who has worked closely with USAID across multiple administrations told the Free Beacon. 'How bad it got is finally coming to light and there is finally transparency.' The Trump administration plans to scale back the agency by dissolving it and placing its core functions within the State Department, where roughly 600 current USAID staffers would work. The agency employed some 10,000 staffers when President Donald Trump took office last month. The overwhelming majority of those staffers were set to go on leave by midnight Saturday. A federal judge blocked the action until Feb. 14, though the decision is temporary and the case is expected to go to the Supreme Court. Democratic lawmakers have vehemently opposed the cuts, arguing that they endanger millions of vulnerable people across the globe. 'People can quibble about this or that,' the current U.S. official said of the Democratic attention surrounding USAID. 'But let's not make the perfect the enemy of the good. This is long overdue.'

‘Fake-Christian Jew-Hatred’ – Evangelical leader urges Trump to r...	Evangelical Christian leader Laurie Cardoza-Moore criticizes President Trump for posing with populist pundit Tucker Carlson, calls on White House to distance itself from those accused of antisemitism on the far-right. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News An Evangelical Christian leader and Republican activist chided the Trump administration Monday, over President Donald Trump's meeting with right-wing pundit Tucker Carlson. Over the weekend, photographs were circulated showing Trump alongside Department of Government Efficiency administrator Elon Musk and Carlson at the White House. In a statement issued Monday by the Tennessee-based Evangelical Christian group Proclaiming Justice to the Nations, the group's president and founder Laurie Cardoza-Moore, accused Carlson of antisemitism, and called on the Trump administration to distance itself from both Carlson and Candace Owens. Owens, a 35-year-old online commentator, has come under fire over her promotion of conspiracy theories and antisemitic canards, including blaming Jews for the death of pop star Michael Jackson. 'I have been inundated with calls from concerned Jews and Christians after Carlson was pictured, wearing an oversized MAGA hat, with President Trump and Elon Musk,' Cardoza-Moore said Monday. 'We the People elected President Trump, with an overwhelming majority and with a referendum, to stand with Israel and our Jewish brethren against the rise of antisemitism, anti-Israelism and anti-Zionism.' Cardoza-Moore lauded Trump's policies vis-a-vis Israel and castigated the rise of antisemitism during the Biden presidency, but expressed concern over Trump's embrace of Carlson. 'Under the Biden Administration, his policies incited violence against our Jewish communities on higher-ed and K-12 campuses, in synagogues, and places of worship.' 'Our 47th President is without any doubt Israel’s greatest friend in the White House ever, but Tucker Carlson’s anti-Semitism is appalling,' continued Cardoza-Moore, whose syndicated Focus on Israel television show reaches billions of viewers worldwide. 'Following the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust, Tucker has chosen to platform Holocaust revisionists, Jew haters and fake Christian leaders on the Palestinian Authority payroll,' Cardoza-Moore said, referencing Carlson's interview with podcaster Darryl Cooper and Carlson's April 2024 interview with Munther Isaac. During his interview with Carlson, Cooper downplayed Hitler's role in the Second World War, painting Winston Churchill as the conflict's primary villain. Isaac, a Lutheran pastor from Bethlehem and ardent Palestinian nationalist, had praised the October 7th invasion of Israel prior to his appearance on Carlson's show. 'He peddles in conspiracy theories against God’s Chosen,' Cardoza-Moore said of Carlson. 'He libels the Israel Defense Forces as deliberately targeting civilians – with no basis whatsoever,' she added. Cardoza-Moore called on Trump to keep both Carlson and Owens out of the White House, calling the two 'false prophets.' 'Tucker Carlson should not be allowed anywhere near the White House. Carlson’s positions on Jews are demonic and in violation of the 9th Commandment, bearing false witness against your neighbor. America was founded upon Judeo-Christian values which have made us what we are today. We can put America First and Make America Great Again without false prophets like Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens.'

Gaza hostage’s father credits Trump with daughter’s freedom	The president’s pressure even before his inauguration was what led to the hostage deal, Eitan Gonen wrote. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Romi Gonen’s father gave full credit to U.S. President Donald Trump for his daughter’s freedom and asked him to continue his efforts so that all the remaining hostages come home as well, in an op-ed he wrote in The New York Post Saturday. 'The person who made seeing my daughter possible, after so many months of despair and failed negotiations, was President Donald Trump,' Eitan Gonen averred. 'When he set a Jan. 20 deadline for the deal, it applied the necessary pressure, setting in motion the events that would bring Romi home,' he continued, adding that he would be 'honored' to one day shake the president’s hand 'and express my gratitude for his role in reuniting our family.' Gonen then begged the president to continue his efforts for those still in Hamas’ and other terror groups’ hands in Gaza. 'For the 79 hostages still in captivity as of Friday, including dozens who aren’t even part of the current phase of negotiations, President Trump is their only hope,' he continued. 'Only he could help other families experience the reunion I had. Only he can make the next stages of the deal possible.' Romi was freed along with Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari on January 19 in the first of six scheduled weekly exchanges of hostages for Palestinian security prisoners during a ceasefire whose negotiations had lasted for months before Trump’s November victory in the American elections. The second stage of the negotiations, for the younger, live, male hostages, including IDF soldiers and foreign nationals, with Hamas demanding more prisoners’ freedom and a complete withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza in return, are beginning now in Qatar. There is tremendous pressure from much of the Israeli public for a deal to be inked, especially after the release Saturday of three hostages, Ohad Ben Ami, Or Levy and Eli Sharabi, who were emaciated, very pale and shaky on their legs. Many Jews and non-Jews had the same thoughts when seeing their gaunt frames, and President Trump put it very clearly. 'I watched the hostages come back today,' he said, 'and they looked like Holocaust survivors. They were in horrible condition' and looking '25 years older.' While not going into detail about what he meant, he said repeatedly, 'I don’t know how much longer we are going to take that,' and 'At some point, we’re going to lose our patience.' Holocaust survivors told The Post Sunday that the images of Ben Ami, Levy and Sharabi brought them back to their horrific experiences in the concentration camps. 'It’s a sorry sight to look at, and even sorrier we have to discuss it,' said 97-year-old Aron Krell, who survived several brutal German camps. 'It brings back the memories you try to forget, but you can’t forget.' 'When I saw their pictures coming out of captivity, they looked so emaciated and so sick,' he said. 'And the world doesn’t care. I can’t understand — where is the outrage?' Another nonagenarian survivor who also spoke to the New York paper, Lucy Lipiner, wrote on X, ''The horrible images of the hostages pale and starved that were released yesterday brought me back to a very dark time in my life.' 'I saw almost skeletal men walking,' she added. 'The worst thing about them was the depression that was written on their faces – the hollowed cheeks, sunken-in faces… can you imagine this emotional torture, on top of physical torture?' 'The three men look like they came out from Auschwitz.'

Erdogan accuses US of bowing to ‘Zionist lobby’ on Gaza	Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan also rejected the plan earlier on Sunday, calling it historically ignorant. By JNS Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday condemned U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to relocate Palestinians from Gaza and rebuild the area, calling it unworthy of discussion and driven by pressure from the 'Zionist lobby.' Gaza, Judea and Samaria and eastern Jerusalem rightfully belong to the Palestinians, he said. 'I would like to state this clearly once: The proposals put forward by the new American administration regarding Gaza with the pressure of the Zionist lobby have nothing worth considering or discussing from our perspective,' Erdogan told reporters at Istanbul Airport before boarding a flight to Malaysia for an official visit. 'These are purely preoccupations with nonsense. No one has the power to remove the people of Gaza from their eternal homeland that has been around for thousands of years,' he continued. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan also rejected the plan earlier on Sunday, calling it historically ignorant. 'The displacement of Palestinians is unacceptable,' said Fidan. Ankara has been among Jerusalem’s fiercest critics during the war, cutting trade ties and drawing comparisons between Israel’s actions and those of Nazi Germany during the Holocaust. Erdogan even hinted at military action against the Jewish state. Turkey joins other Arab and Muslim-majority countries in rejecting Trump’s proposal, made during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Washington last week, that would see the U.S. take control of Gaza, resettle its Palestinian population elsewhere and transform the enclave. On Sunday, Trump said that 'Hamas has been a disaster,' blaming the terrorist group for making Gaza one of the 'most dangerous places in the world.' Despite their statements to the contrary, Arab nations would be open to resettling Gazans elsewhere once they were negotiating directly with him, Trump said during a press gaggle on Air Force One as he headed to New Orleans to attend the Super Bowl. 'They never spoke to me. They spoke to other people. When they speak to me, they’re going to take them,' he claimed.

Israel’s largest-ever business delegation heads to India to boost...	Trade between Israel and India continues to grow, with total trade volume reaching approximately $5.01 billion in 2024. By Pesach Benson, TPS Led by Minister of Economy and Industry Nir Barkat, Israel’s largest business delegation of its kind departed on Monday for India. The two-day visit aims to strengthen economic ties between the two nations, expand trade opportunities, and foster technological collaboration. The delegation’s departure marks a new phase in the growing economic relationship between Israel and India. 'The departure of the economic delegation to India is a significant step towards deepening economic ties between the countries, strengthening the Israeli economy through significant growth in exports and lowering the cost of living through expanding imports,' said Barkat. 'At the invitation of Indian Economy Minister Piyush Goyal, we are embarking on a journey that will open new markets, increase trade, and remove barriers for Israeli industry. The combination of Israeli innovation and the vast Indian market constitutes a tremendous growth engine for the Israeli economy, and we are committed to leveraging it for the benefit of the Israeli public and economy,' Barkat said. During the visit, key events include the Israel-India Business Forum, attended by economy ministers and senior government officials, and the 'Bridge to Growth' panel on economic cooperation. Business-to-business meetings will take place, facilitating connections between companies from both countries. Professional tours of innovation and industry hubs, including India Energy Week 2025, will offer insights into India’s growing economic landscape. The delegation will focus on strategic areas, including agriculture and water technologies, cyber and information security, digital health, renewable energy, Industry 4.0, and smart transportation. Israeli companies specializing in these fields will explore opportunities to collaborate with Indian counterparts, leveraging their expertise to contribute to India’s economic growth. 'India is a top-notch strategic destination for Israeli companies, and the current delegation is an exceptional opportunity to expand trade and technology ties between the countries,' said Avi Balashnikov, Chairman of Israel’s Export Institute. Trade between Israel and India continues to grow, with total trade volume reaching approximately $5.01 billion in 2024. Exports from Israel to India amounted to around $2.39 billion, while imports from India to Israel stood at approximately $1.42 billion. Diamond trade between the two countries accounted for an additional $1.2 billion. Key Israeli exports include transportation products, chemicals, medical devices, and agricultural products. Another key topic of discussion will be expanding cooperation to bring professional manpower from India to Israel under fair employment conditions. Strengthening labor market ties could provide solutions to workforce shortages while ensuring mutual economic benefits for both countries. India has enormous potential to become one of Israel’s key trading partners, and advanced Israeli technologies are significant to the needs of the Indian government on its path to growth,' said Dr. Ron Tomer, President of Israel’s Manufacturers Association. 'The delegation is an opportunity for Israeli industrialists to meet Indian businesspeople and government officials, to create business connections, with the aim of turning them into commercial collaborations in the future.'

He also noted that Trump is due to meet with Jordan’s King Abdullah in the coming days, which Jordan’s state news agency has already reported. By Reuters and The Algemeiner Israeli President Isaac Herzog said on Sunday that US President Donald Trump was set to meet with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and possibly Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, although he gave no dates for the talks. The comments, delivered in an interview with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo, came in response to a question about Trump’s recently unveiled proposal to take over and redevelop the Gaza Strip. Herzog did not say when or where the meetings would take place, nor did he discuss their potential content. He also noted that Trump is due to meet with Jordan’s King Abdullah in the coming days, which Jordan’s state news agency has already reported. 'President Trump is due to meet with major, major Arab leaders, first and foremost the king of Jordan and the president of Egypt and I think also the crown prince of Saudi Arabia as well,' Herzog said. 'These are partners that must be listened to, they must be discussed with. We have to honor their feels as well and see how we build a plan that is sustainable for the future,' Herzog said. Saudi Arabia has flatly rejected Trump’s Gaza plan, as have many world leaders. Jordan’s King Abdullah plans to tell Trump during their planned Feb. 11 meeting in Washington that the proposal is a recipe for radicalism that will spread chaos through the Middle East and jeopardize the kingdom’s peace with Israel, Reuters reported earlier this week. The White House did not immediately respond to comment. It was not immediately possible to contact officials in Cairo and Riyadh.

Israel hits Syria-Lebanon arms smuggling tunnel	Additionally, the IAF struck Hezbollah sites in Lebanon containing munitions and rocket launchers that posed an 'imminent threat.' By JNS The Israeli Air Force on Sunday carried out a precision strike on a tunnel that according to the Israeli military was used by Hezbollah to smuggle weapons from Syria to Lebanon. According to the Israel Defense Forces, the tunnel in the Beqaa Valley had been struck previously, and was targeted again to prevent its restoration. Additionally, the IAF struck Hezbollah sites in Lebanon containing munitions and rocket launchers that posed an 'imminent threat,' according to the IDF. The IDF emphasized that these targets violated the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire and reaffirmed its commitment to preventing Hezbollah’s rearmament while upholding the truce. Israel on Saturday attacked Hezbollah forces in the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon and a facility in southern Syria belonging to the Gaza-based Hamas terrorist organization.

Poll: Americans back Trump’s Israel policies – but few support Ga...	New poll shows few Americans believe Trump is sincere about his Gaza relocation plan while a plurality of Israelis believe Trump's plan could realistically be implemented. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Americans and Israelis are deeply divided over President Donald Trump's Gaza resettlement plan, with a wide gap between the two populations regarding perceptions of the proposal's viability. Last Tuesday, President Trump held a joint press conference in the White House with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. During the press conference, Trump announced plans to permanently resettle the entire population of the Gaza Strip - officially listed by the Palestinian Authority at over 2.2 million, though some estimates place it as low as 1.7 million - to third-party countries. The plan was panned by leaders across the Arab world, with the foreign ministries of five European powers also distancing themselves from the proposal. The Israeli government, however, and a number of Republican lawmakers hailed the plan, with Prime Minister Netanyahu calling it the 'first good idea' he has heard on the issue of the post-war handling of the Gaza Strip. On Sunday, CBS News published a poll, conducted by YouGov, which surveyed 2,175 American adults from February 5th through the 7th, polling respondents on their views regarding Trump's job performance and specific issues, including his Gaza plan. A majority of 53% said they approve of his job performance thus far, and 59% back his program to deport large numbers of illegal immigrants from the U.S. Even more (64%) say they support deploying troops to the border with Mexico to rein in illegal border crossings. Fifty-four percent said they support Trump's handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict, but just 13% said they think Trump's plan to assume control over the Gaza Strip is a 'good idea.' Nearly half (47%) said it was a 'bad idea,' while 40% were unsure. In a separate poll, a plurality (47%) of Israelis say Trump's Gaza plan is realistic, compared to (38%) who say it is not, with 15% expressing no opinion. The poll, conducted by the Lazar Research Institute, found that respondents who said they voted for parties in the coalition government were far more likely to say Trump's plan was realistic than voters who backed parties in the opposition, with 78% of coalition voters saying the plan could be implemented, while 58% of opposition voters said it could not be.

Super Bowl halftime show performer detained over Palestinian flag	Neither the NFL nor the entertainment production company knew of the stunt ahead of time. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A backup performer flew a combined Sudanese and Palestinian flag during one of the shows put on at half time at the Super Bowl Sunday before running onto the field and being detained by police. The flags share the same colors, and the word 'Sudan' was written on the Sudanese half while 'Gaza' was written on the Palestinian half, with a heart painted in front of each name. The man, who was later confirmed to be part of the production cast of hundreds dancing while singer Kendrick Lamar performed, pulled it out of his pocket during Lamar’s last song. He held it up while standing on top of a car that was on the stage as part of the set. After waving it briefly, he jumped off the car and off the stage and ran around the sidelines of the football field waving the flag for several seconds before three security guards tackled him. They were joined by several others and dragged him quickly off the field. At no point was the performance stopped because of the stunt. In a statement, the Roc Nation entertainment company that produced the halftime show, which is watched by millions during the long intermission between halves of the championship game, said that the man’s act 'was neither planned nor part of the production and was never in any rehearsal.' The National Football League also said that 'the individual hid the item on his person and unveiled it late in the show' and that 'no one involved with the production was aware of the individual’s intent.' The league praised the security personnel 'for quickly detaining the individual who displayed the flag.' The New Orleans police said in a statement that 'law enforcement is working to determine applicable charges in this incident.' According to AP, one punishment had already been decided upon, as it reported that NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said that the protestor would be 'banned for life from all NFL stadiums and events' as a result. By displaying simultaneous support for both Gaza and Sudan, the man was seemingly showing that he backed both the Hamas terror organization in the Strip and the Houthi terrorist group that has taken over most of the North African country in a bloody civil war. The Houthis have showed their support for their fellow Iranian proxy during the 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas by periodically launching missiles at the Jewish state as well as at cargo ships going toward Israel and the Suez Canal, endangering a major international shipping lane.

Next US ambassador to Israel hints at changes of ‘biblical propor...	Former Governor Mike Huckabee, nominated as US Ambassador to Israel, says Hamas 'cannot exist,' lauds Trump's Gaza relocation plan. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump's nominee for the next Ambassador to Israel commended the president's proposed Gaza resettlement plan, and suggested that the president's second term in the White House could lead to geopolitical changes in the Middle East of 'biblical proportions.' On Sunday, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who has been tapped to serve as Trump's envoy to the Jewish state - pending his confirmation by the U.S. Senate - spoke with Fox News' Mario Bartiromo about the future of the Gaza Strip and the Middle East as a whole, following Trump's unveiling last Tuesday of his Gaza plan. 'I’m personally optimistic that we’re going to see something bold,' Huckabee said. 'I will use this term, Maria: I think we will see something of biblical proportion happen with his leadership in the Middle East.' The former governor, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and has in the past expressed opposition to Palestinian statehood, excoriated the Hamas terror organization, citing its record after seizing control of the Gaza Strip in 2007, less than two years after Israel withdrew from the territory in 2005. 'A lot of people forget that Gaza was once a place inhabited by both Jews and Palestinians, until 2005 when Ariel Sharon decided to give it all away,' continued Huckabee. 'He did. They militarily marched 10,000 Jewish people out of Gaza. Turned it into a complete Palestinian state, and the result we saw was [the Hamas-led attack on] Oct. 7th.' 'President Trump did something bold. He looked into the future and said kind of a what if. We don’t know exactly what might happen in Gaza, but here’s what could have happened in Gaza: Gaza could have been Singapore. Instead, Hamas turned it into Haiti. And in fact, maybe worse, far worse than that.' Hamas, Huckabee added, 'is not going to be able to exist,' saying the terror group's dismantling is a 'done deal.' Huckabee went on to laud Trump's Middle East policies during his first term in office, while backing his plan to facilitate mass migration out of the Gaza Strip. 'The only time we’ve had real, significant peace in that region was the four years that Donald Trump was president, and I’m very optimistic that with his leadership, his bold and innovative thinking—he doesn’t think like the other politicians and diplomats have thought, and thank God he doesn’t because we get results.' He throws the box away and says, let’s start with a blank slate and see where this could go. That’s leadership, and that’s what we have with President Trump.'

‘Powerful offensive in Judea and Samaria will continue’ – IDF chi...	The monthlong Islamic festival is often marked by an uptick in terror attacks in Israel, particularly in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria. By World Israel News Staff Outgoing Israeli army Chief-of-Staff pledged that the military would continue its 'powerful offensive' against terrorists in Judea and Samaria during an IDF exercise on Sunday. In late January 2025, the IDF launched Operation Iron Wall, a widescale counter-terror operation in Palestinian Authority-controlled enclaves within Judea and Samaria. The operation began as Israel released thousands of convicted terrorists from detention facilities, as part of a ceasefire and hostage exchange deal with the Hamas terror group. 'Looking ahead at the challenges in Judea and Samaria, we will maintain a strong and aggressive approach' towards rooting out terror in the region, HaLevi said to troops. 'Entering areas like Nur a-Shams, the Jenin refugee camp, and terror centers in Tulkarem, Hebron, and Sa'ir a-Shuyuh — whether to disrupt terrorist plans early or to prevent terrorists from carrying out imminent attacks — is the most effective strategy' for protecting Israel, HaLevi said. 'This effort must continue, and you are carrying it out with great precision and effectiveness.' HaLevi spoke to soldiers during a drill testing the operational readiness of the IDF's Central Command. According to an army media statement, the exercise simulated numerous responses to a number of potential scenarios involving national security. The statement noted that the army is stepping up its operational readiness ahead of the Islamic holiday of Ramadan, which begins in late February. The monthlong Islamic festival is often marked by an uptick in terror attacks in Israel, particularly in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria. The release of thousands of security prisoners to eastern Jerusalem and PA-controlled municipalities in Judea and Samaria has raised concerns about a potential wave of terror targeting Israeli civilians. In recent years, PA-controlled communities have been flooded with Iranian weapons, smuggled in from Jordan, adding to the security risks.

Ben-Gvir: ‘Stop providing humanitarian aid, fuel to Gaza’	We’ve become the joke of the Middle East - I’m not sure we even realize it yet,' said Otzma Yehudit Chair Itamar Ben-Gvir. By World Israel News Staff Former National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who resigned from the government with his Otzma Yehduit party over the approval of the ceasefire and hostage deal, is urging Israel to adopt a harsher stance towards Hamas in order to secure a decisive victory in the Gaza Strip. Ben-Gvir has been highly critical of Israel's practice of permitting the entry of humanitarian aid and fuel into the Strip, citing the fact that the vast majority of these supplies are usurped by Hamas. Speaking to radio station Kol BaRama on Sunday, Ben-Gvir said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had caved to pressure from the U.S. over the humanitarian crisis in the Strip, to the detriment of Israel's war aims. 'It’s not easy to stand up to the U.S. president, but I would expect the prime minister to stand by our truth,' Ben-Gvir said. He appeared to be referencing President Donald Trump's ultimatum that Israel agree to the ceasefire, which some have argued includes unfavorable terms for the Jewish State. 'We’ve become the joke of the Middle East - I’m not sure we even realize it yet,' he continued. 'A country doesn’t supply fuel to its enemy and provide humanitarian aid that ends up in Hamas’s hands - those who voted [to do so] knew exactly what they were doing.' Ben-Gvir has enthusiastically supported Trump's proposal to resettle Gazans outside of the Strip while the war-torn territory is rebuilt. But, Ben-Gvir stressed that he disagreed with Trump's recent statement that he is 'not in a rush' to implement the plan. 'We need to launch an initiative [as soon as] today to encourage voluntary migration,' Ben-Gvir told Kol BaRama. 'Trump says there is time, but [from Israel's perspective] there is no time,' he added. Ben-Gvir concluded the interview by reiterating the importance of ousting Hamas from power in the Strip, which is one of the stated goals of the war. He said that his Otzma Yehudit party would not re-join the government 'until we move toward toppling Hamas.'

Trump: ‘Freed Israeli hostages looked like Holocaust survivors’	Trump says that the U.S. is 'going to lose our patience' if Hamas abuse of captives continues. By World Israel News Staff President Donald J. Trump acknowledged the poor condition of recently released Israeli hostages on Sunday, saying that they resembled Holocaust survivors and that Hamas was testing the U.S.'s patience by mistreating captives. Speaking to the media aboard Air Force One, Trump said he was concerned by the apparent starvation endured by Or Levy, Ohad Ben-Ami, and Eli Sharabi, who were released on Saturday by the terror group. 'They were in horrible condition, they were emaciated, and I don’t know how much longer we can take that,' Trump said. The three Israelis 'look like they haven’t had a meal in a month,' Trump continued, adding that they are 'people that were healthy people a reasonably short number of years ago, and you look at them today, they look like they’ve aged 25 years, they literally look like the old pictures of Holocaust survivors, the same thing. No reason for that.' I watched the hostages come back today. And they looked like Holocaust surivors. They were in horrible condition. They were emacitated. It looked like many years ago the Holocaust survivors. I don't know how much longer we can take that&#8230;We're going to lose our patience'- Trump pic.twitter.com/axyUrhlzPG &mdash; Howard Mortman (@HowardMortman) February 9, 2025 Trump appeared to imply that Hamas' abuse of hostages could potentially endanger the ceasefire agreement. The hostages 'are in really bad shape, they have been treated brutally, horribly,' he said. Referencing captives who were released earlier in the deal, Trump notes that even as they 'they were in a little bit better shape [physically,] but mentally they were treated so badly. Who could take that? 'You know, at some point, we’re gonna lose our patience,' he added. The condition of Israeli hostages released in the deal has become progressively worse as the ceasefire continues. The first few batches of hostages freed appeared to be in relatively good health, but the last two weeks have seen the release of captives who are visibly starved. Negotiations for the next phase of the ceasefire and hostage exchange deal are currently ongoing in Qatar. During that stage, the Israeli army is expected to commit to a full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, along with the release of thousands of convicted terrorists from prison.

Elizabeth Pipko: Trump and Netanyahu—The Best Duo to Take on War ...	When it comes to bringing peace to people in Israel and in Gaza, a shift away from the status quo could be the only solution to this never-ending crisis.' By Linda Sadacka, Exclusive to World Israel News For those unfamiliar, Elizabeth Pipko is no ordinary political figure. A first-generation American, she was raised in a proud Jewish and Zionist household with deep roots in the struggle for Jewish identity and survival. At just 21, she started as a volunteer on Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign before quickly being hired full-time. She rose through the ranks, earning two Ivy League degrees, running a Super PAC, publishing a memoir, and becoming a political commentator. In 2024, she served as the Republican Party’s spokesperson in a historic election, solidifying her role as one of Trump’s most trusted advisors, particularly on Jewish affairs and Israel policy. Trump and Netanyahu: A partnership forged in strength With the certainty of someone who had witnessed history unfold behind closed doors, Pipko stated it plainly: 'President Trump wants the same that Israel wants.' She elaborated further: 'A decisive victory over monsters, but also a decisive victory that also ends with people coming back,' she said, her words weighted by the knowledge that, at that very moment, Israeli hostages were still being held in Hamas’s tunnels. When discussing Trump’s relationship with Netanyahu, she left no room for doubt. 'I’m not sure if there is a better duo to take on something like this than Trump and Netanyahu,' Pipko asserted. Addressing the widely discussed recent meeting between the two leaders—where Trump publicly proposed a plan for the United States to take over Gaza—Pipko didn’t hold back in her assessment. In a follow-up comment exclusive to World Israel News, she explained: 'People asked me for nearly four years why I was so confident that President Trump would again stand with Israel in a second term, as he did in his first. President Trump’s actions have always shown the world his intentions, and his actions this week were no different. It took Biden 1,293 days to welcome the leader of one of our closest allies, Israel, to the White House. For President Trump, it took 15.' It was, as Pipko had put it before, a stark contrast between a leader who understood Jewish destiny and one who treated Israel like an inconvenience. A new vision for Gaza—one that breaks the status quo The world had spent decades watching Gaza spiral into chaos. Politicians had come and gone, diplomats had sat at long tables discussing two-state solutions that never materialized, and the cycle of war and terror had continued unabated. But, according to Pipko, Trump wasn’t interested in maintaining a failed status quo. 'The fact is, Donald Trump is back in the White House because he is and always has been a breath of fresh air after the American people dealt with politician after politician who promised results and never delivered,' she said. 'When it comes to bringing peace to people in Israel and in Gaza, a shift away from the status quo could be the only solution to this never-ending crisis.' No vague platitudes. No meaningless calls for 'both sides' to show restraint. Just an understanding that history favored those who took decisive action. The fight against antisemitism: No room for negotiation The battle for Israel wasn’t just being fought on its borders. It was unfolding in the streets of New York, on Ivy League campuses, and in the halls of Congress, where lawmakers openly defended Hamas while claiming to be 'just anti-Zionist.' And Trump? He had no patience for it. Pipko made that abundantly clear when discussing the former president’s decision to cancel the visas of foreign students who support Hamas. 'He believes that if you stand in the United States and you support a terrorist group, maybe you shouldn’t be here,' she said bluntly. And, in case there was any doubt about her stance, she doubled down. 'There is good and there is evil. Donald Trump is very black and white; he is very much to the point,' she continued. No excuses. No middle ground. Just the reality that the people who hate Jews also hate America. 'The people who hate America and everything that we stand for, those are the same people that also hate everything that Jewish people and Israel stand for,' Pipko said, her voice carrying the weight of history behind it. Because she understood something that too many Jewish leaders refused to say out loud: Antisemitism isn’t just about Jews. It’s about civilization itself. More than politics—A deeply personal fight For Pipko, this wasn’t just politics. It was personal. She had spent nearly a decade fighting for President Trump, starting as a volunteer in 2016 and becoming one of his most trusted advisors, particularly on Jewish matters. And, as she sat inside the sanctuary of Park East Synagogue, she made it clear—her Jewish identity wasn’t just a footnote in her story. It was the foundation. She spoke of the synagogue’s importance in her life, its impact on her faith, and the unbreakable link between Judaism and the fight for Jewish survival. And that fight? It wasn’t just about policy or political alliances. It was about standing with those who were willing to act. Pipko had been with President Trump on October 7, 2024, when he became the first U.S. president to visit the Ohel (the burial place of the late Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe). She wasn’t just speaking from behind a desk in Washington. She had been there, walking alongside the man who, she believed, was the only one brave enough to do what needed to be done. Final thoughts—A war that must be won Trump and Netanyahu. A decisive victory. A new future for Gaza. Pipko hadn’t just laid out a vision—she had made it clear that this was a war that had to be won. And not just by Israel, but by everyone who understood what was at stake. Because history would not remember the ones who hesitated. It would remember those who fought.

Iran’s attempts on Trump’s life were more serious than initially ...	During his 2024 campaign, officials warned Trump that Iranian terrorists had access to surface-to-air missiles and were planning to crash his private plane. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Iranian plots to assassinate U.S. President Donald Trump were more serious than initially reported, according to Axios, quoting a book by Alex Isenstadt. The author reports that during his 2024 campaign, officials warned Trump that Iranian terrorists had access to surface-to-air missiles and were planning to crash his private plane. Isenstadt said concerns grew for Trump's safety after shots were fired at his golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida, in September. At one point, Trump's security team flew a decoy plane for his trip to meet with Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, and most of the staff weren’t aware of it until after takeoff. 'The boss ain't riding with us today,' White House Chief of Staff Chris LaCivita told the passengers, according to Isenstadt. 'We had to put him into another plane. This is nothing but a test for how things might unfold in the future.' The aides called the decoy plane situation 'surreal' and wondered why they were being kept on the plane if there was a threat of an Iranian attack. However, they were reassured that they weren't being used as bait. Trump's security staff also received a warning of a plot to shoot at Trump's vehicle in Long Island. When Trump visited Pennsylvania, a drone following his car was shot down. Shortly after taking office, Trump signed an executive order reinstating his 'maximum pressure' policy toward Iran. Last week, President Trump threatened to ‘obliterate’ Iran if the Islamic Republic attempted to assassinate him. Speaking with reporters while signing the sanctions order, Trump said that he had instructed his administration to devastate Iran in the event that he was assassinated by agents working on Tehran’s behalf.

Family of hostage Alon Ohel receives news he is alive, but wounde...	Alon Ohel's family: 'While we are relieved and emotional to learn that Alon is alive, we are devastated and shocked by his severe physical and mental condition.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The family of hostage Alon Ohel reported on Sunday that they have received signs of life, though there are also indications that he is wounded, untreated, and suffering in extreme conditions in captivity. The family released a statement urging the release of the remaining hostages and noted that Alon would spend his 24th birthday in Hamas captivity. They wrote, 'Tomorrow, Alon will spend his 24th birthday in Hamas captivity. We urge the prime minister, the cabinet, and the Israeli government—time is running out. The second phase of the deal must move forward to bring all the hostages home. It is your moral obligation to do everything possible to save Alon and the others.' Ohel, who was attending the Nova Music Festival on October 7, 2023, was kidnapped from the 'death shelter' in Re'im, where Hersh Goldberg-Polin lost his arm to a grenade before being taken hostage. Or Levy, who was released on Saturday, was abducted from the shelter along with Eliya Cohen. Ohel's family was informed that he was being held in tunnels alongside recently freed hostages and that he had a wounded eye but was not receiving adequate medical treatment. Along with other hostages, Ohel is being mistreated and suffering from severe malnutrition. The family's statement continued, 'While we are relieved and emotional to learn that Alon is alive, we are devastated and shocked by his severe physical and mental condition, as well as the ongoing abuse he and the other hostages endure.' It continued, 'Alon has survived this nightmare so far, but he is out of time. The release of the hostages cannot be delayed—they are all humanitarian cases!' 'We all sat in tears on Saturday, watching our dear brothers finally freed after their prolonged ordeal. We urge our leaders to take the necessary humanitarian action to rescue Alon and the other victims from the suffering they continue to endure,' they said.

‘Joe, you’re fired,’ Trump’s cuts off Biden’s intelligence access	Trump’s been on what his critics might call a revenge spree, targeting anyone who’s crossed him. By Jewish Breaking News President Donald Trump is not done with his predecessor just yet, having removed Joe Biden’s access to the nation’s most closely guarded secrets as political payback. 'There is no need for Joe Biden to continue receiving access to classified information. Therefore, we are immediately revoking Joe Biden’s Security Clearances and stopping his daily Intelligence Briefings,' Trump wrote on Truth Social after he arrived at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida for the weekend. 'He set this precedent in 2021, when he instructed the Intelligence Community (IC) to stop the 45th President of the United States (ME!) from accessing details on National Security, a courtesy provided to former Presidents.' Channeling his old reality TV catchphrase, Trump finished off with 'JOE, YOU’RE FIRED!' Biden’s decision to cut off Trump’s intelligence briefings came in February 2021, just weeks after the January 6 Capitol attack. It marked a sharp break from the longstanding tradition of former presidents receiving intelligence briefings after leaving office. At the time, Biden cited Trump’s role in inciting the riot and his persistent efforts to overturn the 2020 election results as evidence of 'erratic behavior' that made him unfit to receive sensitive intelligence. 'I just think that there is no need for him to have the intelligence briefings,' Biden told CBS News. 'What value is giving him an intelligence briefing? What impact does he have at all, other than the fact he might slip and say something?' But this isn’t just a one-off act of settling old scores. Trump’s been on what his critics might call a revenge spree, targeting anyone who’s crossed him. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, who helped coordinate the Justice Department’s response to the January 6 Capitol attack, saw her protective services revoked. Mike Pompeo, his former Secretary of State, has lost his security detail despite facing active threats from Iran. Similarly, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who frequently challenged Trump’s pandemic policies, was also targeted. Others caught in Trump’s retaliatory sweep include some of Biden’s highest-ranking officials. Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and former National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan both saw their security clearances stripped away. Taking aim at his prosecutors, Trump also revoked clearances from New York AG Letitia James and Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, who dragged his business empire and personal conduct into court.

Footage reveals Gazans violated ceasefire by approaching Israel’s...	Defense Minister Katz: 'Israel's security stance on Gaza remains firm: Anyone entering the buffer zone does so at their own risk.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Footage published on social media on Sunday showed Gazans approaching the border with Israel, violating the ceasefire agreement that requires a 700-meter buffer zone. The video showed Gazan civilians near Kibbutz Nahal Oz, prompting the IDF to fire shots into the crowd. Gazan media reported that three people were killed in the shooting. The IDF stated that it fired warning shots in multiple areas of Gaza. Defense Minister Israel Katz commented on the incident on Sunday night, saying, 'Israel's security stance on Gaza remains firm: Anyone entering the buffer zone does so at their own risk.' 'There will be no tolerance for those who pose a threat to IDF forces, the border region, or nearby communities. We will not allow a repeat of the events of October 7,' he continued. 'IDF troops acted appropriately today in identifying and neutralizing the threat, and this approach will continue. The IDF is fully prepared for any scenario and will respond decisively to any danger,' Katz stated. The IDF has cautioned Palestinians against approaching the Israeli border and the buffer zone within Gaza, where its troops are stationed. In a separate incident on Sunday, a Palestinian woman was reportedly killed east of the Al-Qarara suburb in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. During the latest round of hostage negotiations, Israel secured an agreement to maintain a buffer zone along its border with Gaza. Before Hamas's attack on October 7, 2023, the IDF had established a 300-meter (0.186-mile) no-man’s land along the border. While there was no permanent Israeli presence in this buffer zone, the IDF warned that any entry would be considered a hostile act and could be met with live fire. In the aftermath of the invasion, Israel began expanding the buffer zone, demolishing buildings on the Gaza side of the border and creating a roughly 1.5-kilometer (0.93-mile) sterile zone.

War disruptions lead to 13% rise in Israeli fresh produce imports...	The months from January to April saw the highest import volumes due to intense fighting and damage to frontline agricultural areas. By Pesach Benson, TPS Due to the war, Israeli imports of fresh vegetables rose 13 percent in 2024, the Agriculture Ministry reported on Sunday. Approximately 227,000 tons of fresh agricultural produce were imported, reflecting a 13% rise compared to 2023. This increase was necessary to compensate for damage to local production, labor shortages, and operational difficulties in frontline agricultural areas. Since October 7, the war 'posed an unprecedented challenge' to the 'continuity of the supply chain,' Agriculture Ministry Director General Oren Lavie said. 'Alongside the concern for full shelves in the marketing chains, we continue to invest in strengthening local production, out of a commitment to ensuring agricultural stability and food security in the years to come.' Despite disruptions, the government remains committed to increasing local agricultural production by 30% over the next decade. The five leading imported products — apples, onions, tomatoes, garlic, and pineapples — accounted for 75% of total imports. However, there was a decline in tomato and cucumber imports. The imported produce came from 30 countries, including Italy, the United States, Turkey, Greece, Jordan, Spain, China, and Poland. The months from January to April saw the highest import volumes due to intense fighting and damage to frontline agricultural areas. January recorded the highest import volume at 33,000 tons, followed by March, February, and April. Apple imports rose by 58% to 60,000 tons in 2024. The increase was attributed to difficulties in tending and harvesting orchards in northern communities near the Lebanese border. Apples were imported from 16 countries, with most coming from Italy, followed by the United States, Argentina, Greece, Moldova, and Spain. Onion imports doubled to 57,000 tons due to reduced local yields caused by propagation issues and disease. Most of the imported onions came from the Netherlands, which quadrupled its exports to Israel. Other sources included Turkey, China, Spain, and Greece. Tomato imports decreased by 35% to 30,000 tons. Early in the year, imports increased significantly as the war affected tomato production in the Negev. Jordan and Turkey were the primary suppliers, but exports from these countries ceased in mid-2024, leading to diversification of import sources. By December, only 100 tons of tomatoes were imported, as local production recovered. Garlic imports rose 30% to 13,000 tons due to 2022 tariff reductions impacting local production. Most came from China, with some from Jordan and Spain. Pineapple imports increased 64% to 10,000 tons, mainly from Costa Rica, with smaller amounts from Kenya and the Dominican Republic. Cucumber imports fell over 50% to 7,708 tons due to supply losses from Jordan, Turkey, and Gaza. In January, Israel and Thailand finalized an agreement to bring 13,000 Thai workers to work in farms, orchards, greenhouses and packing plants. There are currently more than 42,000 foreign workers working in Israeli agriculture, around 10,000 more than pre-war levels.

IDF expands northern Samaria operation to Nur al-Shams Camp	As of the latest Israel Defense Forces update, around 50 terrorists have been killed and more than 100 wanted suspects arrested since the operation began. By JNS Israel’s military has expanded its 'Iron Wall' counter-terrorism operation to the Nur al-Shams camp near Tulkarem in northern Samaria, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Sunday. 'We are crushing terrorist infrastructure in the refugee camps and preventing its return. We will not allow the Iranian axis of evil to establish an eastern terror front that threatens the settlements in Samaria, the seam line, and large population centers in Israel,' Katz tweeted. The move represents a further expansion of the operation, which began in the Jenin area on Jan. 21, with Israeli forces also targeting the area east of Jenin that includes Tubas, Tammun, Tayasir, Aqabah and Far’a. As of the latest Israel Defense Forces update, around 50 terrorists have been killed and more than 100 wanted suspects arrested since the operation began. As part of the latest wave of arrests in Jenin and Tulkarem, security forces targeted financial operatives, including money changers funding bomb-making, recruitment and arms procurement. The ongoing security threat was underscored on Tuesday when two soldiers were killed and eight others wounded in a terrorist shooting in northern Samaria. Despite the attack, 'Iron Wall' continues at full force, with IDF Central Command emphasizing that 'this attack only reinforces the operation’s necessity.' Over the past month, Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) agents, working alongside the IDF, have thwarted 90 major terrorist attacks, including 75 in Samaria, as security sources warn that Iran is fueling violence in Judea and Samaria. A security official identified Tehran as a central force escalating tensions by supplying weapons and financial aid to terrorist networks, significantly increasing the security threat, Israel’s Channel 12 News reported on Wednesday. The military has also announced plans to form a new battalion that will remain in the Jenin and Tulkarem areas beyond the duration of the operation.

Chief Prosecutor Khan first on US ICC sanctions blacklist	Khan, who is British, paid a visit to New York as recently as Jan. 27 to brief the U.N. Security Council on Sudan. By JNS Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, has become the first person working for the court to be subjected to economic and travel sanctions by the Trump administration, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters on Friday. U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday directing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to submit a report within 60 days naming people who should be sanctioned. Khan’s name was designated in an annex a day later, which was not yet made public, according to the report. Those blacklisted are barred from entry into the U.S., along with their families, and their U.S. assets are frozen. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who met last week with Trump in the White House, praised the move during a visit to Congress on Friday. He called the ICC 'scandalous,' saying it 'threatens the right of all democracies to defend themselves.' In November, the court issued arrest warrants for the Israeli premier and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes committed in Gaza. Trump’s move targeting the Hague-based ICC over its investigations of U.S. citizens and U.S. allies is a repeat of a measure he took during his first term, when in June 2020 he ordered economic and travel sanctions against International Criminal Court employees involved in an investigation into whether U.S. troops committed war crimes in Afghanistan. The tribunal on Friday decried the sanctions, vowing to back its staff and 'continue providing justice and hope to millions of innocent victims of atrocities across the world, in all situations before it,' Reuters reported. Two-thirds of the court’s member states, 79 in total, issued a joint statement warning that the U.S. measure could 'threaten to erode the international rule of law.' It added, 'Sanctions would severely undermine all situations currently under investigation as the Court may have to close its field offices.' Khan, who is British, paid a visit to New York as recently as Jan. 27 to brief the U.N. Security Council on Sudan. As the chief prosecutor is a frequent traveler to New York, U.N. deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said on Friday that 'we trust that any restrictions taken against individuals would be implemented consistently with the host country’s obligations under the U.N. Headquarters agreement.' Trump’s order from Thursday includes a declaration of a national emergency to respond to the court’s 'unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. 'The ICC’s recent actions against Israel and the United States set a dangerous precedent, directly endangering current and former United States personnel, including active service members of the Armed Forces, by exposing them to harassment, abuse and possible arrest,' the order states. Neither the United States nor Israel is a member of the court, which is a stand-alone entity and is not part of the United Nations. Both Washington and Jerusalem assert that they are not subject to the tribunal’s jurisdiction.

Israeli delegation arrives in Doha for ceasefire talks	Israel's Coordinator for the Hostages and the Missing has reportedly raised objections with mediators regarding the poor physical condition of released hostages. By JNS An Israeli delegation arrived in Doha, Qatar on Saturday night to continue the negotiations on the ceasefire with Hamas. U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff is mediating the latest round of talks. The working-level team includes Coordinator for the Hostages and the Missing Brig. Gen. (res.) Gal Hirsch and officials from the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet), Mossad and Israel Defense Forces. They were authorized to travel to the Qatari capital for technical discussions following the Gaza-based terrorist group’s release of three hostages and Israel’s release of 183 Palestinian terrorists on Saturday under the first phase of the truce. The Israeli Security Cabinet will convene on Monday to determine the negotiation team’s mandate, according to Hebrew media reports. Hirsch expressed anger over the poor physical condition of the three hostages released on Saturday, saying that Israel has raised objections with mediators and will respond accordingly. Jerusalem is evaluating the possibility of reducing aid shipments into Gaza, according to Israel’s Channel 12 News. According to Israeli estimates, there are 76 hostages still in Hamas captivity in Gaza, including 73 abducted during the Oct. 7 attacks.

Israeli president blasts BBC for comparing hostages to Hamas terr...	We are a democracy' - Israel's president castigates the BBC, accusing the media giant of drawing an 'outrageous' false equivalence between Israeli hostages and convicted Hamas terrorists jailed in Israel. By World Israel News Staff Israeli President Isaac Herzog appeared on the BBC Sunday morning to sharply criticize the British media giant over its coverage of the ongoing Gaza hostage deal, accusing the broadcaster of equating Israeli captives with Palestinian terrorists jailed in Israel. In an interview on the BBC's 'Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg,' Herzog said the outlet falsely suggested Israel mistreated convicted terrorists, drawing a false equivalence between the terrorists freed by Israel during the ceasefire with the Israeli hostages released by the Islamic terror group. 'I absolutely reject that, and I think that this equality that the BBC is always trying to make is outrageous and preposterous, absolutely not true,' Herzog said. 'We are a democracy. We abide by the rule of law. All prisoners in Israel get whatever is necessary as prisoners under the law, under the supervision of the court, even a Supreme Court justice recently visited the prisons.' 'And not only that, some of the prisoners, the Palestinians, didn't want to leave. They didn't want to go back to Gaza. They preferred staying in the Israeli prisons.' 'So of course, there's always this notion by the BBC, which is really outrageous in my mind, and I call upon all of you to stop that attitude and understand that this attack on October 7, was an attack on the entire free world, and what we are doing when we are catching terrorists who carried out these atrocities, we are simply preventing them from taking on further attacks against humanity at large,' Herzog continued. Herzog also highlighted the conditions under which the 76 remaining hostages are being held in the Gaza Strip, citing reports of hostages being kept in underground tunnels for months, deprived of adequate food and medical care, and suffering severe physical and emotional trauma. 'They were kept in tunnels throughout that period. They had no contact with the outside world. They hardly ate.' 'They became totally emaciated, and they have suffered a huge amount of bruises, pains and wounds, and of course, we haven't discussed the mental situation, but we are all shocked and horrified as we saw them emerging out of those terrible captivity tunnels of the brutal terrorists of Hamas.' Asked to respond to President Donald Trump’s recently unveiled Gaza plan, Herzog avoided directly commenting on the proposal,' saying only that he supported 'new ideas.' 'I would say that President Trump basically came forward and said something which I read as follows: Going back to the same routine of getting to a ceasefire – an arrangement and a Hamas attacks you, and then we go to war, and then terrible things happen – cannot go on.' We have to look for new ideas. And I believe that after he met with Prime Minister Netanyahu, now President Trump will meet with President El-Sisi of Egypt, with King Abdullah of Jordan.' 'I'm sure that they will have to express their views on the issue, and of course, they are our partners in peace processes, including the Abraham Accords partners, we’ll hear all of them, and we'll have to find a right way to make sure that what happened will not recur again, meaning that Hamas cannot rule Gaza anymore.'

Saudis respond to Netanyahu proposal to create Palestinian state ...	The Saudis can create a Palestinian state in Saudi Arabia; they have plenty of land over there,' said Netanyahu. By World Israel News Staff The Saudi government rebuffed suggestions last week that it use its own territory to facilitate the establishment of a Palestinian state. On Sunday, the Saudi Foreign Ministry issued a page-long statement rejecting comments by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made last week during an interview with Israel's Channel 14, during which the prime minister said, possibly intended as a joke, that Saudi Arabia itself furnish the land for a future Palestinian state. 'The Saudis can create a Palestinian state in Saudi Arabia; they have plenty of land over there,' Netanyahu said, in response to the oil-rich Sunni kingdom's recent statements linking normalization of ties with Israel to Palestinian statehood. Netanyahu went on to reiterate his opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state in Judea and Samaria. In response, Riyadh issued a 'categorical rejection' of 'what Benjamin Netanyahu stated regarding the displacement of the Palestinian people from their land.' The Saudi foreign ministry also condemned what it called the 'continuous crimes committed by the Israeli occupation against the Palestinian brothers in Gaza, including the ethnic cleansing they are subjected to.' 'The Kingdom affirms that the Palestinian people have a right to their land, and they are not intruders or immigrants to it who can be expelled whenever the brutal Israeli occupation wishes.' The statement echoed Saudi Arabia's insistence that any comprehensive deal with Israel include Jerusalem's acceptance of Palestinian statehood. 'The Kingdom also asserts that lasting peace will not be achieved except&#8230;through the two state solution.' Last week, Riyadh rejected claims by President Donald Trump on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia had privately dropped its insistence that normalization with Israel be accompanied by the establishment of a Palestinian state. The Saudis also publicly condemned Trump's Gaza plan, under which the U.S. will facilitate the mass resettlement of the Strip's entire population in third-party countries.

A closer look at the terrorists released from Israeli prisons	The ongoing first phase of the ceasefire is supposed to see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed over six weeks in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel released 183 imprisoned Palestinian terrorists on Saturday in exchange for hostages Or Levy, Eli Sharabi, and Ohad Ben Ami. The list includes 18 terrorists who were serving life sentences and 111 Palestinians from Gaza who were detained during the war. Here is a closer look at some of the terrorists who were freed. Falah Ratib Shahadeh, a Fatah figure who was servinga 27-year sentence for carrying out shooting attacks, planting bombs and recruiting terror cells during the Second Intifada. Shahadeh will be deported. Iyad Abu-Shkheidem, a member of Hamas who masterminded a double suicide bombing in Beer-Sheva in 2004 in which 16 people were killed and more than 100 injured. He was also accused of preparing a bomb belt for a terrorist in 2004 who was caught on his way to a Jerusalem restaurant. Yousef al-Mabhouh of Gaza was serving a 15-year term for firing rockets, planting bombs and working in Hamas tunnels. Mabhouh had an additional 15 years added to his sentence for stabbing a guard at the Nafha Prison. Hatem al-Jayousi, a founding member of Fatah’s Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades serving multiple life sentences for the murder of six Israelis. Ali Haroub, a Hamas bombmaker. In 2013, Israeli prison authorities thwarted a kidnapping plot that Haroub had planned from his cell. Jamal Tawil, a Hamas figure who had been working to extend the terror groups influence in Judea and Samaria. Arrested in 2021, Tawil was convicted of inciting violence, organizing riots, and trying to set up Hamas headquarters in Ramallah. Shadi Barghouti, who was serving 27 years for numerous shooting and bombing attacks. The ongoing first phase of the ceasefire is supposed to see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed over six weeks in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. The exact number will depend on how many are alive. Since the ceasefire went into effect, 583 Palestinian prisoners have been released. The fate of the remaining 65 hostages will be determined by negotiations during the ceasefire’s second phase. Critics say the phased approach condemns hostages not freed in the beginning to open-ended captivity and undermines Israel’s war gains. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 76 remaining hostages, more than 30 are believed to be dead.

Iran currency plunges to record lows amid escalating US tensions	Facing an official inflation rate of about 35%, Iranians seeking safe havens for their savings have been buying dollars, other hard currencies, gold or cryptocurrencies, suggesting further headwinds for the rial. By The Algemeiner and Reuters Iran’s currency fell on Saturday to a new all-time low against the US dollar after the country’s supreme leader rejected talks with the United States and President Donald Trump moved to restore his 'maximum pressure' campaign on Tehran. The rial plunged to 892,500 to the dollar on the unofficial market on Saturday, compared with 869,500 rials on Friday, according to the foreign exchange website alanchand.com. The bazar360.com website said the dollar was sold for 883,100 rials. Asr-e-no website reported the dollar trading at 891,000 rials. Facing an official inflation rate of about 35%, Iranians seeking safe havens for their savings have been buying dollars, other hard currencies, gold or cryptocurrencies, suggesting further headwinds for the rial. The dollar has been gaining against the rial since trading around 690,000 rials at the time of Trump’s re-election in November amid concerns that Trump would re-impose his 'maximum pressure' policy against Iran with tougher sanctions and empower Israel to strike Iranian nuclear sites. Trump in 2018 withdrew from a nuclear deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 and re-imposed U.S. economic sanctions on Iran that had been relaxed. The deal had limited Iran’s ability to enrich uranium, a process that can yield fissile material for nuclear weapons. Iran’s rial has lost more than 90% of its value since the sanctions were reimposed in 2018.

Israel forms draft plan to let Gazans leave by sea, air	While 69% of Israelis support the plan, with 18% opposing it, only 36% believe it's practical, as Arab countries and some Western governments oppose the idea. By JNS Israel has selected two potential exit points to allow Palestinians leave Gaza in accordance with U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent proposal to resettle the Strip’s population. At a briefing on Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces presented Defense Minister Israel Katz with a draft plan for safe passage, consisting of Ramon Airport, some 250 kilometers away from Gaza near Eilat, and Ashdod Port, about an hour’s drive up the Mediterranean coast from the Strip, according to an unnamed Israeli official cited in a report from Bloomberg on Friday. As things stand, the source continued, the military is assessing which of the five land crossings between the Strip and Israel would serve as a safe passageway with security screening. The idea of resettlement, suggested by Trump at a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the White House on Tuesday, received the backing of most Israelis, according to a Channel 12 News survey. However, while 69% supported the plan, with 18% opposing it, only 36% believed it was practical, as Arab countries and some Western governments voiced their opposition to the idea. Both Egypt and Jordan, named by Trump as potential destinations for the resettlement of Gazans, vehemently rejected the proposal. In Israel, reports emerged that OC Military Intelligence Directorate Maj.-Gen. Shlomi Binder issued a warning about the proposal, warning that it could trigger violence in Judea and Samaria. This propelled Katz to release a statement on Friday, saying, 'There will be no reality in which IDF officers will speak out against U.S. President Trump’s important plan regarding Gaza, and against the directives of the political echelon.' The Defense Ministry’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) unit was put in charge of the planning, the report read. During a meeting on Friday at the Oval Office with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Trump seemingly placed caveats on his proposal, saying there was 'no rush' to implement it. Trump said that his comments about Gaza being turned over from Israel to the U.S. as a 'real estate transaction' have been 'very well received,' and did not necessitate American soldiers being deployed to the Strip. 'We’re not talking about boots on the ground or anything, but I think the fact that we’re there, that we have an investment there, [will go] a long way to creating peace. We don’t want to see everybody move back and then leaving again in 10 years. We want to see stability and it would bring stability in the area,' the U.S. president said. Voluntary departure On Thursday, Katz said that he had instructed the IDF to prepare a plan to facilitate the voluntary departure of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip. 'The plan will include exit options at land crossings as well as special arrangements for exit by sea and air,' he said. 'I welcome U.S. President Donald Trump’s bold plan. The residents of Gaza should be allowed to enjoy the freedom of exit and migration as is customary everywhere in the world.' Katz went on to state that 'countries like Spain, Ireland, Norway and others, which have made false allegations against Israel’s actions in Gaza, should by any account allow every Gazan resident to enter their territory. Their hypocrisy will be exposed if they refuse to do so. There are countries like Canada, which has a regulated immigration program, that have expressed a desire in the past to absorb residents from Gaza.' Israel has been engaged in a devastating war in Gaza ever since Hamas carried out the single-day deadliest attack in Israel’s history on Oct. 7, 2023. The war has entered a ceasefire, hostages-terrorists exchange agreement phase over the past three weeks, as Washington seeks a permanent end to the conflict.

Trump’s aid cut to South Africa over its ICJ case against Israel,...	South Africa is 'undermining' US foreign policy and thus ‘poses national security threats' to America and its allies, said the executive order. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday cutting American aid to South Africa, citing, among other reasons, the country's legal case against Israel in the Hague, as well as South Africa's ties to Iran. 'South Africa has taken aggressive positions towards the United States and its allies, including accusing Israel, not Hamas, of genocide in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), and reinvigorating its relations with Iran to develop commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements,' the order noted. Pretoria, a harsh critic of Israel for many years, led the charge last year to accuse the Jewish state in the ICJ of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip in its defensive war against Hamas after the terror organization massacred 1,200 people in shootings, beheadings, burning and mass rapes during its October 7th, 2023 invasion. Israel has robustly defended its actions in the Strip to the Court, including by citing its low ratio of two noncombatants’ deaths to every terrorist killed, which is unheard-of in military conflicts. Much of its success was due to warning civilians out of battle zones ahead of time, and forming humanitarian corridors so they can leave safely, although this lost the IDF the element of surprise. Trump’s order also sharply criticized the black-led government of 'disregard of its citizens’ rights' in enacting an Expropriation Act that will make it easy to confiscate land from white Afrikaners without compensation, having 'countless' policies that reduce equal rights, and engaging in actions 'fueling disproportionate violence against racially disfavored landowners.' White Afrikaners own some 75% of the freehold farmland in the country. 'The United States cannot support the government of South Africa’s commission of rights violations in its country or its undermining United States foreign policy,' the order declared, 'which poses national security threats to our Nation, our allies, our African partners, and our interests.' All American agencies, including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) were ordered to halt their assistance to Pretoria. A back door was left open by the caveat that an agency head could permit provision of aid if the head deems it 'necessary or appropriate.' The order also introduced a policy of 'promot[ing] the resettlement of Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored, race-based discrimination.' South African President Cyril Ramaphosa responded by saying that his country 'will not be bullied' by the United States. The government’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation put out a statement charging that the 'foundational premise' of the order 'lacks factual accuracy' and was the seeming result of a 'campaign of misinformation and propaganda.' It ignored the foreign policy aspect of the order, only calling it 'ironic' that it 'makes provision for refugee status in the US for a group in South Africa that remains amongst the most economically privileged, while vulnerable people in the US from other parts of the world are being deported and denied asylum despite real hardship.'

Netanyahu defends Trump’s Gaza plan, says Gazans who eschew terro...	Israeli prime minister appears on Fox News during Washington trip to defend Donald Trump's plan to relocate Gaza's population, suggests Gazans who eschew terror will ultimately be able to return to the Strip. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended President Donald Trump's plan for resettling the Gaza Strip's entire population in third-party countries, while claiming that Gazans will eventually be allowed to return to the Strip if they so choose - so long as they eschew terrorism. Appearing on Fox News Saturday evening in a pre-recorded interview with Mark Levin, Netanyahu, who left Washington D.C. for Israel on Sunday, hailed Trump's proposal, first unveiled last Tuesday, as the 'first fresh idea in years.' 'It has the potential to change everything in Gaza,' Netanyahu added, calling it a 'novel approach, and the correct approach.' Netanyahu said the mass relocation would be entirely voluntary, rejecting accusations that it would constitute ethnic cleansing. It is 'not forcible eviction,' the premier noted. 'Not ethnic cleansing. Getting out from what all these countries and all these do-gooders say is an open-air prison. Why do you want to keep them in prison?' While Trump had on Tuesday appeared to suggest that Gazans would not return to the Strip, Netanyahu said that those who 'disavow' terror would eventually be permitted back. 'Give them an option to relocate temporarily while we rebuild the place physically and while we also rebuild it in terms of radicalization. You want to come back? You have to disavow terrorism, but you can come back.' Netanyahu also denied reports that he had torpedoed hostage deal talks throughout 2024, blaming the Hamas terror organization for the failure to reach a second deal earlier. 'That's false. It's the ones who are keeping them in those dungeons. These Hamas terrorists, it's not me.' The Israeli premier also touted the return of Israeli hostages during the November 2023 deal, the ongoing deal signed last month, and through rescue efforts since October 7th, 2023, saying that security experts had once predicted that few if any of the captives would be brought back alive. 'At the beginning of the war, people said, including the most senior defense officials, they said, ‘We're not going to get any of these hostages out. We have to assume that that's not going to happen.’' 'I said, ‘No. We're going to fight Hamas, and at the same time, we're going to release the hostages.’ And that's essentially what we've been doing up to now. I never gave up on them. And by the end of next week, we'll probably have about 75% of the living hostages. They're also holding bodies as hostages. I mean, these are monsters. But we're going to get 75% of the living hostages out, which, and I intend to get all of them out.'

IDF withdraws from Netzarim Corridor, bolsters Gaza border	The IDF began to withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor in late January, enabling the return of displaced Gaza residents to the northern Strip. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces redeployed from the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza to outposts along the perimeter of the Strip as part of the implementation of the hostages-terrorists swap agreement with Hamas. 'Forces from 162nd Division, 143rd Division and 99th Division under the Southern Command have been deployed at several points in the Gaza Strip region to strengthen the defensive layer for the residents of the western Negev and the State of Israel,' the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit said on Friday. Senior officers of the IDF’s Southern Command held a field assessment along with fighters on the ground in anticipation of the next phase of the release of the Israeli captives held in the Gaza Strip, the military said. The IDF began to withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor in late January, enabling the return of displaced Gaza residents to the northern Strip. Defense Minister Israel Katz emphasized that Israel will continue to strictly enforce the ceasefires, both with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, warning that any violation will be met with a strong response. Meanwhile, Gazan residents have been cautioned against approaching IDF troops, including near the Rafah Crossing and the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egyptian border. On Wednesday, IDF fighters fired on suspects who posed a threat to them in several parts of the Gaza Strip, the army said. In one instance in southern Gaza, soldiers identified suspects and fired warning shots to distance them. After the suspects continued advancing toward the troops, the troops fired 'additional shots to remove the threat.'

Could Turkey, Qatar face legal action for hosting Hamas?	Global coalition of 850 organizations combating antisemitism launch campaign pushing for legal action against leaders of Qatar, Turkey, and other states which harbor Hamas leaders or sponsor the group. By World Israel News Staff Hundreds of NGOs around the world are calling for legal sanctions against countries hosting Hamas' leadership, after three Israeli men released by Hamas Saturday showed signs of severe starvation. The Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM), a global coalition of 850 organizations fighting antisemitism, announced over the weekend the launch of a new international campaign pushing for legal action against Hamas and those nations that sponsor it and host its senior members, including Iran, Qatar and Turkey The bid was launched, CAM said, after the 'appalling images of the recent release of Israeli hostages,' who suffered long-term starvation while in Hamas captivity. 'What Hamas is doing is reminiscent of the Nazis, who also used murder, rape, torture and starvation against innocent Jewish victims during the Holocaust,' said CEO of CAM Sacha Roytman Dratwa. 'International law as we know it was formulated in the post-Holocaust era to ensure that these types of crimes against humanity would never happen again. However, they are happening before our very eyes, and the international community and so-called humanitarian NGOs appear to be reacting with a collective sigh of disinterest.' 'On the basis of international humanitarian law, crimes against humanity and international jurisdiction, we are calling for immediate legal action, not only against Hamas and its leaders but against all those countries which have assisted it and provide sanctuary to its leaders.' 'We should remain focused on the crimes of October 7th. We have to also draw attention and attach culpability to all those involved in the countless crimes of the murder, rape, maiming, torture and starvation of Israelis and other nationals being held in Gaza over the last 16 months since then.'

Police battle Bedouin crime in Negev with undercover operation	I was constantly afraid they might harm me,' says undercover agent of experience during 18-month-long investigation against Bedouin crime family. By World Israel News Staff Bedouinorganized crime families are facing a crackdown by Israeli police, as the authorities work to bust so-called 'protection' rackets and rampant intimidation in the Negev's construction industry. For years, residents of Israel's south have complained about deteriorating law and order in the region, including widespread extortion which sees business owner forced to pay monthly 'fees' to Bedouin mafias, or risk seeing their businesses vandalized or destroyed. Even local government tenders have been affected by organized crime, with mafias controlling the allocation of lucrative state contracts to specific construction companies. Speaking to Hebrew-language Ynet, two police officers recently involved in an advanced undercover operation revealed how the authorities are utilizing new strategies to combat the phenomenon in construction projects. The investigation began after numerous contractors who were awarded tenders to build a new neighborhood in the Bedouin town of Segev Shalom were intimidated by a local crime family. Claiming ownership rights over the land on which the neighborhood is slated to be built, the mafia has threatened contractors, burned their construction equipment, and scared workers away from the site, making the project's advancement impossible. The police planted undercover agents at the construction site, who posed as security guards and laborers. The agents were repeatedly directly threatened by members of the mafia, who told them to abandon the project or risk consequences targeting their families. One of the agents involved, who was identified only by his first initial A, told Ynet that the mafia have a sophisticated system in order to determine the identifies of those working at the site. A said that seemingly-innocent children were sent to ask workers their names and communities of origin. That information would be reported back to mafia leadership, who would then dispatch so-called 'soldiers' to threaten the families of those involved in the project. 'Throughout the work [at the construction site], my heart raced,' another undercover agent, identified as H, said. 'I was constantly afraid they might harm me,' he told Ynet, adding that as he 'drove around the area to check on the progress [of the building], there was always an ATV nearby with a masked man riding back and forth, reporting on our movements.' After an investigation lasting nearly 18 months, the police gathered enough evidence of threats and intimidation for a criminal indictment against two local crime families. In a statement to Ynet, the families' defense attorneys, Esther Bar Zion and Victor Uzan, claimed that their clients were innocent. 'These accusations are baseless and intended to intimidate the&#8230; families, as well as the broader Bedouin community. Behind the scenes, powerful economic interests, contractors and construction companies, are exploiting false complaints to secure police assistance in advancing construction projects, despite court orders delaying' construction projects, said Bar Zion and Uzan.

Trump expresses hope nuke deal can avert Israeli strikes on Iran	President Trump says he is pushing for a new nuclear deal with Iran to avoid Israel 'bombing the hell out of Iran.' By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump expressed his support last Friday for a new nuclear deal with Tehran, so long as it ensures Iran remains 'non-nuclear,' thus avoiding possible Israeli airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. The president spoke with The New York Post onboard Air Force One on Friday, discussing the war between Russia and Ukraine, his efforts to reach out to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the prospects of a new nuclear agreement with Tehran. Trump told the Post that favors negotiations to resolve the simmering tensions with Iran, and to avert Israeli military action against Iran's nuclear program. 'I would like a deal done with Iran on non-nuclear. I would prefer that to bombing the hell out of it,' Trump said. 'They don’t want to die. Nobody wants to die.' 'If we made the deal, Israel wouldn’t bomb them.' The president declined to share details on how he will handle talks with Tehran. 'In a way, I don’t like telling you what I’m going to tell them. You know, it’s not nice.' 'I could tell what I have to tell them, and I hope they decide that they’re not going to do what they’re currently thinking of doing. And I think they’ll really be happy.' Trump's comments on Friday echoed a statement he issued via his Truth Social account last Wednesday, emphasizing his preference for a negotiated settlement to ensure Tehran does not acquire nuclear capabilities. 'I want Iran to be a great and successful Country, but one that cannot have a Nuclear Weapon. Reports that the United States, working in conjunction with Israel, is going to blow Iran into smithereens,' ARE GREATLY EXAGGERATED,' Trump wrote. 'I would much prefer a Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper. We should start working on it immediately, and have a big Middle East Celebration when it is signed and completed. God Bless the Middle East!'

Jew-hating UN official: Israel ‘arrogant’ for leaving HRC	Albanese did not acknowledge that the populations of both Gaza and Palestinian Authority-controlled enclaves in Judea and Samaria have grown since October 7th, which disproves her allegation of genocide against the Palestinian. By World Israel News Staff A virulently antisemitic and anti-Israel United Nations official expressed outrage last week over Israel's decision to withdraw from the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), deeming the move 'extremely serious.' United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on the Palestinian territories Francesca Albanese has a long history of remarks indicating a deep bias against Jews and Israel. In a recent interview with Reuters, Albanese blasted Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar's statement about Israel's reasons for withdrawing from the council, in which he noted a disproportionate number of resolutions condemning Israel by the body. Sa'ar's statements about the council's unrelenting persecution oft Israel 'shows the hubris and the lack of realization of what they [Israel] have done,' Albanese claimed to Reuters. She said that by withdrawing from the body, Israel is 'insist[ing] in self-righteousness, that they have nothing to be held accountable for, and they are proving it to the entire international community.' Referring to ongoing counter-terror operations being carried out in Jenin and other hotbeds of Islamic extremism in northern Samaria, Albanese said she was 'concerned' that the Israeli 'genocide' was expanding. 'The north [of Samaria] is being attacked primarily by soldiers. The south has been attacked primarily by [Israeli] settlers, and you can see this as an assault on the Palestinian people as a whole,' Albanese told Reuters. Albanese did not acknowledge that the populations of both Gaza and Palestinian Authority-controlled enclaves in Judea and Samaria have grown since October 7th, which disproves her allegation of genocide against the Palestinian. Albanese slammed a proposal by President Donald Trump for the U.S. to assume control of rebuilding Gaza, which would include the temporary resettlement of Gazan civilians in other countries. She blamed the U.S. president for 'destroying the basic principles of respect for human rights across a huge spectrum, not just in Palestine,' adding that the world has 'moved further towards the abyss.' Albanese said she was baffled by the relatively lowkey European pushback to the outline. 'I'm surprised that European states are staying silent instead of rising up and saying, 'This is utter nonsense, and we will not tolerate this',' she said.

Or Levy, Eli Sharabi, Ohad Ben Ami freed from Gaza, resemble Holo...	Israelis are drawing chilling parallels to the Muselmann—a term from the Holocaust used to describe Jewish prisoners in Nazi concentration camps who were starved to the brink of death. World Israel News and JNS Staff Three Israelis were freed on Saturday after 491 days in Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip, bringing the total number of hostages redeemed in the ongoing first phase of the ceasefire agreement to 21. Or Levy, 34, Eli Sharabi, 52, and Ohad Ben Ami, 56, were handed over by the Red Cross officials to Israel Defense Forces troops at around 11:15 a.m. local time and driven back to Israeli territory some 30 minutes later. The IDF brought the freed hostages to a facility near the border for a preliminary physical and psychological examination, and to meet with their families. Before their release, Hamas paraded the hostages on a stage in front of a raucous crowd of Palestinians in central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah. The three men appeared frail and emaciated. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office released a statement welcoming home the captives. 'The government of Israel embraces the three returnees,' it read, adding, 'The shocking images that we have seen today will not go unaddressed. 'The government, together with all of the security officials, will accompany them and their families. The government of Israel is committed to returning all of the hostages and the missing,' it continued. The PMO statement concluded with a quote from Psalms (31:15): 'Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, from those who pursue me.' The condition of the hostages has sparked intense reactions across social media. Many Israelis are drawing chilling parallels to the Muselmann—a term from the Holocaust used to describe Jewish prisoners in Nazi concentration camps who were starved to the brink of death. The hostages appeared visibly frail, showing signs of extreme exhaustion and severe weight loss. Their protruding bones, sunken cheeks, and pronounced clavicles and Adam’s apples painted a harrowing picture of malnutrition and muscle atrophy. For many, these haunting images are a stark reminder of history, with some online noting a tragic resemblance to the suffering endured by Muselmann prisoners during one of humanity’s darkest periods. 'This is what a crime against humanity looks like!' Israeli President Isaac Herzog wrote in a post on X. 'The whole world must look directly at Ohad, Or, and Eli—returning after 491 days of hell, starved, emaciated and pained—being exploited in a cynical and cruel spectacle by vile murderers. We take solace in the fact that they are being returned alive to the arms of their loved ones,' Herzog wrote. 'Completing the hostage deal is a humanitarian, moral, and Jewish duty. It is essential to bring back all our sisters and brothers from the hell of captivity in Gaza—every last one of them!' he added. 'A psychological war is being waged that can cause harm to us,' said Dr. Gilad Bodenheimer, chief of the ministry’s mental health division. 'We urge the public to minimize exposure to distressing images and videos and to be mindful of what they, their children and their loved ones are seeing.' Added the Hostage and Missing Families Forum: 'The disturbing images from the release of Ohad, Eli and Or serve as yet another stark and painful evidence that leaves no room for doubt—there is no time to waste for the hostages!' Levy was kidnapped from the Supernova music festival near Kibbutz Re’im during the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre. His wife, Eynav, was killed; their now three-year-old son Almog has been living with his grandparents since the terrorist assault. Sharabi and his brother Yossi were abducted from Kibbutz Be’eri during the Palestinian invasion. Sharabi’s wife and daughters were murdered in their home during the attack, while Yossi has since been confirmed dead, his body still being held in Gaza. Ben Ami was taken from Be’eri along with his wife, Raz, who was freed as part of a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. In return, Israel was set on Saturday to release 183 Palestinian terrorists: 18 serving life sentences, 54 serving lengthy terms and 111 who were arrested in Gaza during the war. Last Saturday, Israelis Yarden Bibas, Ofer Kalderon and Keith Siegel were freed from Gaza. Two days earlier, three Israelis—IDF soldier Agam Berger, 20, along with civilians Arbel Yehud, 29, Gadi Mozes, 80, and five Thai farm workers—Pongsak Thaenna, Sathian Suwannakham, Watchara Sriaoun, Bannawat Saethao and Surasak Lamnao—were redeemed from terrorist captivity. The previous week, Jerusalem redeemed four female IDF soldiers—Karina Ariev, 20; Daniella Gilboa, 20; Naama Levy, 20; and Liri Albag, 19—who were abducted from the Nahal Oz base during the Hamas-led invasion. Three civilian women—Emily Damari, Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher—were released on Jan. 19, shortly after the ceasefire went into effect. According to Israeli estimates, there are 76 hostages still in Hamas captivity in Gaza, including 73 abducted during the Oct. 7 attacks. Of the 251 hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, 178 have been returned or rescued, and Hamas is believed to be holding 35 bodies, 34 of them taken during the cross-border invasion and that of IDF Lt. Hadar Goldin, which was taken by the Palestinian terrorist group in 2014.

Details of horrific conditions in captivity revealed by hostages	The hostages had no access to media and were unaware of the details of the October 7th massacre. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The testimonies of the three hostages released on Saturday night—Ohad Ben-Ami, Eli Sharabi, and Or Levy—reveal that they suffered physical and mental abuse, were starved, and were confined to tunnels without exposure to daylight. Additionally, they had no access to media and were unaware of the details of the October 7 massacre. Eli Sharabi was unaware that his wife, Lianne, and their two daughters—13-year-old Yahel and 16-year-old Noya—had been murdered during the attack. He only discovered the tragic news upon his release. Hamas captors increased the hostages' food intake before their release, likely in an attempt to conceal human rights abuses. Dr. Hagar Mizrahi, head of the Health Ministry's General Medicine Division, said, 'The harrowing images of the three released hostages reinforce reports of severe abuse during their captivity.' 'They have endured significant malnutrition, a testament to the horrors they faced. These images are deeply distressing—not only for the families welcoming their loved ones home but also for those still waiting for their hostages to return,' Dr. Mizrahi added. After medical staff at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and Sheba Medical Center examined the freed hostages, they concluded that the men had lost around 30% of their body weight. Upon his release, Or Levy, who was kidnapped at the Nova Music Festival, requested to meet with the parents of Aner Shapira, whom he last saw at the bomb shelter in Re’im. He mistakenly believed that Hersh Goldberg-Polin and Almog Sarusi had been released, but both had been murdered in captivity. Netanyahu, who is currently visiting officials in Washington, D.C., released a statement welcoming the hostages' release but expressing outrage over their condition. 'The Israeli government welcomes the hostages' return, confirming to their families that they are now in the care of our forces,' the statement read. Reacting to images of the freed hostages in their starved condition, Netanyahu added, 'The shocking images that we have seen today will not go unaddressed.' The PMO also stated, 'Given the critical condition of the three hostages and Hamas’s repeated violations, Prime Minister Netanyahu has ordered that this not be overlooked and that appropriate action be taken.'

Netanyahu, who is currently visiting officials in Washington, D.C., released a statement welcoming the hostages' release but expressing outrage over their condition. 'The Israeli government welcomes the hostages' return, confirming to their families that they are now in the care of our forces,' the statement read. Reacting to images of the freed hostages in their starved condition, Netanyahu added, 'The shocking images that we have seen today will not go unaddressed.' The PMO also stated, 'Given the critical condition of the three hostages and Hamas’s repeated violations, Prime Minister Netanyahu has ordered that this not be overlooked and that appropriate action be taken.'

His wife and daughters murdered, his brother declared dead	The story of Ohad Ben Ami’s captivity crystallizes the ongoing hostage crisis through intimate family details: a daughter discovering her father’s capture through social media; a wife returning home alone from Hamas captivity; and a warm home in Kibbutz Be’eri that stands empty, waiting for his return. By Noam Dvir, JNS Eli Sharabi, 52, was released from Hamas captivity on Saturday, alongside Ohad Ben Ami and Or Levy. He was abducted from his home in Kibbutz Be’eri on Oct. 7, 2023, the day of the Hamas-led massacre. But his story is not just one of abduction, it is a family tragedy. His wife, Lianne, and their two daughters, 13-year-old Yahel and 16-year-old Noya, were murdered. He now has to face the harrowing reality that his immediate family has been wiped out. 'We are overwhelmed and so happy to hear Eli’s name on the list of those returning tomorrow. I want to thank everyone and all of Israel for standing with us. Now, please let us support Eli and protect his privacy,' said the wife of Yossi Sharabi, Eli’s sister-in-law, whose husband was murdered in captivity and whose body remains in Gaza, said on Friday. At the same time that Eli was taken, his brother Yossi, 51, who also lived in Be’eri, was kidnapped. Hamas later released a video of him in captivity, but in June, the IDF informed the family that he had been murdered and that his body was being held in Gaza. A brother fighting for his life The Sharabi family consists of five siblings, two of whom were taken hostage. Stepping into the role of a determined advocate, 48-year-old Sharon Sharabi has become the face of the fight for their return, battling for the release of his brother Eli, who was considered alive in captivity, and for Yossi’s body to be brought home for burial. 'Beyond being brothers, we are also best friends,' Sharon shared. 'We don’t even have time to grieve because we are fighting for Eli’s life.' Rotem, Sharon’s daughter and Eli’s niece, also spoken out about the toll on the family. 'What we’ve been going through since then is unbearable. We are not the same family we used to be, something in our bond has been fractured, and it will never be the same again.' Eli is described as a sharp-minded man, a natural leader who always takes command. But in captivity, he was utterly powerless. The hope for a mother’s embrace The Sharabi family originally lived in Tel Aviv. As a teenager, Eli moved to Be’eri and fell in love with life on the kibbutz. His younger brother Yossi followed him, and together they built their lives there. Their 75-year-old mother was initially shielded from the news of their abduction to spare her the pain. Eventually, the family had no choice but to tell her the truth. Sharon pictured the emotional moment of reunion. 'I can see the moment my mother hugs Eli, after we’ve lost four family members, Lianne, his wife, and their two daughters, Noya and Yahel. I will let my sisters have their moment first, and then I will say the Shehecheyanu blessing for having reached this time. And then, I will give him the biggest hug I know how to give, with the entire nation behind us.' Ohad Ben Ami with his daughter Ella. Credit: Courtesy. ‘They are with us. I hear gunshots’: Ohad Ben Ami’s message before captivity The story of Ohad Ben Ami’s captivity crystallizes the ongoing hostage crisis through intimate family details: a daughter discovering her father’s capture through social media; a wife returning home alone from Hamas captivity; and a warm home in Kibbutz Be’eri that stands empty, waiting for his return. This 56-year-old resident, taken from his home in sleepwear alongside his wife, Raz, during the Oct. 7 attack, represents one of the many personal tragedies still unfolding in the wake of Hamas’s assault on Israel’s Gaza border communities. Ohad and Raz’s ordeal began during the Oct. 7 attack on Be’eri, after an extended period hiding in their safe room. The terrorists, who initially passed by their seemingly empty house, later returned. Ohad’s last message to his daughter was chilling: 'They are with us. I hear gunshots.' The enduring image of his capture shows him being led away by terrorists, dressed only in a short-sleeved shirt and underwear, while his Raz, 57, was similarly taken in her sleepwear. Soon after being freed from Hamas captivity in November 2023 as part of the first ceasefire deal, Raz shared her anguish: 'My husband, Ohad, the love of my life and father of my children, remains in captivity. On October 7, the terrorists shattered our paradise and dragged us in our pajamas into hell. The world must not maintain its silence. Each day he spends there endangers his life. Bring him home now.' Or Levy. Credit: Israel Hayom. The murdered wife, the young son waiting to see him: The story of Or Levy The couple arrived at the Supernova music festival nine minutes before hell broke loose. As the Gazan rockets rained down, they ran for shelter. Or called his mother, Geula, and told her, 'Mom, you don’t want to know what’s happening here.' That was the last time his family heard his voice over the phone. Ten minutes later, Hamas terrorists threw grenades and opened fire in all directions. Einav was murdered, and Or was abducted into the tunnels of Gaza. The boy who keeps asking about his parents Or, a software developer by profession, is the father of Almog, who celebrated his third birthday without his parents. He has been raised by his grandparents, and as time passes, his memories of his mother and father are fading. 'Almog keeps asking about his mom and dad,' said his uncle, Michael, in a speech at the U.N. 'Even when we try to explain, he doesn’t understand why he can’t see his father or what the words ‘Mom is never coming back’ mean. But this boy can still get his father back. Don’t let him become an orphan from his father too.' The abduction footage The Hamas terrorist organization has not released any documentation of Or Levy from captivity, nor has it been reported in the media who among the hostages has seen him or when. However, two videos shed light on what happened to him. The first is footage from the bomb shelter that has since been dubbed the 'death shelter,' capturing the moments of terror. Michael, Or’s brother, described the harrowing video: 'The last image we have of him is heartbreaking—covered in his wife’s blood, dazed and terrified. It’s an extremely difficult video to watch. Or is seen surrounded by bodies, one of them Einav’s. The terrorists can be heard speaking Arabic to one another, saying that someone is still alive. They ask Or if he is a soldier. You can hear him begging them not to take him, not to shoot him. That video was the first time I saw what had happened to Or.' Michael added, 'He’s my younger brother. All these years, I was the one protecting him. It was unbearable to see the horror on his face in the most terrible moments of his life, knowing that there was nothing I could do to help him.' Additionally, in June 2024, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum released a video showing the terrorists driving toward Gaza in a pickup truck on Oct. 7. Inside the vehicle were four hostages, including the late Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eliya Cohen, and Or. Originally published by Israel Hayom.

US Supreme Court to weigh landmark terrorism case targeting Pales...	If the justices rule in favor of the plaintiffs, it could set a precedent allowing American victims of international terrorism to pursue legal claims against foreign entities that support or enable such attacks. By Debbie Weiss, The Algemeiner In a case that could redefine the legal landscape for victims of terrorism seeking justice, the US Supreme Court is set to hear arguments against the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) over their role in incentivizing violence against Americans abroad. The high-profile brief — filed this week by a legal coalition and more than a dozen organizations in response to the 2018 murder of Israeli-American Ari Fuld by a Palestinian terrorist — calls on justices to hold the Palestinian leadership accountable for its controversial 'pay-for-slay' program. The amicus brief, submitted on Tuesday by the International Legal Forum (ILF) and 16 other Jewish and pro-Israel organizations, argues that the PA and PLO have long been complicit in orchestrating and financially rewarding acts of terror. 'Since their founding, the PLO and the Palestinian Authority have been an instrumental element in inciting, funding, and rewarding terrorism, especially through the pay-for-slay program,' ILF CEO Arsen Ostrovsky told The Algemeiner. 'They are not a powerless bystander but a leading driver of modern-day terrorism. Enough is enough.' The so-called 'pay-for-slay' scheme has been widely condemned by US lawmakers, with reports estimating that approximately 8 percent of the PA’s budget is allocated to paying stipends to convicted terrorists and their families. As outlined in the ILF’s legal filing, 'the more deadly the attack and the longer the terrorist spends in prison, the greater the stipends they receive.' The legal brief contends that the US Congress has clear constitutional authority to permit American victims of Palestinian terrorism to sue the PA and PLO in US courts, since these entities have maintained a presence on American soil and were previously warned that their activities could expose them to legal action. Palestinian leaders 'had been on notice that their activities would subject them to jurisdiction, yet have continued to reward and sponsor terrorism regardless,' Ostrovsky said. The lawsuit was initially filed under the US Anti-Terrorism Act by Fuld’s widow and other American victims of Palestinian terror, seeking damages from the PA and PLO. However, the case faced a major setback in 2023 when the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that US federal courts lack jurisdiction over the Palestinian entities, citing concerns over the due process rights of foreign organizations. Congress attempted to address this legal gap in 2019 with the passage of the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA), which sought to ensure that the PA and PLO could be held accountable in American courts if they funded attacks against US citizens or conducted activities within the United States. The brief argues that the PA and PLO have done both, and therefore must face legal consequences. 'It is imperative to hold not only Hamas accountable, but the Palestinian leadership as well,' Ostrovsky said. 'Acts of terror, such as the one that claimed the life of Ari Fuld, do not occur in a vacuum. They are the direct result of a pervasive Palestinian infrastructure that indoctrinates hate and incentivizes violence.' The development coincides with an ongoing ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, which included the release last month of Ari Fuld’s killer, Khalil Jabarin. Ari Fuld’s brother, Hillel Fuld, said the family’s 'personal grievance and loss was currently amplified' by Jabarin’s release from prison. Reflecting on the hostage deal that saw Jabarin walk free — financially secure by Palestinian standards due to the pay-for-slay stipends he received while in prison — Fuld acknowledged that the situation was 'not black and white.' 'On the one hand this is a terrible, terrible deal from a strategic perspective, and there’s no sugarcoating the fact that letting go of thousands of monsters is just horrible,' he told The Algemeiner. 'The flip side is that it’s the most beautiful thing there is to see those families reunited, and it’s a fundamental pillar of Judaism to free our prisoners, our people, and our soldiers need to know that we will do whatever it takes to bring them back if such a thing happens to them.' Ostrovsky expressed his hope that the Supreme Court would hold Palestinian leaders accountable and prevent them from 'rewarding and underwriting murderers of American nationals abroad, like Ari Fuld.' The court’s decision to take up the case marks a pivotal moment in US counterterrorism law. If the justices rule in favor of the plaintiffs, it could set a precedent allowing American victims of international terrorism to pursue legal claims against foreign entities that support or enable such attacks. The brief was filed on behalf of ILF by the Holtzman Vogel law firm as well as the National Jewish Advocacy Center, with oral arguments expected later in the year.

IDF strikes terror targets in Syria and Lebanon	The IAF struck a Hamas weapons storage facility in Syria, and another attack targeted and eliminated Hezbollah terrorists in the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon. By JNS The Israeli Air Force on Saturday attacked a facility in southern Syria belonging to the Gaza-based Hamas terrorist organization, the IDF said. 'A short while ago, Israeli Air Force fighter jets, guided by the Intelligence Directorate and Northern Command, struck a Hamas weapons storage facility in the Deir Ali area of southern Syria. The weapons were intended for perpetrating terror attacks against IDF forces,' the Israel Defense Forces Spokesperson’s Unit said. 'The Palestinian terror organizations, led by Hamas, operate by exploiting Syrian territory to establish terrorist activities under Iranian direction,' the military added. It went on to say that Israel will continue to strike Hamas 'wherever it attempts to establish itself' and will act against terrorist efforts 'to expand and strengthen [their forces].' The Israeli Air Force on Saturday attacked Hezbollah forces in the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces Spokesperson’s Unit said. 'An IAF aircraft conducted an intelligence-based strike on Hezbollah operatives in the area of the Beqaa in Lebanon,' the statement read. 'The strike was conducted after the terrorists were operating in a strategic weapons manufacturing and storage site belonging to the terrorist organization,' the military continued. 'The activity at the site is a broad violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon,' it stressed, referring to the ceasefire terms with Hezbollah signed on Nov. 26. 'The IDF continues to operate to remove any threat to the State of Israel and will prevent any attempt by the Hezbollah terrorist organization to rebuild its forces, in accordance with the ceasefire understandings,' the statement concluded. This was the second consecutive day in which the IAF carried out attacks in the Land of the Cedars. The Air Force conducted precision strikes overnight Friday inside Lebanon, targeting two sites containing Hezbollah weapons. The military did not specify the location of the sites. On Monday, Israeli forces dismantled Hezbollah infrastructure in Southern Lebanon, as part of the Israel Defense Forces’ ongoing defensive operations there, the military said. Soldiers from the 769th 'Hiram' Territorial Brigade and 7th 'Storm from the Golan' Armored Brigade located weapons storage facilities containing what the IDF said were significant stockpiles of military equipment. Additionally, Israeli forces killed several Hezbollah operatives in the area and detained individuals who posed a threat to their mission.

State Dept notifies Congress of $7 billion arms sale to Israel	The first arms package, valued at $6.75 billion, includes a range of munitions and bomb components set for delivery this year, while the second, worth $600 million, consists of 3,000 Hellfire missiles scheduled for delivery in 2028. By JNS The U.S. State Department has notified Congress about its plan to sell $7 billion worth of weapons to Jerusalem, on the backdrop of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to the White House last week. As the formal notice typically comes after an appeal to the top four lawmakers on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who can raise objections, an approval by Congress is now more likely to occur, the Associated Press reported on Saturday. The plan consists of two separate plans that were submitted to Congress on Friday. The first includes an array of The first arms package, valued at $6.75 billion, includes a range of munitions and bomb components set for delivery this year, while the second, worth $600 million, consists of 3,000 Hellfire missiles scheduled for delivery in 2028.munitions from 166 small-diameter bombs to 2,800 500-pound bombs, as well as thousands of guidance kits, fuses and other bomb components and support equipment, totaling $6.75 billion and to begin delivery this year, according to the report. The second arms package, for $600 million, includes 3,000 Hellfire missiles and will begin its delivery in 2028, with additional training by the U.S. military. Since entering into office on Jan. 20, U.S. President Donald Trump lifted a partial arms embargo on 2,000-pound bombs to Israel, withheld by the Biden administration over concerns about the war in Gaza. To a question as to why he released the bomb sale, Trump responded, 'Because they [Israel] bought them.' Netanyahu was the first foreign leader to meet Trump at the Oval Office after his second inauguration, where the president proposed a plan to allow the Palestinian to voluntarily depart from the Gaza Strip and permanently resettle elsewhere. The two men also discussed the present Gaza ceasefire, as well as the strategy to stop Iran from attaining nuclear weapons. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier in the month that Netanyahu and his team are expected to press Trump to move forward with a separate set of arms transfers initially requested by the Biden administration, totaling more than $8 billion. 'The weapons haven’t yet received full approval because of a hold by some Democratic lawmakers,' the paper noted, citing a congressional official. Democrats have continued to express reservations about the weapons deal as they engage with the new administration, said a spokesman for the Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. In the wake of Trump’s shipment approval regarding 2,000-pound bombs, Netanyahu said in a video message, 'Thank you, President Trump, for keeping your promise to give Israel the tools it needs to defend itself, to confront our common enemies and to secure a future of peace and prosperity.'

Netanyahu vows to take ‘appropriate action’ after hostages return...	FM Gideon Sa'ar: 'Hamas terrorists and Gaza residents appear well-fed, while the Israeli hostages resemble Holocaust survivors.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement on Saturday, declaring that 'appropriate action' will be taken in response to the emaciated condition of three male hostages freed from Hamas captivity. Hostages Or Levy, Eli Sharabi, and Ohad Ben Ami were released Saturday after 491 days in captivity. After medical staff at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and Sheba Medical Center examined the freed hostages, they concluded that the men had lost around 30% of their body weight. The hostages, who had to be supported while walking and standing by Hamas terrorists, were forced to speak to a crowd in Gaza before being handed over to the Red Cross. Netanyahu, who is currently visiting officials in Washington, D.C., released a statement welcoming the hostages' release but expressing outrage over their condition. 'The Israeli government welcomes the hostages' return, confirming to their families that they are now in the care of our forces,' the statement read. Reacting to images of the freed hostages in their starved condition, Netanyahu added, 'The shocking images that we have seen today will not go unaddressed.' The PMO also stated, 'Given the critical condition of the three hostages and Hamas's repeated violations, Prime Minister Netanyahu has ordered that this not be overlooked and that appropriate action be taken.' The Hostage and Missing Families Forum compared the sight of the emaciated hostages to images of Jewish prisoners liberated from Nazi death camps during the Holocaust. 'The shocking images of Ohad, Eli, and Or expose the harrowing impact of 491 days in Hamas captivity. These men have endured unimaginable suffering—this is a crime against humanity,' the Hostage and Missing Families Forum stated. 'These distressing images lay bare to the world the desperate plight of every hostage still held in Gaza. They evoke painful echoes of the liberation of the camps in 1945, the darkest chapter in our history.' Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar criticized the global focus on the plight of Gazans while ignoring the condition of the hostages. He wrote on X, 'For over a year, the international community has been misled by false claims of 'starvation' in Gaza.' 'But the images speak for themselves: Hamas terrorists and Gaza residents appear well-fed, while the Israeli hostages resemble Holocaust survivors—the only ones visibly suffering from starvation,' he continued. 'Hamas has committed crimes against humanity against kidnapped civilians. This Hamas-Nazi evil must be eliminated.'

Or Levy, Eli Sharabi, Ohad Ben Ami freed from Gaza after 491 days	Referring to the starved condition of the hostages, President Isaac Herzog wrote,'This is what a crime against humanity looks like!' By JNS Staff Three Israelis were freed on Saturday after 491 days in Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip, bringing the total number of hostages redeemed in the ongoing first phase of the ceasefire agreement to 21. Or Levy, 34, Eli Sharabi, 52, and Ohad Ben Ami, 56, were handed over by the Red Cross officials to Israel Defense Forces troops at around 11:15 a.m. local time and driven back to Israeli territory some 30 minutes later. The IDF brought the freed hostages to a facility near the border for a preliminary physical and psychological examination, and to meet with their families. Before their release, Hamas paraded the hostages on a stage in front of a raucous crowd of Palestinians in central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah. The three men appeared frail and emaciated. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office released a statement welcoming home the captives. 'The government of Israel embraces the three returnees,' it read, adding, 'The shocking images that we have seen today will not go unaddressed. 'The government, together with all of the security officials, will accompany them and their families. The government of Israel is committed to returning all of the hostages and the missing,' it continued. The PMO statement concluded with a quote from Psalms (31:15): 'Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, from those who pursue me.' 'This is what a crime against humanity looks like!' Israeli President Isaac Herzog wrote in a post on X. 'The whole world must look directly at Ohad, Or, and Eli—returning after 491 days of hell, starved, emaciated and pained—being exploited in a cynical and cruel spectacle by vile murderers. We take solace in the fact that they are being returned alive to the arms of their loved ones,' Herzog wrote. 'Completing the hostage deal is a humanitarian, moral, and Jewish duty. It is essential to bring back all our sisters and brothers from the hell of captivity in Gaza—every last one of them!' he added. 'A psychological war is being waged that can cause harm to us,' said Dr. Gilad Bodenheimer, chief of the ministry’s mental health division. 'We urge the public to minimize exposure to distressing images and videos and to be mindful of what they, their children and their loved ones are seeing.' Added the Hostage and Missing Families Forum: 'The disturbing images from the release of Ohad, Eli and Or serve as yet another stark and painful evidence that leaves no room for doubt—there is no time to waste for the hostages!' Levy was kidnapped from the Supernova music festival near Kibbutz Re’im during the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre. His wife, Eynav, was killed; their now three-year-old son Almog has been living with his grandparents since the terrorist assault. Sharabi and his brother Yossi were abducted from Kibbutz Be’eri during the Palestinian invasion. Sharabi’s wife and daughters were murdered in their home during the attack, while Yossi has since been confirmed dead, his body still being held in Gaza. Ben Ami was taken from Be’eri along with his wife, Raz, who was freed as part of a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. In return, Israel was set on Saturday to release 183 Palestinian terrorists: 18 serving life sentences, 54 serving lengthy terms and 111 who were arrested in Gaza during the war. Last Saturday, Israelis Yarden Bibas, Ofer Kalderon and Keith Siegel were freed from Gaza. Two days earlier, three Israelis—IDF soldier Agam Berger, 20, along with civilians Arbel Yehud, 29, Gadi Mozes, 80, and five Thai farm workers—Pongsak Thaenna, Sathian Suwannakham, Watchara Sriaoun, Bannawat Saethao and Surasak Lamnao—were redeemed from terrorist captivity. The previous week, Jerusalem redeemed four female IDF soldiers—Karina Ariev, 20; Daniella Gilboa, 20; Naama Levy, 20; and Liri Albag, 19—who were abducted from the Nahal Oz base during the Hamas-led invasion. Three civilian women—Emily Damari, Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher—were released on Jan. 19, shortly after the ceasefire went into effect. According to Israeli estimates, there are 76 hostages still in Hamas captivity in Gaza, including 73 abducted during the Oct. 7 attacks. Of the 251 hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, 178 have been returned or rescued, and Hamas is believed to be holding 35 bodies, 34 of them taken during the cross-border invasion and that of IDF Lt. Hadar Goldin, which was taken by the Palestinian terrorist group in 2014.

Hamas warns Trump’s plan to move out Gazans could kill hostage de...	A Hamas offical warned that any plan aimed at displacing Palestinians would be considered a 'new occupation' and met with determined resistance. By World Israel News A Hamas official in Gaza issued a warning on Thursday, responding to US President Donald Trump's proposals about evacuating Palestinian refugees and establishing Gaza control. The official stated that Hamas would mount 'strong verbal and physical resistance' if Trump or the Israeli government attempted to enforce such a plan. He cautioned that implementing this proposal could jeopardize ongoing ceasefire talks and destabilize the region. Speaking to the Saudi newspaper A-Sharq Al-Awsat, the official emphasized that the plan would create 'far-reaching consequences affecting all regional countries,' with unpredictable outcomes. Although Hamas' leadership had reviewed Trump's statements individually, no formal discussions had taken place. Another senior Hamas official outside Gaza remarked that any effort to evacuate refugees would be viewed as an attempt to 'eliminate the Palestinian cause,' prompting both operational and diplomatic retaliation. The official urged the US administration to rethink its strategy. 'The Trump administration should focus on pressuring Netanyahu's government to advance the existing agreement rather than introducing disruptive proposals that could derail everything,' he said. He added that such actions would influence future phases of the ceasefire. Hamas considers Trump’s statements significant due to their public nature and the unified opposition they have generated globally. The terror group believes the proposal faces numerous obstacles that make its practical implementation unlikely, reducing it to a 'theoretical' concept. The Hamas offical warned that any plan aimed at displacing Palestinians would be considered a 'new occupation' and met with determined resistance.

Hamas holds up list of names of hostages for release, claims Isra...	Data from COGAT shows that 12,000 humanitarian aid trucks have entered Gaza in direct contradiction to Hamas's claims. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hamas is deliberately delaying the release of the names of hostages to be freed on Saturday, a move that it claims is in retaliation for Israel allegedly failing to deliver sufficient aid. Sources told the Saudi state-owned news outlet Al Arabiya that Hamas did not deliver the names of hostages as expected on Friday because Israel allegedly did not allow mobile homes and tents into Gaza. They also claimed that Israel should provide vehicles to remove rubble as well as additional fuel. Hamas urged mediators in Egypt and Qatar to put pressure on Israel to deliver more aid. On Telegram, the terror group claimed that Israel was preventing patients from leaving Gaza for medical treatment. They also claimed that only 76 aid trucks entered Gaza, and none had winter coats or blankets. The Rafah municipality said it needed 40,000 tents and claimed that 40% of patients with kidney problems died due to a lack of care. 'Only about 10% of the humanitarian aid stipulated in the agreement has entered the Strip,' Hamas added. Data from COGAT shows that 12,000 humanitarian aid trucks have entered Gaza in direct contradiction to Hamas's claims. Video footage, witness testimony, and other evidence have proven that Hamas routinely steals humanitarian aid and sells it to Gazan civilians at inflated prices. 'There were reports about a month ago that Hamas has earned as much as $500,000 by selling the humanitarian aid it looted from international organizations. With this money, it pays salaries to its remaining members and manages to mobilize new ones,' Professor Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at Tel Aviv University’s Institute for National Security Studies and a senior fellow at the Misgav Institute for National Security, told TPS-IL. According to Michael, Hamas continues to take control of at least 50 percent of all humanitarian aid entering Gaza. 'Many trucks are being looted by Hamas even before they get into the hands of humanitarian organizations. The army recorded a conversation between two Hamas operatives in which they complained that their warehouses were so full they had nowhere to store the aid—this is the extent of the problem,' he said.

They did it anyway.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News US Senator Ted Cruz said in an interview with The Daily Caller that the Biden administration 'poured hundreds of millions of dollars' into Hamas. Cruz was responding to questions about US President Donald Trump pausing and reviewing all existing foreign aid. 'They secretly funneled literally uncountable hundreds of millions of dollars to Hamas, including tens of millions in cash they could never account for,' Cruz said. 'Throughout the Biden administration, they knew the money they were pouring into Gaza would benefit Hamas,' the Texas senator wrote in an X post. 'They did it anyway.' According to The Daily Caller, the Biden administration gave $1.3 billion to groups that sponsored or were directly responsible for terrorism. Last July, Cruz issued a statement saying, 'Biden-Harris officials poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Hamas-controlled areas, which Hamas seized, ultimately allowing $100 billion to flow to the Ayatollah in Iran, much of which was also funneled toward terrorism.' 'In a real and direct way, the Biden-Harris administration funded the October 7 terrorist attack, which was the largest one-day mass murder of Jews since the Holocaust,' he continued. In 2022, Cruz demanded that the Biden administration withdraw $1 million in funding from an organization that investigated alleged abuses in Judea and Samaria and the Gaza Strip. Cruz, along with other Republican senators, said that singling out Israel in this way constitutes 'new antisemitism.' Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and 11 other Republican lawmakers called on the Biden administration to cancel the grant program and uphold its repeated pledges to combat the BDS movement. 'As a policy matter, it is wholly unacceptable for the State Department to fund NGOs to delegitimize and isolate Israel,' the lawmakers wrote. The State Department, the lawmakers allege, is using taxpayer dollars to promote 'new antisemitism' driven by 'a global network of anti-Israel nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and human rights groups.'

Left-wing militant group pushing anti-ICE protests in LA teaches ...	UdB seeks to model itself on militant groups, such as the Brown Berets and the Black Panthers, as well as the socialist revolutions of Cuba and Venezuela. By Jessica Coestescu, The Washington Free Beacon A radical left-wing group, Unión del Barrio (UdB), is offering 'self-defense' training to combat Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. The Latino-focused organization, which models itself on militant groups like the Black Panthers, is also trying to recruit members for daily car patrols to help 'expel' ICE agents from neighborhoods. UdB, an American left-wing revolutionary socialist group was established in 1981 to combat 'all manifestations of colonial, imperialist, and neoliberal oppression.' The group’s website features a photo of Cuban soldiers holding AK-47s and claims that America is a 'violent and dangerous' 'empire in decline.' And last month, as President Donald Trump was about to take office and launch his promised mass deportations, UdB began offering self-defense trainings. It's also been involved in anti-ICE protests sweeping through Southern California. 'COMMUNITY SELF-DEFENSE! STOP THE ICE RAIDS!' the flyer advertising a Jan. 18 online training read. 'Learn how to identify undercover ICE vehicles that are used in ICE raids.' The group also boasted that at least 20 organizations had signed up for a Jan. 25 online training. 'Help us defend our communities from ICE!' a flyer for that event read. Two more, this time geared toward educators, were held Jan. 28 and Feb. 4. An in-person training is scheduled for Thursday in Los Angeles. 'We are ORGANIZING to fight ICE raids,' a flyer posted to Instagram reads. The caption said over 30 organizations will be present. UdB has also been involved in the recent wave of anti-ICE protests that have engulfed Southern California in response to Trump’s deportations. Some have led to illegal street and freeway blockades, as well as incidents of criminal vandalism. On UdB’s website, the group contends that protesting and radical rhetoric alone are not enough to bring about change. Instead UdB seeks to model itself on militant groups, such as the Brown Berets and the Black Panthers, as well as the socialist revolutions of Cuba and Venezuela. According to a PowerPoint presentation used in trainings reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon, UdB seeks to 'identify, denounce and expel' ICE officers from Mexican neighborhoods. It does so by teaching people how to identify the different types of U.S. immigration agencies, how to identify uniformed and undercover immigration officers, the vehicles they use, and their methods of operation. UdB members interested in further 'protecting communities from ICE and police terror' are encouraged to join and carry out daily car patrols, according to the training PowerPoint. 'The Community Patrols are a means of building community-based power that will challenge police and migra attacks,' UdB’s website states. 'These agencies are trained to profile, harass, detain, arrest, and brutalize our people. We are determined to build … barrio [neighborhood]-centered self-defense and prevent the detention and family separation that has taken place over the last several decades.' ​​'The objective is to organize our people in every barrio, block by block, to defend our communities from colonial violence and threats to our human and democratic rights,' the webpage continues. 'We intend to expose the anti-Raza [race] nature of the colonizer state that has now openly declared itself a tool to terrorize, repress, and exploit the lives and labor power of the Mexicano-Raza working class.' During the Jan. 18 online training session, UdB secretary general Adriana Jasso emphasized that self-defense is part of the greater socialist class struggle. 'The great majority of our people are providing for their families, are in survival mode under this colonial system,' Jasso said. 'For that reason, we stand together and we stand in unity and unconditional support to defend the working class of our communities and that’s who we identify with and that’s who we seek to defend in this period of struggle.' 'We don’t want anyone to be separated or to be deported,' Jasso continued. 'Our communities deserve to be seen, and we stand with them. We will defend them and our proposal to all of you is community self-defense. No one is going to tell us if we belong here or don’t belong here. We know that this is our struggle. We know that, going back to our history, this is where our people are supposed to be.' On Sunday the group released its own online guide outlining best practices for organizing protests. 'In recent days, we have seen a major surge of anger and community action, both on the streets of every U.S. city and on social media. Unión del Barrio applauds the courage of our gente in standing up to resist the current attacks against our community,' UbD wrote in a statement. UbD’s website includes three 'strategic goals to guide all areas of our community work for building people’s power.' Under the first goal, 'Community Level Self-Defense,' UdB says it must become 'a party capable of providing for the immediate self-defense of our communities within every sector of our population. Conditions are already truly dire for our gente, and things will inevitably be getting worse.' The second goal, 'dual and contending power,' refers to a concept used by revolutionary movements to undermine the state’s legitimacy and vie for control. 'We live in what is an empire in decline, which is domestically and internationally even more violent and dangerous than an ascending empire,' the website states. 'Precisely because of this, we must build a party capable of providing for the economic, political, cultural, and ideological self-determination and self-sufficiency within every sector of our population within the current borders of the U.S.' The final goal, written in Spanish, translates to 'Rearguard for Our America.' There, UdB argues that it must work toward the first two goals 'with the understanding that we have an essential role to fulfill as the historical Rearguard (Retaguardia) of the revolutionary process for liberation and socialism that is already taking place throughout Nuestra América.' 'When we struggle locally we must also identify ourselves with and actively defend the socialist revolution of Nuestra América [Our America] that is currently on the march in the South,' the site continues. In addition to 'resisting' immigration and law enforcement in the United States, UdB 'unconditionally uphold[s] the right of self-determination of indigenous people, and of all poor and oppressed people throughout the world.' As such, in the wake of Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack, UdB announced that 'Palestinians and Mexicans/Indigenous people have a common enemy: settler colonialism.' 'Today, we express our solidarity with the bold resistance of Palestinians in their struggle against normalized Israeli state terror and settler colonization,' UdB wrote in a statement the day after the attack. 'Unión del Barrio stands with the people of Palestine and with their righteous struggle for self-determination and the right to return to their illegally occupied lands. The bold resistance of the Palestinian people is understood as such by billions of colonized and displaced people around the world, and we are confident that justice will prevail in Palestine!' UdB has since participated in dozens of anti-Israel and pro-Hamas protests according to Instagram posts reviewed by the Free Beacon. On the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 massacre, the group once again released a statement celebrating the attack and blaming Israel for the violence. UdB did not respond to a request for comment.

Azerbaijan state oil deal with Israeli gas field signals growing ...	Azerbaijan’s ties with Israel have long been significant, though often under the radar, and Baku has been Israel’s most vital ally in the Caucasus and Central Asia for more than three decades. By Debbie Weiss, The Algemeiner A deal struck this week between Israel and Azerbaijan’s state oil company, SOCAR, has underscored a geopolitical reality often overlooked: Azerbaijan’s emerging role as a strategic player in the evolving Middle East. While the Abraham Accords reshaped regional alliances under the first administration of US President Donald Trump, a second Trump term will usher in what some analysts call a 'New Middle East' — one that prioritizes regional security cooperation to counter Iran while favoring diplomacy over conflict, all while recalibrating America’s presence in the region. At the heart of this shifting landscape is Azerbaijan, a country that shares hundreds of border miles with Iran while maintaining deep ties with both Israel and Turkey, straddling multiple power blocs in ways that could prove crucial to Trump’s ambitions. According to Ze’ev Khanin, a professor of Eurasian geopolitics at Bar-Ilan University and a senior research fellow at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, Azerbaijan is a key part of strategic alliances that he calls 'unclosed triangles,' with Baku comprising the missing link. 'We are living in the world of so-called unclosed triangles, which is unlike what we had in the 19th century and 20th centuries — when the enemy of my enemy is my friend and the friend of my friend is also my friend,' he told The Algemeiner. One prominent example is the unclosed triangle of Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Israel. Despite strained ties between Turkey and Israel, Azerbaijan continues to use Turkey as a transit point for energy exports to Israel. 'The Turks didn’t stop the stream of Azerbaijani energy through Turkey to Israel,' Khanin said, adding that Ankara was eager to position itself as a transit hub for energy exports to Europe. Azerbaijan’s ties with Israel have long been significant, though often under the radar, and Baku has been Israel’s most vital ally in the Caucasus and Central Asia for more than three decades, with a partnership that spans across energy security, defense, and intelligence. As of 2019, more than 60 percent of Israel’s gasoline was sourced from Azerbaijan. Baku has also purchased advanced Israeli defense systems, including the 'Barak MX' missile system as well as surveillance satellites. The recent SOCAR deal investing in Israel’s offshore gas fields has further deepened these relations. Aaron Frenkel, an Israeli businessman, agreed to sell 48 percent of his holdings in the Tamar gas field to SOCAR, making the oil company a significant stakeholder in the Tamar gas field, which is a major natural gas source for Israel and has turned the country into a gas exporter in the region. This move not only cements Baku’s economic influence in the region but also places it at the crossroads of a growing pro-Western bloc seeking to counter Iran’s regional ambitions. Trump’s vision for the region, as articulated in past speeches and his meetings this week with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, involves shifting security responsibilities to local allies, forming what some have dubbed a 'Middle East NATO.' In this framework, normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia is a linchpin, but Azerbaijan’s strategic positioning could offer another key pillar, Khanin said. 'Everybody understands that Iran is not going anywhere,' Khanin said. Both Jerusalem and Washington recognize that, Khanin said, and see the need to form a strong pro-Western bloc of countries that, despite differing political ideologies, can cooperate because of overlapping security interests. As Trump seeks to end what he calls 'unnecessary wars,' he is looking to prioritize diplomatic solutions over direct military engagement, as evidenced by his comments this week seeking another deal with Iran. Trump also aims to end the war in Gaza, secure the release of Israeli hostages, and 'to limit, if not eliminate, Hamas,' Khanin said. Trump’s comments about a 'US takeover of Gaza' notwithstanding, his broader goal is to 'outsource the responsibility for Middle Eastern security' to a regional coalition with Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other key US allies under American leadership, Khanin added. For Israel, the SOCAR agreement is more than an economic deal — it is a sign that Azerbaijan’s role in the region is expanding in ways that align with broader strategic goals, Khanin said. As the contours of the 'New Middle East' take shape, Baku may find itself in a position of influence it has never held before.

Netanyahu tells Saudis to create Palestinian state on their land	His remark was in response to a question regarding Saudi Arabia's stated precondition for normalizing ties with Israel—namely, a framework for the establishment of a Palestinian state. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated in a Channel 14 interview on Thursday that Saudi Arabia has enough land to establish a Palestinian state within its borders. His remark was in response to a question regarding Saudi Arabia's stated precondition for normalizing ties with Israel—namely, a framework for the establishment of a Palestinian state. Netanyahu responded,'The Saudis can create a Palestinian state in Saudi Arabia; they have plenty of land over there.' Netanyahu, who has long opposed a two-state solution for security reasons, stated that he 'would not make an agreement that would endanger the State of Israel.' He added, 'Certainly not a Palestinian state. After October 7? Are you aware of what happened? There was a Palestinian state—it was called Gaza. Under Hamas rule, Gaza functioned as a Palestinian state, and the result was the worst massacre since the Holocaust.' The interview took place after a joint press conference featuring Netanyahu and then-US President Donald Trump in Washington, D.C. During the conference, as the two leaders discussed the possibility of normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel, Netanyahu remarked, 'I think normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia is not only feasible—I think it's going to happen.' Shortly after the press conference, the Saudi foreign ministry stated that it would not negotiate normalization without a clear framework for a Palestinian state. Last May, after the governments of Spain, Norway, and Ireland unilaterally recognized a Palestinian state, Netanyahu condemned the move, calling the two-state proposal a 'reward for terrorism.' 'The intention of several European countries to recognize a Palestinian state is a reward for terrorism,' Netanyahu said. 'Eighty percent of the Palestinians in Judea and Samaria support the terrible massacre of October 7. This evil cannot be given a state.' 'This would be a terrorist state. It would attempt to repeat the October 7 massacre repeatedly; we will not allow this.' 'Rewarding terrorism will not bring peace, nor will it stop us from defeating Hamas.' Netanyahu’s comments echoed a tweet from Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz (Likud), who stated, 'Today’s decision sends a message to the Palestinians and the world: Terrorism pays.'

Social media gets creative over Trump’s plan to transform Gaza	What’s next – a Trump golf course in Rafah?' someone wrote on X. By Jewish Breaking News U.S. President Donald Trump’s dramatic proposal for Gaza’s future has sparked a surge of support among some segments of Israeli society. 'The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too,' Trump declared as he stood alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Tuesday. As for Gaza’s residents, he said they should be provided with 'a good, fresh, beautiful piece of land' somewhere while rehabilitation takes place. The immediate response was visible on Tel Aviv’s main freeway Wednesday morning, where commuters were greeted by giant billboards featuring American flags alongside Trump’s image, with a simple message in English: 'Thank you, Mr. President,' JTA reports. Social media quickly lit up with reactions, including digitally altered images showing luxury hotels rising from Gaza’s landscape. Some users shared mock tourism posters featuring 'Trump International Gaza Beach Resort' while others created memes suggesting a 'Real Two-State Solution: Israel and America.' However, not all reactions have been positive. 'First the US couldn’t handle Afghanistan, now they want Gaza? This will be another Trump real estate flop,' wrote one influential Israeli X user. 'What’s next – a Trump golf course in Rafah?' wrote another. 'Trump thinks he can turn Gaza into Atlantic City. Someone should remind him how that worked out?' But behind the funny memes and hotel jokes, since the October 7 Hamas massacre which left 1,200 innocent people dead and 251 taken hostages. Netanyahu has struggled to define what comes next after he achieves his war goals in Gaza. Despite the seemingly outlandish nature of Trump’s proposal, for some, it at least offers a guarantee that that haunting nightmare will never happen again.

By The Associated Press A hearing in a New Mexico courtroom devolved into chaos when three people rushed the defendant in a homicide case, setting off a brawl with flying fists and kicks. Courtroom video cameras recorded the Jan. 31 melee, which subsided as a law enforcement officer drew a stun gun and protected the defendant from further attack. Felony charges were filed against two men: battery and assault on a public official. They apparently rushed the defendant in a fit of rage over the killing of a relative.

The courtroom video showed her hitting the defendant and an officer with a chair. The presence of corrections officers and other security details in courtrooms does not always keep the peace. Last year a defendant in a felony battery case in Nevada flung himself over a judge’s bench and grabbed her hair, sparking a bloody brawl with court officials. Katina Watson, court executive officer at New Mexico’s Second Judicial District, told KRQE that 'these are the types of things that we see regularly.' She praised an officer for reacting to ensure safety, without mention of potential security enhancements. The Associated Press sent a request to the court Thursday for comment on the fight and security precautions.

Trump slaps sanctions on anti-Israel International Criminal Court	The sanctions, the White House said, are in direct response to the 'ICC’s biased attacks on the U.S. and Israel.' By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday sanctioning the International Criminal Court (ICC) over its efforts to prosecute America and its allies, primarily Israel. The order 'places financial and visa sanctions' on all ICC personnel, as well as their families, according to information provided by the White House. Trump’s order closely mirrors congressional legislation that overwhelmingly passed the GOP-controlled House in January. The bill stalled in the Senate, however, when all but one Democratic member, Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman, voted against it. Like Congress’s bill, Trump’s order authorizes far-reaching sanctions on the ICC and those who assist it in investigating U.S. citizens and allies, according to a White House fact sheet reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon. The court has faced widespread GOP criticism for issuing an arrest warrant on Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is in Washington, D.C., through Sunday for meetings with the White House and Congress. 'By issuing arrest warrants for Israeli officials and Hamas officials at the same time, the ICC created a shameful moral equivalency,' the White House wrote in its fact sheet on the executive order. 'The ICC consistently constrains liberal, democratic nations like Israel in exercising their rights to self-defense.' Trump, the fact sheet adds, 'will not support an organization that unfairly targets U.S. citizens and our allies.' Neither Israel nor the United States recognize the ICC’s jurisdiction. Trump nonetheless applied both financial sanctions and visa restrictions on its members, measures that will effectively bar ICC officials, as well as their family members, from entering the United States and cut off their access to some financial networks. The sanctions, the White House said, are in direct response to the 'ICC’s biased attacks on the U.S. and Israel.' Trump’s decision to sign the order while Netanyahu is in town reflects the White House’s drive to strengthen the U.S.-Israel alliance after four years of tension under Joe Biden. 'The ICC’s disproportionate focus on Israel, without investigating the actions of groups that openly call for Israel’s destruction, reveals a clear double standard,' the fact sheet adds. It also points out that while the ICC pursues Israel, it has done little to combat the Iranian regime’s mass human rights abuses. The court spends more than $2 billion a year investigating countries like Israel, but has conducted 'less than 10 successful prosecutions,' according to the White House. The Rome Statute, an international treaty that established the ICC in 1998, grants the court and its chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, 'unaccountable powers that pose a significant threat to United States sovereignty and our constitutional protections,' the White House said in justifying the sanctions. Thursday’s executive order continues a tough stance toward the court that started during Trump’s first term in office. In 2020, Trump initiated an asset freeze and entry ban on ICC officials after the court began investigating alleged American war crimes in Afghanistan. In November 2024, when the ICC first issued its arrest warrant for Netanyahu, the Israeli leader slammed the court, claiming its efforts signal a deep anti-Semitic bias.

‘Hypocrisy will be exposed’: Israeli defense chief calls out Spai...	Katz took issue with countries that have been vocal critics of Israel and portrayed themselves as staunch defenders of the Palestinians taking such a stance. By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz on Thursday warned that the 'hypocrisy' of Spain, Ireland, and other European countries hostile to the Jewish state will be exposed if they do not take in Palestinians who choose to leave Gaza, the war-torn enclave that US President Donald Trump has said he intends to rebuild after the population resettles elsewhere for a unknown period of time. Katz called out several countries in Europe while announcing he had ordered the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to prepare a plan to allow Gaza residents who wish to leave to exit the enclave voluntarily. 'The people of Gaza should have the right to freedom of movement and migration, as is customary everywhere in the world,' Katz posted on X/Twitter. 'I welcome President Trump’s bold initiative, which can create extensive opportunities for those in Gaza who wish to leave, assist them in resettling in host countries, and support long-term reconstruction efforts in a demilitarized, threat-free Gaza after Hamas — an effort that will take many years.' He said his plan would include exit options via land crossings, as well as special arrangements for departure by sea and air, noting that the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, which controlled Gaza before the current war and remains the strongest faction there absent the Israeli army, has used residents as 'human shields' and and now 'holds them hostage.' Katz’s order came two days after Trump said that the US would take over Gaza and develop it economically after Palestinians are safely resettled elsewhere. I have instructed the IDF to prepare a plan that will allow any resident of Gaza who wishes to leave to do so, to any country willing to receive them. Hamas has used the residents of Gaza as human shields, built its terror infrastructure in the heart of the civilian population,… &mdash; ישראל כ'ץ Israel Katz (@Israel_katz) February 6, 2025 Global reaction to Trump’s plan was largely negative, with many countries expressing both incredulity and indignation. Spain, for example, said that Palestinians must stay in Gaza. 'I want to be very clear on this: Gaza is the land of Gazan Palestinians and they must stay in Gaza,' Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares told reporters on Wednesday. 'Gaza is part of the future Palestinian state Spain supports and has to coexist guaranteeing the Israeli state’s prosperity and safety.' Katz took issue with countries that have been vocal critics of Israel and portrayed themselves as staunch defenders of the Palestinians taking such a stance. 'Countries such as Spain, Ireland, Norway, and others, which have falsely accused Israel over its actions in Gaza, are legally obligated to allow Gazans to enter their territory,' Katz said in his social media post. 'Their hypocrisy will be exposed if they refuse. Meanwhile, countries like Canada, which has a structured immigration program, have previously expressed willingness to take in residents from Gaza.' Albares rejected Katz’s suggestion that Spain should accept displaced Palestinians. 'Gazans’ land is Gaza and Gaza must be part of the future Palestinian state,' Albares said in an interview with Spanish radio station RNE. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Irish Foreign Ministry told the Turkish state-run Anadolu Agency on Thursday that Katz’s post was 'unhelpful and a source of distraction,' adding, 'The objective must be that the people of Palestine return safely to their home.' Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said during a press conference on Wednesday that Gaza under Hamas rule has been a 'failed experiment, adding, 'As long as immigration is voluntary and there is a country willing to accept them, can anyone really say it’s immoral or inhumane?' 'עזה זה ניסוי שנכשל' - שר החוץ גדעון סער נואם במליאה: 'כל עוד הגירה מתבצעת מרצונו החופשי של אדם, וכל עוד יש מדינה שמוכנה לקלוט את אותו אדם, מישהו יכול להגיד שזה לא מוסרי ולא אנושי?' @gidonsaar pic.twitter.com/VxNy7jSdZC &mdash; ערוץ כנסת (@KnessetT) February 5, 2025 Since Hamas started the Gaza war with its invasion of and massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, both Spain and Ireland have been fierce critics of the Jewish state. In the aftermath of the Oct. 7 atrocities, Spain launched a diplomatic campaign to curb Israel’s military response. At the same time, several Spanish ministers in the country’s left-wing coalition government issued pro-Hamas statements and called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, with some falsely accusing Israel of 'genocide.' More recently, Spanish officials said they would not allow ships carrying arms for Israel to stop at its ports. The US Federal Maritime Commission recently opened an investigation into whether Spain, a NATO ally, has been denying port entry to cargo vessels reportedly transporting US weapons to Israel. Spain stopped its own defense companies from shipping arms to Israel in October 2023. One year later, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez urged other members of the EU to suspend the bloc’s free trade agreement with Israel over its military campaigns against Hamas in Gaza and the terrorist organization Hezbollah in Lebanon. Sanchez’s demand came three days after the Spanish premier urged other countries to stop supplying weapons to the Jewish state. In Ireland, meanwhile, President Michael D. Higgins used his platform speaking at a Holocaust commemoration last month to launch a tirade against Israel’s military campaign targeting Hamas terrorists, appearing to draw parallels between Israel’s war in Gaza and the Nazi genocide of Jews during the Holocaust. The speech came against a backdrop of strained Irish-Israeli relations, exacerbated by Ireland’s decision to join South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and its support for redefining genocide in order to secure a conviction against Jerusalem. In December, Israel announced it was shuttering its embassy in Dublin, accusing the Irish government of undermining Israel at international forums and promoting 'extreme anti-Israel policies.' Last month, Israel announced it was shuttering its embassy in Dublin, accusing the Irish government of undermining Israel at international forums and promoting 'extreme anti-Israel policies.' In October, Irish leaders called on the EU to 'review its trade relations' with Israel after the Israeli parliament passed legislation banning the activities in the country of UNRWA, the United Nations agency responsible for Palestinian refugees, because of its ties to Hamas. Spain and Ireland, along with Norway, officially recognized a Palestinian state in May, claiming the move was accelerated by the Israel-Hamas war and would help foster a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israeli officials described the decision as a 'reward for terrorism.'

Musk’s Nazi-like salute sends Tesla into tailspin	In California, traditionally a Tesla stronghold, sales declined by 8% in the fourth quarter of 2024, with a concerning 12% drop for the entire year. By Jewish Breaking News Tesla is grappling with mounting consumer backlash over CEO Elon Musk’s Nazi-like salute. In Europe, where Tesla has significant market presence, the response has been particularly fierce. Outside Barcelona, French artist James Kina installed a provocative red raised arm at a Tesla charging station. Last month in Germany, activists projected images of Musk’s gesture onto the company’s Gigafactory near Berlin, accompanied by the word 'Heil' in reference to the Holocaust’s architect Adolf Hitler. Authorities have since launched a criminal investigation under the country’s strict laws against Nazi symbolism. The firestorm kicked off during a post-inauguration celebration at Capital One Arena when Musk thanked MAGA supporters by touching his chest and raising an arm in a Nazi salute-like fashion. Despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s defense of the tech tycoon, Musk didn’t do himself any favors after responding to the criticism with a series of Holocaust-related puns on his social media platform X. 'Don’t say Hess to Nazi accusations!' Musk wrote on Thursday. 'Some people will Goebbels anything down!' Musk wrote. 'Stop Göring your enemies! His pronouns would’ve been He/Himmler!' he continued. 'Bet you did nazi that coming.' Tesla can’t afford any more erratic behavior from their boss. According to Bloomberg, the electric vehicle giant is seeing sales plummeting across major global markets for the first time in over a decade. In California, traditionally a Tesla stronghold, sales declined by 8% in the fourth quarter of 2024, with a concerning 12% drop for the entire year.

Pohutsky, who has promoted herself as the first openly bisexual member of the Michigan House, on Thursday took to X to claim that 'many men' are not happy with her decision. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon A Democratic Michigan state representative told protesters Wednesday that she underwent voluntary sterilization to avoid becoming pregnant during President Donald Trump's second term, a left-wing media outlet reported. 'Just under two weeks ago, I underwent surgery to ensure that I would never have to navigate a pregnancy in Donald Trump's America,' Rep. Laurie Pohutsky told anti-Trump protesters gathered Wednesday outside the Michigan Capitol, according to a piece published by the Michigan Advance. 'I refuse to let my body be treated as currency by an administration that only sees value in my ability to procreate.' Trump has maintained that abortion policy should be left to state legislatures, such as the Michigan House of Representatives. Pohutsky is a member of the Michigan House and served for two years as speaker pro tempore. Pohutsky insisted that her surgery was important, telling protesters, 'If you know people who are questioning how serious this is, I'm going to repeat myself: A sitting government official opted for voluntary sterilization because she was uncertain she would be able to access contraception in the future.' Pohutsky, who has promoted herself as the first openly bisexual member of the Michigan House, on Thursday took to X to claim that 'many men' are not happy with her decision. 'Oh my… it would seem that many men with profile photos of other people have read the news and are not very happy with me today,' the state representative wrote. 'So anyway, who else is excited for the new Lady Gaga album?' Commenters seemed similarly excited, with one writing, 'The gene pool breathes a sigh of relief.' The Advance is part of States Newsroom, a network of center-left webpages that claims to focus on local issues. While the network may appear grassroots, donors include the Rockefeller family and foreign billionaire Hansjörg Wyss. It was launched with the backing of a group called the Hopewell Fund, which was in turn managed by left-wing dark-money behemoth Arabella Advisors.

Standing together: Rep. Brian Mast meets wounded IDF soldier Ari ...	Mast, a U.S. Army veteran, lost both legs and a finger in 2010 while clearing explosives during an operation with the Army Rangers in Kandahar. By Jewish Breaking News Rep. Brian Mast (R-FL), Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, met with IDF soldier Ari Spitz, a fellow war amputee who lost both legs while fighting in Gaza. Spitz a member of the Givaati Brigade is one of the most seriously injured Israeli soldiers to survive his wounds, spent six weeks recovering in hospital care. He shared details of their meeting on social media, writing: 'Yesterday I had the privilege of meeting the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Brian Mast. Besides his important role, he also lost both his legs as a soldier in Afghanistan. We spoke of prosthetics, politics, and the future. I thanked him for his longstanding support of Israel and the Jewish people as a public servant. It is always a pleasure to draw inspiration from people who have made a remarkable recovery.' Mast, a U.S. Army veteran, lost both legs and a finger in 2010 while clearing explosives during an operation with the Army Rangers in Kandahar. He was awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart for his service. A staunch advocate for Israel, Mast previously volunteered with the IDF’s Sar-El program, assisting with logistics near Tel Aviv. Following the October 7th massacre, he arrived in Congress wearing an IDF uniform, posting on social media: 'As the only member to serve with both the United States Army and the Israel Defense Forces, I will always stand with Israel.' He also took a direct jab at Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), adding: 'Tlaib’s got her flag. I got my uniform.' The meeting between Mast and Spitz highlights the deep personal and political ties between the U.S. and Israel, as both men continue to advocate for strong U.S.-Israel relations.

Israel prepares for possible tsunami following earthquakes in Gre...	Thousands of small earthquakes in the Santorini Islands in recent days have raised concerns about the potential for a larger earthquake in the region, which could lead to a tsunami in the Mediterranean. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel's National Security Council has warned of the risk of a tsunami following a series of earthquakes in Greece. The National Security Council met on Wednesday with emergency agencies and government ministries to discuss preparations for a possible tsunami scenario. Concerns were raised due to the high risk of tsunamis following the increased seismic activity recently observed in Greece. Thousands of small earthquakes in the Santorini Islands in recent days have raised concerns about the potential for a larger earthquake in the region, which could lead to a tsunami in the Mediterranean. Ariel Heimann, a senior geologist at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), described the concern over the seismic activity in Santorini and said, 'Approximately 2,000 earthquakes have occurred in Santorini over the past week, with the strongest measuring between 4 and 5.3 in magnitude, including 24 in the past 24 hours.' He added, 'Such a cluster of earthquakes could precede a major earthquake that may occur soon. However, there is also a considerable possibility that after a period of such seismic activity, the phenomenon will subside, and calm will return.' Santorini is 1,200 km from Israel, but since the earthquakes that generate tsunamis occur in the sea, powerful waves could reach Israel. 'A tsunami wave takes time to travel across the Mediterranean. Even if an earthquake triggers one, there would be enough time to issue a warning before it reaches the shore. Therefore, we should remain vigilant but not panic. This serves as a reminder that a major earthquake in Israel is not a matter of if, but when—making it essential to prepare for this threat,' he said. Israel is included in a tsunami warning system that issues alerts as soon as severe storms are detected. In areas along Israel's coast, sensors are installed to protect the public. Tsunamis take the form of long, powerful waves that hit the shore with tremendous impact. They can last for hours, with waves continuing to add strength as they hit the shore. Flooding can last for hours or even days. When a tsunami is detected, residents are alerted and warned to evacuate, with routes mapped out and made available to the public. In cities such as Haifa, signs indicate evacuation plans and safe routes. Officials often recommend that residents evacuate on foot rather than in cars to leave the roads clear for emergency vehicles.

Spain and Ireland reject Israel’s suggestion that they take in Ga...	Spain, Ireland, and Norway had unilaterally recognized a Palestinian state, and Spain halted all weapons exports to Israel. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Foreign Ministries of Spain and Ireland rejected Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz’s suggestion that they accept Palestinians displaced from Gaza. Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares dismissed the idea, stating, 'No one should even be debating where Palestinians in Gaza should go, because that debate is closed.' He added, 'Palestinians’ homeland is Gaza. Gaza should be part of the future Palestinian state, as recognized by Spain and most nations worldwide.' Albares emphasized Spain’s support for humanitarian aid and Gaza’s reconstruction. 'The EU has made clear its support for a two-state solution,' he stressed. Ireland’s Foreign Ministry called Katz’s proposal 'unhelpful and a source of distraction.' 'The priority must be a massive scale-up of aid to Gaza, the restoration of basic services, and a clear framework for displaced residents to return,' the ministry stated. The Spanish and Irish ministries were responding to comments from Katz, who told reporters, 'Countries like Spain, Ireland, Norway, and others, which have leveled accusations and false claims against Israel over its actions in Gaza, are legally obligated to allow any Gaza resident to enter their territories.' Katz made these remarks after instructing the IDF to assist civilians leaving Gaza by land, sea, and air. He also expressed support for Donald Trump’s plan to relocate Gazans. Spain, Ireland, and Norway had unilaterally recognized a Palestinian state, and Spain halted all weapons exports to Israel. In response, Israel’s Foreign Ministry immediately proposed recalling its ambassadors from Norway, Ireland, and Spain. During a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, Trump proposed relocating Palestinian civilians from Gaza to other countries and having the U.S. assume control of the territory during its reconstruction. On Wednesday, the White House clarified some details of the plan, appearing to contradict Trump’s Tuesday claim that the resettlement would be permanent. 'I can confirm that the president is committed to rebuilding Gaza and to temporarily relocating those who are there because … it is a demolition site,' White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. Leavitt also stated that under Trump’s plan, the U.S. would neither fund Gaza’s reconstruction nor deploy military forces to the area. 'This does not mean U.S. boots on the ground in Gaza, nor does it mean American taxpayers will fund the effort,' she said. 'Instead, it means that Donald Trump, known for his negotiation skills, will work to secure an agreement with regional partners.'

Trump remarks on Gaza not cause for Democrat freakout, Fetterman ...	To Fetterman, no one is being honest about the devastation on the ground in Gaza and the need to move citizens out in the short term. By Menachem Wecker, JNS As many of his Democratic peers in Congress respond very vocally to everything that U.S. President Donald Trump says, Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) thinks it is essential to choose one’s battles carefully, the pro-Israel senator told Tara Palmeri on her podcast Somebody’s Gotta Win. 'When the pitcher is throwing thousands of balls, you have to decide which ones are the strikes to swing on and to push back and to fight against,' Fetterman told Palmeri, senior political correspondent at Puck. 'Many of my colleagues—we’re a little over two weeks in—and now they’re in full on freakout, and now they’ve got the signs and they’re going out, ‘Ahhhh.’ ‘Hey, let’s grab a bullhorn and go into a Starbucks and start yelling,’' Fetterman said. (Fetterman has been regaining his clarity of speech since suffering a stroke in 2022.) Palmeri asked the senator about what her sources have told her, that Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner had put forth a plan to develop Gaza. What if that development benefits the Trump family, she asked. 'I don’t personally believe that they are going to turn Gaza into Trump Plaza kind of a situation,' Fetterman said. He added that he thought it was 'silly' for Trump to rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, but said that he doesn’t think such name changes really matter. 'You can be concerned,' he said about Democrats responding to the president’s many comments. 'When you have used the extreme language in your portfolio of ‘fascist’ and now they’re throwing around that this is a ‘coup,’' he said. 'I’ve studied what coups really were, and I’ve studied what some of these things were, and right now this is sound and fury, and thus far at least it really hasn’t created any lasting damage or anything serious about it.' Where colleagues can’t resist reacting to Trump, 'I’m not that guy,' Fetterman told Palmeri, in the interview which ran about 45 minutes. 'You have to choose which thing you’re going to go back at and then other things that you’re going to ignore.' Palmeri told JNS that she had a preplanned interview with Fetterman, but knowing he is an 'ardent supporter of Israel,' she wanted to get his reaction to Trump’s proposal about Gaza. 'Unlike many members of Trump’s own party, he seemed open to it,' she told JNS. 'I think his views on Israel are probably more in line with the state that he represents, a battleground state, that Donald Trump won,' she added. 'Israel was a major wedge for Democrats during the election, and Fetterman has been one of the lone voices in his party that has had unwavering support for Israel.' ‘Gigantic kind of undertaking’ The senator said that Trump’s plan for the United States to take over Gaza is 'provocative.' 'But I don’t think that that’s in an actual serious kind of a way, and I think, I mean I can’t speak exactly what he meant, but what I think it was more to kind of shake things up and to start like a very more honest conversation of Gaza,' he said, 'and how 90% of the housing has been destroyed or severely damaged, and where are you going to live?' There are no utilities, water or structures to protect Gazans from the weather, according to Fetterman. 'Where are they going to go? Where are they going to live? How are they going to do that in a hygienic kind of way, and how are you going to rebuild it, especially when Hamas is still allowed to function,' he told Palmeri. 'Where’s the money gonna come from? And who is going to be doing all the building and do all that work?' he added. 'I mean that’s a gigantic kind of undertaking, and now no one has been honest about it.' Fetterman added that his top priority in the region is destroying Iran’s nuclear facilities. 'We have a unique opportunity to do that knowing that now, that Hamas is severely damaged, and so is Hezbollah severely diminished and Iran,' he said. 'It has actually been shown that Iran doesn’t have the capabilities to really project those kinds of damage and they are not as fearsome as people thought that they were.' 'All of the experts on the Middle East throughout all of this were wrong,' he added. 'For me, my top priority in that region is destroying Iran’s nuclear facilities.' The senator said he doesn’t think U.S. troops will be on the ground in Gaza. Instead, he thinks Washington must 'hold Hamas and Iran and the region—the whole region—accountable.' The Jewish state reminded that Hamas by design 'hides in things like schools and refugee camps and those things, and they forced Israel to fight through civilians.' 'They were forced to fight a war through civilians. I have never described Palestinians as a necessary sacrifice,' he said. 'The Palestinian leaders describe that, and they design that to maximize the most amount of death and hoping that they can bring everyone into the region into the war, when Israel actually demonstrated that Iran really isn’t the kind of powerful force in the region.' 'All those proxies really aren’t much of much,' he said. To Fetterman, no one is being honest about the devastation on the ground in Gaza and the need to move citizens out in the short term. 'If you’re returning to an absolute pile of rubble, then it’s like that’s not an honest one. Gaza is going to need to be rebuilt, and how do you rebuild that if Hamas is in power?' he told Palmeri. 'Because when they’ve built Gaza, they stole those resources and built those tunnels and bought those kind of weapons that they turned on Israel on Oct. 7. No one is being honest and no one is reacting to the reality on the ground.' Palmeri asked if Trump’s plan could jeopardize the ceasefire agreement. Hamas is 'very eager' for a ceasefire, and Hezbollah and Iran are 'begging' for ceasefire, Fetterman said.

Biden State Dept privately downplayed use of ‘jihad’ and ‘occupat...	The memo offers a fresh window into the Biden administration's decision to restore funding to UNRWA—one that shows the Biden State Department was well aware of the issues plaguing the embattled relief agency but opted to barrel forward with funds anyway. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon When the Biden administration resumed funding to the United Nations relief agency for Gaza, it penned an internal memo aimed at defending UNRWA over its production of childhood 'educational materials' that encourage violence and demonize Israel. Some of those materials included references to 'jihad' and Israeli 'occupation'—terms that the Biden State Department wrote are 'in line with U.N. principles' and only 'viewed as inappropriate by some other audiences.' The memo, obtained by the Washington Free Beacon through a records request from watchdog group Protect the Public Trust, came roughly two weeks after the Biden administration restored tens of millions of dollars in funding to UNRWA in April 2021 following a pause during President Donald Trump's first stint in the White House. Written by deputy assistant secretary Nancy Izzo Jackson for Secretary of State Antony Blinken, it addressed 'examples of criticism' targeting UNRWA and laid out the State Department's 'response.' The first section, titled, 'Educational Materials,' notes that UNRWA made 'home-learning 'cards,' based on the Palestinian Authority's educational curriculum, to supplement textbooks sent home' during the COVID pandemic. Some of those cards, according to a January 2021 report from research firm Impact-se, included the 'encouragement of violence' and accused Israel 'of deliberately dumping radioactive and toxic waste in the West Bank.' UNRWA, the State Department wrote, had already removed or changed the content before the report's release. Shortly thereafter, however, Impact-se issued a follow-up report that identified additional 'problematic cards,' including 'references to jihad in and violence in Arabic language lessons for grades 6 and 9,' as well as references to 'the Israeli occupation.' UNRWA determined that those terms did not violate 'U.N. principles,' according to the State Department memo, which states that only 'some other audiences' may object to them. 'UNRWA removed or updated four cards while retaining a dozen cards it deemed as in line with U.N. principles (e.g. use of 'jihad' in the Quran or the term 'occupation') but are viewed as inappropriate by some other audiences,' the State Department said. The memo offers a fresh window into the Biden administration's decision to restore funding to UNRWA—one that shows the Biden State Department was well aware of the issues plaguing the embattled relief agency but opted to barrel forward with funds anyway. It came just two months before the State Department privately assessed that Hamas was likely to benefit from more than $360 million in additional aid. Those private assessments did not square with the administration's public one. When announcing the funding restoration, Blinken said the assistance 'serves important U.S. interests,' including 'Israeli-Palestinian understanding.' Behind closed doors, however, the State Department acknowledged concerns that UNRWA’s facilities are used by 'terrorist groups' like Hamas. Its memo referenced the 2020 discovery of tunnels beneath an UNRWA school and facility but said it remained 'unknown which entity is responsible' for them. Hamas, in the lead up to Oct. 7 and after it, relied heavily on a sophisticated tunnel system built beneath the Gaza Strip. Many of these networks connected to UNRWA schools, which were also used as Hamas military outposts. UNRWA, the State Department maintained in its memo, 'has been very transparent with the Israeli Ministry of Defense and with the United States when any such incidents occur.' In a separate report prepared for Congress in 2021, the State Department documented 'violations of UNRWA’s neutrality policies that are not consistent with the principle of neutrality.' This included 'slogans, graffiti, or other imagery on the inside or outside of UNRWA facilities.' More than 247 infractions were reported from 2019 to 2020 alone, the report states. The report also noted that, despite a 'strict no-arms policy' at all UNRWA facilities, the agency had reported 'armed incursions, armed incidents, unauthorized use of UNRWA installations, weapons, and tunnels.' To address these concerns, the State Department proposed sending even more money to UNRWA so that it could train staff how to uphold the 'principles of neutrality, tolerance, anti-discrimination, and human rights.' Michael Chamberlain, Protect the Public’s Trust’s director, said the newly unearthed State Department documents highlight how the former administration 'tried to sell a wholly unrealistic version of UNRWA to Congress.' 'Even with all they knew, they shrugged and wrote the checks anyway,' he told the Free Beacon. 'All the post-Oct. 7 reports about UNRWA staff participating in terrorist attacks and terror groups storing war materiel in UNRWA facilities were not surprising to anyone paying attention—not even to the officials in charge of the decision to resume sending money to this organization.' While UNRWA’s ties to terrorism have long generated concerns in Congress, it was not until Oct. 7 that these issues hit the mainstream. At least 19 UNRWA staff members participated in Hamas’s terror spree, leading the Biden administration and international donors to pause their funding. Israel maintains that many more helped Hamas hide hostages and gave it access to UNRWA facilities across the Gaza Strip. Israel formally banned UNRWA late last month, citing its role in the Oct. 7 attacks. Israeli officials are now barred from working with the aid agency and the country seeks an alternative route to provide aid in the Gaza Strip.

Hamas urges Arab countries to resist Trump’s Gaza relocation plan	Hamas urged Arab nations to convene an emergency summit to discuss strategies for countering what it called Trump's 'displacement project.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hamas issued a statement on Thursday calling on Arab countries to reject U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to relocate Palestinians from Gaza and assume control of the territory during the reconstruction process. The terror group also urged Arab nations to convene an emergency summit to discuss strategies for countering what it called Trump's 'displacement project.' Hamas stated that the president's remarks regarding Washington's stance on the Gaza Strip amounted to a declaration of the U.S.'s intent to occupy the territory. 'We do not need any nation to govern the Gaza Strip, and we reject replacing one occupation with another,' the group added. 'We urge Arab countries to resist pressure from Trump and stand firm in rejecting the displacement plan,' Hamas said. On Tuesday, during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump announced that his administration intends to relocate the entire population of the Gaza Strip to third-party countries, with the U.S. assuming control of the coastal enclave for rehabilitation and reconstruction. The proposal received praise from many Israeli leaders and congressional Republicans but drew strong criticism from the Arab world, several European governments, and some Democratic lawmakers. On Wednesday, the White House clarified some details of the plan, appearing to contradict Trump's Tuesday claim that the resettlement would be permanent. 'I can confirm that the president is committed to rebuilding Gaza and to temporarily relocating those who are there because … it is a demolition site,' White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.

Israel thwarts Palestinian suicide bombing on Jerusalem bus	Several members of the cell were also involved in shooting attacks against Israeli soldiers in the past year. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli security forces thwarted a suicide bombing attack against a bus in Jerusalem, the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) announced on Thursday. Members of a terror cell made up of Fatah and Hamas operatives from Ramallah were arrested in November and December, the Shin Bet said. The suspects were identified as Mander Sheikh Qassem, Bashir Awad, Omar Sobakh, Ali Shweiki and Ahmed Jasser Ali. It emerged that the latter, with help from the rest of the cell, manufactured an explosive device to be used in a suicide bombing on a bus in Jerusalem. Investigators confiscated an explosive device that the cell intended to use to test their remote detonation mechanism. Also seized was a Carlo-type rifle. Several members of the cell were also involved in shooting attacks against Israeli soldiers in the past year. Since the October 7 attacks, Israeli forces have arrested 6,000 wanted Palestinians in counterterror operations in Judea and Samaria. Around 40 percent were affiliated with Hamas.

Israeli army to prepare plan allowing Gazans to voluntarily leave...	A Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research survey published on June 26, 2024, found that 44% of Gazans ages 18-29 would emigrate if given the chance. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz instructed the military to prepare a plan allowing Gazans to leave the enclave voluntarily, he announced on Thursday. The initiative would establish options for departure through land crossings, as well as via air and sea, Katz said. His announcement follows US President Donald Trump’s suggestion on Tuesday that the Strip’s residents relocate to third countries while Gaza is rebuilt. Katz accused Hamas of using Gazans as human shields, diverting humanitarian aid for its own purposes, and preventing residents from leaving the Strip. He argued that Gazans should have the same right to emigrate as people anywhere in the world. 'Countries like Spain, Ireland, and Norway, which have falsely accused Israel over its actions in Gaza, have a legal duty to allow Gazans to enter their territory,' Katz said, adding that refusal to do so would expose their 'hypocrisy.' He also pointed to Canada as a potential destination, citing its structured immigration program and past willingness to accept Gazan refugees. The Defense Minister stated that Hamas continues to exploit civilians and restrict their movement. 'Hamas used Gaza residents as human shields, built terror infrastructure in the heart of the population, and is now extorting them by using humanitarian aid while preventing them from leaving,' he said. Details of Trump’s suggestion have not been worked out, but any Gazan who wishes to emigrate would be able to do so, provided another country agrees to take them in. Katz believes such a move could pave the way for Gaza’s long-term rehabilitation once Hamas is no longer in control. 'Gaza’s residents should be allowed the freedom to exit and emigrate, as is the practice anywhere in the world,' Katz stressed. He added that Trump’s plan could help support a future demilitarized Gaza, though such a transition would take years. 'It does appear that President Trump is committed to the idea. He has the ability, if he wants to, to twist Jordan’s arm, to twist Egypt’s arm. Jordan is so dependent economically on the US and free trade with the US – which is more beneficial to Jordan than the US – that if President Trump really wants to make this happen, the US has the power to make it happen,' Asher Fredman, executive director of the Misgav Institute in Jerusalem told TPS-IL. Fredman said that despite the public Palestinian rhetoric, many Gazans do want to leave Gaza. He cited a Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research survey published on June 26, 2024, which found that 44% of Gazans ages 18-29 would emigrate if given the chance. The reported noted, 'Among those [of all ages] who have considered emigrating, 30% say they would do so even if they did not have the required papers.' A 2022 report, written by the Hamas-affiliated Council on International Relations and seen by TPS-IL, said 12% of the Strip’s population fled since 2007, when the terror group violently seized control of Gaza. The ongoing first phase of the ceasefire is supposed to see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed over six weeks in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. The exact number will depend on how many are alive. So far, 18 hostages — 13 Israelis and five Thais — have been released. The fate of the remaining 65 hostages will be determined by negotiations during the ceasefire’s second phase. Critics say the phased approach condemns hostages not freed in the beginning to open-ended captivity and undermines Israel’s war gains. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 79 remaining hostages, 35 have been declared dead.

Israel to cease participation in UN human rights council	Israel remains the only nation regarding which the body has a dedicated agenda item, which Sa’ar said was clear evidence of institutional bias. By Ariel Kahana, JNS Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar announced on Wednesday that Israel will follow the example set by U.S. President Donald Trump and cease its engagement with the United Nations Human Rights Council. While neither are members of the council, both have informal observer status. In a pointed critique, Sa’ar characterized the council as a platform that systematically undermines Israel’s diplomatic standing while failing to address genuine human rights concerns globally. The Israeli foreign minister went on to state that the council serves as a mechanism for protecting human rights violators, enabling them to evade international scrutiny. He specifically condemned the UNHRC for 'obsessively demonizing the one democracy in the Middle East—Israel,' rather than genuinely addressing global human rights challenges. Sa’ar noted that the council has passed more than 100 resolutions against the Jewish state—more than 20% of all council resolutions, surpassing the combined total of resolutions against Iran, Cuba, North Korea and Venezuela. Moreover, Israel remains the only nation regarding which the body has a dedicated agenda item, which Sa’ar said was clear evidence of institutional bias. Sa’ar’s announcement reflects a broader strategy of challenging what Israel perceives as systemic discrimination within multilateral institutions.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lavishes praise on Donald Trump, calling him the 'best friend Israel has ever had in the White House,' and lauds Gaza resettlement plan as the 'first good idea' he has heard on Gaza's future. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed President Donald Trump’s Gaza resettlement plan on Wednesday, calling the proposal the first 'good idea' he has heard on the subject of the post-war administration of the Gaza Strip. Speaking on Fox News with Sean Hannity on Wednesday, Netanyahu discussed his meeting with President Trump a day earlier in the White House, including his comment to the president that he is 'the greatest friend Israel's ever had in the White House.' 'It's that simple,' Netanyahu told Hannity. 'He's the greatest friend Israel ever had in the White House. You know, in his first term, he recognized Jerusalem as our capital and moved the American embassy there, recognized our sovereignty over the Golan Heights, got out of the disastrous Iran deal, and we worked together on the historic Abraham Accords that brought peace to Israel and four Arab states.' Netanyahu lavished praise on Trump for his 'remarkable' accomplishments during the first few weeks of his second term, including the removal of limits on arms shipments imposed by the Biden administration, the defunding of UNRWA, and most recently, the president’s plan to resettle the population of Gaza and administer the coastal enclave after the current war. The Israeli premier called the plan the 'first good idea' that he has heard on the question of managing post-war Gaza. 'Well, I don't think he talked about sending US troops to complete the job of destroying Hamas,' continued Netanyahu. 'That's our commitment. That's our job. And we're absolutely committed to it. And I also don't think he said that he's going to fund it. He said that neighboring states, wealthy states, would do it. But the actual idea of allowing first Gazans who want to leave to leave, I mean, what's wrong with that? They can leave, they can then come back, they can relocate and come back, but you have to rebuild Gaza.' 'This is the first good idea that I've heard. It's a remarkable idea. And I think it should be really examined, pursued and done, because I think it will create a different future for everyone.' Netanyahu seemed to indicate that the war against Hamas would resume after the current truce, vowing to eliminate Hamas’ military capabilities. 'So far, we've decimated most of Hamas' military power. Not all. There's some left, and we'll make sure that it's not there when this war ends, and it could end very quickly. Second, we've released so far about 70 percent, more than that actually, of the living hostages, which nobody believed we would do.'

Israel to ‘turn over’ Gaza to US, says Trump, but no US troops wi...	White House appears to walk back Trump's claim that resettlement of Gazans will be permanent, as president defends plan, saying no American troops would be deployed to Gaza. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Donald Trump defended his Gaza resettlement plan Thursday, emphasizing that no American soldiers will be deployed to the Gaza Strip, while the White House appeared to walk back a key feature of Trump's plan. On Tuesday, Trump told reporters at a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that his administration plans to resettle the entire population of the Gaza Strip in third-party countrie, with the U.S. taking control over the coastal enclave for its rehabilitation and reconstruction. The plan drew praise from many Israeli leaders and congressional Republicans, but sharp criticism from the Arab world, a number of European governments, and some Democratic lawmakers. On Wednesday, the White House clarified some details of the plan, and appeared to directly contradict Trump's claim Tuesday that the resettlement would be permanent. 'I can confirm that the President is committed to rebuilding Gaza and to temporarily relocating those who are there, because &#8230; it is a demolition site,' White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. Leavitt also said the U.S. will not pay for Gaza's reconstruction under the Trump plan, nor will American military forces be deployed to the area. 'That does not mean boots on the ground in Gaza. It does not mean American taxpayers will be funding this effort,' she said. 'It means Donald Trump, who is the best deal maker on the planet, is going to strike a deal with our partners in the region.' On Thursday, Trump himself addressed questions regarding his Gaza plan in a post to the Truth Social platform. The president claimed that Israel will 'turn over' the Gaza Strip to the U.S., but no American forces will be sent to Gaza. 'The Gaza Strip would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting,' Trump wrote. 'The U.S., working with great development teams from all over the World, would slowly and carefully begin the construction of what would become one of the greatest and most spectacular developments of its kind on Earth. No soldiers by the U.S. would be needed! Stability for the region would reign!!!'

Accusing Trump of ‘ethnic cleansing,’ congressman proposes impeac...	Democratic lawmaker calls for Trump's impeachment, after the president proposed relocating Gaza's population to third-party countries, calling the plan 'ethnic cleansing.' By World Israel News Staff A Democratic lawmaker in the U.S. House of Representatives announced plans Wednesday to submit articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump over the president's plan to relocate en masse the entire population of the Gaza Strip. On Tuesday, President Trump spoke at a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, unveiling his plan for facilitating the mass migration of Gazans and bringing the coastal enclave under American control. A day later, Rep. Al Green of Texas addressed the House floor, accusing Trump of promoting 'ethnic cleansing,' and thus a 'crime against humanity,' arguing that it was sufficient basis to remove him from office. 'Ethnic cleansing in Gaza is not a joke,' Green told the House, 'especially when it emanates from the President of the United States. The most powerful person in the world. When he has the ability to perfect what he says.' Green slammed Prime Minister Netanyahu for not distancing himself from Trump's plan. 'Ethnic cleansing in Gaza is no joke and the Prime Minister of Israel should be ashamed, knowing the history of his people, to stand there and allow such things to be said.' 'Ethnic cleansing has been a crime against humanity and I stand here today to denounce what the president said, to denounce the complicity of the Prime Minister of Israel, and to remind people that Dr. King was right, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere and injustice in Gaza is a threat to justice in the United States of America.' Green vowed to bring articles of impeachment to Congress against Trump, without laying out a time frame for the beginning of the impeachment effort. 'I rise to announce, that the movement to impeach the President has begun. I rise to announce that I will bring articles of impeachment against the President for dastardly deeds proposed and dastardly deeds done. Green last year criticized Israel's handling of the war against the Hamas terror organization, accusing the IDF of engaging in an 'unjust, revengeful, might-makes-right offense.' 'No country can commit such atrocious injustices in the name of justice and expect the blessings of people of good will.'

Terrorists released by Israel leave prison as millionaires	In another society, if a criminal goes to jail for murdering someone, he’s ashamed about it. In the Palestinian Authority, they go around with a crown on their heads,' Itamar Marcus, Palestinian Media Watch’s founder and director, said. By David Isaac, JNS Many terrorists released by Israel are millionaires, flush with cash from years of receiving monthly Palestinian Authority 'pay for slay' stipends, an analysis by a Jerusalem-based watchdog group revealed on Wednesday. Palestinian Media Watch posted a list of all 734 terrorists scheduled for release from Israeli prisons in the first phase of the hostages-for-ceasefire agreement with Hamas, together with their 'salaries'—the dollar amounts each terrorist received from the Palestinian Authority’s so-called Martyrs’ Fund while incarcerated. In total, the terrorists received $141,837,087, or more than half a billion shekels. Of those, 316, or nearly half, received more than a million shekels. (Palestinian Media Watch created a program to crunch the numbers, inputting all the relevant P.A. criteria—crime, marital status, number of children, etc., to determine the size of their stipends.) 'It’s a tremendous force driving terror,' Itamar Marcus, Palestinian Media Watch’s founder and director, told JNS. First, it signals to Palestinians that these terrorists weren’t working in a vacuum, but were acting in the name of the P.A. Second, the wealth places the terrorists in an honored position in Palestinian society, in fact, 'Palestinian terrorists are the most honored people in Palestinian society,' he said. 'When they’re introduced, and in interviews, even years after they were released from jail, they’re called Asra ['Prisoner']. That’s their title. It’s like an ambassador. It’s actually similar to POW [prisoner of war]. They have a different word for criminal prisoners. For the P.A., they’re legitimate fighters, even if they killed women and children,' Marcus said. 'In another society, if a criminal goes to jail for murdering someone, he’s ashamed about it. In the Palestinian Authority, they go around with a crown on their heads,' he said. The P.A.’s ongoing 'pay-for-slay' program demonstrates that Israel’s efforts to curtail it have not succeeded. In July 2018, Israel, which collects tax and tariff revenue of behalf of the P.A., passed a law withholding those funds equal to the amount the P.A. paid to terrorists. The law aimed to put an end to the practice. The P.A. declared that payments would go on. P.A. President Mahmoud Abbas said in October 2019, 'The Martyrs and their families are sacred, [and so are] the wounded and the prisoners. We must pay all of them. If one penny remains in our hands it is for them and not for the living.' Abbas has made good on his pledge. Marcus told JNS that the P.A. has not paid its employees their full salaries—'at one point they skipped a whole month, which they’ve never made up'—to ensure imprisoned terrorists were paid in full. 'What’s outrageous, of course, is a person who’s living at home, working, who’s got five or six kids and needs the money—his salary you’re cutting to 70%. But the prisoner who’s getting everything—all his food and everything taken care of by Israel—that’s the one who’s getting 100%. So it’s just a message of values,' Marcus said. In response, Palestinian Media Watch spearheaded a campaign in 2020 together with the IDF to effect a change whereby much of Israel’s Anti-Terror Law would be applied to Judea and Samaria, 'rendering banks liable to punishment for facilitating P.A. terror salaries.' It worked to a degree. It sent the P.A. into crisis as it realized its banks would be exposed to international terror financing laws. 'According to the official statements that we got, 33,000 bank accounts were closed,' Marcus said. As a temporary workaround, the P.A. paid the terrorists’ families through the post office. (The families complained about the indignity of having to wait in line to receive their stipends, Marcus noted.) Then the P.A. opened a special bank dedicated solely to receiving the funds from the P.A. 'The only thing that this bank does is pay terrorist salaries,' he said. Marcus’s suggestion is to arrest anyone in the P.A. involved in the 'pay-for-slay' program, even if that means arresting the entire staff at the P.A.’s Ministry of Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs. 'They should all be arrested, put in jail, charged. And that would stop it very quickly,' he said.

Israel nearly launched massive attack to destroy Hezbollah four d...	Top IDF brass and defense minister Yoav Gallant were for striking the more powerful enemy first. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel came very close to preemptively striking Hezbollah four days after the October 7, 2023 Hamas invasion in the belief that one should hit the more powerful enemy first, The Jerusalem Post reported Thursday. IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi was thinking about such an operation within minutes of the war breaking out in the south, the report said. Military intelligence brought him information about a potential complementary invasion from Lebanon by the much stronger Hezbollah forces, with concern growing steadily due to the Iranian proxy’s launch of dozens of missiles at northern Israel starting on October 8. Halevi held round after round of consultations with top subordinates such as Northern Command chief Uri Gordon and air force commander Tomer Bar, and told several people that it 'was too good an opportunity to miss,' and that 'if there are two enemies, you go after the stronger one first to avoid them taking you by surprise,' the report said. The chief of staff also contacted then-defense minister Yoav Gallant, who strongly supported the idea to get the jump on Hezbollah before it organized for a major attack. Both Halevi and Gallant met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the subject, although Gallant had a very hard time getting in to see Netanyahu and had to be content at first with speaking to the prime minister’s confidant, Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer. He made it clear to Dermer that Hezbollah had to be attacked now, and not doing so could lead to the opportunity being lost for a long time. Instead of bringing the defense minister to Netanyahu, Dermer called U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, which led to President Joe Biden talking directly to Netanyahu. Biden made the American position crystal clear, saying, 'Do not do this&#8230;. This is a mistake. Do not go down this road.' U.S. intelligence and the military strongly believed that the Israelis were reading Hezbollah’s actions incorrectly, that it had no plans for an invasion, and that a strike that would cripple the terror group would lead to a regional war. This opinion was conveyed to Dermer when Netanyahu actually interrupted a security cabinet meeting for the minister to call Sullivan again. The report said that Sullivan brought the top U.S. guns to convince Dermer, including then-secretary of state Antony Blinken, defense secretary Lloyd Austin, CIA director William Burns, director of national intelligence Avril Haines, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs CQ Brown. When Netanyahu, Gallant, Halevi and Dermer met after the call, the report said that the prime minister clearly voiced his disapproval of a strike. 'I am opposed,' he said. 'We would face massive destruction on the home front. You see all of these buildings in Tel Aviv. They will all be destroyed. Hezbollah just has too many rockets. Also, we need the full backing of the Americans for invading Gaza.' He was also fearful, he said, that 'the blow to the Israeli home front will be so horrible that it will cause a deep demoralization.' When speaking to the security cabinet, Netanyahu focused on the political aspect, saying that Biden’s message to him had been 'that a [wrong] decision to significantly escalate the conflict with Hezbollah with a preemptive strike could radically alter Israeli-US relations.' He also received crucial support from Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, whose party joined the government in a show of national unity following the surprise invasion, and were in the cabinet. They are both former chiefs of staff, and lent an Israeli military imprimatur to foregoing a strike even while Halevi was being backed by his intelligence chief Aharon Haliva, Bar and Gordon, besides the heads of the Mossad and Shabak. In the event, when the IDF turned its attention to Hezbollah in September, almost a full year after the war began, with tens of thousands of northern residents having been displaced from their homes the whole time, the war in Lebanon ended within three months with the terror group’s crushing defeat. Then, too, the Biden administration had expressed its firm opinion that Israel should not strike Hezbollah.

Saudis deny Trump’s claims on Israel normalization, blast Gaza pl...	Riyadh pushes back on President Trump's claim that Saudi Arabia is willing to normalize ties with Israel without Palestinian statehood, while bashing president's Gaza relocation plan as 'fantasy of ethnic cleansing.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Saudi Arabia rebutted claims earlier this week by President Donald Trump that the oil-rich Islamic kingdom is willing to establish full diplomatic relations with Israel even without Jerusalem's backing for Palestinian statehood, saying Riyadh's insistence on a two-state solution remains 'firm and unwavering.' During his meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, Trump responded to questions regarding the expansion of the Abraham Accords and normalization of ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia. 'No, they're not,' Trump said, when asked whether the Saudis were still insisting Jerusalem back Palestinian statehood as a precondition for normalization. Publicly, Riyadh has for years conditioned recognition of Israel on Jerusalem's acceptance of a two-state solution. The Saudi Foreign Ministry reiterated that position Wednesday, issuing a statement denying Trump's claims. 'The Ministry of Foreign Affairs affirms that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s position on the establishment of a Palestinian state is firm and unwavering,' Riyadh said. 'His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed Bin Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, Crown Prince and Prime Minister, clearly and unequivocally reaffirmed this stance during his speech at&#8230;the Shura Council on September 18, 2024.' 'The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia emphasises that this unwavering position is non-negotiable and not subject to compromises. Achieving lasting and just peace is impossible without the Palestinian people obtaining their legitimate rights in accordance with international resolutions, as has been previously clarified to both the former and current US administrations.' Later on Wednesday, former Saudi intel chief Prince Turki al-Faisal appeared on CNN to condemn the president's plan, presented on Tuesday, to relocate Gazans en masse to third-party countries. The Saudi prince denounced the proposal as a 'fantasy' which would, if carried out, constitute 'ethnic cleansing' and promote 'more conflict and more bloodshed.' 'It is a fantasy to think that ethnic cleansing in the 21st century can be condoned by a world community that stays on its behinds and does not respond to that,' al Faisal said. 'The problem in Palestine is not the Palestinians. It is the Israeli occupation.' 'This has been clear and understood by everybody. Hence, you have United Nations resolutions calling for the quid pro quo of land for peace from 1967 until now.' 'The Arab Peace Initiative,' al Faisal cntinued, referencing the Saudi backed proposal, 'is based on that and offered Israel not only diplomatic relations, but all of the things that Israel wanted from trade, from normalization, etc., in return for the establishment of a Palestinian state with its capital in east Jerusalem.' All of these things were American policy until this latest wording that Mr. Trump has chosen to use in claiming that he wants to do better things, when actually it is going to turn things into more conflict and more bloodshed.'

Pro-Trump Arab American group changes name after US president flo...	The US will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too,' Trump told reporters. 'We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site.' By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner A prominent organization that sought to forge strong ties between US President Donald Trump and the Arab American community has changed its name in opposition to Trump’s proposal for the US to 'take over' over Gaza. On Wednesday, 'Arab Americans for Trump' announced a rebrand to 'Arab Americans for Peace,' criticizing the president for his failure to hold meetings with 'key Arab leaders' and his support for removing 'Palestinian inhabitants to other parts of the Arab world.' 'We strongly appreciate the president’s offer to clean and rebuild Gaza. However, the purpose should be to make Gaza habitable for Palestinians and no one else,' the group said in a press release explaining the name change. The group explained that it supports a separate independent state for Palestinians encompassing Gaza, Judea and Samaria, and East Jerusalem, expressing disappointment that Trump has not attempted to carve out a 'path to a permanent peace process.' Bishara Bahbah, chairman of the group, told the Associated Press that the organization is 'completely opposed' to Trump’s suggestion to transfer Gaza’s civilians out of the coastal enclave. 'The talk about what the president wants to do with Gaza, obviously we’re completely opposed to the idea of the transfer of Palestinians from anywhere in historic Palestine,' Bahbah said. 'And so we did not want to be behind the curve in terms of pushing for peace, because that has been our objective from the very beginning.' On Tuesday night, Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was visiting the White House, held a press conference following their private meeting in the Oval Office. Trump asserted that the US would assume control of Gaza and develop it economically into 'the Riviera of the Middle East' after Palestinians are resettled elsewhere. 'The US will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too,' Trump told reporters. 'We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site.' Earlier in the day, Trump referred to Gaza as a 'demolition site' and said its residents have 'no alternative' but to leave, suggesting Egypt, Jordan, and other Arab states as possible relocation sites. Trump performed remarkably well with Arab American voters in the 2024 presidential election. In the majority-Arab American city of Dearborn, Michigan, 42 percent of voters backed Trump, compared to 36 percent who supported Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Other Arab American leaders and organizations slammed Trump’s proposal to vacate Palestinians from Gaza. Layla Elabed, the co-chair of the Uncommitted National Movement, said she was 'sad, angry, and scared for our communities.' James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, called Trump’s comments 'dangerous, provocative, illegal, and callously insensitive to Palestinian needs.' Wa’el Alzayat, leader of EmgageUSA, an organization that advocates on behalf of Muslim Americans, rebuffed Trump’s proposal as a 'violation of international law.'

White House expands search for countries to take in Gazans – repo...	Along with Egypt and Jordan, Trump administration is reportedly considering three other territories to take in Gazans part of the president's plan to rehabilitate the coastal enclave. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Trump administration is mulling a number of possible third-party countries and territories as possible hosts for Gazans migrating out of the Gaza Strip under President Donald Trump's proposed plan for the coastal enclave, an Israeli media outlet reported Wednesday evening. On Tuesday, Trump said his administration would promote the relocation en masse of the Strip's entire population to third-party countries, resettling Gazans outside of the warzone, while the U.S. takes control of the area for its rehabilitation and development into a 'Middle Eastern Riviera.' Trump revealed last month that he has spoken with the leaders of Egypt and Jordan regarding the possibility of the two moderate Arab states taking in Gazans - a request both countries publicly rejected. Subsequent reports have claimed that the White House is also considering Indonesia and Albania as host countries. On Wednesday, Channel 12 News reported that the White House is now weighing working with Morocco and two territories inside of Somalia to resettle Gazans. The territories include Puntland, an autonomous zone on the northeastern edge of Somalia, and Somaliland, a self-declared state which has claimed independence from Somalia. Combined, the two areas have a total population of roughly 10.5 million. According to the report, the U.S. believes that Morocco and the two territories may be willing to work with the U.S. in exchange for American support, including backing for their claims in long-running territorial disputes. Morocco has been engaged in a long-running conflict with a separatist group in the Western Sahara. While Rabat maintains effective control over most of the Western Sahara, most countries refuse to recognize its sovereignty over the area. The first Trump administration granted American recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the area in exchange for Rabat's normalizing of relations with Israel in 2020.

IDF ordered to facilitate mass migration of Gazans	Israel's defense chief directs the military to draft plan enabling Gazans to leave the Gaza Strip en masse, following President Donald Trump's call for the relocation of the entire population of the coastal enclave. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Israeli military is preparing to help facilitate the mass migration of Palestinian Arabs out of the Gaza Strip, Israel's defense chief revealed Thursday. According to a statement released by Defense Minister Israel Katz's (Likud) office Thursday morning, the minister has instructed the IDF to aid Gazans wishing to leave the Strip to do so. In the statement, Katz lauded President Donald Trump's announcement Tuesday of his plans to relocate en masse the Gaza Strip's entire population to third-party countries. Trump's proposal, Katz said, is a 'courageous plan which could enable a wide swath of the population in Gaza to leave to various places around the world.' 'Hamas used Gaza residents as human shields and built terror infrastructure in the heart of the population, and is now holding them hostage, extorting money from them by use of humanitarian aid, and preventing them from leaving Gaza.' The defense minister's orders do not include any steps to force or encourage Gazans to emigrate, but merely to ensure IDF cooperation enabling those who express a desire to leave to do so. The measures would include ensuring the emigrants passage through land crossings or, in special cases, arrangement of passage by sea or air, presumably via Israel. 'Gaza’s residents should be allowed the freedom to exit and emigrate, as is the practice anywhere around the world,' Katz said. Taking aim at countries which have endorsed unilateral Palestinian statehood and backed 'false accusations' against Israel's conduct in the Gaza Strip, Katz suggested Spain, Ireland, and Norway take in Gazans. Katz also noted that Canada has 'previously voiced a willingness to absorb Gaza residents.'

Defense Secretary: US will help Israel ‘eradicate radical enemies...	Netanyahu praised Trump's 'peace through strength' doctrine, saying that Israel shares the same perspective on maintaining a powerful military in order to ensure reginal stability. By World Israel News Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth met at the Pentagon on Wednesday, with the two men stressing the importance of military cooperation between Israel and the United States. 'We're honored to stand alongside you and stare down many of the same threats that you do, and under President Trump's leadership, just like you, we are totally committed to achieving peace through strength,' Hegseth told Netanyahu, according to a summary of the meeting published by the Department of Defense. 'We are going to continue to grow our defense industrial base,' Hegseth continued, adding that he had been to Israel numerous times and understands the threats facing the Jewish State. The secretary of defense referenced previous weapons shipments that were delayed by the Biden administration, pledging that Washington would now provide Israel with advanced arms needed for a decisive victory over its enemies. Some of those munitions include 2,000 pound bombs, which Israel had paid for but were not delivered during Biden's tenure. 'We've supplied munitions that were previously not supplied [and] that are useful in eradicating radical enemies, and we are committed to continuing to do so,' Hegseth said. 'Destroying Hamas's capabilities in Gaza, Hezbollah's capabilities in the north, damaging the Houthi infrastructure in Yemen and things that are of great importance to America,' he added. Netanyahu praised Trump's 'peace through strength' doctrine, saying that Israel shares the same perspective on maintaining a powerful military in order to ensure reginal stability. 'The only way to get peace, and enduring peace, is by being very, very strong,' he said. 'And with our alliance and your support, including the decision … of supplying Israel the much-needed tools for our defense, we are a lot stronger than we've ever been.'

3 arrested for waving Hamas flags, celebrating released terrorist...	During the celebrations for released security prisoners, the trio waved Hamas flags and praised the terror group. By World Israel News Staff Three people were arrested for publicly supporting terror during celebrations marking the release of security prisoners, Israeli security forces said in a statement on Wednesday. The suspects, who were not named in the media release, are residents of Palestinian Authority-controlled enclaves in Judea and Samaria. They reportedly participated in welcoming home convicted terrorists who were freed to the Ramallah area during the ongoing ceasefire and hostage deal. During the celebrations, the trio waved Hamas flags, praised the terror group, and engaged in other activity 'disruptive to public order,' which is against Israeli law. 'The determined, intelligent, and professional operations of our security forces conveyed a clear message - celebrating the release of terrorists will not happen on our watch,' said Border Police Commander Maj. Itzhak Brik in a press statement. 'We will not allow any attempts to disrupt public order. We will continue to monitor the released terrorists, who must know that any of them who return to terrorism will be met with the full force of the State of Israel's security forces.' Last week, footage of a senior terrorist being released to an eastern Jerusalem neighborhood while clad in a Hamas scarf sparked widespread outrage. Ashraf Zagheir, who was serving a life sentence for his involvement in a Tel Aviv bus bombing, was freed from an Israeli prison in late January. He was welcomed home to the Kfar Aqab neighborhood with a procession promoting the Hamas terror group, as participants waved Hamas flags and fired into the air. At the time, police said that the 'terms of the hostage release deal' prevented them from being able to re-arrest Zagheir on charges of promoting terror. It's unclear if the suspects arrested by the police on Wednesday included those who had participated in celebrations marking Zagheir's release.

Attacked IDF post operated ‘like Oct. 7th didn’t happen’ – Report	The terrorist managed to ascend the observation tower at the compound, killing a soldier inside the pillbox and another on the ground. By World Israel News Staff The army post in northern Samaria that was the scene of a recent deadly terror attack had operated according to lax security standards, according to a report from Hebrew-language outlet KAN News. Two IDF reservists were killed and eight others were wounded when a terrorist infiltrated a military compound and observation tower next to the Tayasir checkpoint on Tuesday. The terrorist, armed with an M-16 automatic assault rifle and clad in a bulletproof vest, reportedly scouted out the site days in advance of the attack. He then snuck into the compound under the cover of darkness in the early hours of Tuesday morning, then attacked at around 6:00 am. There were 12 soldiers present in the compound at the time of the attack, with two shot fatally and another eight sustaining wounds from gunfire. The terrorist managed to ascend the observation tower at the site, killing a soldier inside the pillbox and another on the ground. The troops at the Tayasir outpost engaged in a minutes-long firefight with the terrorist, but failed to neutralize him. A soldier from a back-up squad eventually hurled a grenade at the terrorist, finally killing the assailant and ending the attack. The perpetrator was later identified as Mohammad Daraghmeh. His brother, Ahmad Daraghmeh, was the commander of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s Tubas Battalion and was killed by Israeli security forces in February 2024. The army has pledged to 'learn lessons' from the deadly attack, referring to it as a 'difficult incident.' The attack demonstrated a major security failure on the part of the IDF, with many questioning how the terrorist was able to access the compound so easily. 'The lessons haven't been learned, unfortunately, as if October 7 never happened,' a security source told KAN News. Maj. Ofer Yung and Maj. Avraham Tzvi (Tzvika) Friedman were killed in the attack. Yung leaves behind a wife and two children, and Friedman is survived by his wife and six children.

An EU spokesperson reaffirmed the commitment to two-state solution as a resolution to the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The European Union has firmly rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for post-war Gaza, emphasizing that it views Gaza as an integral part of a future Palestinian state. An EU spokesperson reaffirmed its commitment to the establishment of a Palestinian state as a resolution to the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The EU’s statement was a response to Trump’s announcement at a press conference on Tuesday, attended by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. During the event, Trump declared that the U.S. would permanently relocate the entire population of the Gaza Strip to other countries, assume control of the territory, and redevelop it into a luxury coastal destination akin to a Middle Eastern 'Riviera.' Several high-profile Israeli lawmakers, from both the Coalition and the Opposition, praised Trump’s plan. Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana (Likud) described it as the 'dawn of a new day.' 'This is what happens when two brave leaders meet,' said Transportation Minister Miri Regev, also of the ruling Likud party. Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar (New Hope) expressed optimism about the proposal, saying it was important to 'consider out-of-the-box ideas.' 'Gaza in its previous form has no future. Another solution must be found – and that’s what President Trump is trying to do,' said Sa’ar. A number of European governments, including Germany, France, Britain, and Spain, voiced strong opposition to Trump’s plan. 'The displacement of the Palestinian civilian population from Gaza would not only be unacceptable and a violation of international law,' said German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, 'but it would also lead to new suffering and new hatred.' British Foreign Minister David Lammy reiterated London’s support for a two-state solution. 'We must see Palestinians live and prosper in their homelands in Gaza and the West Bank.' France’s foreign ministry echoed Lammy’s remarks, stating that Paris will 'continue to advocate for the implementation of the two-state solution, the only framework that can ensure lasting peace and security for both Israelis and Palestinians.'

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Iran’s Foreign Minister responded to Trump’s 'maximum pressure' policy on Tuesday, predicting it would fail but suggesting that an agreement with the U.S. could be possible if the issue was limited to preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. 'Maximum pressure is a failed experiment, and trying it again will only lead to another failure,' said Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. He added, 'If the primary concern is preventing Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons, this can be achieved without difficulty.' Araghchi did not address Trump’s threat of sanctions on Iranian oil exports. A U.S. official told Reuters on Tuesday that Trump plans to sign an executive order reinstating a 'maximum pressure' campaign against the Islamic Republic of Iran. The order seeks to block all avenues for the Iranian regime to obtain nuclear weapons while countering Tehran’s harmful regional influence, the official stated. It directs U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to apply maximum economic pressure through sanctions and enforcement measures against those who violate existing restrictions. Once Trump signs the order, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will collaborate with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to amend or revoke existing sanctions waivers, aiming to reduce the Islamic regime’s oil exports to zero, the official said. On Wednesday, Trump took to social media to emphasize that his 'maximum pressure' campaign was not intended to destroy Iran’s infrastructure but rather to take steps toward achieving a nuclear peace treaty. 'I want Iran to be a great and successful Country, but one that cannot have a Nuclear Weapon. Reports that the United States, working in conjunction with Israel, is going to blow Iran into smithereens,' ARE GREATLY EXAGGERATED,' Trump wrote. 'I would much prefer a Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper. We should start working on it immediately, and have a big Middle East Celebration when it is signed and completed. God Bless the Middle East!'

Mr. President, only you can bring my sister home!' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Emma Tsurkov, the sister of hostage Elizabeth Tsurkov, criticized the Biden administration and corrupt Iraqi officials for the lack of progress in securing her sister’s release. 'It's been 687 days since my sister Elizabeth, a Princeton student, was kidnapped in Baghdad—687 days of incompetence and inaction by the Iraqi prime minister,' Tsurkov wrote. 'The Biden administration has kept showering corrupt Iraqi officials with hundreds of millions of our taxpayer dollars without accountability. Thank God a tough leader with a backbone of steel is in the White House and has stopped playing games. Mr. President, only you can bring my sister home!' she added. Elizabeth Tsurkov, a researcher specializing in the Middle East at Princeton University, traveled to Iraq on her Russian passport to conduct research for her doctoral dissertation. However, Israeli citizens are prohibited from traveling to enemy nations, even with a foreign passport, due to security concerns. She has been held hostage by a Shia militia in Iraq since 2023. Tsurkov’s family said they spoke with her the day before she was captured and that nothing seemed unusual. 'We talked the day before the kidnapping—a completely normal and standard conversation about the interviews she had done and what was left for her to complete,' they said. Last week, the British website Amwaj reported that, in exchange for Tsurkov, Israel would release eight Hezbollah terrorists captured since the beginning of the conflict with Lebanon. One of the terrorists slated for release is Imad Ahmaz, a senior member of Hezbollah’s naval force, who was captured three months earlier in a special operation by Shayetet 13. Last week, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein told Axios that Tsurkov is still alive after two years in captivity and that Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani is working toward her release. In a September 2023 interview, the Iraqi prime minister said it was unclear who was responsible for abducting Tsurkov. 'The incident damages the reputation of Iraq’s stability and the capabilities of our security agencies,' he said.

Favorite son? New Yorkers like Trump more than Dem governor, poll...	She also holds a negative 44-48 percent job approval rating, with only 22 percent saying that Hochul's administration has improved New York's fiscal condition. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon Residents of deep-blue New York view President Donald Trump more favorably than Democratic governor Kathy Hochul, who struggles with low approval ratings and bleak reelection prospects, according to a poll released Monday. Trump's favorability in the Empire State has risen to 41 percent, up from 37 percent in December, while just 39 percent of New York voters rate Hochul favorably, according to the Siena College poll. The poll found that only 31 percent of New Yorkers would vote to reelect Hochul, with 57 percent saying they would vote for 'someone else.' Hochul has faced widespread criticism in recent months for her mixed messages on congestion pricing, which was slated to go into effect in June 2024 until she unexpectedly blocked it. She started the program last month, charging drivers $9 to enter Midtown Manhattan. The governor, who is eyeing a reelection bid next year, has not received a positive favorability rating among New York voters in the survey since January 2024. She also holds a negative 44-48 percent job approval rating, with only 22 percent saying that Hochul's administration has improved New York's fiscal condition. Trump was a lifelong New Yorker until he made his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida his primary residence in 2019. 'Governor Hochul's favorability and job approval ratings continue to languish in negative territory,' Siena College pollster Steven Greenberg said, noting that 41 percent of Democrats prefer another candidate as their next governor. Trump's job approval rating stands at 46-51 percent, according to the Monday poll. The president lost New York by 12.6 percentage points in the 2024 election, down from 23.1 points in 2020 and 22.6 points in 2016. The post Favorite son?

Additionally, an amulet depicting the Egyptian god Bes was found among the burial items, and Bes was often associated with the protection of women and children, suggesting that many of the deceased may have been women. By Pesach Benson, TPS Archaeologists uncovered a 2,500-year-old burial site in the Negev Highlands, shedding light on ancient trade routes that connected cultures from Yemen, Phoenicia, Egypt, and beyond, the Israel Antiquities Authority announced on Wednesday. The site, south of Beer-Sheva, contains dozens of tombs believed to belong to individuals from caravans that passed through the region, highlights the Negev’s role as an international crossroads during the 7th to 5th centuries BCE. Archaeologists found copper and silver jewelry, alabaster items used for incense preparation, amulets, beads, and vessels likely used to transport incense resins. 'The discovery is unique and it points to wide-reaching cultural interchange between southern and northern Arabia, Phoenicia, Egypt and southern Europe,' said excavation director Dr. Martin David Pasternak. They also found arrowheads made of flint, a material associated with ancient trade from Yemen and Oman, with traces of ochre. 'The presence of ochre on these arrowheads may indicate their religious or cultic significance as having special value,' explained Dr. Jacob Vardi, an Antiquities Authority specialist in flint tools. The tombs raise intriguing questions about their purpose and the nature of the trade caravans that used the route. Pasternak said the tombs could have served as a long-term burial site for caravans passing through the area, or they may mark the mass burial of a caravan that came under attack. Despite their location at a remote junction in the desert, the site’s strategic position along key trade routes makes it a plausible resting place for travelers engaged in long and perilous journeys across difficult terrain. These traders were likely involved in the transport of valuable goods such as frankincense and myrrh, prized commodities from southern Arabia. The findings also suggest a more complex social dynamic among the caravans. Dr. Tali Erickson-Gini, a senior researcher, pointed to the presence of artifacts that may indicate the involvement of women in these trade networks. Texts from the period describe the purchase of women as part of the caravan trade, and an inscription found in Yemen records the purchase of 30 women from Gaza. Additionally, an amulet depicting the Egyptian god Bes was found among the burial items. Bes was often associated with the protection of women and children, suggesting that many of the deceased may have been women. This raises the possibility that the caravans could have been involved in human trafficking, a practice documented in ancient texts. 'The discovery emphasizes the central role of the Negev in antiquity as an international crossroad and as a gateway for trade and a meeting place of cultures,' said Antiquities Authority director Eli Escusido. 'The discovery is unique and it enables us to touch small but important historical moments of the people who traversed the desert through this place centuries ago.'

‘Slidetronics’: Breakthrough in atomic layer manipulation could t...	These new configurations, once formed, remain stable even after the external force is removed and can store information, functioning much like a tiny memory unit. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli researchers revealed an atomic innovation that could pave the way for faster, more efficient memory storage, advanced semiconductors, and even quantum computing technologies, offering a level of precision and control never before seen in material science. In a Tel Aviv University study released on Wednesday, researchers shared a new method of manipulating the atomic layers of materials such as graphite to create new configurations with unique properties. 'Slidetronics,' as the researchers call it, works by sliding the layers of materials that are held together by weak van der Waals forces, such as graphite, into different stable positions. Van der Waals forces are weak, short-range forces that occur between atoms or molecules. Unlike chemical bonds, which involve the sharing or transfer of electrons, van der Waals forces are a result of temporary shifts in the distribution of electrons around atoms or molecules. The scientists, led by Prof. Ben Shalom and PhD students Maayan Vizner Stern and Simon Salleh Atri, achieved the slidetronic shifts by applying small forces like electric fields or mechanical pressure, which caused the atomic layers to slide into new configurations. These new configurations, once formed, remain stable even after the external force was removed. The result is a material that can store information, functioning much like a tiny memory unit. The findings were recently published in the peer-reviewed Nature Review Physics. The researchers said that the ability to control these atomic-level structural changes opens up new possibilities for manipulating material properties on demand. 'Like graphite, nature produces many other materials with weakly bonded layers. Each layer behaves like a LEGO brick—breaking a single brick is difficult, but separating and reconnecting two bricks is relatively simple,' said Stern. 'Similarly, in layered materials, the layers prefer specific stacking positions where atoms align perfectly with those in the neighboring layer. Sliding between these positions happens in tiny, discrete jumps—just an atomic distance at a time.' The researchers also explored how different numbers of layers influence material properties. For example, three layers of a material with two types of atoms can create six distinct stable materials, each with unique internal polarizations. With five layers, this number increases to 45 different possible structures. By switching between these configurations, scientists can control electrical, magnetic, and optical properties. Even graphite, composed solely of carbon, can rearrange into six different crystalline forms, each with distinct electrical conductivities, infrared responses, magnetizations, and superconducting properties, the researchers noted. The potential applications are vast. First and foremost, Slidetronics could revolutionize memory storage. By utilizing the ability to shift atomic layers into distinct arrangements, researchers can create ultra-small memory units that are faster, more efficient, and have higher storage capacities than existing technologies. These tiny memory units could outperform traditional memory storage devices, offering enhanced speed and lower energy consumption. Additionally, the precise control over atomic layers could lead to the development of advanced semiconductors with customizable electrical properties. The ability to manipulate materials at the atomic level also holds promise for quantum computing. By controlling the electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of materials, Slidetronics could help develop more efficient qubits—quantum bits that are central to quantum computers, leading to faster and more powerful quantum systems. Other practical applications include the creation of new superconducting materials or those with specialized magnetic properties, useful in fields like medical imaging, energy transmission, and particle physics. The precise manipulation of materials could also enable the development of customizable smart materials that adapt to changing conditions, with applications in robotics, aerospace, and medicine.

Trump intends to sign an executive order resuming a 'maximum pressure' campaign on the Islamic Republic of Iran, a U.S. official told Reuters on Tuesday. By JNS Iran should be a successful country but it must not acquire nuclear weapons, U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday. Dismissing reports that the U.S. and Israel plan to destroy Iranian nuclear infrastructure as 'greatly exaggerated,' he instead advocated for a verified nuclear peace agreement. He called for immediate efforts to negotiate such a deal. 'I want Iran to be a great and successful Country, but one that cannot have a Nuclear Weapon. Reports that the United States, working in conjunction with Israel, is going to blow Iran into smithereens,' ARE GREATLY EXAGGERATED,' Trump wrote. 'I would much prefer a Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper. We should start working on it immediately, and have a big Middle East Celebration when it is signed and completed. God Bless the Middle East!' Trump intends to sign an executive order resuming a 'maximum pressure' campaign on the Islamic Republic of Iran, a U.S. official told Reuters on Tuesday. The order is aimed at denying the Iranian regime all paths to nuclear weapons and countering Tehran’s malign regional influence, the official stated. The order directs U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to impose maximum economic pressure, including via sanctions and enforcement mechanisms on those violating existing measures. After Trump signs the order, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will work with Bessent to modify or rescind existing sanction waivers to drive the Islamic regime’s oil exports to zero, the official said. Iran is seeking to quickly build a crude nuclear device, with the aim of deterring a Western attack, The New York Times reported on Monday, citing U.S. officials. The assessment is based on intelligence collected during the final months of the Biden administration and passed on to Trump’s national security team during the transition, the officials said. Iran has the knowledge to make an 'older-style nuclear weapon, one that could be put together far faster than the more sophisticated designs Tehran has considered in the past,' the Times reported. Iran likely obtained the weapon’s blueprints from Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan (1936-2021), according to the report. Although such a weapon would not fit on a ballistic missile and would be less reliable than more modern ones, it could be built faster and would serve as a deterrent against attack.

Trump’s Gaza plan draws praise, condemnations, and outrage	Israeli leaders and Republicans laud Trump for 'bold new plan' to resettle Gazans, while European foreign ministers reject the plan, and Palestinian leaders and far-left Democrats accuse Trump of planning 'ethnic cleansing.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Reactions around the world to President Donald Trump's plan for the Gaza Strip, unveiled at a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House Tuesday, ranged from full-throated praise to accusations of ethnic cleansing. During Tuesday's press conference, Trump announced that his administration is seeking to 'permanently' resettle the entire population of the Gaza Strip in third-party countries, with the U.S. taking control of the coastal enclave and rebuilding it as a Middle Eastern 'Riviera.' A number of prominent Israeli lawmakers, both from the Coalition and the Opposition, lauded Trump's plan, with Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana (Likud) calling it the 'dawn of a new day.' 'This is what happens when two brave leaders meet,' said Transportation Minister Miri Regev, also of the ruling Likud party. MK Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit), a former National Security Minister who bolted the government last month over the Gaza ceasefire deal, called the plan the 'beginning of a beautiful friendship.' Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar (New Hope) expressed optimism regarding the plan, saying it was important to 'consider out-of-the-box ideas.' 'Gaza in its previous form has no future. Another solution must be found – and that’s what President Trump is trying to do.' Opposition MK and former Defense Minister Benny Gantz said the plan demonstrated that Trump 'is a true friend of Israel and will continue to stand by it on issues important to strengthening its security.' In a statement, Gantz called Trump's idea 'creative, original and interesting.' 'In his remarks, he presented creative, original and interesting thinking, which must be examined alongside the realization of the goals of the war, giving priority to the return of all the hostages.' Israeli Opposition Leader Yair Lapid (Yesh Atid) declined to either praise or criticize the proposal, saying he would need time to 'study the details.' 'We will have to study the details to understand what the plan is in Gaza,' Lapid told Galei Tzahal radio on Wednesday. A far-left Knesset Member, Ofer Cassif, the token Jewish member of the Arab Hadash-Ta'al list, excoriated Trump's plan, threatening to 'blow up the bridges' to block the 'transfer' of Gaza's population. 'Facing the notion of ​​Arab deportation and exile — ‘transfer’ — we must stand up and say sharply and simply: It will be impossible because we will not allow it,' Cassif tweeted. 'Even if we have to lie down under the wheels of trucks. Even if we have to blow up the bridges. There will be no mass deportation by force, because we will not allow it to happen.' Cassif is already suspended from the Knesset after he praised Palestinian terrorists and joined a petition to the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide in the Gaza Strip. The Chinese Foreign Ministry panned the Gaza plan, with spokesman Lin Jian dubbing it a 'forced transfer.' 'China has always maintained that Palestinian rule over Palestinians is the basic principle of the postwar governance of Gaza, and we are opposed to the forced transfer of the residents of Gaza.' Multiple European governments joined in voicing their objections to Trump's plan, including Germany, France, Britain, and Spain. 'A displacement of the Palestinian civilian population from Gaza would not just be unacceptable and against international law,' said German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. 'This would also lead to new suffering and new hatred.' British Foreign Minister David Lammy said London still backs a two-state solution. 'We must see Palestinians live and prosper in their homelands in Gaza and the West Bank.' France's foreign ministry echoed Lammy's comments, saying Paris will 'continue to campaign for the implementation of the two-state solution, the only one that can guarantee long-term peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians alike.' Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares told reporters his government rejected Trump's plan. 'I want to be very clear on this: Gaza is the land of Gazan Palestinians and they must stay in Gaza.' Among the Palestinian leadership, both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority were unequivocal in their condemnation of the relocation plan. Hamas denounced Trump's proposal as a 'recipe for generating chaos and tension,' while PA chief Mahmoud Abbas said the plan was 'not negotiable.' 'President Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian leadership expressed their strong rejection of calls to seize the Gaza Strip and displace Palestinians outside their homeland,' his office said. At home, multiple Republican lawmakers responded positively to Trump's plan, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who hailed the proposal as a 'bold action in hopes of achieving lasting peace in Gaza.' 'We are hopeful this brings much needed stability and security to the region,' Johnson tweeted. 'Hamas terrorists murdered babies and burned people alive,' said Florida Senator Rick Scott. 'They are evil monsters. Thank God we finally have a president who is committed to standing with Israel and working with Netanyahu on how to support their efforts to get terrorists out of Gaza and bring every hostage home.' Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman praised the Gaza plan as 'brilliant, historic.' 'Trump’s proposed USA takeover of the Gaza Strip may sound out of the box, but it is brilliant, historic and the only idea I have heard in 50 years that has a chance of bringing security, peace and prosperity to this troubled region.' Under President Trump, America will be the beacon of PEACE for the world! It’s time to change the Middle East in pursuit of ending endless war, and this is EXACTLY how it’s done,' said Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. On the Left, Michigan Democrat Rep. Rashida Tlaib excoriated both Trump and Netanyahu, calling the latter a 'genocidal war criminal,' while accusing the president of pursuing 'ethnic cleansing.' 'This president is openly calling for ethnic cleansing while sitting next to a genocidal war criminal,' Tlaib tweeted. 'He’s perfectly fine cutting off working Americans from federal funds while the funding to the Israeli government continues flowing.' 'Palestinians aren’t going anywhere. This president can only spew this fanatical bullshit because of bipartisan support in Congress for funding genocide and ethnic cleansing. It's time for my two-state solution colleagues to speak up.'

Jewish population of Judea & Samaria to top 1 million by 2050	Number of Israelis living in Judea and Samaria rises to 530,000, not including 340,000 Israelis living in parts of Jerusalem liberated in 1967, report says. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The number of Israelis living in Judea and Samaria topped 530,000 in 2025, with the settler population slated to exceed one million by 2050, according to a new report published Wednesday morning. The report, drafted by the Bet El Institutions and former MK Yaakov Katz, and based on data collected by Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, found that as of New Year's Eve, the number of residents registered in the 125 Israeli towns in Judea and Samaria stood at 529,455, and is now projected to be nearing 540,000. The growth rate of Judea and Samaria's Israeli population continues to exceed that of Israel as a whole by more than twofold, with the area growing 2.33% during 2024, compared to 1.1% for Israel as a whole. The statistics do not include the roughly 340,000 people living in Israeli neighborhoods in Jerusalem in areas liberated during the 1967 war. With the population of east Jerusalem included, roughly 880,000 Israelis now live in areas liberated from Jordan in the Six Day War. If the growth rate observed in Judea and Samaria over the past five years continues, the number of Israelis living in the area will reach close to 605,000 in five years, nearly 700,000 by 2035, and will top 1,030,000 by 2050. The two largest settlements are both ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) cities, with Modi'in Illit, in Samaria, topping the list with 90,633 residents, followed by Beitar Illit in Judea, with 73,198 residents. Maale Adumim, east of Jerusalem, came in a distant third with 40,606 residents, followed by Givat Ze'ev with 24,654 and Ariel rounding out the top five with 21,711. The Jordan Valley was the district within Judea and Samaria which enjoyed the most significant growth during 2024, expanding by 4.2% last year and by 25.5% during the last five years.

Stockholm cracks down on mosque serving as Iranian spy ring	Swedish authorities escalated their investigation last month with a late-night raid on Mohsen Hakimollahi’s Stockholm residence. By Jewish Breaking News Sweden has cracked down on what officials say is an Iranian intelligence operation hiding behind Stockholm’s largest Shiite mosque. Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed revealed on Monday that the Imam Ali Islamic Center (IAC) has been under investigation for serving as a platform for Iranian intelligence operations targeting both Swedish interests and the Iranian diaspora community. 'This is extremely serious,' Forssmed told Expressen, adding that Sweden had stopped all state monetary aid to the center. He also said that 'additional measures' were being pursued but did not provide further information. Swedish authorities escalated their investigation last month with a late-night raid on Mohsen Hakimollahi’s Stockholm residence. The 63-year-old Imam, sent by Tehran in 2011 to run the center, had held permanent residency since 2017. He was arrested and issued a deportation order last Thursday. Predictably, the mosque maintains its innocence. 'IAC maintains strict oversight to ensure that our premises are not used as a platform for any criminal activity,' IAC states on its website. 'The Centre aims, inter alia, to create a more friendly relationship and cooperation with various institutions, including government, to facilitate the integration of Muslims into Swedish society.' Iran has since summoned Sweden’s ambassador to protest. 'The Swedish ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Ministry yesterday, where we clearly expressed our concerns,' Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ismail Baghaei said as cited by state-run IRNA. 'Some decisions appear to be influenced by third parties who do not wish well for Iran-Sweden relations.' Sweden’s action follows similar measures across Europe, most notably Germany’s closure of the Hamburg Islamic Center in August over extremist activities linked to Iran. Authorities have not yet announced whether the mosaue will face closure following its terror director’s detention.

Netanyahu gifts Trump with golden pager	The prime minister called the president 'the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House' in their joint press conference. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented President Trump with gifts of a golden pager and a regular one during their meeting Tuesday, as tokens of one of Israel’s most spectacular anti-terror successes last year. The president understood immediately, saying, 'That was a great operation.' The Mossad had booby-trapped thousands of pagers that it managed to sell to Hezbollah through a third party, and when they were simultaneously detonated in September, about 30 Hezbollah operatives were killed and 3,000 were wounded. According to Mossad agents speaking to the American news show 60 Minutes two months later, 'It was the tipping point of the war' against the Lebanese terror group, which soon agreed to a ceasefire with Israel. For his part, Trump gave Netanyahu a picture of the two of them and, referring to the prime minister by his nickname, he wrote a dedication across its top, 'To Bibi, a great leader.' Netanyahu praised Trump fulsomely in their post-meeting, joint press conference, in which the president proposed that the U.S. take over Gaza in order to rebuild it and move the entire Palestinian population there to other countries for their own safety and to enable them to build better lives for themselves. Netanyahu first repeated Israel’s goals in Gaza, 'Destroy Hamas’s military and governing capabilities, secure the release of all our hostages and ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel.' He then said to Trump, 'Your willingness to think outside the box with fresh ideas will help us to achieve these goals. And I’ve seen you do this many times. You cut to the chase, see things others refuse to see, say things others refuse to say, and after the jaws drop people scratch their heads and say, 'You know, he’s right.'' 'This is the kind of thinking that enabled us to bring the Abraham Accords, enable us to shape the Middle East and bring peace,' he added. He also thanked Trump for inviting him to be the first foreign leader to visit the White House in his second term, saying, 'This is a testament to your friendship and support for the Jewish state and the Jewish people.' 'I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again: You are the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House,' he continued. He ticked off a list of things Trump has already done for the Jewish state, including pressure that the president applied before entering office, which Netanyahu called 'leadership to help bring our hostages home, among them American citizens.' Referring to executive orders Trump has since signed, he said, 'You freed up munitions that have been withheld from Israel in the midst of a seven-front war for our existence. You ended unjust sanctions against law-abiding Israeli citizens, you boldly confronted the scourge of antisemitism, you stopped funding international organizations like UNRWA that support and fund terrorists, and today you renewed the maximum pressure campaign against Iran.' The latter was a reference to a directive to the U.S. Treasury to enforce sanctions in order to 'drive Iran’s oil exports to zero,' which would cripple the Islamic Republic’s economy that is almost completely dependent on its oil sales. 'Ladies and gentlemen,' Netanyahu said, 'all this in just two weeks, can we imagine where we’ll be in four years? I can, I know you can, Mr. President.'

Disabled ‘climate leaders’ in Asia, ‘indigenous language tech’ in...	Here's a rundown of USAID spending under President Joe Biden. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon As the Trump administration works to shrink the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and place it under the State Department's umbrella, congressional Democrats have argued that the move 'endangers lives and undermines U.S. national security.' But away from funding for lifesaving medicines like HIV drugs, funding that is exempt from the State Department's broader foreign aid freeze, USAID has spent millions in taxpayer cash on left-wing priorities like climate activism—and bankrolled groups linked to Palestinian terrorism. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced Monday that he will serve as USAID’s acting leader while the Trump administration works to reduce the agency's spending. The agency's career staffers have battled the administration's 90-day freeze on foreign funding, seeking exemptions that would funnel tens of millions of dollars to agency bureaus that cover issues like 'environmental justice' and 'LGBTQI+ Inclusive Development,' the Washington Free Beacon reported. The Trump administration responded by putting scores of those staffers on administrative leave, a move Rubio said came in response to 'insubordination.' USAID 'has a history of … deciding that they're somehow a global charity separate from the national interest,' he told reporters on Monday. 'That sort of insubordination makes it impossible to conduct a sort of mature and serious review that I think foreign aid writ large should have.' Rubio said that the State Department will not gut foreign aid altogether, but rather cut 'programs that run counter to what we're trying to do in our national strategy.' Here's a rundown of spending under President Joe Biden that may fit that description: $1 Million To Make Disabled Tajikistanis 'Climate Leaders' In 2023, Biden’s USAID allocated up to $1 million in taxpayer funds on a project to help disabled people in Tajikistan become 'climate leaders,' the Free Beacon reported at the time. The grant notice solicited proposals for a 'Disability-Inclusive Climate Action' project in the Central Asian country. The cash was meant to ensure that disabled Tajikistanis were included 'in the development of climate change response and mitigation policies.' USAID championed the funding under its 2022-2030 climate strategy, a $150 billion 'whole-of-agency approach' that aimed to create an 'equitable world with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.' The Tajikistan grant was centered on ensuring 'that climate action by governments and other actors is informed by and responsive to the unique ideas and contributions of persons with disabilities.' $1 Million for Foreign DEI Programs, Including 'Indigenous Language Technology' in Guatemala Just before leaving office, the Biden administration pushed out more than $1 million in taxpayer-funded diversity, equity, and inclusion programs abroad, the Free Beacon reported. The funding notice, privately transmitted to Congress just before Christmas, said USAID would 'engage with Indigenous-led institutions to implement an Indigenous language technology program' in Guatemala, where nearly 95 percent of residents speak Spanish. In Kenya, meanwhile, USAID promised to 'build a collaborative bridge between U.S. higher education institutions, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities; select Kenyan universities; and the private sector.' And in Indonesia, the money aimed to help 'underrepresented' students 'gain access to higher education opportunities in the United States.' Nearly $100K to a Palestinian Activist Group Whose Leaders Hailed PFLP Terrorism In November 2022, USAID sent $78,000 to the Community Development and Continuing Education Institute (CDCEI), a Palestinian activist group based in Judea and Samaria. Its leaders praised a terrorist who murdered a U.S. military attaché as a 'hero fighter,' the Free Beacon reported. CDCEI got the cash to promote 'youth participation and accountability in local governance,' USAID said at the time. Imad Al-Zeer, the chair of CDCEI’s board, attended a Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine event celebrating the 52nd anniversary of the terrorist group's founding. His deputy chair, Mike Salman, praised George Abdallah, a Lebanese terrorist serving a life sentence in France for the 1982 murder of U.S. military attaché Charles R. Ray, as 'the hero fighter George.' $1 Million to a Hamas-Linked Charity Just six days before Hamas's Oct. 7 assault on Israel, USAID doled out more than $900,000 'to a terror charity in Gaza involved with the son of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh,' a watchdog report obtained by the Free Beacon found. USAID earmarked the funds for the Bayader Association for Environment and Development, a Gaza-based humanitarian group that was said to be 'in close cooperation with [the] Hamas regime.' 'Bayader is listed in federal spending data as a sub-grantee for USAID, with the government monies first routed through a sponsoring U.S. nonprofit, which are ostensibly required to vet their sub-grantees,' according to a Middle East Forum report. USAID would not comment at the time on whether the money was subject to oversight or vetted to ensure it did not benefit Hamas. $1.5 Million Effort To 'Empower' Female Climate Activists in Northern Kenya In May 2023, USAID announced plans to spend $1.5 million on a program aimed at 'empowering' female climate activists in northern Kenya. The project, the Free Beacon reported at the time, centered on 'empowering women to adapt to climate change in northern Kenya.' Women in the area, USAID wrote, live in 'traditionally patriarchal communities' and need training to join Kenya’s fight against climate change. The funding notice detailed USAID’s efforts to 'empower women, improve their participation in decision making, and enhance adaptive capabilities to climate change.' The program also operated as part of USAID’s 2022-2030 climate strategy. $15 Million for 'Contraceptives and Condoms’ in Taliban-Controlled Afghanistan In July 2024, Biden's USAID sent $15 million into Taliban-controlled Afghanistan for the distribution of 'oral contraceptives and condoms.' The spending, outlined in a congressional funding notice obtained by the Free Beacon, came roughly three years after the administration's chaotic withdrawal from the country cemented the Taliban's resurgence. The notice acknowledged that 'some coordination' with the terror group would be 'necessary for programmatic purposes.' While U.S. law bars the federal government from funding the Taliban, the notice argued that USAID would work with 'national authorities' in Afghanistan without 'directly benefiting them.' A Well-Established Vetting Problem USAID has long struggled to ensure taxpayer cash goes to its intended use. A 2024 inspector general report, for example, found that the agency had issues combating 'corruption, abuse, and fraud.' 'One of USAID’s foremost challenges is ensuring U.S. taxpayer funds are used effectively, efficiently, and for their intended purposes,' the report said. 'However, corruption, fraud, and sexual exploitation and abuse undermine the effectiveness of aid, erode public trust, and impede sustainable development.' The agency also came under fire last year for failing to 'prevent the diversion of assistance to Hamas and other terrorist organizations,' according to the report. In one case, a Syrian national diverted $9 million in USAID funds to an affiliate of the al Qaeda terror group.

Israeli ex-minister mulls return to government after Trump’s spee...	Former National Security Minister drafts bill to encourage voluntary mass-migration of Gazans from the Gaza Strip, hints at possible return to the Netanyahu government after Trump proposes relocation of Gaza's population. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A former Israeli government minister, who bolted the coalition last month in protest of the ceasefire deal with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, hinted at the possible return of his party to the government, following Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's joint press conference with President Donald Trump on Tuesday. MK Itamar Ben-Gvir, who until recently served as Israel's National Security Minister, said Wednesday that following Trump's comments a day earlier, it appears increasingly likely his Otzma Yehudit party will return to the Netanyahu government. 'I have yet to have a new minister's jacket prepared,' Ben-Gvir told Galey Yisrael Radio Wednesday morning, 'but there is no question that the chances of Otzma Yehudit rejoining the government have increased.' 'The ball is now in the prime minister's court,' Ben-Gvir continued. 'If he implements this, I'll be there with him all the way,' the lawmaker said, referring to Trump's proposal to relocate the entire population of the Gaza Strip. 'As soon as they start and there is a clear indication it will be implemented, I'm back in.' Ben-Gvir directly addressed Trump's plan in a series of tweets Tuesday night, writing in English: 'Donald, this looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship.' On Tuesday, Trump announced that his administration plans to facilitate the mass resettlement of Gaza's entire population in third-party countries, with the U.S. directly handling the post-war administration and rehabilitation of the Gaza Strip. The president added that the resettlement would be permanent. Earlier that day, Ben-Gvir and other members of his Otzma Yehudit faction submitted a bill which would offer financial incentives to Gazans to emigrate abroad. Any Gazan wishing to return after accepting the money offered under Ben-Gvir's plan would be required to pay back the grant in full, adjusted for inflation, or be barred from returning for life.

Israeli rabbinical courts report surge in divorces, but drop in s...	Among the regions showing the sharpest rise in divorce rates were Beit Shemesh and Kiryat Gat, both of which saw increases of 45% while Beitar Illit also experienced a 44% jump. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli rabbinical courts reported a notable 6.5% increase in divorces among Jewish Israelis in 2024, compared to the previous year, according to the Chief Rabbinate’s annual report released on Tuesday. The report also noted a drop in the number of recalcitrant husbands who were sanctioned by the court for refusing to divorce their wives. According to the report, a total of 11,542 divorces were finalized, up from 10,838 in 2023. The surge in divorce rates is attributed to the emotional strain caused by war with Hamas and Hezbollah. This increase marks the highest level of divorces since 2021, when the coronavirus pandemic and related lockdowns also contributed to a spike in marital separations. One key focus of the report was the work of a special rabbinical unit handling cases involving individuals who refuse to grant or accept a religious divorce, known as a get. In Jewish law, both the husband and wife must consent to the divorce, with the husband required to give his wife a get willingly, though significant pressure may be applied to compel him. A woman whose husband refuses to give a writ of divorce and cannot remarry is known as an agunah, or 'chained woman.' The divorce can also be invalid if the wife refuses to accept the get. According to the Rabbinate’s report, this unit secured 221 divorce documents in 2024 for women whose husbands had previously refused to grant them, a figure comparable to the 226 cases in 2023. The unit also imposed sanctions on 135 men who had refused to grant a get, down from 209 the previous year. Sanctions were also imposed on eight women who had refused to accept the divorce documents, up from six in 2023. As of early 2025, there are 67 open cases of ongoing get refusals, with 44 of those involving men and 23 involving women. In instances where a wife refuses to accept a get, there is a legal workaround that allows a man to remarry with the approval of 100 rabbis. According to the Rabbinate’s report, the procedure was used in seven cases during the Jewish year 5784 (2023-2024). Among the regions showing the sharpest rise in divorce rates were Beit Shemesh and Kiryat Gat, both of which saw increases of 45% while Beitar Illit also experienced a 44% jump. On the other hand, Jerusalem experienced a slight decline, with a 4% decrease in divorces. Religious affairs and issues of personal status such as marriage, divorce, and conversion are determined by leaders of Israel’s recognized religious communities — Jewish, Muslim, Druze and 10 Christian denominations. The rabbinate’s report only covered Jewish cases under its purview.

‘People like the idea’: Trump teases support for Israel’s annexat...	People do like the idea, but we haven't taken a position on it yet. But we will be making an announcement probably on that very specific topic over the next four weeks.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Donald Trump hinted Tuesday that his administration will be deliberating in the coming weeks on an Israeli plan to apply sovereignty over large swaths of Judea and Samaria. Speaking at a joint press conference in the White House Tuesday afternoon with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump responded to questions from reporters regarding the premier's long-shelved plan to extend Israeli sovereignty over Israeli towns in Judea and Samaria. Netanyahu first announced the plan ahead of the September 2019 Knesset election, vowing to annex the Jordan Valley area, followed by the remaining Israeli towns in Judea and Samaria. In 2020, however, the proposal was shelved amid resistance from then-Defense Minister Benny Gantz and calls by the Trump administration to delay implementation of the plan in order to facilitate the signing of the Abraham Accords that year. On Tuesday, however, Trump teased a major announcement on the Israeli sovereignty plan, saying that while no decision had yet been made, the White House would be speaking out on it in roughly a month. 'Do you support Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria, areas which many believe is the biblical homeland of the Jewish people?' Israel National News' Yoni Kempinski asked. 'We're discussing that with many of your representatives. You're represented very well,' Trump said. 'People do like the idea, but we haven't taken a position on it yet. But we will be making an announcement probably on that very specific topic over the next four weeks.' Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, who served during the first Trump administration, said that in 2020, Israel agreed to drop its sovereignty plan for four years, until after the 2024 presidential election.

Trump admin to send Israel $1 billion in bombs and bulldozers	This would be in addition to the $8 billion in arms already requested by the former administration. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News President Trump is asking Congress to support the sale of a billion dollars’ worth of bombs and bulldozers to Israel, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. A majority of the deal is for ordinance of the half-ton, MK83 variety, some 4,700 bombs worth over $700 million that the Israeli air force uses constantly against terrorist forces. The one-ton variety, called the MK84, are considered 'bunker-busters.' These, and a much lighter, 500-pound version, are the munitions that the Biden administration paused shipment of when the IDF invaded Rafah last May, to signal its displeasure regarding Jerusalem ignoring its demand not to enter the southern town that was Hamas’ last stronghold at the time. Just a few days after taking office, Trump removed that suspension, saying that the Israelis 'paid for them and they have been waiting for them for a long time.' The other $300 million is for armored, Caterpillar bulldozers, which have been used throughout the war to probe for booby traps before troops move onto Gazan streets, find tunnel openings, and knock down buildings from which terrorists have threatened the soldiers. These items would be in addition to the $8 billion in arms that the Biden administration requested 'informally' for Israel just two weeks before the former president left office. Those munitions include medium-range air-to-air missiles to help Israel defend against UAVs and other airborne threats, 155mm artillery shells, Hellfire AGM-114 missiles for Israel’s helicopter gunships, 500-lb bombs of the kind that had previously been slow-walked, and JDAM kits that turn 'dumb' bombs into 'smart,' guided ones. It was expected that in his meeting with the president Tuesday, Netanyahu would ask that the sale be speeded up if possible. Only some of these arms can be supplied from current American stockpiles. The orders for the majority will take one or more years to fill. All arms sales need prior approval of both the House and Senate foreign relations committees before going to the respective houses for a vote. From the day of the Hamas invasion of Israel that sparked the current war in October 2023 to October 2024, the United States has provided $17.9 billion in military aid to Israel, with most if not all spent by Israel on purchasing American-made hardware. This is a record for a single 12-month period, as estimated by the Costs of War Project at Brown University.

Under Trump plan, US will ‘own’ Gaza – but who will live there?	President Trump presents ambitious plan to relocate Gaza Strip's entire population, but says he doesn't 'necessarily' back Israeli resettlement of Gaza, says it will be turned into 'Riviera of the Middle East' and a home for the 'world's people.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Donald Trump on Tuesday unveiled his plan for the post-war administration of the Gaza Strip, calling for the mass migration of the coastal enclave's entire population, with the United States assuming control of the area for the foreseeable future. During a joint press conference in the White House Tuesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump called for 'permanently' resettling the Gaza Strip's entire population in third-party countries. The area, Trump continued, would not be administered either by Hamas, the Palestinian Authority, or a non-partisan committee of Gazans, as proposed by Hamas and the PA. Instead, Gaza would be placed under the direct control of the United States for the foreseeable future. 'The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too,' Trump said, emphasizing the need for a lengthy rehabilitation period. 'We’ll own it, and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons of the site, level the site, and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out, create an economic development that will supply an unlimited number of jobs and housing for the people of the area.' 'We’ll do a real job, do something different. You can’t go back. If you go back, it’ll end up the way it’s been for a hundred years.' 'I think we will be a great keeper of something that is very, very strong, very powerful, and very, very good for the area, not just for Israel, for the entire Middle East,' Trump continued. 'There will be jobs for everyone.' 'Everyone I have spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent.' However, Trump provided few details on the future of the Gaza Strip following its reconstruction as the 'Riviera of the Middle East,' saying he would 'not necessarily' back the resettlement of the area by Israeli Jews. The president only offered vague ideas regarding its future inhabitants, while declining to say whether American control of the Strip would be permanent. 'I think the potential in the Gaza Strip is unbelievable and I think representatives from all over the world will be there,' Trump said, adding that the 'world's people' would live in Gaza following its reconstruction. While Trump did not rule out allowing some Gazans to return to the Strip one day, he emphasized that most should be resettled permanently elsewhere. 'I think they’ll be resettled in areas where they can live a beautiful life and not be worried about dying every day.'

Trump: If Iran tries to assassinate me, they’ll get ‘obliterated’	There won't be anything left' - President Donald Trump threatens Iran with obliteration if Tehran attempts to assassinate him, as he signs executive order imposing tougher sanctions. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump threatened Tuesday to 'obliterate' Iran if the Islamic republic attempts to assassinate him. The president issued the warning in the Oval Office while signing an executive order imposing tougher sanctions on Tehran, as part of a bid by the Trump administration to impose 'maximum pressure' on Iran and to close loopholes used by third-party states to purchase Iranian oil despite existing sanctions. 'I'm signing this, and it's a very powerful document, but hopefully we're not going to have to use it,' Trump said of the new executive order. Speaking with reporters while signing the sanctions order, Trump said that he has instructed his administration to devastate Iran in the event that he is assassinated by agents working on Tehran's behalf. 'That would be a terrible thing for them to do,' Trump said. 'If they did that they would be obliterated, that would be the end.' 'I’ve left instructions if they do it, they get obliterated, there won’t be anything left.' Last year, Iran plotted to assassinate then-candidate Donald Trump ahead of the 2024 presidential election. An Iranian immigrant to the U.S., 51-year-old old Farhad Shakeri, is facing espionage charges in absentia for his role in the assassination plot, the Department of Justice revealed last November. According to the Department of Justice, Iran sought to have its operatives kill Trump last October. Trump chided his predecessor, President Joe Biden, for not taking tougher action against Iran in response to the 2024 assassination plot. Biden, should have said that,' Trump said, criticizing the former president for failing to threaten Tehran, saying he failed to due to a 'lack of intelligence.'

‘Racist, recipe for chaos’ – Hamas slams Trump’s Gaza plan	Hamas condemns American proposal for Gaza, but quietly signals it wants negotiations with the Trump administration. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror group expressed its opposition to President Donald Trump's proposal for the U.S. to assume authority over the Gaza Strip and resettling Gazan civilians elsewhere, in a number of media statements on Wednesday. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri slammed the proposal for Gazans to temporarily leave the Strip as 'expulsion from their land.' Hamas considers Trump's ideas to be 'a recipe for generating chaos and tension in the region because the people of Gaza will not allow such plans to pass,' he added. Rather than an outline to rehabilitate and reconstruct the Strip, Abu Zuhri said 'what is needed is an end to the occupation and aggression against the Palestinians, not their expulsion from their land.' Another Hamas official, Izzat al-Risheq, wrote on his Telegram account that the terror group 'oppose[s] the statements of U.S. President Donald Trump, in which he called on the Palestinian people in Gaza to leave their homeland under the pretext of rehabilitating the Strip.' 'Trump’s statements are racist and represent a clear attempt to eliminate the Palestinian issue while disregarding our steadfast national rights. Our people in Gaza have thwarted migration and expulsion plans even under attacks for 15 months. The Palestinian people are rooted in their land and will not accept any plan aimed at uprooting them,' al-Risheq added. However, Hamas wants to engage in negotiations with the American president, according to a report from Russia's RIA state news agency on Wednesday morning. 'We are ready for contact and talks with the Trump administration,' RIA quoted Hamas politburo member Mousa Abu Marzouk as saying. Hamas' response came after Trump announced that the U.S. was ready to play a central role in the future of Gaza, including helping resettle the civilian population in nearby wealthy Arab countries durin the reconstruction process. The U.S. would 'own' Gaza and be responsible for its demilitarization, as well as creating new housing and jobs. 'This is not a decision made lightly,' Trump said, adding that 'everybody I’ve spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land.' American responsibility for Gaza would bring 'great stability to that part of the Middle East,' he added.

‘Thank you, heroes’ – Remembering 2 slain IDF soldiers	Loved ones pay tribute to Tel Aviv attorney, kibbutznik father-of-six, who were killed by terrorist infiltration in Samaria army outpost. By World Israel News Staff The loved ones of two Israeli reservists slain in a terror attack on Tuesday are speaking to Hebrew-language media about their loss. Maj. Ofer Yung, 39, and Maj, Avraham Tzvi (Tzvika) Friedman, 43, were killed by gunfire during an attack at the Tayasir checkpoint in northern Samaria, which wounded six other soldiers. The terrorist managed to infiltrate a military compound near the checkpoint, eventually making his way up to the observation terror. Eventually, the assailant was killed by a grenade. Yung, a father-of-two from Tel Aviv, worked as a lawyer. He is survived by his wife, Dana Meir Yung, who is also an attorney, and their two children, Eitan and Ori. 'He was a wonderful father and uncle, intelligent, a hero. We will miss him the most in the world,' Yung's sister, Hadas, told Hebrew-language news outlet . A eulogy posted by the Tel Aviv municipality described Yung as 'a man of action, on the battlefield and in civilian life.' The city said that it 'shares in the grief of his family, friends and colleagues. May his memory be blessed.' Friedman, who lived in Kibbutz Ein HaNatziv, is survived by his wife Gal and six children, ranging in age from 16 to 3 years old. A longtime employee of the Israel Electric Company, Friedman was known within his community for his selfless and giving nature. 'We lost a dear man and I lost a close friend,' Uri Glasner told Ynet. Friedman 'lived on the kibbutz for almost 20 years and was a central part of our community. He&#8230;raised a wonderful, close-knit, and loving family. He volunteered wherever possible and continued serving in the reserves even though he was exempt due to his age, and volunteered for many causes in our area.' Yung and Friedman bring the Israeli army death toll since October 7th, 2023, to 844.

‘Morally deviant’ – Hamas executed its own gay operatives	Internal notes from within terror organization promote recommended stoning a homosexual commander to death. By World Israel News Staff Hamas regularly tortured and executed its own members if they were suspected of engaging in 'deviant' activity, meaning being homosexual, according to internal documents obtained by the New York Post. The documents, which were obtained in an Israeli military raid and passed onto the Post, included notes about the behavior of individual operatives that raised the concern of the terror group's senior leadership. Notes on unacceptable acts warranting severe punishment, including death, described one man as being 'behaviorally and morally deviant,' which is Hamas' terminology for being gay, the Post reported. The decision to execute former Hamas commander Mahmoud Ishtiwi, who was killed by the terror group after being accused of homosexual activity, was included in the documents. 'Committing the crime of sodomy in a hideous manner while he is married to two women,' Islamic religious leaders within Hamas wrote of Ishtiwi. 'This is more heinous than adultery and it has been described as an obscenity in the Qur’an more than once. Sodomy receives its punishment at the very least, which is stoning to death.' After a forced confession, Ishtiwi was tortured in Hamas prisons for a year, then shot to death. While Hamas has downplayed homosexuality within its ranks, an Israeli male survivor of the Nova Festival massacre told Hebrew-language media that he was sexually assaulted by a terrorist during the onslaught. One Israel Fund Director of Education Eve Harow said that the brutality described within Hamas itself is a clear reflection of the terror organization's violent ideology, which also sees the group torture Gazan civilians opposed to their regime. 'Even within their own society, those who do not conform to Hamas’ extremist ideology — whether women, journalists, activists or minority groups — face persecution, imprisonment or even execution,' she told the Post. 'Their leadership thrives on destruction, sacrificing their own people while blaming the world for the consequences of their own brutality.'

Trump warmly welcomes Netanyahu, calls for resettling Gazans ‘per...	The president did not say whether he thought Palestinians would have a 'right' to return to Gaza. By World Israel News and JNS US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a press conference after their meeting at the White House. President Trump began by expressing his pleasure at Netanyahu’s return to the White House. 'We had fantastic talks. He’s the first foreign head of state to visit during our administration. Bibi, it’s an honor to have you with us,' he said, directly addressing Netanyahu. Trump called for 'permanently' resettling Palestinians outside Gaza on Tuesday, as he and Netanyahu took questions from reporters at the White House. The president did not say whether he thought Palestinians would have a 'right' to return to Gaza but asked why they would want to return given the level of destruction. 'I don’t think people should be going back to Gaza,' Trump said. 'I think that Gaza has been very unlucky for them. They’ve lived like hell. They live like you’re living in hell.' 'Gaza is not a place for people to be living, and the only reason they want to go back, and I believe this strongly, is because they have no alternative,' Trump said. 'What’s the alternative? Go where? There’s no other alternative. If they had an alternative, they’d much rather not go back to Gaza and live in a beautiful alternative that’s safe.' Trump's comments on Gaza are the clearest indication so far of Trump’s views on whether Palestinians should be allowed to resettle outside of Gaza in Egypt, Jordan or another country. He has previously said the option could be temporary or permanent and that he would like to 'just clean out that whole thing.' Trump and Netanyahu took 15 minutes of freewheeling questions from reporters, ranging from the prospects for a future Palestinian state, a potential agreement to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia and whether the United States or Israel intend to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities. 'What do you know about anything?' Trump replied to a reporter’s claim that Netanyahu wants the United States to attack Iran. 'You don’t know what he wants,' Trump said. Asked if the Saudis were demanding the creation of a Palestinian state as a prerequisite to normalization with Israel, Trump replied, 'No.' 'Everybody’s demanding one thing, you know what it is? Peace,' Trump said. 'We want people to stop being killed.' With Israel and Hamas heading toward negotiations for phase two of the ceasefire-for-hostage deal, Netanyahu said he was committed to achieving all of Israel’s aims in Gaza. 'I support getting all the hostages out and meeting all our war goals, that includes destroying Hamas’s military and governing capabilities and making sure that Gaza never poses a threat to Israel again,' Netanyahu said. 'All three.'

Female IDF hostages were used as human shields by Hamas military ...	Liri Albag, Daniela Gilboa, Karina Ariev, Naama Levy, and Agam Berger were confined in an apartment where the high-ranking Hamas leader was staying. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Five female IDF observers recently freed from captivity in Gaza were used as human shields to protect a senior Hamas military leader. Liri Albag, Daniela Gilboa, Karina Ariev, Naama Levy, and Agam Berger were confined in an apartment where the high-ranking Hamas leader was staying. When the women noticed their captor giving orders to subordinates, they realized he held significant influence within the terror group. They reported that their captor provided them with food and allowed them to shower, but this apparent kindness was ultimately a 'good cop, bad cop' ploy, as other terrorists treated them as 'soldiers' rather than civilians. The Hamas military leader also provided them with food in an attempt to coerce information about IDF operations on the Gaza border before October 7. The five female observers are set to be discharged from the hospital on Wednesday, though their full rehabilitation will take time. DNA evidence confirmed that six hostages executed by Hamas in October had also been used as human shields. Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Alex Lobanov, Carmel Gat, and Almog Sarusi were the six hostages murdered by Hamas to prevent an IDF rescue. Hamas leader and October 7 mastermind Yahya Sinwar was killed by chance during an IDF operation in Rafah, near the site where the six hostages had been executed. When the IDF recovered the hostages' bodies on August 31, they also found DNA evidence indicating that Sinwar had been in the area at some point between August 21 and August 27. Early war reports suggested that Sinwar was hiding in Gaza tunnels and using hostages as human shields. The DNA evidence, location, and intelligence reports link him to the six murdered hostages. The IDF had opportunities to target Sinwar earlier in the war, but his use of hostages as human shields hindered these operations.

LA talent agency adds former President Biden to star-studded rost...	Though CAA is usually tied with big movie stars and A-list celebrities, the Los Angeles talent agency is no stranger to political heavyweights. By Jewish Breaking News Former US President Joe Biden has signed a mega-deal with the Creative Artists Agency (CAA). It’s actually a homecoming of sorts for Biden, as he was previously on CAA’s star-studded roster from 2017 to 2020 following his eight-year term as the 47th Vice President of the United States. His previous collaboration with CAA proved transformative, yielding his deeply personal memoir 'Promise Me, Dad,' which topped the New York Times bestseller in 2017. The memoir’s success and subsequent book tour at the time helped reintroduce Biden to the American public as more than just Obama’s lackey. It is credited for paving the way for his successful presidential run against Trump the first time around. 'President Biden is one of America’s most respected and influential voices in national and global affairs,' said CAA co-chairman Richard Lovett. 'His lifelong commitment to public service is one of unity, optimism, dignity, and possibility. We are profoundly honored to partner with him again.' Though CAA is usually tied with big movie stars and A-list celebrities, the Los Angeles talent agency is no stranger to political heavyweights. They’ve worked with Barack and Michelle Obama, whose production company Higher Ground has the Oscar-winning 'American Factory.' Hillary Clinton also entrusted CAA with her literary ventures, including her diplomatic memoir 'Hard Choices.' While Biden has been keeping a low profile since leaving office, he has been spotted occasionally around his Delaware home and celebrating the joy of recently becoming a great-grandfather, according to the BBC. Before leaving office, he reassured supporters saying, 'We’re leaving office, we’re not leaving the fight.' For now, his future projects remain under wraps. If history is any guide, we might not see the end of Biden in political discourse anytime soon.

Trump to restore ‘maximum pressure’ campaign on Iran, which raked...	Iranian state-controlled media described the White House’s fresh push as 'futile,' saying on Tuesday that 'sanctions cannot bring the country to its knees, nor will they be able to do [sic] in the future.' By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon President Donald Trump is set to restore his 'maximum pressure' sanctions campaign on Iran in a bid to eliminate the country’s illicit oil exports. An impending executive order, which Trump is expected to sign on Tuesday, will reverse the Biden administration’s perennial lax sanctions enforcement that brought Tehran more than $140 billion in profits. The order will kickstart an administration-wide effort to reinstall 'maximum economic pressure on Iran,' according to Reuters, which described the effort as 'aimed at driving Iran's oil exports to zero.' The Treasury Department will be responsible for enforcing sanctions on Tehran’s fleet of oil tankers, while the State Department will nix a series of sanctions waivers that made it easier for Iran to access cash. The effort fulfills a Trump campaign promise to target Iran’s financial networks and continues a policy he pursued during his first stint in the White House when he abandoned the 2015 nuclear accord and slapped a bevy of sanctions on Tehran’s regional terror proxies. Iranian state-controlled media described the White House’s fresh push as 'futile,' saying on Tuesday that 'sanctions cannot bring the country to its knees, nor will they be able to do [sic] in the future.' Under the Biden administration, however, Iran raked in more than $140 billion from its illicit oil sales, primarily to China, according to figures compiled by the advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran. 'China has proven the savior of Tehran by continuing to import millions of barrels of oil every single day, and imports have likely even exceeded those made when the trade was not subject to U.S. sanctions,' the organization reported in late December, just before Trump took office. The Biden administration's reluctance to enforce sanctions already on the books drove those oil sales. 'Iran's unprecedented oil sales have occurred because, for nearly four years, the Biden-Harris administration stopped enforcing U.S. sanctions,' Andrea Stricker, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank, told the Washington Free Beacon in July. 'Tehran and its proxies have used this revenue to attack Israel, U.S. troops, and global shipping.' The Biden administration also greenlit a sanctions waiver that empowered Iraq to provide Tehran’s regime with access to more than $10 billion in electricity payments. This cash, critics argued, helped free up revenue streams for Iran’s regional terror proxies as they waged war on Israel. The Free Beacon reported in January that Iraq is also playing a central role in a billion-dollar oil-for-cash scheme run by Iranian militias in the country. An intelligence dossier presented to senior Biden administration officials identified Iraq’s government as central to an Iranian 'oil and fuel smuggling' operation that significantly expanded in 2022. It is likely that the Trump administration will seek to disrupt this type of fuel smuggling in combination with tough new sanctions on Tehran’s energy sector.

Netanyahu set to meet Trump at White House	The talks will likely focus on starting the negotiations for stage two of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement, in which Israel is to withdraw entirely from Gaza in exchange for the release of the remaining living hostages and a permanent cessation of hostilities. By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was set on Tuesday to become the first foreign leader to meet U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House since the latter’s second term began on Jan. 20. The private meeting in the Oval Office is scheduled for 4 p.m. local time and is expected to last approximately 15 minutes, and is to be followed by a bilateral meeting that will include Netanyahu and Trump’s respective teams. According to an itinerary shared with the media, the two leaders will host a joint press conference at 5:10 p.m., followed by a dinner in the State Dining Room of the White House around half an hour later. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters ahead of the meeting on Tuesday that Trump’s invite to Netanyahu means that the U.S. president 'will continue to stand strongly with Israel and that he is wholeheartedly committed to ensuring all of the hostages return home.' The talks will likely focus on starting the negotiations for stage two of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement, in which Israel is to withdraw entirely from Gaza in exchange for the release of the remaining living hostages and a permanent cessation of hostilities.

United Airlines to restart service to Israel in March	Before the war broke out, United offered the largest number of flights to Israel of any U.S. carrier, with 14 weekly flights from the New York area alone as well as service from Chicago, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. By JNS United Airlines announced on Tuesday that it will resume flights to Israel next month, becoming the first U.S. carrier to renew service to Tel Aviv repeatedly halted due to the Israel-Hamas war. The Chicago-based carrier will restart flights to Israel from Newark’s Liberty International Airport on March 15, with daily service beginning two weeks later on March 29. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, welcomed United’s decision to resume non-stop service to Tel Aviv following service disruptions after the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas. 'Last week, I spoke with airline leadership following my meeting with Israeli President Isaac Herzog about the negative impact caused by the lack of flights. Israel remains a critical ally and economic partner to our state,' Murphy stated. 'This important move eases travel difficulties for businesses, the Jewish community and many others in New Jersey and will allow families to travel to see loved ones or host them in time for the Passover holiday.' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) commended United for 'its commitment to serving Tel Aviv and being the first major U.S. airline to resume flights to Tel Aviv this year, which will be followed by Delta resuming flights on April 1.' 'I urge American Airlines and other airlines to restore service to Tel Aviv as expeditiously as possible,' Schumer stated. 'These flights restoring travel options between New York, the United States and Israel are vital for Israel’s economy, for Americans who are eager to start traveling to Israel again, and for the U.S.-Israel relationship.' Before the war broke out, United offered the largest number of flights to Israel of any U.S. carrier, with 14 weekly flights from the New York area alone as well as service from Chicago, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. 'United has a longstanding commitment to serving Tel Aviv, and this return will make United the first U.S. airline to resume service this year,' the airline stated. United noted that it would resume additional flights to Israel based on demand. Delta had previously announced that it would renew service to Israel in April. American Airlines is still not flying to Israel and has not announced when it plans to restart service. The moves by United and Delta will effectively end the monopoly Israel’s flagship carrier El Al had on the lucrative transatlantic route through most of the 15-month-long war, which sent fares skyrocketing amid charges of price gouging.

Which countries are taking in released Palestinian terrorists?	Turkey, Qatar, Pakistan, and Malaysia have stated they would accept Palestinians released from Israeli prisons, and discussions are ongoing to secure approval from Algeria and Indonesia. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News So far, 99 of the hundreds of Palestinian prisoners released in exchange for hostages have been sent to Egypt, according to Quds Press. During later phases of the deal, it is estimated that 263 released Palestinians will go to Egypt. Egypt has indicated that it will only allow freed Palestinians within its borders if they are Fatah members. Turkey, Qatar, Pakistan, and Malaysia have stated they would accept Palestinians released from Israeli prisons, and discussions are ongoing to secure approval from Algeria and Indonesia. Tunisia has refused to accept freed Palestinians. On Tuesday, 15 terrorists were expected to arrive in Turkey from Cairo. Qatar has allocated $1 million to house released Palestinian terrorists in a hotel. A source told Ynet that the men were confined to their hotel, with the terrorists lamenting that they had merely been moved 'from an Israeli prison to an Egyptian prison.' According to the PA source, the Egyptians are not treating the men warmly, as they were denied basic necessities—including replacements for their prison uniforms and sandals—for an extended period. Egypt has refused to accept Gazan refugees. In a recent media statement, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi suggested that Gazans were so radicalized that their presence in Egypt would pose a threat to the country. Sisi rejected the idea of transferring Gazans to Egypt, a proposal put forward by President Donald Trump, stating that it 'can never be tolerated or allowed because of its impact on Egyptian national security.' Turkey, which has openly praised the Hamas terror group and repeatedly accused Israel of genocide, was reluctant to disclose how many former prisoners it would be willing to host. 'We have agreed to accommodate a certain number of expelled Palestinian prisoners,' Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said in a brief media statement, without providing further details. Qatar, which has long offered sanctuary to Hamas' leadership, was similarly evasive about the number of freed terrorists it intended to accept.

Netanyahu to make major concession secure peace deal with Saudi A...	Riyadh has insisted that Israel take steps towards establishing a Palestinian state as a condition for normalization. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli coalition officials told the Jerusalem Post on Tuesday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will concede on annexation of Judea and Samaria in a push towards a normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia. The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said they believed Netanyahu was likely to use a delay in annexation as a compromise to dissuade Saudi Arabia from demanding the establishment of a Palestinian state as a precondition for normalization. In late January, Prince Khalid bin Bandar, Riyadh’s ambassador to the United Kingdom, reiterated in a radio interview the Saudi government's insistence that Israel agree to a Palestinian state as a step toward normalization. 'We cannot have normalization with Israel without a solution for the Palestinians. And the solution for the Palestinians is a state; it is very clear,' the ambassador said when asked what it would take for Riyadh to join the Abraham Accords. Netanyahu, who met with U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday, has expressed his goal of expanding the Abraham Accords to include normalization with Saudi Arabia. However, two diplomatic sources reported that Saudi Arabia demands an end to the war in Gaza and a pathway toward a Palestinian state. Many members of Netanyahu's coalition welcomed the return of Donald Trump to the White House, hoping that the president would give a green light to annexing territories in Judea and Samaria or declaring Israeli sovereignty in the region. In 2020, Netanyahu tried to convince Trump to allow Israel to declare sovereignty over 30% of Judea and Samaria, a plan that failed due to opposition from members of Netanyahu's government and then-Defense Minister Benny Gantz. In private conversations, Trump has reportedly said annexation is not currently on the agenda.

Netanyahu to concede on annexation of Judea and Samaria to secure...	Riyadh has insisted that Israel take steps towards establishing a Palestinian state as a condition for normalization. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli coalition officials told the Jerusalem Post on Tuesday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will concede on annexation of Judea and Samaria in a push towards a normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia. The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said they believed Netanyahu was likely to use a delay in annexation as a compromise to dissuade Saudi Arabia from demanding the establishment of a Palestinian state as a precondition for normalization. In late January, Prince Khalid bin Bandar, Riyadh’s ambassador to the United Kingdom, reiterated in a radio interview the Saudi government's insistence that Israel agree to a Palestinian state as a step toward normalization. 'We cannot have normalization with Israel without a solution for the Palestinians. And the solution for the Palestinians is a state; it is very clear,' the ambassador said when asked what it would take for Riyadh to join the Abraham Accords. Netanyahu, who met with U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday, has expressed his goal of expanding the Abraham Accords to include normalization with Saudi Arabia. However, two diplomatic sources reported that Saudi Arabia demands an end to the war in Gaza and a pathway toward a Palestinian state. Many members of Netanyahu's coalition welcomed the return of Donald Trump to the White House, hoping that the president would give a green light to annexing territories in Judea and Samaria or declaring Israeli sovereignty in the region. In 2020, Netanyahu tried to convince Trump to allow Israel to declare sovereignty over 30% of Judea and Samaria, a plan that failed due to opposition from members of Netanyahu's government and then-Defense Minister Benny Gantz. In private conversations, Trump has reportedly said annexation is not currently on the agenda. However, some members of Netanyahu's government were hoping that during his visit to Washington, Netanyahu could persuade Trump to agree to the proposal. These officials fear that annexation may once again be ruled out.

Iran mulling shortcuts to build nuclear bomb – report	US officials say intel indicates Tehran considering options for shortcuts to give it the option for a quick nuclear breakout capacity, amid fears Israel may decide to carry out strikes on Iran's nuclear program. By World Israel News Staff Iranian nuclear officials are examining the possibility of establishing a rapid nuclear breakout capability, American officials say, a move which could potentially dramatically reduce the time it would take Iran to produce an atomic weapon. The New York Times published a report Monday citing current and former American officials who said that new intelligence regarding Iran's nuclear program indicates Tehran is secretly exploring the possibility of taking shortcuts in its development of nuclear weapons. Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian heralded as a moderate compared to his predecessor, Ebrahim Raisi, has signalled his willingness to negotiate with the Trump administration for a new nuclear deal, replacing the 2015 agreement Trump bolted during his first term in office. At the same time, amid fears Israel could strike Iran's nuclear facility in the near future, the country's top nuclear officials are said to have assembled a team of atomic scientists to gauge whether it is feasible to attempt a rapidly accelerated nuclear breakout towards an atomic weapon. According to the report, Tehran hopes to cut the time needed to build a nuclear weapon down from a year or more to a matter of months. But Iran has not yet committed to such a crash program, American officials cited by the report said, emphasizing that Iran is still limiting efforts in this regard to proof of concept. In January, Rafael Grossi, director of the United Nations' atomic watchdog group, warned that Iran is 'pressing the gas pedal' on its nuclear enrichment efforts, after Iran informed the International Atomic Energy Agency that it was accelerating efforts to achieve 60% uranium enrichment, pushing its stores closer to the 90% weapons-grade level.

In a first, Pakistani Muslim cleric leads solidarity trip to Isra...	‘Pakistan and Israel are on the same side in the fight against extremism,’ says Sufi Muslim leader from Pakistan during visit to towns in southern Israel devastated during October 7th invasion. By World Israel News Staff In a historic first, Peer Syed Mudassir Shah, Chairman of the Sufi Council, Founder and President of the SACH Institute, and a prominent spiritual leader in Pakistan who heads a community of 300,000 followers, visited Israel recently to foster interfaith understanding and counter extremism. His visit marks the first time a prominent Pakistani Muslim religious leader has publicly engaged with Israel, underscoring the shared struggle against radicalization and terrorism. During the visit, which was organized by the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs (JCFA) and in conjunction with Ohr Torah Stone’s Ohr Torah Interfaith Center (OTIC), Peer Mudassir participated in a roundtable with leaders from the aforementioned groups to explore avenues for cooperation between Pakistan, where the majority of the population is Sufi Muslim, the Sufi world and Israel. The discussions focused on countering radicalism, strengthening academic and cultural ties, and promoting interfaith collaboration. 'Pakistan and Israel are on the same side in the fight against extremism,' said Peer Mudassir. 'This is not about doing favors—it is about standing together against forces that threaten peace, stability, and our shared values.' Peer Mudassir also visited Gaza border towns, witnessing firsthand the devastation caused by Hamas’s October 7th attack. Led by Rabbi Aharon Ariel Lavi, a resident of the area and OTIC's Managing Director, Peer Mudassir toured Kfar Aza with October 7th survivor Batia Holin, witnessing firsthand the devastation wrought by the Hamas invasion. Mudassir also met with residents, visited the scene of the Nova music festival massacre, and reflected on the need for a global commitment to eradicating terrorism. Deeply moved, he wrote in a guestbook of a damaged home as he reflected on the tragic loss of life. He also visited Rahat, where he engaged in a discussion with the family of murdered hostages Youssef and Hamza Al Ziyadne on the role of religion in combating extremism. 'As a center dedicated to interfaith diplomacy, we regularly engage with and meet Muslim leaders,' said Rabbi Lavi. 'This visit is particularly significant as the first public visit by a prominent Pakistani religious leader, but also because of his unique character and broad influence. We look forward to formalizing our collaboration with a Memorandum of Understanding and strengthening this relationship.' The visit was not merely symbolic, it carried a strategic vision. With a large portion of Pakistan’s population identifying as Sufi, Peer Mudassir has long advocated against the influence of extremist Salafi ideology. He envisions the establishment of a synagogue in Islamabad as a bold step toward religious coexistence. Aviram Bellaishe, JCFA vice president, who initiated the historic visit, concluded that the visit 'marks a pivotal moment in Jewish-Muslim relations.' 'Peer Mudassir’s courage in publicly engaging with Israel sends a powerful message against extremism and in favor of cooperation.' 'This visit is more than a historic milestone—it is a glimpse into what the future of Israel-Pakistan relations could be. Despite decades of political distance, the shared struggle against extremism and a common spiritual heritage create a foundation for meaningful engagement. If leaders like Peer Mudassir continue to step forward, the door to dialogue and cooperation may finally open.'

Biden admin quietly funneled $3 mil to Palestinian government ‘se...	Nearly 400 Palestinians imprisoned for terrorism are known PASF members. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon The Biden administration, weeks before leaving power, funneled more than $3 million in taxpayer cash to the Palestinian Authority Security Forces (PASF), according to a nonpublic notice transmitted to Congress that was reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon. Those funds allowed the PASF to conduct 'firearms and ammunition' training—and came after its members carried out scores of attacks against Israelis. The Jan. 3 funding notice outlined more than $20 million in funding for regional security projects, including those in Judea and Samaria, the Gaza Strip, Lebanon, and Jordan. Just over $3 million of these funds were earmarked for the PASF, which the United States is training to handle security operations in the war-torn Gaza Strip. As it does so, the PASF is reportedly seeking more than $680 million from the American government over the next four years. That spending—both past and, potentially, future—is drawing concerns in both Israel and Washington, D.C., given PASF's deep and longstanding ties to terrorism carried out against Israelis. PASF members conducted more than 1,500 terror attacks against Israel in 2023—attacks that came with the Palestinian government’s backing, according to a Palestinian Media Watch investigation shared with the Free Beacon. More than 60 percent 'of the number of Martyrs in the West Bank' are affiliated with the Palestinian Fatah movement, which sponsors the PASF, 'and most of them are members of the [PA] Security Forces or their sons,' the investigation found. Nearly 400 Palestinians imprisoned for terrorism are known PASF members. Earlier this month, for example, the PASF announced that one of its officers, Hassan Raba'iah, was killed during a standoff with Israeli forces in Jenin, a northern Samaria city. 'Shortly thereafter, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, a designated terrorist organization, announced that Hassan Raba'iah was one of its commanders,' PMW determined in an investigation. Both the PASF and Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades celebrated Raba’iah’s death in Telegram channels, that investigation found. 'With all signs of respect and pride, the Security Forces mourn their heroic Martyr son, First Lieutenant Hassan Ali Hassan Raba'iah, who was a member of the Palestinian Preventive Security Service, who fell as a Martyr … from the occupation [Israeli] army's gunfire while fulfilling his national duty,' the PASF said. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades shared a similar statement: 'With all badges of honor and resilience, full of pride and glory, the [Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades'] Rapid Response Units … mourn the Martyr, commander Hassan Ali Hassan Raba'iah &#8230; who ascended to Heaven in armed conflict with a special Israeli force.' For Rep. Michael McCaul (R., Texas), the former chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the new information casts doubt on the PASF’s ability to handle future security operations in Gaza and prevent Hamas from rebuilding its terrorism empire. 'The PASF have demonstrated an ongoing inability to maintain order in the West Bank, a fact made more concerning by emerging reports of the group’s ties to terrorism in the region,' McCaul told the Free Beacon. 'As everyone knows, money is fungible.' Congress and the Trump administration, McCaul added, 'must conduct rigorous oversight of this type of funding, which the Biden administration quietly noticed at the 11th hour. We must ensure taxpayer dollars are not empowering terrorists to fight our allies and undermine the very principles they’re meant to protect.' The Trump State Department said that its ongoing freeze on all foreign assistance will help ensure that taxpayer funds are not spent on frivolous projects. 'The Department and USAID take their role as stewards of taxpayer dollars very seriously,' a State Department spokesman said. The 90-day freeze on foreign aid 'furthers that mission,' according to the spokesman. The congressional funding notice reviewed by the Free Beacon explains how U.S. taxpayer cash has empowered the PASF in part by providing 'equipment and training' in Judea and Samaria. The funds, the notice says, will help 'develop the capacity of, and potentially equip, West Bank PASF units for deployment.' A portion of the $3 million given to the PASF was earmarked for a Gazan division of the forces, 'thus ensuring we could more quickly move toward larger-scale training and equipping Gazan PASF if conditions and authorities allow,' according to the notice. The security forces are slated to be trained at Jordan’s International Police Training Center, where instruction includes 'the use of ammunition and firearms.' 'Firearms and ammunition procured with funds notified in this [congressional notice] will only be used for training purposes,' the State Department informed Congress. During his first term, President Donald Trump froze hundreds of millions in U.S. funds for the Palestinian Authority due to its support for terrorists. The Biden administration unfroze those funds, reinstating $45 million a year in funding to the PA security services. It did so, the Free Beacon reported, as internal assessments showed that the funding could boost the Iran-backed terror group Hamas.

Trump to watch 47-minute film on horrors of Oct 7 attack followin...	The film documents the full extent of the Hamas-led massacre, showing atrocities committed against Israeli civilians and foreign workers in real time. By Jewish Breaking News President Donald Trump is set to watch the '47-minute horror film' documenting the October 7 Hamas atrocities in Israel within the next 24 hours. This follows a strong recommendation from special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, who viewed the footage during a recent visit to Israel and urged Trump to see it firsthand. Witkoff was reportedly deeply shaken by what he saw and stressed the importance of understanding the full scope of the tragedy. Among the most harrowing footage is CCTV video of firefighter Gil Taasa’s final act of heroism, as he jumped on a grenade to shield his children. The aftermath captures his injured sons, one suffering a severe eye injury, while the other repeatedly shouts, 'Why am I still alive?' At the same time, the perpetrator of the attack is seen casually rummaging through the family’s refrigerator—right in front of the devastated survivors. What is the 47-minute October 7 video? The 47-minute video, titled 'Bearing Witness to the October 7th Massacre,' is a compilation of raw footage assembled by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Spokesperson’s Unit. It includes graphic and disturbing scenes captured from multiple sources such as body cameras worn by Hamas terrorists, security cameras from homes and public areas, and personal mobile phone recordings from victims and perpetrators The film documents the full extent of the Hamas-led massacre, showing atrocities committed against Israeli civilians and foreign workers in real time. The content is highly graphic, depicting acts of extreme violence, including murder, mutilation, and kidnappings. Why is the video not publicly available? Due to the extreme nature of the footage, the IDF has not released the video for public viewing. There are several key reasons for this decision. Seeing the content is so distressing that unrestricted public access could cause significant emotional and mental harm. The footage shows innocent civilians in their final moments, making it ethically sensitive. Some of the video material contains intelligence-sensitive data that cannot be widely disseminated. Instead of a public release, the IDF has organized exclusive screenings for select individuals, including Israeli and international lawmakers, journalists and media representatives, high-ranking military and intelligence officials, and foreign diplomats and policymakers These screenings aim to ensure that key decision-makers fully understand the severity of the attack and its consequences. How and where has the video been shown? Since October, the IDF has screened the video in controlled environments for audiences around the world, including the Israeli Knesset members, foreign government officials visiting Israel, and select media personnel at the Israeli embassies One such screening took place at Israel’s embassy in Nepal, where international diplomats and journalists were invited to witness the footage firsthand. The screenings serve as a strategic tool to counter misinformation and provide undeniable evidence of the attack’s brutality. Why Trump watching this matters As a high-profile global leader, Trump viewing the video signals a significant moment in international awareness of the October 7 attacks. His reaction and potential statements afterward could influence public perception and diplomatic discourse on the conflict. With Steve Witkoff describing the footage as deeply disturbing, Trump’s decision to watch the film underscores the need for leaders and policymakers to confront the harsh realities of modern terrorism.

Lawsuit against US charity that employed Hamas captor dismissed	Judge claims that rescued hostage Almog Meir Jan failed to prove that the People Media Project knew its journalist was a member of Hamas. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The judge in a lawsuit brought by a former Hamas hostage dismissed the case against the American charity that employed his captor, saying he hadn’t proven that it knew its journalist was a member of the terror organization. Almog Meir Jan had filed the lawsuit in Washington state against the People Media Project, its chief editor and others, a month after he was rescued by the IDF along with two other hostages from the home of Abdallah Aljamal. Aljamal wrote regularly for the Palestine Chronicle, a vehemently anti-Israel outlet owned by the People Media Project. Jan alleged that the defendants 'employed and compensated Aljamal as a journalist and provided him a U.S.-based platform to publish articles supporting Hamas,' although it is a U.S-designated foreign terrorist organization said the court papers. He further claimed that 'through these actions, Defendants aided and abetted his kidnapping and imprisonment.' U.S. District Court Judge Tiffany Cartwright wrote in her decision that the Project could only be held accountable for aiding and abetting an act of terrorism if they 'knew they were paying a Hamas operative.' Because Jan’s complaint 'does not allege actual knowledge,' his claim must be dismissed, she wrote. She also accepted the defendants’ claim that the articles written by Aljamal were protected by the First Amendment’s 'protection of speech on matters of public concern.' The judge did leave room in her ruling for a renewed lawsuit. 'Because the deficiencies in Jan’s complaint could conceivably be cured through the allegation of other facts, the Court also grants Jan leave to amend' his complaint, she wrote, giving him until February 21 to do so. Jan, Shlomi Ziv and Andrey Kozlov were abducted from the Nova music festival during the Hamas-led invasion of Israel on October 7, 2023. They held together for eight months in the Aljamal apartment in the Nuseirat refugee camp and tortured both physically and psychologically. This included being told constantly that they would be murdered by their captors and that their families didn’t care about them, being deliberately starved of food, and punished for the smallest infraction, such as being covered with blankets in the heat for hours after not asking for permission to leave the bathroom. Aljamal, who previously had been a spokesman for the Gazan labor ministry under Hamas, was killed during the IDF operation in which the threesome were rescued in a daring daytime raid that also saw the successful rescue of another Nova hostage, Noa Argamani, from an apartment a few hundred meters away.

Israel to send delegation to Doha after ‘positive’ talks in DC	Upon returning from the United States, Netanyahu will convene Israel’s Security Cabinet to outline Jerusalem’s stance on the second phase of the deal, shaping future negotiations, the PMO stated. By Joshua Marks, JNS Israel will dispatch a delegation to Doha, Qatar this weekend to discuss the future of its ceasefire agreement with Hamas. This follows a 'positive and friendly' meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff on Monday. The meeting in Washington, a day before Netanyahu was scheduled to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House, also included U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, Israeli Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter and other senior officials.

Photo by Avi Ohayon/GPO. While in the Qatari capital, the working delegation is to 'discuss technical details' of the deal, according to the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, as negotiators focus on reaching phase two of the tenuous truce. Upon returning from the United States, Netanyahu will convene Israel’s Security Cabinet to outline Jerusalem’s stance on the second phase of the deal, shaping future negotiations, the PMO stated. Netanyahu, who arrived in Washington on Sunday, plans to extend his visit until Saturday night, his office said, citing 'many requests by U.S. officials who want to meet him.' The Israeli leader had originally planned to fly home on Thursday. In phase two of the ceasefire-for-hostages deal between Israel and Hamas, Israel is to withdraw entirely from Gaza in exchange for the release of the remaining living hostages and a permanent cessation of hostilities. According to Israeli estimates, there are 79 hostages still in Hamas captivity in Gaza, including 76 abducted during the Oct. 7 attacks. Of the 251 hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, 175 have been returned or rescued, and Hamas is believed to be holding 35 bodies, 34 of them taken during the cross-border invasion and that of IDF Lt. Hadar Goldin, which was taken by the Palestinian terrorist group in 2014. Jerusalem is also maintaining a ceasefire with the Hezbollah terrorist organization in Lebanon, with IDF troops still on the ground in the south of the country dismantling the Iranian proxy’s infrastructure. Originally set to last 60 days, the agreement has been extended until Feb. 18. Netanyahu meets with Elon Musk While in Washington, Netanyahu met on Sunday with billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who heads the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Their discussion focused on strengthening U.S.-Israel cooperation in artificial intelligence (AI). David Sacks, the administration’s lead on cryptocurrency and AI, also reportedly attended. This was Netanyahu’s third meeting with Musk, following a visit to Tesla’s California facility a year and a half ago and Musk’s trip to Israel after the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre.

Netanyahu meets with Elon Musk, secures major AI deal with US	Tech mogul and Department of Government Efficiency administrator Elon Musk agrees to partner up with Israel's AI program during meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency chief, Elon Musk, Sunday, two days before the premier's visit to the White House and first formal meeting with President Donald Trump since inauguration day last month. While a photograph showed President Trump joining the two, the Prime Minister's Office only confirmed Monday that Netanyahu met with Musk, remaining mum on the president's involvement in the meeting. During their meeting, which took place shortly after Netanyahu arrived in Washington D.C., Musk and the Israeli premier were joined by David Sacks, Chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. At Netanyahu's behest, Musk and Sacks agreed to integrate Israel's artificial intelligence programs into Trump administration plans to massively expand AI development, estimated at roughly half a trillion dollars. The cooperative effort is expected to benefit the U.S. and Israeli cybersecurity industry, cryptocurrency markets, and the artificial intelligence industry. The meeting came just weeks after Netanyahu publicly defended Musk from accusations of antisemitism, after gesture made by the billionaire at a Trump inauguration event on January 20th was interpreted by some as a Nazi salute. 'Elon Musk is being falsely smeared,' Netanyahu tweeted. 'Elon is a great friend of Israel. He visited Israel after the October 7 massacre in which Hamas terrorists committed the worst atrocity against the Jewish people since the Holocaust.' 'He has since repeatedly and forcefully supported Israel’s right to defend itself against genocidal terrorists and regimes who seek to annihilate the one and only Jewish state.'

Arab countries refuse to accept Palestinian terror prisoners	Qatar, which has long provided sanctuary for Hamas' leadership, was coy about the number of freed terrorists it plans to accept. By World Israel News Staff Palestinian security prisoners freed in the ongoing ceasefire and hostage exchange are stuck in limbo, as Arab countries - which have publicly supported the Palestinian cause - have proven unwilling to repatriate released terrorists. Around 70 Palestinian convicted terrorists have been deported to Egypt, but the country and others in the region are not enthusiastic about the prospect of granting residency rights to those who were released. 'To date, no Arab country has agreed to receive even a single released and expelled Palestinian prisoner,' a source from the Palestinian Prisoner Authority told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. The source added that the men are not allowed to leave their hotel, with the terrorists complaining that they had been transferred 'from an Israeli prison to an Egyptian prison.' The men are 'not being treated warmly' by the Egyptians, the PA source continued, citing the fact that the men were not given basic necessities - such as alternatives to their prison uniforms and sandals - for a lengthy period of time. Egypt has been steadfast in its refusal to accept Palestinians, with its president stating the country would refuse to even provide temporary refuge to civilian Gazans. In a recent media statement, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi appeared to say that Gazans are so radicalized that their presence in Egypt would be a danger to the country. The transfer of Gazans to Egypt, which was recently proposed by President Donald Trump, 'can never be tolerated or allowed because of its impact on Egyptian national security,' Sisi said. Turkey, which has widely praised the Hamas terror group and repeatedly accused Israel of genocide, was reticent when asked how many former prisoners it would be willing to host. 'We have agreed to accommodate a certain number of expelled Palestinian prisoners,' Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said in a laconic media statement, without providing additional details. Qatar, which has long provided sanctuary for Hamas' leadership, was similarly coy about the number of freed terrorists it plans to accept. The repatriation of the Palestinian prisoners to the Gulf Kingdom 'must be based on their own decision,' said Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed al-Thani in a statement.

Terrorists released in Gaza hostage deal transferred to luxurious...	The 88 who have been deported so far are enjoying the beautiful St. Regis Almasa Hotel. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The Palestinian terrorists who have been deported to Egypt among the hundreds released in exchange for Israeli hostages so far are enjoying luxurious conditions at a Cairo-area hotel, Ynet reported Tuesday. So far, 88 have entered Egypt at the Rafah Crossing, and from there they were taken to the high-end St. Regis Almasa (Diamond) Hotel in the New Administrative Capital east of Cairo. Many of the men were serving multiple life sentences in Israel for murdering or being responsible for the murder of innocent civilians in various terror attacks. They are now enjoying the many amenities provided by the hotel, which belongs to the Marriott International chain. These include a large fitness center, spa, cafés and restaurants, sports club, snooker rooms, and even a shooting range and movie theater. There is a chandelier-bedecked lobby, elegant and carpeted dining rooms, and top-quality accommodations in their private rooms. The ex-prisoners may be staying in the hotel for a while, as discussions are still being held with several countries about how many each is agreeing to take in, and no timetable for their moving on has been set. 'There is no need to rush, especially since the agreement is still in its first stage,' a source told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed. The men are receiving very good treatment, he noted, including being 'allowed to receive their visitors or relatives without any restrictions.' They are also allowed to come and go as they please, the source said, pushing back on a claim that the men were not allowed to leave the complex. Countries that have expressed willingness to host the former prisoners include Turkey, Qatar, Algeria, as well as Pakistan and Malaysia, with Doha taking the lead in the numbers it is willing to host, according to the Qatari-owned media outlet. The source said that Turkey is interested in receiving prisoners specifically from Jerusalem, and that Egypt itself may be the final destination for some of them instead of just a transit point. The first batch of 70 prisoners was greeted by a long line of officials, including Hamas chief Khaled Mashal, and representatives of other terror organizations such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Before the reception, Al Qahera News reported, the Egyptians gave them new clothes, including warm jackets, caps, and a kind of scarf to wear around their necks that had a picture of Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Palestinian flag on either side. Crowds stood outside in a celebratory mood, with cries of 'Allahu Akhbar [God is great]' filling the air, Arab media reported.

Record emigration from Israel during war: Knesset report	Nearly 60,000 Israelis permanently left the country in 2024. By World Israel News Staff A report recently presented in the Knesset revealed that tens of thousands of Israelis have emigrated from the country since October 7, 2023, raising concerns around the Jewish State's growth rate. According to the report by the Central Bureau of Statistics, around 82,700 Israelis left the country in 2024, with just 23,800 returning, indicating a net loss of nearly 60,000 residents. Notably, nearly half of those who emigrated were born outside of Israel. 15 percent of those who left had spent less than five years in the country. In 2024, Israel's population growth rate plunged from 1.6% in 2023 to 1.1%. According to earlier data released in December 2024 by the Central Bureau of Statistics, the number of new immigrants to Israel has fallen sharply. The startling statistics were discussed in the Knesset's Aliyah, Absorption, and Diaspora Committee on Monday. Research by the committee members also found that Israel is ranked as one of the least attractive destinations for entrepreneurs and potential immigrants with advanced academic degrees. 'Despite the wave of antisemitism around the world, the Israel-Hamas War is discouraging new olim from coming to Israel,' said MK Oded Forer (Yisrael Beytenu) during the discussion, according to a summary of his remarks published on the Knesset website. Forer added that he believed unnecessary government bureaucracy and red tape around recognizing potential immigrants' professional qualifications - such as a lengthy process for doctors to obtain local medical licenses - were a major factor in discouraging educated immigrants from moving to Israel. Others cited the general economic downturn caused by the war as a reason for the drop-off in migration to Israel. 'High-tech professionals love the country and want to live here, but the decline in investors in the Israeli market is harming their ability to stay,' said Irit Touitou, Co-Founder and partner of Tech For Israel. 'If the trend does not change, Israel will lose its social and economic advantage. The government must restore the business sector’s confidence in Israel.'

‘Israel is tiny’ – Trump’s response to Israel annexation plans	President Trump says 'no guarantee' Gaza ceasefire will hold, responds to questions regarding Israel's possible annexation of parts of Judea and Samaria by emphasizing the country's 'small size.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Donald Trump cast doubt Monday on the future of the hostage deal between Israel and the Hamas terror organization, while fueling speculation he may be prepared to back shelved Israeli plans to extend sovereignty over parts of Judea and Samaria. On Monday, Trump addressed reporters in the Oval Office of the White House, discussing, among other things, the new tariffs considered for Mexico and Canada. The president also discussed developments in the Middle East, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming visit to the White House, slated for Tuesday. Trump praised his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, for his work in securing the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal, while expressing uncertainty regarding the second phase of the three-phase agreement. 'I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,' Trump said. Witkoff, Trump continued, 'does great work,' but added that the Gaza ceasefire is 'complicated.' Witkoff took a more optimistic tone, saying the administration remains 'hopeful.' It’s holding so far, so we’re certainly hopeful.' When asked whether he would support Israel returning to its Judea and Samaria sovereignty plan, Trump refused to comment directly, but instead emphasized Israel's small geographic dimensions. Trump: 'See this wonderful pen? My desk is the Middle East and this pen is Israel. That's not good&#8230; It's a pretty small piece of land. It's amazing that they've been able to do what they've been able to do&#8230; but it is a pretty small piece of land.' Simple and brilliant. pic.twitter.com/cVQpLb2hWy — Uri Kurlianchik (@VerminusM) February 3, 2025 'I’m not going to talk about that. It certainly is a small country…in terms of land,' Trump mused, pulling out a pen from the Oval Office desk to illustrate Israel's size in comparison to the Middle East as a whole. 'See this pen…my desk is the Middle East, this pen, the top of the pen, this is Israel,' Trump continued. 'That’s not good, you know. It is a pretty big difference.' 'I use that as an analogy. It is pretty accurate, actually. It is a pretty small piece of land. And it is amazing that they have been able to do what they have been able to do when you think about it. A lot of good, smart brain-power. But it is a very small piece of land, no question about it.' Trump's comments have fueled speculation that he may be preparing to back a resumption of Israel's annexation plan, first raised by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ahead of the 2019 Knesset elections, but shelved in 2020 ahead of the signing of the Abraham Accords. Recently, the president has also proposed the mass migration of Gazans out of the Gaza Strip, hinting that the relocation could be a long-term move.

7 IDF soldiers wounded in terrorist shooting in Jordan Valley	Terrorist gunman opens fire at group of Israeli soldiers at checkpoint in the Jordan Valley, leaving seven wounded, including two in critical condition. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News At least seven Israelis were wounded, including two critically, in a terrorist shooting attack in the Jordan Valley area of Samaria Tuesday morning. The attack occurred just after 6:00 a.m. Monday when an Arab terrorist opened fire on a group of IDF soldiers securing a checkpoint outside of the Palestinian Authority-administered town of Tayasir east of Tubas, on the edge of an area in Samaria where the Israeli military and Shin Bet internal security agency have been conducting a major counter-terror operation since January. As the terrorist fired at the checkpoint, IDF soldiers stationed in the area returned fire, fatally wounding the gunman. An IDF spokesperson confirmed the attack, saying: 'A terrorist fired at soldiers at an army position in Tayasir. The soldiers responded with gunfire against the terrorist and eliminated him. According to initial reports, the gunman seized control of an army pillbox, using the position to shield himself during an extended gunbattle with IDF soldiers before being fatally wounded. Additional soldiers have been deployed to the area following the attack. Emergency first responders were dispatched to the scene to treat the wounded and evacuate them to Israeli hospitals. Two army medical evacuation helicopters were used to rush the most seriously wounded to the hospital. Of the seven wounded soldiers, two are listed in critical condition, with two others in moderate condition. The rest are said to be in light condition. The attack comes less than a month after a deadly terrorist shooting attack in Samaria conducted by terrorists linked with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement. The January 6th shooting in al-Funduk left three Israelis dead, prompting Israel to launch Operation Iron Wall on January 21st. Beginning in Jenin and spreading to other terror hotspots across Samaria including Tulkarem and Tubas, the IDF has claimed the operation has led to the elimination of over 50 terrorists affiliated with the Jenin Brigades and other rogue organizations which have challenged the Palestinian Authority for control of northern Samaria.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Nearly 80% of New York State residents support President Donald Trump's plan to deport illegal immigrants convicted of crimes, according to a Siena College poll, Fox News reports. The survey found that 79% of eligible voters in the Empire State agreed with the proposal, while only 11% opposed it. Although more Republicans than Democrats supported the plan, a majority of Democrats also favored deporting illegal immigrants who had committed crimes. The poll found that 69% of Democrats approved of the measure, compared to 91% of Republicans. Only 16% of Democrats and 4% of Republicans opposed it. Meanwhile, 42% of respondents opposed the deportation of illegal immigrants who had not committed crimes. This group included 59% of Democrats and just 15% of Republicans. Among those who supported deporting non-criminal illegal immigrants, 64% were Republicans and 24% were Democrats. The survey also found that 48% of respondents supported federal efforts to deport illegal immigrants in New York, while 31% were against them. Among supporters, 81% were Republicans and 28% were Democrats. Of those opposed, 50% were Democrats and 5% were Republicans. On the campaign trail in 2024, Trump stated that he would conduct 'the largest deportation in the nation's history.' During his campaign, he also said that migrants who support Hamas would be denied residency in the U.S. 'If you want to abolish the state of Israel, you’re disqualified. If you support Hamas or the ideology behind Hamas, you’re disqualified. And if you’re a communist, Marxist, or fascist, you are disqualified,' Trump said at a rally in Iowa. He added that migrants already present in the U.S. who are in the process of obtaining citizenship would be expelled if they expressed support for Hamas or other terrorist organizations. 'We will aggressively deport resident aliens with jihadist sympathies,' Trump said. Trump also emphasized that migrants from 'terror-plagued countries' should undergo 'strong ideological screening,' though he did not specify what that process would entail.

80% of Israelis back Trump’s proposal to relocate Gazans – poll	Around 43% said the plan was 'practical' and should be implemented, while 30% said it was 'desirable but not practical.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A survey by the Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI) showed on Monday that 80% of Israelis agreed with Trump's plan to relocate Gazans to other countries. The poll’s results were revealed as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flew to Washington to meet with US President Donald Trump. Eight out of ten Israelis said they agreed with the statement, 'Arabs from Gaza should relocate to another country.' Although the vast majority supported the plan, not all of them agreed that it was possible or feasible. Around 43% said the plan was 'practical' and should be implemented, while 30% said it was 'desirable but not practical.' Only 13% of respondents believed that Trump's proposal was immoral. Among them, 54% were Arab respondents, while only 3% of Jewish Israelis shared this view. Those who answered that the plan was both practical and desirable included 81% of those who identified as right-wing, 31% of those in the center, and 27% of those on the left. The majority of Likud voters agreed that the plan was both practical and desirable, and half of those who voted for the National Unity party felt it was desirable but not practical. About 62% of Labor voters said the plan was 'immoral' or a 'distraction.' The conclusion of the JPPI survey was that the proposal to relocate Palestinians, a move once thought of as unacceptable by many Israelis, is now garnering widespread support. Most of those who objected to the plan did so because they doubted it could be carried out or felt it was a distraction, rather than rejecting it on moral grounds. By way of comparison, surveys taken in the 1990s and 2000s regarding the transfer of Palestinians from Judea and Samaria showed that at that time, only 40-50% of respondents supported the plan. Trump contacted Jordanian King Abdullah and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi regarding the transfer of Gazan civilians to their countries, but both leaders, as well as the Arab League, rejected Trump's plan.

When the Hamas captors asserted that their ancestors lived in the land before the Jews, Moses responded, 'What are you talking about? Our people lived in these places 3,000 years ago!' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News During his captivity, freed hostage Gadi Moses regularly debated with his Hamas captors over the ownership of the land of Israel. The Hamas captors taunted the 80-year-old hostage and asked, 'Where are your parents from? Go back there!' When they asserted that their ancestors lived in the land before the Jews, Moses responded, 'What are you talking about? Our people lived in these places 3,000 years ago!' The first period of his captivity was spent alone, and he would pass the time debating with his captors, often about Islam and political issues. At one point, his Hamas guards gave him a book about Islam, which Moses said he couldn't read without glasses, so they provided him with a pair. Deprived of electricity, Moses went to sleep at sunset and woke at sunrise, often hearing bombings. 'It was very scary for him,' said his son Yair. During the last two months of captivity, he was placed with Thai workers who had been kidnapped on October 7. 'At last, he was no longer alone—there were others with him. They exchanged a few words but mostly relied on hand and eye gestures to communicate,' Yair shared. 'For the most part, they treated him with respect. They ate their meals together, and he rarely felt afraid, aside from a few brief moments. Mostly, it was just endless boredom—hours upon hours of nothingness,' Yair continued. 'Over time, he managed to piece things together, gaining an understanding of what was happening in Israel. Occasionally, he watched Al Jazeera and became aware of the war in Gaza,' Yair recounted. Moses, Ofer Kalderon, and Yarden Bibas were freed during Saturday night’s hostage-for-prisoner exchange. Bibas returned to Israel without his wife, Shiri, and his two small children, Ariel and Kfir, who were supposed to have been released along with the women and children in the early phase of the hostage deal. Israel has asked Hamas to clarify the status of the mother and children, who are on the list of the 33 hostages to be released in the first phase of the agreement.

IDF: 50 terrorists killed, 100 detained since start of Samaria op	The military on Sunday destroyed 23 buildings in the Jenin area which were used as terror infrastructure. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces has killed more than 50 Palestinian terrorists since the start of 'Operation Iron Wall' in northern Samaria on Jan. 21, the military said on Sunday evening, announcing it was expanding the offensive. At least 35 gunmen were killed by soldiers during ground operations in the Jenin and Tulkarem areas, while another 15 were killed in airstrikes, the IDF said. More than 100 wanted terrorists have been detained thus far. 'During the operation, the forces located and confiscated dozens of weapons, destroyed hundreds of explosive devices and dozens of additional charges that were planted on roads to harm our forces,' the IDF said. On Sunday, the counter-terrorism operation was expanded to include Tammun, a Palestinian town south of Tubas near Nablus. On Jan. 20, one Israeli soldier was killed and four others were wounded when their armored army vehicle hit a roadside bomb in Tammun. Earlier on Sunday, the army said it had destroyed 'several buildings in Jenin, in the Menashe Brigade [area of responsibility], which were used as terror infrastructure.' According to the IDF, security forces destroyed 23 structures in the Jenin area where terrorist infrastructure was located after searching hundreds of buildings in the area. During the scans, explosives laboratories, weapons, observation posts, and more terrorist infrastructure were found. No casualties were reported in the incident. The demolition came after Defense Minister Israel Katz ordered the IDF to destroy any building used to carry out acts of terrorism in the hostile Palestinian city, the Jewish state’s Channel 12 broadcaster reported. 'Operation Iron Wall' includes the IDF, Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) and Border Police forces, the army said when it announced the raids two weeks ago. Israeli ground forces entered Jenin with the stated goal of preserving Jerusalem’s ability to swiftly act against terrorist organizations in the city, known among Arabs as the 'Martyrs’ Capital' due to the many suicide bombers who have emerged from the area. During a visit to the Jenin area on Jan. 22, Katz described the operation in the city as 'a shift in the IDF’s security doctrine in Judea and Samaria. 'We will not allow the arms of the Iranian octopus and radical Sunni Islam to endanger the lives of [Israeli] citizens and establish an eastern terrorist front against the State of Israel,' the defense minister vowed. 'We will strike hard at the arms of the octopus until they are severed.' An unnamed senior security official told Israel’s Channel 14 News broadcaster previously that the large-scale campaign against Iranian-backed terrorist organizations in northern Samaria could take months. 'When it ends, the terror camps will cease to exist. What we did in Gaza, we will do to them as well; we will leave them in ruins,' the source said. The Israeli Air Force conducted a series of strikes on terrorist cells in northern Samaria on Saturday, thwarting an 'imminent terror attack.' Secondary blasts were observed after the Air Force strike in Qabatiya, indicating the presence of explosives in a vehicle being used by terrorists. According to the IDF, the Palestinian cell had been en route to carry out an attack.

Hamas forced hostage to write thank-you letter before release	American-Israeli dual citizen held captive for over year by Hamas terrorists was forced to write a letter thanking his captors before being released as part of the hostage deal. By Jewish Breaking News Hamas’ depravity knows no bounds as Israeli media reports that recently freed Oct. 7 hostage Keith Siegel was forced to write a thank-you letter to his captors. Published on Telegram by Hamas-affiliated channels after the 65-year-old’s release on Saturday, the letter is undated and carefully describes his treatment during his 481 days in Gaza 'To the Qassam fighters, my name is Keith Siegel and I am from Kfar Aza. I was a prisoner in Gaza from October 7, 2023, until January 2025,' the letter begins. 'My guards during this period took care of all my needs: food and drink, medicine, vitamins, eye drops, a blood pressure measuring device and more.' 'They also made sure I got a doctor’s checkup when I felt unwell for a long time. The guards considered my needs and responded to my requests regarding nutrition, eating habits and more. They made sure I had food that suited my health needs,' he wrote. Of course, the reality was much different, as revealed after his release. As a vegetarian, Siegel had been so desperate for sustenance that he ate meat whenever it was offered. The last meal he ate was 24 hours before his release. Siegel was also forced to blame Israel for the delay in his release and for causing 'many casualties and unnecessary damage.' 'To the fighters who guarded me during this period, I would like to say thank you,' the letter ends. In a statement, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum slammed Hamas’s abusive actions, characterizing them as 'one example of many of the cruel and cynical conduct' of the Iranian-backed terror organization. In fact, Hamas has developed a torturous ritual around hostage releases, complete with official 'release certificates' and 'gift bags' containing mementos of their suffering. They even prepared a package for Siegel’s wife Aviva, who had been released in a brief exchange a month after Hamas’s deadly Oct. 7 rampage against Israel in 2023.

Elon Musk says President Donald Trump has ‘agreed’ USAID should b...	USAID, whose website vanished Saturday without explanation, has been one of the federal agencies most targeted by the Trump administration in an escalating crackdown on the federal government and many of its programs. By The Associated Press The U.S. Agency for International Development is on the cusp of being shuttered, according the Trump administration's billionaire adviser and Tesla CEO Elon Musk — who has been wrestling for control of the agency in recent days. Early Monday, Musk held a live session on X Spaces, previously known as Twitter Spaces, and said that he spoke in detail about USAID with the president. 'He agreed we should shut it down,' Musk said. 'It became apparent that its not an apple with a worm it in,' Musk said. 'What we have is just a ball of worms. You’ve got to basically get rid of the whole thing. It’s beyond repair.' 'We're shutting it down.' His comments come after the administration placed two top security chiefs at USAID on leave after they refused to turn over classified material in restricted areas to Musk's government-inspection teams, a current and a former U.S. official told The Associated Press on Sunday. Members of Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, eventually did gain access Saturday to the aid agency's classified information, which includes intelligence reports, the former official said. Musk's DOGE crew lacked high enough security clearance to access that information, so the two USAID security officials — John Voorhees and deputy Brian McGill — believed themselves legally obligated to deny access. The current and former U.S. officials had knowledge of the incident and spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share the information. Musk on Sunday responded to an X post about the news by saying, 'USAID is a criminal organization. Time for it to die.' He followed with additional posts on X about the aid agency. Kate Miller, who serves on an advisory board for DOGE, said in a separate post that no classified material was accessed 'without proper security clearances.' It comes a day after DOGE carried out a similar operation at the Treasury Department, gaining access to sensitive information including the Social Security and Medicare customer payment systems. The Washington Post reported that a senior Treasury official had resigned over Musk's team accessing sensitive information. Musk formed DOGE in cooperation with the Trump administration with the stated goal of finding ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations. USAID, whose website vanished Saturday without explanation, has been one of the federal agencies most targeted by the Trump administration in an escalating crackdown on the federal government and many of its programs. 'It’s been run by a bunch of radical lunatics. And we’re getting them out,' Trump said to reporters about USAID on Sunday night. The Trump administration and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have imposed an unprecedented freeze on foreign assistance that has shut down much of USAID’s humanitarian, development and security programs worldwide — compelling thousands of layoffs by aid organizations — and ordered furloughs and leaves that have gutted the agency’s leadership and staff in Washington. The U.S. is by far the world’s largest donor of humanitarian aid, with USAID administering billions of dollars in humanitarian, development and security assistance in more than 100 countries. Peter Marocco, a returning political appointee from Trump’s first term, was a leader in enforcing the shutdown. USAID staffers say they believe that agency outsiders with visitors badges asking questions of employees inside the Washington headquarters are members of Musk's DOGE team. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in a post on Sunday that Trump was allowing Musk to access people's personal information and shut down government funding. 'We must do everything in our power to push back and protect people from harm,' the Massachusetts senator said, without giving details.

ISIS terrorist gets 3 life sentences for Jerusalem murders	Palestinian Arab terrorist who swore allegiance to the Islamic State In Syria terror group and murdered three in two separate Jerusalem stabbing attacks sentenced to three life sentences, 40 years in prison. By World Israel News Staff An ISIS terrorist who murdered an elderly couple and a foreign worker in Jerusalem in two separate attacks has been sentenced to three consecutive life sentences and 40 years in prison. On Monday, the Jerusalem District Court handed down three life sentences, plus a prison term of 40 years, to 36-year-old Wasim a-Sayed, the Palestinian Arab terrorist who attempted to stab an Israeli teenger in 2019, stabbed an elderly Jewish couple to death six years ago, and murdered a foreign worker while wounding his roommate three years ago. A-Sayed, a resident of the city of Hebron in Judea, had aligned himself with the ISIS terror organization in his 20s, and was jailed in Israel from 2015 to 2018 under administrative arrest as a preventative measure, amid fears he planned to commit terror attacks on Israelis. In January 2019, shortly after his release, a-Sayed attempted to stab a teenage girl in Jerusalem's Armon Hanatziv neighborhood, but was forced to flee the scene when his victim screamed for help. A day later, however, a-Sayed broke into the apartment of an elderly Jewish couple - Yehuda and Tamar Kaduri - stabbing the two to death in a double murder case that remained unsolved for years. He was later arrested for swearing allegiance to ISIS - even as authorities remained unaware of his killing of the Kaduris - leading to a two-year jail sentence. Following his release in 2022, a-Sayed resumed his killing spree, murdering a foreign worker, Ivan Tarnovski of Moldova, in Jerusalem's Arnona neighborhood, and wounding a second foreign worker. After he was arrested following the Arnona stabbings, a-Sayed confessed to murdering the Kaduris in 2019, leading to his April 2022 indictment on three charges of murder and two charges of attempted murder. Last September, a-Sayed was convicted on one count of murder under aggravated circumstances, two counts of terror-related murder, and two counts of attempted murder. On Monday, the Jerusalem District Court ruled that given the severity of his crimes, a-Sayed may not be released in the current hostage deal or any future arrangement.

Trump suspends funding to South Africa for land confiscation and ...	The country recently played a controversial role in facilitating international legal actions against Israel at the International Criminal Court, accusing Israel of war crimes during its conflict with Gaza. By Jewish Breaking News President Donald Trump has taken to social media to denounce South Africa, accusing the nation of confiscating land and mistreating certain groups of people, calling it a 'massive Human Rights VIOLATION.' Trump criticized the lack of media attention on the issue, stating, 'The United States won’t stand for it, we will act.' He also announced a suspension of all future U.S. funding to South Africa until a full investigation into the situation is conducted. Ironically, this action by Trump comes amidst growing scrutiny of South Africa’s actions on the global stage. The country recently played a controversial role in facilitating international legal actions against Israel at the International Criminal Court, accusing Israel of war crimes during its conflict with Gaza. Many see this as part of South Africa’s longstanding criticism of Israeli policies. The move angered Israeli officials and their allies, who condemned it as politically motivated and an unfair targeting of the Jewish state.

By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon Panamanian president José Raúl Mulino said his country would not renew its agreement with China's Belt and Road Initiative following a visit from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a move that will make it the first Latin American country to leave the initiative. Mulino, speaking to reporters on Sunday after Rubio's first foreign trip as America's top diplomat, said he believes the agreement is due for renewal in a year or two. He said he would study 'whether it can be finished earlier or not.' The news is a blow to Beijing, which views Panama as critical to its foreign influence efforts in the Western Hemisphere. Chinese businesses operate ports near the Panama Canal, which the United States owned and operated until moving control to Panama in 1999. Following his meeting with Mulino, Rubio said the United States 'cannot, and will not, allow the Chinese Communist Party to continue with its effective and growing control over the Panama Canal area.' Brazil also considered joining the Belt and Road Initiative late last year, signaling a desire to align with the Chinese Communist Party. The country abandoned those plans soon after, however, with officials expressing fear about signing long-term agreements with Beijing. In late 2023, meanwhile, Italy became the first European nation to exit the initiative, arguing that the deal did little to boost the country's exports to China. Panama was the first Latin American nation to join the Belt and Road Initiative and now becomes the first to back away from it. The initiative seeks to spread Chinese influence worldwide through public investment from Beijing. Panama's decision to leave the initiative reverses 'the Chinese Communist Party's geopolitical gains in our own hemisphere,' said Michael Sobolik, a veteran China analyst with the Hudson Institute think tank. 'Americans should welcome this achievement, and every BRI partner in Latin America should follow Panama’s example,' he told the Washington Free Beacon. Mauricio Claver-Carone, the U.S. special envoy for Latin America, said Rubio 'is effectively restoring American credibility on his first stop on his first trip abroad as Secretary of State.'

Despite vows by Netanyahu, Palestinian Authority gains foothold i...	Palestinian Authority reportedly managing strategically critical border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip - in spite of repeated pledges by the Prime Minister's Office that PA will have no role in Gaza security. By World Israel News Staff The Palestinian Authority has assumed partial control of a strategically critical position along the Gaza-Egyptian border recently, giving Ramallah a foothold in the Gaza Strip, Yedioth Aharanoth reported Monday morning. According to the report, for the past two days, Palestinian Authority officials have administered the Rafah Border Crossing on the Gazan side of the Egypt-Gaza frontier. Citing Louy Izriqat, a spokesman for the PA's paramilitary security force, Fares a-Rifi, a member of the PA's ruling Fatah party who lives in the Gaza Strip, has been given control of the Rafah Border Crossing police station. A-Rifi and other PA officials are said to be managing the border crossing in conjunction with a joint mission of Egyptian security officials and Europeans, who have been tasked with ensuring compliance with the ceasefire deal and to prevent the movement of terrorists across the border. Thus far, movement across the border is only permitted out of the Gaza Strip and into Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. The report contradicts repeated claims by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose office denied prior reports of the PA's planned role in managing the Rafah Border Crossing. Last month, the Prime Minister's Office denied claims by Ramallah that the PA was poised to take control of the Rafah crossing during the first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza. In a statement issued on January 22nd, the PMO claimed that the PA's role would be strictly technical, providing exit stamps on the passports of departing Gazans. 'The report is incorrect despite efforts by the Palestinian Authority to create a false picture to the effect that it controls the crossing,' the PMO said. Netanyahu's office emphasized that the IDF will remain 'positioned around the crossing,' and that there will be 'no passage without the supervision, oversight and advance approval of the IDF' and the Shin Bet, Israel's internal security agency. 'The technical management inside the crossing is being carried out by Gazans not affiliated with Hamas, with security by the ISA, who have been managing civilian services in the Strip, such as electricity, water and sewage, since the start of the war. Their work is supervised by the international EUBAM force.' 'The only practical involvement of the Palestinian Authority is its stamp on the passports, which according to the existing international arrangement, is the only way Gazans may leave the Strip in order to enter, or be received in, other countries.' However, a social media post by a-Rifi's brother congratulating him on the new role suggested the PA force's involvement is more significant that suggested by the PMO. 'The legitimate Palestinian police are the ones who will control and maintain security at the Rafah crossing under the command of Fares a-Rifi.' The PA team operating at the Rafah crossing reportedly includes nine officers. The report claimed that the PA team's work on the Rafah crossing was initiated following intense coordination with Israeli agencies, including the Shin Bet, the IDF, and the Defense Ministry's Civil Administration. Former National Security Minister MK Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit), who bolted the ruling coalition last month over the Gaza ceasefire, castigated the government following the report. 'The Israeli government continues to violate the promises and principles it declared in the context of the reckless deal,' Ben-Gvir tweeted Monday. 'The Prime Minister has emphasized countless times that he will not allow the Authority to manage the transition and that it is a security risk, but unfortunately, he is also folding on this issue.' 'The government allows the Palestinian Authority – the one that pays salaries to terrorists – to control the gates of Gaza. How low will we go?'

‘This is not justice’: Female guards feel betrayed as their abuse...	Released prisoner Mahmoud Attalah used his position to terrorize female guards. He selected who would work in his wing, touched them at will, issued threats—and in Hilla’s case, raped her multiple times. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Four times, 'Hilla' was raped, suffering in silence while her superiors ignored the horror unfolding before them. She was just 19 years old, serving as a guard in the high-security Gilboa Prison as part of her mandatory military service. And now she faces the possibility that her rapist, convicted Palestinian terrorist Mahmoud Attalah will walk out of prison and return to Shechem (Nablus), a short distance from Hilla’s home and the homes of other guards he tormented while superiors turned a blind eye. 'For a decade, I fought for justice. I endured humiliation, disbelief, and a legal battle just to see him finally indicted,' Hilla told The Press Service of Israel. 'Now, the state that let this happen is turning its back on me again. If he is to be freed, I am begging them—send him far away. Don’t leave me living in fear.' As victims of sexual assault, Hilla and the four other guards chose not to identify themselves publicly out of fear for their safety. Attalah, a longtime Fatah operative, is serving a life sentence plus an additional 15 years for murdering a Palestinian woman from Ramallah whom he suspected of collaborating with Israel. Yet, inside Gilboa Prison, he enjoyed a privileged status. As the designated liaison between security prisoners and officials, he wielded influence over inmates from nearly all terror factions. In exchange for the intelligence-related activities he facilitated, Attalah was granted anything he requested, including the power to handpick the female guards assigned to work near him. 'He was the true commander of the prison,' attorney Keren Barak, who represents the five female guards, told TPS-IL. Testimonies revealed how Attalah used his position to terrorize female guards. He selected who would work in his wing, touched them at will, issued threats—and in Hilla’s case, raped her multiple times. For years, the case was buried, dismissed, and covered up. But the victims succeeded in exposing the truth in 2021 during an inquiry into the escape of six prisoners. The revelations shocked Israelis. Attalah was indicted on charges of sexual assault in September. Bassem Kashkosh and Rani Basha, the Gilboa Prison’s former commander and intelligence officer respectively, were also indicted for breach of faith and failing to report Atallah’s sexual offenses. Attalah’s own trial on these charges was scheduled to begin towards the end of January. It seemed that justice was within reach. ‘I Will Chase You For the Rest of Your Life’ Then, the news came. A phone call from their attorney informed them: Attalah would soon walk free as part of a hostages’ release deal with Hamas. The trial was canceled. For the abuse survivors, Attalah’s release is not just a symbolic injustice. It is an immediate and tangible threat. During interrogations, Attalah directly threatened his former guards, saying, 'I will chase you for the rest of your life.' He demonstrated intimate knowledge of his victims’ personal lives, their families, and their homes. 'He obtained the phone numbers of female soldiers and called them after their service ended,' Barak recounted. 'This is a man who was given so many privileges by the system that their fear is not paranoia. It is real.' Despite the red flags, Israeli authorities didn’t classify Attalah as a high-risk prisoner eligible for deportation. 'He should not be free at all. But if he is released, why is he being placed so close to his victims?' Barak asks. 'They fought so hard to see justice, and now they are being abandoned.' Meanwhile, the women’s pleas for protection were ignored. Their petition to the High Court of Justice was dismissed outright. The Ministry of Defense claimed the matter was not under its jurisdiction. The Ministry of National Security and the Israel Prison Service passed responsibility on to the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet). Neither the Shin Bet nor the Prime Minister’s Office responded to TPS-IL inquiries. 'They ignored us when we were being abused. They called us liars. They let this monster control us,' Hilla said. 'And now, they’re doing it again. It’s the third time they’ve thrown us to the wolves.' One of the survivors has not left her house since hearing the news. The others live in a constant state of fear. 'Their fear is justified,' Barak emphasizes. 'They are being asked to live alongside a man who abused and terrorized them. And the state is pretending this is not its problem.' The survivors stress they do not oppose the hostage deal. 'We are not saying don’t release prisoners. But why is Attalah not being deported?' Barak asks. 'The government has the power to put him on a plane. Why are they forcing these women to relive their nightmare?' The silence from officials only deepens the wounds. Today, Hilla and other former guards have moved on with their lives. They are married, raising families, and building careers. But the trauma of what happened in the Gilboa Prison lingers, and with Attalah’s release looming, their sense of safety is shattered. 'If they are so sure he isn’t a threat, let them say so publicly,' Barak insisted. 'Let them answer: What will you say if, God forbid, one of these women is harmed?' Hilla’s voice raw with exhaustion and pain. 'I have fought enough. I just want to live without fear,' she said. 'Is that really too much to ask?'

Document reveals ‘real mastermind’ of Oct 7 and when invasion was...	A captured document shows that Mohammed Deif, head of Hamas’ military arm, sent detailed orders to 25 senior commanders. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The attack order for the October 7th invasion of Israel was issued two weeks earlier to 25 senior Hamas commanders, with nothing leaked of the detailed instructions to Israel's security apparatus, which remained certain that the terrorist organization was deterred, Channel 11 News reported Sunday. An operational document was found by IDF forces fighting in Gaza, said the report, which revealed that Mohammed Deif, head of Hamas’ military arm, the Izz Ad-Din al- Qassam Brigades, had sent the complete invasion plan, together with the most precise details, to his brigade and division heads, on September 23, which also noted the date of the invasion. The plan included instructions that were followed to the letter, from the initial massive rocket fire on southern and central Israel, to the use of drones to take out observation platforms and effectively blind the IDF forces to what was happening on the border, the flying of paragliders into Israel and the use of trucks and off-road vehicles to crash through the border fence in dozens of locations. They were given the names of the villages and IDF positions to attack, how to commit their forces, and what exactly they were to do. Deif also talked of 'three waves' of attackers on the Gaza envelope communities, the first being of the elite Nukhba forces, then a mix of elite and regular fighters, and lastly what he called 'civilian volunteers,' men and women who came to loot but also helped perpetrate the massacre itself of some 1,200 people, and the taking of 251 hostages in all. According to the report, this document showed that Deif was the real mastermind behind the complexities of the invasion, and not Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Even if Deif was in charge of the all the planning, however, Sinwar had to still give the green light for the invasion to be set in motion, and the IDF has never absolved him of this responsibility. The report pointed out that although so many people received this document, 'not an iota of it was leaked, not to the Shabak, not to 8200 (the army’s intelligence gathering group), and not to the research division of IDF Intelligence.' It has become known since the war began that there were some lonely voices in Intelligence warning of Hamas plans to attack Israel, that many female IDF observers on the border reported seeing the terrorists practicing takeovers of villages in the months and weeks prior, and that there were signals throughout the night before that something was about to happen, but little to nothing was done in response to prepare troops or even heighten alerts on the border. The fact is now acknowledged that the various heads of intelligence agencies, the army, and the political echelon, were all captives to the 'concept' that Hamas was deterred from fighting the IDF, and that it was only looking for ways to keep their citizens working in Israel to help their economy, as seen by speeches made in public by top Israeli officials even a few days before October 7.

Herzog meets Thailand’s foreign minister after 5 Thais held in Ga...	Herzog said that Israel’s objective is to complete the hostage deal fully and release all hostages, including in the second phase and beyond. By The Algemeiner President Isaac Herzog met Thailand’s Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa at the President’s Residence in Jerusalem on Sunday, following the release of five Thai foreign workers who were held in Gazan captivity for more than 480 days. Herzog stressed Israel’s commitment to the release of all hostages, including the Thai and other foreign nationals held in the Gaza Strip after their abduction on Octobe 7, 2023. 'They are our brothers,' Herzog said. 'Everywhere we went, in all the villages that we visited that were attacked on October 7, there were pictures and signs of the Thai workers along with the Israelis held in brutal captivity by Hamas in Gaza.' Herzog said that Israel’s objective is to complete the hostage deal fully and release all hostages, including in the second phase and beyond. Sangiampongsa thanked the President on behalf of the Thai government: 'To say how much we appreciate the collaboration and assistance that the Government of Israel extended to the Government of Thailand. I met the returned hostages yesterday. Physically they are doing well but we cannot know yet the damage caused by being held captive for over a year. They were held in tunnels, and we worry for their mental and physical well-being.' The close cooperation 'is an opportunity to promote a stronger link between our peoples, to radiate a message of love between our nations, and to greatly increase the cooperation between us, government to government, people to people,' he added.

Hezbollah’s Nasrallah to be buried in ‘grand procession’	On Sept. 27, the Israeli Air Force dropped at least a dozen 2,000-pound bunker-buster bombs on Nasrallah’s bunker in Beirut’s southern suburbs, killing the Hezbollah leader. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS The head of the Iranian-backed Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah said on Sunday that his predecessor, Hassan Nasrallah, will be buried on Feb. 23, nearly five months after he was killed in an Israeli airstrike. While 'security conditions' prevented a funeral during the war with Israel that ended with the Nov. 27 truce, the terror organization’s leadership has now decided to hold a 'grand procession' for its slain chief near the Beirut airport, Naim Qassem said in a televised speech. 'We hope that it will be a grand funeral procession befitting this great personality,' he stated in remarks translated by Agence France-Presse. A funeral for top Hezbollah terrorist Hashem Safieddine, who had been elected to succeed Nasrallah before he, too, was eliminated by Israel, is to be held on the same day. Safieddine will be buried with the same honors as Nasrallah because 'he was martyred on Oct. 3, a day or two before the announcement' of his new position, Qassem revealed. Nasrallah will be buried in the Beirut area 'in a plot of land we chose between the old and new airport roads,' while Safieddine will be buried in his hometown of Deir Qanoun al-Nahr in Lebanon’s south, he said. Qassem in his address acknowledged that Nasrallah was killed 'at a time when circumstances were difficult' for the terrorist organization, forcing it to conduct a temporary burial for him according to Shi’ite traditions. On Sept. 27, the Israeli Air Force dropped at least a dozen 2,000-pound bunker-buster bombs on Nasrallah’s bunker in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Two unnamed Israeli officials told The New York Times that more than 80 bombs were dropped over the span of several minutes during the strike, but did not confirm the type of munitions used. A week later, an IAF strike on a bunker in the Dahiyeh district killed Safieddine—a maternal cousin of Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah’s Executive Council and a leading candidate to replace the terror chief. Visiting Israel Defense Forces troops in Southern Lebanon on Sunday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a warning to the Iranian-backed terrorists: 'I suggest that the successor of Nasrallah’s successor not make a mistake about Israel’s determination, lest he pay a very heavy price.' According to Katz, Jerusalem will not allow a return to the situation that prevailed on the Israel-Lebanon border before the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist massacre. 'We will foil threats and respond with full force,' the defense minister said. The ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah took effect at 4 a.m. on Nov. 27, ending nearly 14 months of hostilities. Under the agreement with the Lebanese government, Israeli soldiers are to gradually withdraw from Southern Lebanon as the Lebanese Armed Forces and U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon assume responsibility for ensuring Hezbollah remains disarmed south of the Litani River.

This is Hamas’s ‘Shadow Unit’	Initially, the unit was composed of highly experienced terrorists, but over time, others were recruited, including members of the Hamas intelligence apparatus, its Nukhba force and other divisions. By Shachar Kleiman, JNS Amid the ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages by Hamas, new details emerged on Sunday regarding the terrorist group’s 'Shadow Unit,' which is responsible for holding Israeli captives in the Strip. Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat on Sunday published an extensive report on the unit, which Hamas sources told the outlet was created in 2006 following the abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. The unit’s existence was only revealed in 2016—five years after the deal for Shalit’s release—when footage from his captivity in Gaza was published. Terrorist sources told the Saudi paper that the unit was formed about three months after Shalit’s abduction, following a series of Israeli attacks on locations where he had been hidden. Initially, the unit was composed of highly experienced terrorists, but over time, others were recruited, including members of the Hamas intelligence apparatus, its Nukhba force and other divisions. According to the report, these operatives received intelligence and technological training. Hamas sources also stated that two of the group’s senior leaders (both of whom were killed by Israel during the war), Mohammed Deif and Yahya Sinwar, were behind the decision to establish the unit. They added that most of the unit’s original operatives were from the Khan Yunis area. Members of Hamas’s 'Shadow Unit' hand over Israeli hostages Ofer Kalderon and Yarden Bibas to the International Red Cross during a ceremony in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip. Feb. 1, 2025. Photo by Abed Rahim Khaatib/Flash90 According to the report, Shadow Unit operatives were also involved in launching rockets, digging tunnels and other tasks, as their primary role was not always needed. During the war, sources claimed that unit members received 'round-the-clock instructions' to move hostages from place to place, both above ground and through tunnels. Hostages were sometimes dressed in Arab women’s clothing to facilitate their movement, according to the report. Hamas sources also revealed that Israeli strikes on the terror group’s tunnel system forced operatives to transfer hostages from underground passageways to safe houses controlled by the Shadow Unit. Another reported method involved using vehicles to create a diversion while transferring hostages to different locations. Additionally, some hostages were moved between identical vehicles of the same make and color, with multiple cars departing simultaneously to confuse trackers. Meanwhile, following the public appearance of Hamas’s Shati Battalion commander Haitham al-Khujari on Saturday, Hamas sources told the Saudi outlet that he had survived three assassination attempts and was seriously wounded in one of them. However, they stated that he had since recovered.

Israeli high court questions security establishment’s refusal to ...	The law revokes their citizenship or residency but the agencies have illegally denied the political echelon the information it needs to carry it out, MK Amit Halevi says. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The High Court of Justice is hearing a petition Monday to force the state’s security agencies to provide information they are refusing to hand over to the Interior Minister, thereby blocking the lawful deportation of Israeli-Arab terrorists. Likud MK Amit Halevi filed the urgent brief because 69 terrorists who have been released so far in exchange for Hamas-held hostages hold blue Israeli identity cards, and 41 of them were allowed to return to their homes in places such as eastern Jerusalem. This right to expel such terrorists is granted to the state under a two-year-old law that allows the revocation of the citizenship or residency of a person who has received compensation for committing an act of terror. All Palestinian terrorists jailed by Israel are paid a monthly stipend by the Palestinian Authority, on a sliding scale depending on the seriousness of the crimes they committed. The law, which passed overwhelmingly with 94 votes, said that since these terrorists were paid by the PA, they have thereby declared their affiliation with it and should therefore be moved there upon their release from prison. Halevi is charging that the implementation of the law is being willfully thwarted by the security authorities, because they are not providing the political echelon with the data on the former prisoners that it needs, first and foremost how much they have been paid over the years. 'It is incomprehensible how the IDF refuses to hand over information during wartime in order to implement the law,' he said. A report in Maariv Friday stated that such a list of terrorists and the monies they receive is sitting in the offices of the Minister of Defense, the Shabak, and the IDF Intelligence Division, 'and yet&#8230;from the day the law was enacted until now, two years later, none of these bodies is willing to pass the list on to the Minister of the Interior.' In fact, the report said, each one of the branches is tossing the responsibility to pass on the list to one of the other bodies. The Attorney General’s office is representing the state against Halevi in this instance, and has demanded that the petition be rejected on the grounds that the information being requested is 'highly sensitive' and 'confidential,' and that 'the manner and timing of its use are very complex.' This reasoning was completely unacceptable to Halevi, who responded through his lawyer that the Interior Ministry has every right to information that will enable it to carry out the law and that it is 'illegal' for the security authorities 'to replace the discretion of the political echelon with their own discretion.' By its 'conscious' decision not to transfer the needed information, the defense establishment has 'dissolved [its] subordination&#8230;to the rule of law and the supremacy of the legislature,' he added. Halevi’s lawyer, David Peter, summarized the issue as 'whether there is authority not to give the information to the political echelon,' while commenting that 'There is not a single legal argument to hide the information.'

RFK grilled in Senate over claims of Jewish ‘immunity’ to COVID-1...	Colorado senator presses Trump's Health and Human services nominee on 2023 comments suggesting COVID-19 may have been engineered to specifically target some ethnic groups, while leaving others, including Ashkenazi Jews, more immune. By World Israel News Staff Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, faced questions last week in the U.S. Senate regarding past comments on the COVID-19 virus and its differential impact on various ethnic groups, including Ashkenazi Jews. During a confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Colorado Democrat Michael Bennet took aim at a number of Kennedy's positions and past comments on issues ranging from vaccines to AIDS to the coronavirus pandemic. Bennet, whose mother was a Holocaust survivor, questioned Kennedy over comments made during a Manhattan gathering in 2023, including claims that COVID-19's disparate impact on various ethnic groups - including its allegedly diminished impact on Ashkenazi Jews - may have been engineered. 'Did you say that Covid-19 was a genetically engineered bioweapon that targets black and white people and spares Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people,' Senator Bennet asked. Kennedy denied that he claimed the virus was 'deliberately targeted' at any ethnic group. 'I just quoted an NIH funded, an NIH published study.' The questioning hinged on Kennedy's phrasing of the comments during a private meeting. 'There is an argument that it is ethnically targeted. COVID-19 attacks certain races disproportionately,' Kennedy said at the time. 'COVID-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.' Citing a study published by BMC Medicine which showed greater susceptibility to COVID-19 among people with certain variants of the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, Kennedy said it was unclear 'whether it was deliberately targeted or not but there are papers out there that show the racial or ethnic differential and impact.' Days later, Kennedy rejected claims he had said COVID-19 was engineered specifically to 'spare Jews.' 'I have never, ever suggested that the COVID-19 virus was targeted to spare Jews,' Kennedy tweeted. 'I accurately pointed out&#8230;that a 2021 study of the COVID-19 virus shows that COVID-19 appears to disproportionately affect certain races since the furin cleave docking site is most compatible with Blacks and Caucasians and least compatible with ethnic Chinese, Finns, and Ashkenazi Jews.' 'In that sense, it serves as a kind of proof of concept for ethnically targeted bioweapons. I do not believe and never implied that the ethnic effect was deliberately engineered.' At the time, Morton Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America, defended Kennedy, saying that 'recent statements have been wrongly misinterpreted to falsely claim hostility to Jews. This has caused Bobby much pain.'

One seriously wounded in stabbing near Jerusalem	Police have launched an investigation and are searching for the suspect, who fled the scene. By JNS A 40-year-old man was seriously wounded in a stabbing in Abu Ghosh, near Jerusalem, on Monday morning. Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency teams provided initial medical treatment at the scene in the Arab-Israeli town, located six miles west of Jerusalem, before evacuating the victim to Jerusalem’s Shaare Zedek Hospital. Police have launched an investigation and are searching for the suspect, who fled the scene. The motivation behind the attack remains unclear. This is a developing story.

Trump hints at ‘progress’ in Mideast and ‘very big meetings’ ahea...	President Trump drops hints about 'very big meetings' and 'progress' in Middle East talks involving Israel, ahead of his planned meeting with Israel's prime minister. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump hinted at major developments in Middle East talks in the near future, ahead of his planned meeting with Israel's prime minister. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in Washington D.C. Sunday, a day before the Israeli delegation was scheduled to kickoff talks with U.S. officials on the implementation of the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal, and two days before Netanyahu's meeting with President Trump in the White House. Tuesday's meeting will be the first between the two leaders since Trump returned to office on January 20th. On Sunday night, Trump addressed reporters at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, saying that talks between Israel and other countries were 'progressing,' without providing details. The president also alluded to 'very big meetings,' in the near future. 'The discussions on the Middle East with Israel and various other countries are progressing. Bibi Netanyahu's coming on Tuesday, and I think we have some very big meetings scheduled,' Trump said. Netanyahu is expected to push for American backing to tweak the implementation of the second phase of the hostage deal with Hamas, softening terms which have been rejected by members of the Israeli government. The meeting between the president and the Israeli premier also comes against the backdrop of continuing efforts by Trump to secure third-party countries willing to receive large-scale emigration from the Gaza Strip. According to a report by Israel Hayom on Sunday, the Trump administration's plan for the removal of Hamas from the Gaza Strip and the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the coastal enclave hinges on the mass-evacuation of most of the area's population. In talks with reporters recently, Trump suggested 1.5 million Gazans could be relocated, amounting to two-thirds of the Strip's population. Reports have floated various possible third-party countries whom the Trump administration is said to have reached out to, including Indonesia and Albania, while Trump has discussed the possibility of Egypt and Jordan taking in large numbers of Gazans. Publicly, all four of the countries have rejected the plan.

Jordan to deport Palestinian terrorist involved in Sbarro bombing...	Ahlam Tamimi played a critical role in a suicide bombing that killed 16 civilians, including 8 children, but was freed from prison and deported to Jordan in the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange. By World Israel News Staff Jordan is reportedly seeking to deport a terrorist involved in one of the most notorious bombings of the Second Intifada, according to Arabic-language media reports. Hamas' Al-Aqsa TV and the Qatari Al-Araby Al-Jadeed media outlet reported on Sunday that Jordanian officials are planning to immediately deport Ahlam Tamimi. According to the reports, Jordanian intelligence informed Hamas that the terror group needs to find a country willing to accept Tamimi, or she will be extradited to the U.S. and face murder charges for her involvement in the 2001 Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing. Tamimi, a Palestinian with Jordanian citizenship who lived in a PA-controlled enclave of Judea and Samaria, played a critical role in deadly terror attack. She chose the restaurant as the target for the bombing, and drove the bomber, Izz al-Din Shuheil al-Masri, through a checkpoint from PA territory to the restaurant in Jerusalem. The bomber murdered 16 civilians, including two American citizens, one of whom was pregnant, and wounded 140 others. Tamimi was given 16 consecutive life sentence for her role in the attack, but was released from an Israeli prison in the 2011 Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange. After serving less than a decade behind bars, Tamimi was deported to Jordan, where she was received with a hero's welcome and became a popular media host. She has gained notoriety for her lack of remorse, openly stating that she 'regretted nothing' and would 'do it again today, and in the same manner.' In a chilling TV interview that went viral, Tamimi is seen smiling widely as a reporter tells her that eight children were killed in the blast. Since Tamimi's release and subsequent deportation to Jordan, Arnold Roth - whose American citizen daughter Malki was murdered in the attack - has urged for her to be extradited to the U.S. U.S. law allows for the prosecution of the murderers of American citizens, no matter where in the world the killing took place. Jordanian King Abdullah II is expected to meet with President Donald Trump in the White House later in February.

Will Jordan finally extradite Sbarro terrorist to the US?	Ahlam Tamimi played a critical role in a suicide bombing that killed 16 civilians, but was freed from prison and deported to Jordan in the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange.

‘Oct. 7th wasn’t worth it,’ says terrorist freed in hostage deal	Released terrorist says Palestinians paid 'too high a price' for the gains achieved by the October 7th terror onslaught. By World Israel News Staff A terrorist recently freed from an Israeli prison told Arabic-language media that the October 7th terror attack was a mistake, saying that the 'price was too high' for the Palestinian people. Mohammed a-Tus, a terrorist from Bethlehem affiliated with the Fatah party's military wing, told Emirati news outlet Al Mashhad Media that the Israeli response to the attack did not justify the gains achieved by the terror onslaught. According to an i24 report, a-Tus served nearly four decades in Israeli prison due to his planning of numerous deadly terror attacks against Israeli civilians. Speaking from Egypt, where he was deported last week, a-Tus said that he will 'tell my grandchildren not to carry out military actions against Israel. At this stage, we must focus on diplomatic actions rather than military ones.' When directly asked by the reporter if he supported the October 7th attack, as the abduction of Israelis during the onslaught eventually secured his release from prison, a-Tus said he did not, citing the death toll in Gaza following the outbreak of the war. 'The price is very high, we will not accept that the price of our liberation is a drop of a Palestinian child's blood,' a-Tus said. But despite being a member of the rival Fatah party and supposedly condemning terror, a-Tus praised the Hamas terror group, which planned and led the October 7th attack. 'Hamas members are brothers of the homeland, of the shared path and of the future,' a-Tus said. He added that terrorists must carefully weigh the severity of an Israeli response before launching future attacks on the Jewish State. 'Any leader who contemplates undertaking a major action must know the price to pay for what he wants to achieve and if the goal justifies the sacrifices,' he said.

Almost 20 years later, suspect charged for murder of IDF soldiers	Terrorist who participated in murder of two IDF soldiers in 2007 arrested by Israeli forces, nearly 20 years after slayings. By World Israel News Staff A Palestinian man was formally charged with murder by a military court last week, nearly two decades after participated in a terror attack that killed two Israeli army soldiers in Judea and Samaria. On December 28, 2007, three residents of Hebron - David Rubin, 21, Ahikam Amichai, 20, and Naama Ohayon - were hiking at the Nahal Telem stream. The trio were suddenly attacked by a group of armed terrorists in an SUV, who drove into the nature reserve with the intent of murdering Jewish hikers. Rubin and Amichai, off-duty IDF soldiers who had their services weapons with them, managed to kill one of the attackers and injure the other shooter. Tragically, both Rubin and Amichai were both fatally wounded in the attack. Ohayon, who was unarmed, hid during the incident and survived. She immediately called Israeli security forces, who set up a roadblock near the attack but were unable to capture the perpetrators. Some of the terrorists involved in the attack eventually turned themselves into the Palestinian Authority, which refused to extradite them to the Israeli authorities. It has never been clear whether all the gunmen and planners of the attack were held responsible for their involvement. Last Thursday, the IDF's military prosecution filed an indictment for murder against Ali Dandis, more than 17 years after the slayings occurred. In December 2024, Dandis was arrested by Israeli security forces, including Shin Bet operatives, in Bethlehem for his role in the 2007 murders. According to a Jerusalem Post summary of the indictment, Dandis both aided in both the attack's planning and execution. Prosecutors said that Dandis fired the shots that killed Rubin. Dandis, a member of the PA's ruling Fatah party, has worked in Sharia courts in the PA-controlled territory. One of his accomplices, Amar Taha, was a member of the Palestinian Security Forces.

Freed Hostage Ofer Kalderon was regularly beaten, kept in a cage ...	Hamas wanted to convince Kalderon 'that the world he knew no longer existed.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The family of freed hostage Ofer Kalderon (54) reported that he was regularly beaten, held in a cage, and mentally tortured and humiliated by his Hamas captors. His relative, Ido Dan, told Walla on Sunday, a day after his release, that Hamas wanted to convince Kalderon 'that the world he knew no longer existed. He was kept in a cage for a long time and had to wait for permission to shower or use the bathroom.' Additionally, Kalderon was regularly beaten and lost a significant amount of weight due to extreme malnutrition. Dan continued, 'He was lonelier than others, rarely exposed to television or radio. They didn't show him that there was a struggle for his release.' 'He didn’t see anything. He wasn’t aware of what was happening here&#8230; He only knew that there were demonstrations, but he asked questions as if he had never seen the news. There were relatives who fought for him and were interviewed frequently, and he asked what happened to them, if they even participated in the struggle.' However, Dan added that Ofer reported seeing his cousin Yifat Calderon demonstrating on Al-Jazeera. Despite all that Kalderon endured, his family reported that he is showing his characteristic humor and appears to be in good spirits. 'He talks a lot, and so far, we're surprised by his improved condition. We feared he would return broken. But he is very much the Ofer we knew—silly, full of humor, funny, and cynical. He makes everything feel light. It’s been an enormous relief.' However, Ido Dan discussed the toll his father’s extended captivity has taken on his children. 'The children haven't fully recovered yet. You can see the effect on their behavior and anxiety&#8230; They are not ordinary children. With his release, the relief they feel is indescribable.' Dan added, 'I don’t think he fully understands what the family went through during that time or the level of anxiety we experienced. Until a few days ago, we didn’t know if he was alive or dead. We only knew there was a high probability that he was alive.'

71% of Israelis oppose Palestinian state, even if it means forfei...	A majority of Israelis polled said they would reject Saudi normalization if it requires the establishment of a Palestinian State. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A poll by the Sovereignty Movement found that 71% of Israelis oppose the establishment of a Palestinian state, with many changing their position on the issue from 'for' to 'against' after October 7. According to the poll, 59% were against Palestinian statehood before the October 7 attacks and remain opposed. Twelve percent supported it before October 7 and have since shifted their position. Additionally, 25% supported a Palestinian state before the events of October 7 and still do, while only 4% changed from opposing it to supporting it after the Hamas assault on southern Israel. Although many Israelis support normalization with Saudi Arabia, the majority of those polled do not support it if it requires the establishment of a Palestinian state as a precondition. A total of 39% would favor normalization with Saudi Arabia if it required establishing a Palestinian state, and 8% expressed no opinion. After U.S. President Donald Trump proposed voluntary emigration for Gaza residents, 80% of those polled said they agreed with the proposal, 10% were against it, and 10% had no opinion. In July, the Knesset voted overwhelmingly in favor of a resolution rejecting Palestinian statehood in any form. The new resolution, passed by a majority of 68 to 9, includes a broader rejection of Palestinian statehood than a previous resolution. An earlier motion passed in February 2024 by an even broader majority of 99 to 11 won significant support from opposition lawmakers and rejected only unilateral recognition of Palestinian statehood. The July resolution, however, expressed the Knesset’s opposition to any arrangement for Palestinian statehood. 'The Israeli Knesset opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state on any land west of the Jordan River,' the resolution read. 'The existence of a Palestinian state in the heart of Israel would pose an existential threat to Israel and its citizens, further extend the Israel-Palestinian Arab conflict, and destabilize the entire region.' 'It will only be a matter of time before Hamas takes over such a Palestinian state, turning it into a base for radical Islamic terrorism, fully aligned with the Iranian regime that aims to eradicate the State of Israel.' 'Supporting Palestinian statehood would reward terrorism and encourage Hamas and its supporters. Israel’s enemies would see it as the victorious outcome of the massacre on October 7 and a precursor to the conquest of jihadist Islamism throughout the Middle East.'

Legal Forum for Israel files criminal complaint against J Street’...	The offense carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison. By Pesach Benson, TPS The Legal Forum for Israel filed a criminal complaint against U.S.-based advocacy group J Street and its executive director, Nadav Tamir on Sunday, accusing them of violating Israeli law by pushing for restrictions on American military aid to Israel during wartime. 'J Street’s activities, beyond being immoral, can cause actual harm to the State of Israel in its most sensitive situation in many years,' wrote attorneys Shai Mark and Yotam Eyal in their complaint. They argue that lobbying U.S. lawmakers to restrict military aid during an active conflict violates Israeli law. Specifically, the Legal Forum’s complaint alleges that lobbying efforts to convince U.S. lawmakers to limit military assistance constitute a criminal offense under Section 108 of Israel’s Penal Code. This law prohibits actions that endanger military supply lines during wartime. The offense carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison. The complaint specifically highlights the Washington-based J Street’s recent efforts regarding U.S. military support for Israel amid the ongoing war that began on October 7. While J Street Israel has not yet responded to the allegations, the organization defends its advocacy as promoting long-term peace and stability in the region. Tamir, J Street’s executive director, is a former Israeli consul general to New England and adviser to ex-Prime Minister Shimon Peres. While serving as consul general in Boston in 2009, a lengthy memo Tamir wrote criticizing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s policies toward the Obama administration was leaked. He was recalled to Jerusalem and reprimanded, but returned to his post in Boston. Israeli authorities will now review the complaint to determine if a criminal investigation is warranted. Shortly after Donald Trump’s inauguration, the White House lifted a Biden administration ban on 2,000-pound MK84 bombs. On Thursday, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration is also considering green-lighting the sale of 24,000 assault rifles to Israel which the Biden administration also suspended.

Over 50 terrorists killed in Jenin area as Israeli raids continue	According to the IDF, more than 100 wanted Palestinian terror suspects have been arrested, 40 weapons confiscated, and 80 explosives neutralized. By Pesach Benson, TPS More than 50 Palestinian terrorists have been killed since the army launched a counterterror operation in Jenin and northern Samaria nearly two weeks ago, the Israel Defense Forces said on Sunday. The number includes 35 gunmen killed by security forces in Jenin, Tulkarem, and Tamun, and another 15 killed in drone strikes. According to the IDF, more than 100 wanted Palestinian terror suspects have been arrested, 40 weapons confiscated, and 80 explosives neutralized. One of the strikes, in the village of Qabatiya on Saturday night, hit a vehicle carrying several terrorists on their way to carry out what the IDF said was an 'imminent terrorist attack.' Of the two terrorists killed, one was identified as Abd al-Hadi Kamil, who had been released from prison during a temporary ceasefire in November 2023. Aerial surveillance footage of the strike showed secondary explosions indicating the presence of explosives. The army’s Jenin raid, dubbed 'Operation Iron Wall,' launched on January 21, comes on the heels of the Palestinian Authority’s failed crackdown in the Jenin refugee camp. Raids expanded to Tulkarem. Security forces have arrested dozens of wanted Palestinian terrorists, seized weapons, and uncovered an bomb-making laboratory. Previous Israeli counterterror operations in 2023 and 2024 in the Jenin camp uncovered a tunnel shaft, a rocket launcher, large amounts of weapons and bomb-making laboratories. As of 2023, just over 24,000 registered refugees were living in the camp that Palestinians have dubbed 'The Martyr’s Capital.'

Israel grants released Thai hostages residency status	The Interior Ministry’s decision grants the former hostages the right to remain in the country and work if they wish to do so after an initial recovery period. By JNS Israeli Interior Minister Moshe Arbel has granted residency status to the five Thai hostages released from Hamas captivity in Gaza on Jan. 30, Hebrew media reported on Sunday. Thaenna Pongsak, Sathian Suwannakhan, Sriaoun Watchara, Saethao Bannawat and Rumnao Surasak were among 31 foreign workers from Thailand who were kidnapped by Hamas-led terrorists during the Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border assault on agricultural communities in Israel’s south. The five were handed over by Hamas to a team of the International Committee of the Red Cross on Jan. 30 as part of the ceasefire deal with Jerusalem, before being escorted back to the Jewish state by Israeli security forces. The Interior Ministry’s decision grants the former hostages the right to remain in the country and work if they wish to do so after an initial recovery period at Shamir Medical Center in Be’er Ya’akov, according to Kan News. On Sunday, Arbel met with Thai Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa, who traveled to Israel to meet with the citizens who were released from Gaza, according to the report. Arbel told Sangiampongsa that an Israeli delegation had left for Thailand to examine new ways of cooperation. Sangiampongsa also met with Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar on Sunday, Jerusalem’s top diplomat said. Sa’ar thanked Sangiampongsa 'for the close cooperation in securing their release from cruel captivity in Gaza' and said he told his Thai counterpart that 'both our nations were overjoyed last Thursday to see their freedom restored.' 'We will strengthen Israeli-Thai relations and I look forward to working closely together,' added Sa’ar. At least one living Thai hostage, Pinta Nattapong, 35, remains in Hamas captivity, alongside two Thai citizens who were murdered and whose bodies are being held by the terror group. Rintalak Suttisak, 43, and Sahaot Banawat, 30, were both killed and kidnapped from Kibbutz Be’eri on Oct. 7, 2023.

BBC refers to Israeli hostages as ‘prisoners’	The BBC issues apology after a news anchor referred to three Israeli men held captive by the Hamas terror organization for over a year as 'prisoners.' By World Israel News Staff The BBC issued an apology last Friday, after it referred to three Israeli captives taken hostage by Hamas terrorists during the invasion of October 7th as 'prisoners.' On Friday, Hamas identified the three men – two Israelis and one dual American-Israeli citizen – set to be freed on Saturday in exchange for the release of 90 jailed Palestinian terrorists, saying that 35-year-old Yarden Bibas, 54-year-old Ofer Kalderon, and 65-year-old Keith Siegel would be the next three captives returned to Israel as part of the ongoing hostage deal. Later that day, BBC News anchor Nicky Schiller called the three captives 'Israeli prisoners.' 'Confirmation in the last couple of hours, first from Hamas, that three Israeli prisoners, all men this time, will be released tomorrow and then we will see 90 Palestinian prisoners freed from Israeli jails,' Schiller said. Hours later, however, the broadcaster issued a correction and an apology for Schiller’s wording. 'Earlier today on BBC News we reported on the names of those three Israeli hostages who are due to be freed tomorrow,' the BBC said. 'At one point during the coverage we mistakenly called the hostages ‘prisoners’ and we would like to apologize.' Friday’s apology is the latest instance of the British news network walking backing reporting on the Israel-Hamas conflict. A month after the October 7th invasion, the BBC issued an apology after an anchor misquoted from a Reuters report, claiming that Israeli soldiers had targeted medical staff and Arabic speakers during a raid of a Gaza hospital used by Hamas forces for terrorist operations. In January 2024, the BBC apologized after a radio report a month earlier claimed IDF forces had carried out 'summary executions' of Gazans. Last May, the BBC apologized after one of its reporters incorrectly claimed on-air that Tel Aviv is the capital city of Israel. 'The events of the weekend, with the close military cooperation involved, have served to bring Washington and Tel Aviv closer together,' Gary O’Donoghue said on BBC Radio 4.

How the Saudis are sneaking into Phase II of the Hamas-Israel dea...	Both the Israeli and American leaders would like to see a broader agreement that would have normalized relations with Riyadh as the new end game. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News With American support, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to reshape the negotiations over Phase 2 of the hostage deal to turn it into a much broader agreement that would have normalized relations with Riyadh as the new end game, Haaretz reported Sunday. According to the Israeli daily, after Netanyahu meets U.S. President Donald Trump Tuesday in the White House, they will make a joint statement about developments on the Saudi-Israel track. It is as yet unknown whether the statement will be more symbolic than concrete, but Haaretz said that the president’s special Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, has been working on its contents while pointing out that Witkoff had just visited Riyadh last week. Netanyahu has already pushed off the start date for negotiating Phase 2, which was supposed to begin Monday in Qatar, to after his return from Washington. Walla cited senior Israeli officials as saying that the negotiations will not just focus as Phase 1 did on the return of hostages, just this time bargaining for the younger, living men still being held captive by Hamas, but on strategic issues like the removal of Hamas as the ruling entity in Gaza, and the end of the war. Throughout the 15 months of fighting in Gaza following the Hamas-led invasion of Israel on October 7, 2023, Saudi Arabia has made it clear that it will not progress towards ties with Israel unless the war ends and a viable vision for a Palestinian state is formulated. Riyadh has concentrated on some kind of reformed Palestinian Authority, not minding if Hamas is taken out of the picture. For his part, Netanyahu has repeatedly said the PA is just as much a terror-supporting entity that cannot take charge of Gaza. Another Netanyahu decision that points to changing the focus of negotiations was his announcement that Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer would be taking the lead as the talks will be on 'the day after,' and thus 'political and strategic.' The prime minister indicated that Dermer will mainly be talking with Witkoff rather than with Egyptian and Qatari negotiators, in an effort, said Walla, 'to reach a breakthrough in the ‘grand deal’ with Saudi Arabia.' The American envoy is expected to talk with Cairo and Doha after understandings are reached with the Israelis, and he or his team may fly in and out of the Arab capitals as a result of the talks as well. Before taking off for Washington Sunday, Netanyahu made clear that the broader issues were what he was interested in coming to agreement with Trump about, albeit without mentioning the name 'Saudi Arabia.' Saying that the decisions Israel had made during the war 'have already changed the face of the Middle East beyond recognition. I think that with joint and intensive work with President Trump we can change it even further, and for the good.' 'We can strengthen Israel’s security, we can further broaden the circle of peace, and can bring about a wonderful era we never dreamed of' before, he added. Meanwhile, most of the families of the hostages still in Hamas hands are insisting that Phase 2 should be implemented as is, having already been passed in a vote by the Israeli Cabinet.

Under pressure from his own gov’t, Netanyahu looks to enlist Trum...	Israel's finance minister presses Netanyahu to renegotiate hostag deal and to promote annexation plan for Judea and Samaria during meeting with President Trump. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is planning to enlist the Trump administration's assistance in altering the hostage deal, in a bid to make the agreement's second phase more palatable to Netanyahu's right-wing allies, Israeli media outlets reported Sunday morning. Netanyahu departed for Washington D.C. Sunday morning, ahead of his meeting with President Donald Trump, slated for Tuesday. The meeting will be the first between the two leaders since Trump took office last month. On Monday, the Israeli delegation will begin talks with the Trump administration for implementing the second stage of the three-stage ceasefire deal signed just days before President Joe Biden left office. Shortly before Netanyahu's departure, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who heads the Religious Zionist Party, issued a video statement calling on Netanyahu to use his meeting with the American president to promote plans to apply Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, to take military action against Iran's nuclear program, and to resume the fighting against Hamas. 'A great deal is at stake – the complete victory in Gaza, the destruction of Hamas and the return of all our hostages, strengthening our security on all borders – in Syria, Lebanon, and of course against the head of the octopus, the Iranian regime and the nuclear threat. This danger must be removed,' Smotrich said Sunday. 'We must strengthen our grip and sovereignty over the homeland in Judea and Samaria. We have such a small land – so, first, we must turn away from evil: we must not take Gaza and multiply the threat against us twentyfold right in the heart of our land. We must strengthen our hold and apply sovereignty in Judea and Samaria.' Smotrich, who had threatened to bolt from the government prior to the signing of the hostage deal, remained in the coalition while voting against the ceasefire. Continued pressure from Smotrich on Netanyahu to end the ceasefire after the six-week initial phase of the agreement has led to concern within the government that should Israel continue the truce beyond the first phase, and end the war as demanded by Hamas, the finance minister may leave the coalition, leaving it short of a majority. While Opposition parties have offered to ensure the government survives long enough to implement the entire hostage deal, Netanyahu has sought to retain Smotrich's support with vows to resume the war at some later date. According to a report by Walla Sunday morning, Netanyahu is hoping to secure sufficient changes to the deal to keep his government together - in part by enabling Israel to resume fighting against Hamas and avoid a permanent end to the war. The report claims that Netanyahu is hoping to alter the format for talks aimed at implementing the second phase of the ceasefire, including replacing brokered talks in Doha, Qatar between the Israeli and Hamas delegations with shuttle diplomacy led by Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. In addition, Israel is poised to replace Mossad chief David Barnea as chief negotiator with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a long-time confidant of Prime Minister Netanyahu. The change also reflects Netanyahu's desire to link further implementation of the ceasefire deal with a normalization agreement between Jerusalem and Riyadh - a separate diplomatic effort Dermer has long been involved with. Netanyahu is also reportedly hoping to extend the first phase of the ceasefire, or at the very least soften some of the terms of the second phase, including Israel's withdrawal from the strategically critical Philadelphi Corridor on the Gaza-Egypt border. Most importantly, however, the Israeli premier is looking to secure American support for a resumption of the war, with the goal of completely dismantling Hamas forces in the Gaza Strip.

Trump puts tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, spurring trade wa...	A new analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale laid out the possible damage to the U.S. economy, saying the average household would lose the equivalent of $1,170 in income from the taxes. By The Associated Press President Donald Trump on Saturday signed an order to impose stiff tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada and China, drawing swift retaliation and an undeniable sense of betrayal from the country's North American neighbors as a trade war erupted among the longtime allies. The Republican president posted on social media that the tariffs were necessary 'to protect Americans,' pressing the three nations to do more to curb the manufacture and export of illicit fentanyl and for Canada and Mexico to reduce illegal immigration into the U.S. The tariffs, if sustained, could cause inflation to significantly worsen, threatening the trust that many voters placed in Trump to lower the prices of groceries, gasoline, housing, autos and other goods as he promised. They also risked throwing the global economy and Trump’s political mandate into turmoil just two weeks into his second term. Trump declared an economic emergency in order to place duties of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada. Energy imported from Canada, including oil, natural gas and electricity, would be taxed at a 10% rate. Trump’s order includes a mechanism to escalate the rates charged by the U.S. against retaliation by the other countries, raising the specter of an even more severe economic disruption. 'The actions taken today by the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together,' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a somber tone as he announced that his country would put matching 25% tariffs on up to $155 billion in U.S. imports, including alcohol and fruit. He channeled the betrayal that many Canadians are feeling, reminding Americans that Canadian troops fought alongside them in Afghanistan and helped respond to myriad crises from wildfires in California to Hurricane Katrina. 'We were always there standing with you, grieving with you, the American people,' he said. Mexico’s president also ordered retaliatory tariffs. 'We categorically reject the White House’s slander that the Mexican government has alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any intention of meddling in our territory,' Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum wrote in a post on X while saying she had instructed her economy secretary to implement a response that includes retaliatory tariffs and other measures in defense of Mexico’s interests. 'If the United States government and its agencies wanted to address the serious fentanyl consumption in their country, they could fight the sale of drugs on the streets of their major cities, which they don’t do and the laundering of money that this illegal activity generates that has done so much harm to its population.' The premier of the Canadian province of British Columbia, David Eby, specifically called on residents to stop buying liquor from U.S. 'red' states and said it was removing American alcohol brands from government store shelves as a response to the tariffs. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the country's government 'firmly deplores and opposes this move and will take necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests.' China began regulating fentanyl-related drugs as a class of controlled substances in 2019 and conducted 'counternarcotics cooperation with the U.S.,' the ministry said, calling on the U.S. government to correct what it considers wrongful actions. The Ministry of Commerce in China said it would file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization for the 'wrongful practices of the U.S.' and take measures to safeguard its rights and interests. The tariffs will go into effect on Tuesday, setting up a showdown in North America that could potentially sabotage economic growth. A new analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale laid out the possible damage to the U.S. economy, saying the average household would lose the equivalent of $1,170 in income from the taxes. Economic growth would slow and inflation would worsen, and the situation could be even worse with retaliation from other countries. Democrats were quick to warn that any inflation going forward was the result of Trump’s actions. 'You’re worried about grocery prices. Don’s raising prices with his tariffs,' Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York wrote in a series of posts on X. 'You’re worried about tomato prices. Wait till Trump’s Mexico tariffs raise your tomato prices,' read another. 'You’re worried about car prices. Wait till Trump’s Canada tariffs raise your car prices,' read another. A senior U.S. administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity to brief reporters, said the lower rate on energy reflected a desire to minimize disruptive increases on the price of gasoline or utilities. That's a sign White House officials understand the gamble they're taking on inflation. Price spikes under former President Joe Biden led to voter frustration that helped return Trump to the White House. The order signed by Trump contained no mechanism for granting exceptions, the official said, a possible blow to homebuilders who rely on Canadian lumber as well as farmers, automakers and other industries. The official did not provide specific benchmarks that could be met to lift the new tariffs, saying only that the best measure would be fewer Americans dying from fentanyl addiction. The order would also allow for tariffs on Canadian imports of less than $800. Imports below that sum are currently able to cross into the United States without customs and duties. 'It doesn’t make much economic sense,’’ said William Reinsch, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former U.S. trade official. 'Historically, most of our tariffs on raw materials have been low because we want to get cheaper materials so our manufacturers will be competitive &#8230; Now, what’s he talking about? He’s talking about tariffs on raw materials. I don’t get the economics of it.’’ With the tariffs, Trump is honoring promises that are at the core of his economic and national security philosophy. But the announcement showed his seriousness around the issue as some Trump allies had played down the threat of higher import taxes as mere negotiating tactics. The president is preparing more import taxes in a sign that tariffs will be an ongoing part of his second term. On Friday, he mentioned imported computer chips, steel, oil and natural gas, as well as copper, pharmaceutical drugs and imports from the European Union — moves that could essentially pit the U.S. against much of the global economy. Trudeau warned of economic pain as the tariffs take effect and encouraged Canadians to 'choose Canadian products and services rather than American ones.' But he also voiced optimism in the enduring relationship between the two countries. 'It is going to have real consequences for people, for workers on both sides of our border. We don’t want to be here. We didn’t ask for this, but we will not back down in standing up both for Canadians and for the incredible successful relationship between Canada and the United States,' Trudeau said.

Hamas subjected captive Yarden Bibas to systematic psychological ...	The terrorists constantly jeered about the death of his wife and two young sons, whom he never saw again after being kidnapped. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Hamas terrorists psychologically tortured Yarden Bibas during the 484 days they held him hostage, constantly taunting him that his wife and two young sons had been killed in captivity, Hebrew-language media reported Saturday. Bibas was captured on October 7, 2023 in Kibbutz Nir Oz separately from his wife, Shiri, and children Ariel and Kfir, who were only four and nine months old respectively at the time, and he never saw them again. The video publicized by the terrorists of Shiri desperately clutching her two tots as they were being dragged away was one of the most infamous clips of the Hamas-led invasion in which they slaughtered 1,200 people and took 251 hostage. Nili Margalit, one of the hostages freed during a week-long ceasefire in late November 2023, said soon after her release that she had been with Bibas when the terrorists first told him they were dead. She said they immediately forced him to record a propaganda video in which he charged that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was at fault for not succeeding in getting their bodies repatriated to Israel. Israel has been demanding to receive confirmation of the mother’s and children’s fates since then, as yet to no avail. Bibas’ family alluded to his psychological distress when they asked the public to 'Please give him the space he needs for his body and soul to begin healing.' A Maariv analysis of Bibas’ body language upon his release Saturday said that his 'slumped shoulders' and 'frightened eyes' when forced to climb a stage in Khan Yunis to wave to a crowd of Gazans before being taken to a Red Cross vehicle, showed how deeply he was traumatized. It pointed out that even when he was safe on the Israeli side of the border, meeting IDF soldiers, 'his steps remained measured and cautious, his head bowed most of the time, and even when he looked up, the movement was slow and hesitant, from the bottom up - a movement that characterizes people under extreme fear, who have lost the ability to look straight ahead.' Bibas was also physically beaten by the terrorists, as was Ofer Calderon, who was held with him in small cages in the beginning of their captivity and was released with him at the end. They were starved, as was the third hostage freed Saturday, American-Israeli Keith Siegal, who spoke of having to eat whatever food was given to him to survive, including some meat on occasion, even though he was a vegetarian. Bibas and Calderon spent their captivity in Khan Yunis in southern Gaza. Bibas was moved many times, sometimes staying in people’s homes and sometimes in the tunnels that crisscrossed the entire city, the reports said. Siegal was also frequently moved around, but in Gaza City, and spent most of his captivity above ground and with other hostages, although he was also sometimes moved underground. According to their relatives, among other cruel psychological games the terrorists would play, the men were often told they were 'going home tomorrow,' and were given food only to have it snatched away by laughing guards before they could take a bite.

Israel secretly building buffer zones inside Lebanon and Gaza	Israel agreed to withdraw from southern Lebanon and partially from Gaza in ceasefire deals, but neither Lebanon nor Hamas seem likely to meet its conditions. By Andrew Tobin, The Washington Free Beacon Israel has been secretly building military outposts in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip as part of a plan to create buffer zones along its northern and southern borders. The construction has taken place at four or five strategic locations up to about two kilometers, or more than a mile, into southern Lebanon as well as at a number of points on Israel’s side of the de facto border but outside the security barrier. Dozens of outposts have also gone up as far as about one kilometer into northern and eastern Gaza. Israel's push to fortify the buffer zones, which has not been previously reported and was confirmed to the Washington Free Beacon by current and former Israeli officials and reserve soldiers, is based on an assumption that the U.S.-brokered ceasefire deals in Lebanon and Gaza are unlikely to endure. Israel believes the two zones—as well as a third one that the military openly maintains in southern Syria—are necessary to protect its border communities, which have been devastated by terrorism over the past 16 months of war. 'Israel's new doctrine is that we will not withdraw from these buffer zones unless someone else comes in who can credibly deal with the threat,' Amir Avivi, a former Israeli brigadier general turned influential military strategist, told the Free Beacon, referring to the Iran-backed terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah and the Islamist rebels who seized power in Syria last month. 'Hezbollah needs to be dismantled in Lebanon, Hamas needs to be out of Gaza, and Syria needs to be liberal and democratic. As long as these things don't happen, Israel is going to stay in the perimeter.' Israeli defense minister Israel Katz said on Tuesday that Israel will 'indefinitely' hold the buffer zone in Syria, which the military moved into after the fall of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s regime in December. 'The IDF will remain at the summit of the Hermon and the security zone indefinitely to ensure the security of the communities of the Golan Heights and the north, and all the residents of Israel,' Katz said during a visit to the Syrian side of Mount Hermon. Israel conditionally agreed to a complete withdrawal from southern Lebanon in a ceasefire deal with Lebanon in late November and at least a partial withdrawal from Gaza in a hostage-ceasefire deal with Hamas in January. But neither Lebanon nor Hamas appeared likely to meet Israel's conditions. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced last week that Israeli troops would not withdraw from southern Lebanon by the Sunday deadline because 'the ceasefire agreement has yet to be fully enforced by the Lebanese state,' which has committed to disarm Hezbollah. Lebanon agreed to extend the deadline until Feb. 18. Meanwhile, senior Hamas official Taher Nounou reiterated on Monday the group's intent to hold onto power in Gaza, something Netanyahu has repeatedly said Israel will not abide. Avivi, who has advised the Israeli government throughout the war, said defense minister Israel Katz told him about the construction of the buffer zone on both sides of the Lebanon border during a three-hour meeting on Tuesday. According to Avivi, Katz was 'unhappy' that the Lebanon ceasefire agreement does not allow for such a zone and the defense minster wants to renegotiate the terms of the deal. An Israeli legislative aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Free Beacon that outgoing Israeli military chief of staff Herzi Halevi said during confidential testimony before the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Tuesday that Israel was building four to five outposts in southern Lebanon. 'In addition to more fortifications, bases, and forces on our side of the border, there are also going to be IDF soldiers staying in Lebanon for the time being because of the understanding that Hezbollah will return to all those areas if the IDF isn't there,' the aide said, referring to the Israeli military by its initialism. 'I think it's pretty obvious to everyone that the Lebanese Army and the United Nations are unable or unwilling to prevent Hezbollah from reorganizing, regrouping, rearming, and resettling those areas.' According to the Knesset website, Halevi told the committee, 'There must not be a major threat close to the border, and this must be enforced very strongly.' An Israeli reservist in the 226th Paratroopers Brigade who asked not to be identified told the Free Beacon that he served from October to January in a newly built outpost north of the security barrier but inside Israel. He said he was aware of at least two other such outposts along the border’s western sector. The Israeli daily Maariv reported on Sunday that Israel had begun building a line of military outposts to protect each of Israel's northernmost communities, including between the border and the security barrier north of Kibbutz Misgav Am in the east. 'The IDF will build the outposts in such a way that the forces will have significant firepower that includes mortars, rocket launchers, and machine guns,' reported military correspondent Avi Ashkenazi. 'At the same time, each outpost will have the capability to observe deep into [Lebanon].' Hezi Nehama, a former Israeli colonel who led a battalion in Gaza during the war, told the Free Beacon that Israel has undertaken a similar project in Gaza, building more than 50 outposts and other fortifications, like tank ramparts and sniper posts, along the strip's northern and eastern borders. 'And they are working on new ones,' he said. Several current and former Israeli officials, including Avivi and Nehama, told the Free Beacon that whereas Israel wants to leave all of Lebanon as soon as possible, Gaza is a different matter. The buffer zones in the strip will have to become part of an Israeli military occupation, the Israelis said. 'I would say the chances are high that in the near future there will be no alternative to Israel enforcing security and preventing Hamas from reorganizing,' Yuli Edelstein, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and a member of the ruling Likud party, told the Free Beacon. 'It doesn’t mean that we are not searching for some other force to rule Gaza, but there are not too many volunteers. I guess Gaza doesn’t have a very good reputation in the Arab world.' According to Avivi, Katz is committed to resuming the war in Gaza once the ceasefire inevitably collapses. Avivi said Israeli leaders are also serious about encouraging emigration from Gaza, an idea that President Donald Trump has championed in recent days. But, Avivi added, much remained uncertain about the course of the war. He predicted that Netanyahu's meeting with Trump at the White House on Tuesday 'will answer a lot of questions.' Spokesmen for Netanyahu and Katz and spokeswomen for the Defense Ministry and the Israeli military declined to comment.

‘We will find you, we will kill you,’ Trump says after strike on ...	Our initial assessment is that multiple operatives were killed in the airstrikes and no civilians were harmed,' Pete Hegseth, the U.S. defense secretary stated. By JNS U.S. President Donald Trump stated on Saturday that he ordered 'precision' air strikes that morning in Somalia against the 'senior ISIS attack planner and other terrorists he recruited and led in Somalia.' The targets, who hid in caves, threatened the United States and its allies, according to the president. 'The strikes destroyed the caves they live in and killed many terrorists without, in any way, harming civilians,' he stated. 'Our military has targeted this ISIS attack planner for years, but Biden and his cronies wouldn’t act quickly enough to get the job done. I did,' Trump stated. 'The message to ISIS and all others who would attack Americans is that ‘we will find you, and we will kill you.'' Pete Hegseth, the U.S. defense secretary, stated that he coordinated with the Somali government, at Trump’s direction, and authorized U.S. Africa Command to 'conduct coordinated airstrikes today targeting ISIS-Somalia operatives in the Golis mountains.' 'Our initial assessment is that multiple operatives were killed in the airstrikes and no civilians were harmed,' Hegseth stated. 'This action further degrades ISIS’s ability to plot and conduct terrorist attacks threatening U.S. citizens, our partners and innocent civilians and sends a clear signal that the United States always stands ready to find and eliminate terrorists who threaten the United States and our allies,' he added. Mike Waltz, the U.S. national security adviser, stated that 'radical Islamic terrorists' are on notice. 'If you harm or plan to attack Americans, we will find you and we will deliver justice,' he said. The clean up of terrorist scum under @POTUS and @SecDef has begun.

‘Deplorable’: Anti-Zionist activists pour concrete into toilets a...	Numerous reports indicate the attack may be the premeditated result of planning sessions which took place many months ago at an event held by Alpha Delta Phi (ADP) — a literary society. By Dion J. Pierre, The Algemeiner Columbia University was a victim of infrastructural sabotage on Wednesday when an extremist anti-Zionist group flooded the toilets of an academic building with concrete to mark the anniversary of an alleged killing of a Palestinian child. 'Restroom facilities at the School of International and Public Affairs were vandalized with graffiti that included disturbing, personal attacks,' the university said in a statement issued after the attack. 'Acts of vandalism of university buildings and property and attempts to harass and intimidate members of our community are unacceptable and abhorrent and will not be tolerated at Columbia.' Stating that an investigation to identify the culprits — widely believed to be members of the anti-Israel group Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) — has been launched, the university continued, 'Our buildings and our classrooms are spaces for teaching and learning and we cannot permit them to be disrupted and defaced. We are acting swiftly to address this misconduct and will update the community as we have more information.' The targeted bathrooms are located on several floors of the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA), according to Keren Yarhi-Milo, dean of the school, who addressed the matter. She called the behavior 'deplorable, disruptive, and deeply unsettling, as our campus is a space we cherish for learning teaching, and working, and it will not be tolerated.' Numerous reports indicate the attack may be the premeditated result of planning sessions which took place many months ago at an event held by Alpha Delta Phi (ADP) — a literary society, according to the Washington Free Beacon. During the event, the Free Beacon reported, ADP distributed literature dedicated to 'aspiring revolutionaries' who wish to commit seditious and subversive acts. Additionally, a presentation was given in which complete instructions for the exact kind of attack which struck Columbia on Wednesday were shared with students. Columbia University told the Free Beacon that it has notified law enforcement of the event, saying, 'We immediately launched an investigation which is ongoing.' CUAD has proven to be one of the most disruptive pro-Hamas student groups in the country since last academic year, when Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre across southern Israel set off an explosion of anti-Zionist activity. In April, its members commandeered a section of campus and, after declaring it a 'liberated zone,' lit flares and chanted pro-Hamas and anti-American slogans, according to reports. When the New York City Police Department (NYPD) arrived to disperse the unauthorized gathering, hundreds of students reportedly amassed around them to prevent the restoration of order. 'Yes, we’re all Hamas, pig!' one protester was filmed screaming during the fracas, which saw some verbal skirmishes between pro-Zionist and anti-Zionist partisans. 'Long live Hamas!' said others who filmed themselves dancing and praising the al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of the Hamas terrorist organization. 'Kill another soldier!' they also shouted. In September, during the university’s convocation ceremony, CUAD distributed literature calling on students to join the Palestinian terrorist group’s movement to destroy Israel. 'This booklet is part of a coordinated and intentional effort to uphold the principles of the thawabit and the Palestinian resistance movement overall by transmitting the words of the resistance directly,' said a pamphlet distributed by CUAD, a Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) spinoff, to incoming freshmen. 'This material aims to build popular support for the Palestinian war of national liberation, a war which is waged through armed struggle.' Other sections of the pamphlet were explicitly Islamist, invoking the name of 'Allah, the most gracious' and referring to Hamas as the 'Islamic Resistance Movement.' Proclaiming, 'Glory to Gaza that gave hope to the oppressed, that humiliated the ‘invincible’ Zionist army,' it said its purpose was to build an army of Muslims worldwide. After almost two years of being accused of cravenly ignoring unlawful and discriminatory behavior, Columbia University has recently made steps towards holding lawbreakers accountable. Earlier this month, it banned from its campus multiple, and suspended another, masked individuals who disrupted an active class last week and proceeded to utter pro-Hamas statements while distributing antisemitic literature. The agitators had stormed into Professor Avi Shilon’s course, titled 'History of Modern Israel,' on the first day of classes of the new semester last Tuesday. Clad in keffiyehs, which were wrapped on their faces to conceal their identities, they read prepared remarks which described the course as 'Zionist and imperialist' and a 'normalization of genocide.' As part of their performance, which they appeared to film, they dropped flyers, one of which contained an illustration of a lifted boot preparing to trample a Star of David. Next to the drawing was a message that said, 'Crush Zionism.' Columbia University’s handling of campus antisemitism and political extremism will continue to be scrutinized, as it is now legally bound, via civil settlement, to protect the civil rights of Jewish students. In June 2024, it settled a lawsuit in which it was accused by a student of neglecting its obligation to foster a safe learning environment amid riotous pro-Hamas protests that were held at the school throughout the final weeks of the academic year. The resolution of the case called for Columbia to hire a 'Safe Passage Liaison' who will monitor protests and 'walking escorts' who will accompany students whose safety is threatened around the campus. Other details of the settlement include 'accommodations' for students whose academic lives are disrupted by protests and new security policies for controlling access to school property.

Arab countries reject Trump’s Gaza relocation plan	The move could 'threaten the region’s stability, risk expanding the conflict, and undermine prospects for peace and coexistence among its peoples,' the statement said. By JNS Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority published a joint statement on Saturday rejecting U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to relocate Gazans to Egypt and Jordan. The foreign ministers of those countries and Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates published the statement following a summit meeting in Cairo, according to the Associated Press. The statement also represents the official position of the Arab League, a regional organization with 22 member states, the document said. 'We affirm our rejection of [any attempts] to compromise Palestinians’ unalienable rights, whether through settlement activities, or evictions or [annexations] of land or through vacating the land from its owners … in any form or under any circumstances or justifications,' the statement read. The move could 'threaten the region’s stability, risk expanding the conflict, and undermine prospects for peace and coexistence among its peoples,' the text continued. Last week, Trump said he had asked Jordan’s King Abdullah II to take in more Palestinians from Gaza, where entire neighborhoods have been destroyed during the 15 months of fighting between Hamas and Israel. 'I said to him that I’d love you to take on more, because I’m looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now and it’s a mess, it’s a real mess,' he told reporters aboard Air Force One. 'It’s literally a demolition site right now. Almost everything’s demolished, and people are dying there, so I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing in a different location where I think they could maybe live in peace for a change,' he continued. He added that he had also asked Egypt to take in Gazans. The proposal was immediately rejected by Egypt and Jordan, with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi saying: 'Our refusal of displacement is a steadfast position that will not change. Jordan is for Jordanians, and Palestine is for Palestinians.' Palestinians currently account for more than 70% of the population of Jordan, which is ruled by the Hashemite royal house, whose origins are in the Arabian Peninsula.

Resentment up, trust down between Israeli Jews and Arabs during G...	New survey finds vast majority of Jews do not trust Arab-Israelis, while roughly half of Arab citizens of Israel do not trust Jews, amid decline in trust and rise in perceived resentment between the two communities. By World Israel News Staff The vast majority of Israeli Jews do not trust Arab Israelis, a new poll has found, with key indicators of trust and social cohesion down significantly during the conflicts with Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The poll was conducted by the Midgam polling institute, and published Sunday morning by Israel's national broadcaster, Kan. According to the survey 72% of Israeli Jews say they do not trust Arab Israelis, with 43% of Arab Israelis responding similarly regarding Israeli Jews. That marks a decline not only from the pre-October 7th levels of trust, but signals a continued fall over the past year. Another poll by Midgam, released in January, 2024, in the midst of both the wars in Lebanon and Gaza, 63% of Israeli Jews said they did not trust Arab Israelis, compared to 34% who said they did. Roughly half of Israeli Jews in Sunday's poll say they have sensed greater hostility from Arab Israelis recently, along with 40% of Arab Israelis who said they felt a similar increase in hostility from Jews. Nearly half (45%) of Israeli Jews said they are unwilling to have any level of friendship with Arab Israelis, compared to 13% of Arabs who said they would not be willing to have Jewish friends. Only 30% of Israeli Jews said they would be willing to study with Arabs or have their loved ones study with Arabs, compared to 60% of Arabs who said they would be willing to study with Jews. Two-thirds of Israeli Jews said they would oppose the inclusion of Arab political parties in the Israeli government.

Who are the terrorists released by Israel on Saturday?	Terrorist who planned bus bombing that killed 17 people is freed to Palestinian Authority-controlled enclave in Judea and Samaria. By World Israel News Staff Three Israeli hostages held in the Strip for more than 15 months were freed by the Hamas terror group on Saturday, in exchange for the release of 183 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli detention facilities. Keith Siegel, Ofer Calderon, and Yarden Bibas were returned to Israel, reuniting with their families and receiving medical care at local hospitals. Hours later, Israel deported some 150 prisoners, who had been serving life sentences or decades-long sentences for terror, to the Gaza Strip. All but seven of the men sent to the coastal enclave are originally from the territory. 32 prisoners were released to Palestinian Authority-controlled areas in Judea and Samaria. One man, an Egyptian national, was deported to Egypt. Among the released were several terrorists responsible for the murders of dozens of civilians during the Second Intifada. Those freed included Shadi Amori, the mastermind behind the 2002 Megiddo Junction bus bombing, which killed 17 people. Another terrorist who was released is Ahmed Aslam, a Fatah terrorist, shot married couple Avi and Avital Wolanski to death in 2002. The couple's three-year-old child was wounded in the attack. Ashraf Abu Sror, who fatally shot IDF soldier Shahar Vekret near Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem in 2000, was also freed. Since the beginning of the ceasefire in mid-January, Israel has released 583 Palestinian terrorists. If phase one of the ceasefire continues until its completion, Israel will have released nearly 2,000 prisoners in exchange for 33 living and deceased hostages. Former Israeli Navy commander Maj.-Gen. Eliezer 'Chayni' Marom recently told Hebrew-language media that he believed the government is not being transparent with the Israeli public about the true cost of the deal. 'What’s in this agreement that we haven’t been told? Hamas is acting like they got far more than what’s been made public, and that deeply concerns me,' he told Radio103FM. Marom admitted that he had not been party to the negotiations, but said he is suspicious that the agreement may include a concession allowing Hamas to remain in power.

Departing Israel for his first meeting with President Trump since inauguration day, Prime Minister Netanyahu hints the two will 'redraw' the map of the Middle East. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu departed from Ben Gurion International Airport in central Israel Sunday morning for Washington D.C., ahead of a planned meeting with President Donald Trump. The two leaders are reportedly slated to meet in the White House on Tuesday, marking the first meeting between Netanyahu and Trump since the latter returned to office on January 20th. Moments before boarding his flight, Netanyahu spoke with reporters, noting that his meeting with the president this week will be Trump’s first since inauguration day. 'I’m leaving for a very important meeting with President Trump in Washington,' Netanyahu said. 'The fact that this would be President Trump’s first meeting with a foreign leader since his inauguration is telling. I think it’s a testimony to the strength of the Israeli-American alliance. It’s also a testimony to the strength of our personal friendship.' Netanyahu expressed optimism that the new administration will succeed in expanding the Abraham Accords, and that working together, the Israeli government and the Trump White House will manage to ‘redraw’ the map of the Middle East. 'That friendship and that cooperation has already yielded important results for Israel and the Middle East, including the historic Abraham Accords that President Trump led and which brought four historic peace treaties between Israel and its Arab neighbors.' 'The decisions we made in the war have already changed the face of the Middle East. Our decisions and the courage of our soldiers have redrawn the map. But I believe that working closely with President Trump, we can redraw it even further and for the better.' Regarding the Iranian regime and its proxies, including Hamas, Netanyahu vowed a policy of 'peace through strength,' as ceasefires in Lebanon and Gaza continue to hold. 'In this meeting we’ll deal with important issues, critical issues facing Israel and our region: Victory over Hamas, achieving the release of all our hostages and dealing with the Iranian terror axis in all its components – an axis that threatens the peace of Israel, the Middle East and the entire world. ' 'I believe that we can strengthen security, broaden the circle of peace and achieve a remarkable era of peace through strength.'

Hamas: ‘We’re ready to continue war against Israel’	Hamas is 'fully prepared to continue the struggle' against the Jewish State, says terror group's media advisor. By World Israel News Staff A senior Hamas official told Arabic-language media that while the terror group is supposedly respecting the terms of the ceasefire, it is 'fully prepared' to resume hostilities against the Jewish State. Hamas media advisor Taher al-Nunu told media outlet Mubasher, an affiliate of Al Jazeera, that Hamas' grip on power in the Strip has not been compromised by the some 15 months of fighting with Israel. Al-Nunu pointed to Saturday's release of Palestinian security prisoners from Israeli detention facilities to the Strip, which saw the convicted terrorists received by Gazans with great fanfare, as proof that Hamas is a unifying force for Palestinians. 'The scenes of the prisoners’ handover prove that the popular front is rallying around the resistance,' al-Nunu said. The embrace of the freed prisoners by the Gazan public underscores that despite the hardships of the conflict, Palestinians are not afraid of continuing the war, al-Nunu claimed. Videos of Gazan civilians congratulating and hugging released prisoners 'send a message to those who imagine they can continue the war' that Hamas is 'fully prepared to continue the struggle' against the Jewish State, he said. At the same time, al-Nunu stressed that the terror group is 'ready and prepared' to begin negotiations for phase two of the ceasefire agreement, which are set to begin on Sunday, the 16th day of the ceasefire. Al-Nunu then poured cold water on international claims that Hamas would not govern the post-war Strip. He said that the Palestinian Authority and its ruling party, Fatah, had rejected a proposal to co-govern Gaza, alongside Hamas. Despite al-Nunu's bluster about the resumption of the war, Hamas has signaled that it is interested in ensuring that ceasefire continues through the second phase. Hamas has promised the family of arch-terrorist Marwan Barghouti that he will be freed during a later stage of the truce.

Defense Minister to released intifada terrorist: ‘One mistake and...	Zubeidi, commander of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and responsible for terror attacks during the Second Intifada, was released on January 30 as part of a hostage-for-prisoners deal. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Saturday night, Defense Minister Israel Katz had a message for released terrorist Zakaria Zubeidi: 'One mistake and you'll join your old friends.' Zubeidi, commander of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and responsible for terror attacks during the Second Intifada, was released on January 30 as part of a hostage-for-prisoners deal. After his release, he was seen on Friday walking around Ramallah to cheering crowds, encouraging them to continue terror attacks against Israel. The Defense Minister wrote a public message to Zubeidi on X: 'You were released in a deal to secure the release of Israeli hostages. One mistake, and you'll join your old friends. We will not accept support for terror.' The terrorist, who planned the 2002 attack on the Likud office in Beit She'an that killed six people, told the crowd, 'It's time for our Palestinian nation to achieve its freedom and the independent state it wishes for, with Jerusalem as its capital.' Zubeidi, a member of the Fatah party in Jenin, escaped from prison in September 2021 before being recaptured. A number of the 735 Palestinian prisoners to be released in exchange for 33 hostages in the first phase of the agreement have committed deadly crimes, killing hundreds of Israelis. Majdi Za’tari, from East Jerusalem, was sentenced to 23 life sentences and an additional 50 years in prison. He was convicted of orchestrating a suicide bombing on a bus in Jerusalem in August 2003, which resulted in the deaths of 23 people. Ahmed Barghouti, commander of the Fatah military wing in the Ramallah area, is serving 13 life sentences. He was convicted of carrying out a series of suicide attacks during the Second Intifada, leading to the deaths of 12 Israelis. Notably, his actions included the attack on the 'Seafood Market' restaurant in Tel Aviv, as well as bombings in Neve Ya’akov and Jaffa Street in Jerusalem. Thabet Mardawi, a high-ranking member of Islamic Jihad, was responsible for the deaths of 21 Israelis and the injuries of nearly 200 during the Second Intifada. He orchestrated a series of deadly attacks, including a suicide bombing at Kibbutz Shluhot, a shooting spree at a market in Hadera, an assault near Camp 80, and a bus bombing at Moza Junction.

Eyal Zamir to become IDF’s 24th chief of staff on March 6	Zamir, 59, the current director general of the Defense Ministry, will be the first IDF chief who started his career in the Armored Corps since David (Dado) Elazar in the 1970s. By JNS Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir has been designated to replace Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi as the Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz announced on Saturday night. Zamir, 59, the current director general of the Defense Ministry, will be the first IDF chief who started his career in the Armored Corps since David (Dado) Elazar in the 1970s. Zamir previously served as deputy chief of staff (2018 to 2021), and before that, he led the Southern Command from 2015 to 2018. During that time, he helped formulate war plans focused on Hamas and contemplated scenarios in which the terrorist faction might be replaced in Gaza, though subsequent Southern Command leaders did not properly update these plans. While at the helm of the Defense Ministry, Zamir has spearheaded efforts over the past year to greatly ramp up domestic weapons production to reduce reliance on imports, working with local defense companies to do this. Zamir will replacing Halevi, who said he will step down on March 6.

Netanyahu to returnees: ‘How good to see you home’	Earlier this week, in the previous phase, we made it very clear that we would not tolerate any violation of the agreement. We insisted on this and we brought forward by a week the release of three of our hostages.' By JNS Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday sent a welcoming message to Yarden Bibas, Ofer Kalderon and Keith Siegal, who were freed earlier in the day from captivity in the Gaza Strip, stressing Israel’s commitment to bring all remaining hostages home and achieve the goals of the war. 'Ofer, Yarden, Keith—It is so good to see you home! Together with all citizens of Israel, and together with many around the world, my wife and I were so moved to see you with us,' Netanyahu said in a recorded statement. 'Earlier this week, in the previous phase, we made it very clear that we would not tolerate any violation of the agreement. We insisted on this and we brought forward by a week the release of three of our hostages,' the premier continued, referring to returnees Agam Berger, 20, Arbel Yehud, 29, and Gadi Mozes, 80. Netanyahu further emphasized Jerusalem’s demand of Hamas to allow the safe release of the hostages, 'after the scenes that we all saw the day before yesterday [when Yehud was surrounded by a threatening Gazan mob], we demanded a safe exit for our hostages in the coming releases. 'As you saw today, this steadfast stand proved itself. The message was delivered, received and carried out. Israel expects that all of the coming phases also be carried out safely,' he said. 'Citizens of Israel, in the last two weeks, we have succeeded in releasing 13 of our hostages, and five Thai nationals who were also held by Hamas,' the prime minister continued. 'At this time our thoughts are all with Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas, and all of our hostages, the living and the deceased, who have yet to return home. 'We will continue to take determined action to bring them back home, and achieve all of our objectives for the war. With God’s help, we will do it and we will succeed,' Netanyahu said. Of the 251 hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, 175 have been returned or rescued, and Hamas is believed to be holding 35 bodies, 34 of them taken during the cross-border invasion and that of IDF Lt. Hadar Goldin, which was taken by the Palestinian terrorist group in 2014.

Iranian FM warns US against attack on nuclear sites	Previously, Araqchi said that he does not believe that the United States or Israel will attack Tehran’s nuclear facilities, calling the idea 'really crazy.' By JNS An attack on the Islamic Republic’s nuclear facilities will lead to 'all-out war in the region,' Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told Al Jazeera in an interview broadcast on Friday. The minister issued a warning to Washington, saying that if it launches an attack with Israel against the nuclear sites, it would be 'one of the biggest historical mistakes the U.S. could make.' According to Reuters, the decision makers in Tehran fear that the Trump administration will 'empower' Jerusalem to strike Iran’s nuclear sites—many deep underground—coupled with further tightening of U.S. sanctions on the Islamic Republic’s oil industry. Reuters added that these concerns, coming against the backdrop of dire economic conditions angering the Iranian public, could prompt the mullahs to enter into talks with Washington over its advanced nuclear program. Iran’s foreign minister said that unblocking Iranian financial assets could serve as a bridge for future negotiations with the U.S. 'Iranian assets and funds have been frozen at various points by the U.S., [which] has not fulfilled its previous pledges [to free them]. These things can be done by the U.S. administration in order to bring confidence between us,' Araqchi was quoted as saying. He made similar remarks in an interview with Sky News Arabia on Tuesday. Araqchi said that he does not believe that the United States or Israel will attack Tehran’s nuclear facilities, calling the idea 'really crazy.' Speaking to the broadcaster, a joint venture of the U.K.-based Sky Group and the United Arab Emirates-based International Media Investments (IMI) corporation, he said, 'This is not a new threat. And they know that this is not a real threat. They know our capabilities to respond, and we have made it clear that any attack to our nuclear facilities would be faced with an immediate and decisive response.' Araqchi continued: 'I don’t think that they will do that crazy thing. This is really crazy,' adding that a strike inside the Islamic Republic would immediately turn the entire region into 'a very bad disaster.' U.S. President Donald Trump said on Jan. 23 he hoped that Israel would not attack Iran’s nuclear faculties, but he appeared to suggest that this was a possibility if the Islamic Republic does not accept a deal on its program. 'We’ll have to see. I’m going to be meeting with various people over the next couple of days. Hopefully, that can be worked out without having to worry about it,' Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the possibility of an Israeli strike. 'It would really be nice if that could be worked out without having to go that further step. Hopefully, that can be worked out. Iran hopefully will make a deal, and if they don’t make a deal, I guess that’s OK too,' he said. During his first term in 2018, Trump pulled the United States out of the 2015 JCPOA nuclear agreement with Iran and stepped up sanctions on the regime in Tehran. The deal offered Iran sanctions relief in exchange for its promise to dial back its nuclear program for a maximum of 10 years.

Israel prison service issues ominous wristbands to released priso...	Each band also carries a strong message in Hebrew and Arabic: 'The eternal nation does not forget.' By Jewish Breaking News As part of the hostage deal, Israel has been forced to release a large number of Gazan prisoners, many of whom are convicted terrorists, in exchange for a significantly smaller number of innocent Israeli hostages held by Hamas. The disparity in numbers has drawn criticism, as many of those freed by Israel have previously carried out deadly attacks. In an effort to send a clear warning, the Israel Prison Service (IPS) has been issuing wristbands to each freed prisoner, labeled with their name and identification number. Each band also carries a strong message in Hebrew and Arabic: 'The eternal nation does not forget.' This phrase serves as a reminder that their crimes have not been erased. Additionally, the bands include a biblical verse from Psalms 'I will pursue my enemies and overtake them.' The message is clear—if these individuals return to terrorism, they will face consequences. To reinforce this warning, banners bearing the same inscriptions were placed at prisons and crossing points where the terrorists were released. While the hostage deal has ensured the return of some Israeli captives, the release of dozens of convicted terrorists—some with blood on their hands—has left Israel on high alert. Security forces remain on guard, aware that many of these individuals could attempt to rejoin terrorist activities, putting Israeli civilians at risk once again.

Deni Avdija, the NBA’s only Israeli, is making a mark on the Port...	Avdija has also been heralded for his defense — which doesn’t dominate highlight reels or stat sheets in the same way as offense — and for his increasingly vocal leadership with his new team. By Jacob Gurvis, JTA An Israeli dominates in Portland. When Israeli NBA player Deni Avdija was traded from the Washington Wizards to the Portland Trail Blazers before this season, his prospects for NBA greatness didn’t exactly improve: the Wizards were 15-67 last season, in second-to-last place in the Eastern Conference, while the Trail Blazers were 21-61, worst in the Western Conference. And Avdija went from starting 75 games last season (out of 82) to playing roughly half of his games this season off the bench. With the exception of points per game — an increase of 0.1 — his major stats are all down this season. So why are we writing about the 24-year-old forward from the small Israeli community of Beit Zera? Because on Tuesday, Avdija dropped 30 points with nine rebounds as the Trail Blazers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 125-112. It’s the 16th 30+ point game of Avdija’s NBA career and his first this season. Trail Blazers coach and former NBA great Chauncey Billups called the performance Avdija’s 'best game' with Portland, according to OregonLive. 'I’ll give it to him if he thinks that,' Avdija said. 'I believe him. I feel like I just try to help the team every game. But I don’t know why today made it like, my best performance, but I’ll go with it.' Avdija’s current hot streak began Jan. 19, after he had missed three straight games. In the seven games since — six of which Portland has won — he’s averaging 19.4 points, 7.7 rebounds and 4.6 assists per game. Two days before his 30-point game, he dropped 28 points against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Avdija has also been heralded for his defense — which doesn’t dominate highlight reels or stat sheets in the same way as offense — and for his increasingly vocal leadership with his new team. His teammates have noticed. 'He’s always willing to listen to what everybody has to say, whether it’s good or bad, coaches or even players,' teammate Anfernee Simons told OregonLive. 'His ability to just adapt to what’s going on. Me and him have been having constant communication on what to look for.'

Ex- hostage Keith Siegel during release discovered his son was al...	During his captivity, Keith Siegel feared his son had been killed during the Hamas invasion. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News After fearing the worst during 484 days of captivity, freed hostage Keith Siegel came home on Saturday to discover he was alive. Siegel and his wife, Aviva, were kidnapped from Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7th, forced into their own car by terrorists, and driven to Gaza. During his captivity, Keith Siegel feared his son had been killed during the Hamas invasion. The couple had settled in Kfar Aza forty years ago, where they raised their four children and welcomed five grandchildren. Aviva was freed in November 2023 and tirelessly advocated for her husband's release, as well as the release of the other hostages. Aviva recounted moments of pure terror when she and Keith feared they wouldn’t make it out alive. 'I prayed that I would die first, so I wouldn't have to watch Keith die in front of me,' she shared in an interview with KAN. 'Every day felt like a battle to survive. There was no air, no light. We were trapped, buried alive.' She also recalled in an interview, 'During the 51 days I was there, we were moved between 13 different locations, both above and below ground. At one point, we were placed in a tunnel with no air. We couldn’t talk, and we could barely breathe.' Aviva Siegel also advocated on behalf of the female hostages and confirmed that Hamas was sexually harassing and assaulting a number of them. She spoke emotionally in an address, saying, 'These girls were transformed into puppets for their captors. They were dressed in tight clothing and forced to endure humiliations no one should ever have to face. We must never forget them.' Upon Keith's release on Saturday, Aviva said to Channel 12, 'I am beyond grateful that Keith is back. But our fight isn’t over. Too many are still out there, living in darkness and enduring the unimaginable. We must bring them all home.'

Netanyahu to meet twice with President Trump on Tuesday	The two leaders are likely to discuss the hostage release deal and the likelihood of the Gaza ceasefire lasting beyond six weeks. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump are expected to meet twice on Tuesday. A working meeting is scheduled for noon and later that evening the world leaders will have a casual dinner along with their spouses White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed at a press conference on Friday. Early last week, Trump extended to Netanyahu and invitation to the White House. On the announcement, the Republican Jewish Coalition said, 'The most pro-Israel president picking up right where he left off: making the U.S.-Israel relationship great again.' The Prime Minister’s Office reported that Netanyahu is the first world leader Trump has invited to the White House in his second term. An image of a letter, reportedly an invitation from Trump to Netanyahu, began circulating on social media. Dated January 28 and signed by Trump, the letter reads: 'I would like to formally invite you to the White House next week.' It continues, 'I look forward to discussing how we can bring peace to Israel and its neighbors, as well as efforts to counter our shared adversaries.' The letter concludes with, 'It will be my honor to host you as my first foreign leader during my second term.' The meeting comes several weeks after Trump’s inauguration and the beginning of the hostage release deal and Gaza ceasefire The two leaders are likely to discuss the hostage release deal and the likelihood of extended the Gaza ceasefire beyond six weeks. Trump and Netanyahu will also deal with issues concerning Iran and the ceasefire in Lebanon. Trump’s Middle East advisor Steve Witkoff was in Israel last week and met with Netanyahu. Witkoff toured the Netzarim corridor with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer. On Thursday, Witkoff met with the families of hostages and said, 'President Trump sends his best blessings. I just want you to know that the people of the United States are with you.'

Yarden Bibas, Ofer Kalderon, Keith Siegel redeemed after 484 days...	In exchange, Jerusalem on Saturday was set to free 183 Palestinian terrorists—18 serving life sentence, 54 serving lengthy terms and 111 arrested since Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre. By JNS Yarden Bibas, Ofer Kalderon and Keith Siegel were freed on Saturday after 484 days in Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian terrorists handed over Bibas and Kalderon to the Red Cross in Khan Yunis, in the Strip’s south, while Siegel was released in Gaza City. 'The government of Israel is committed to returning all of the hostages and the missing,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement issued by his office. The statement concluded with a quote from the Bible: 'I will save you from the hands of the wicked and deliver you from the grasp of the cruel' (Jeremiah 15:21). The Hostage and Missing Families Forum issued a statement saying: 'Their release today brings a ray of light in the darkness, offering hope and demonstrating the triumph of the human spirit. Yet their return also reminds us that 79 hostages remain in Gaza, still waiting to be saved. We will not rest until every phase of this deal is completed and every hostage is returned—the living to reunite with their loved ones, and the deceased for proper burial with dignity​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​.' In exchange, Jerusalem on Saturday was set to free 183 Palestinian terrorists—18 serving life sentence, 54 serving lengthy terms and 111 arrested since Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre.

Bibas’s wife, Shiri, 33, and their two sons, Ariel, 5, and Kfir, 2, are on the list of the 33 hostages to be released in the first phase of the ceasefire agreement. Hamas, however, has claimed that Shiri and the children have been killed. Kalderon, 54, a dual Israeli-French citizen, was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7, 2023, along with his son Erez, 12, and daughter, Sahar, 16. The children were among the 105 captives freed in November 2023 as part of a ceasefire-for-terrorists agreement. Freed hostage Ofer Kalderon meets IDF troops, Feb. 1, 2025.

His wife, Aviva, was among those who returned as part of the November 2023 swap with Hamas. On Thursday, three Israelis—IDF soldier Agam Berger, 20, along with civilians Arbel Yehud, 29, and Gadi Mozes, 80—and five Thais were redeemed from terrorist captivity in Gaza as part of Hamas’s truce with Jerusalem. According to Israeli estimates, there are 79 hostages still in Hamas captivity in Gaza, including 76 abducted during the Oct. 7 attacks. Of the 251 hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, 175 have been returned or rescued, and Hamas is believed to be holding 35 bodies, 34 of them taken during the cross-border invasion and that of IDF Lt. Hadar Goldin, which was taken by the Palestinian terrorist group in 2014.

US Secretary of State Rubio: ‘The real test is when Gaza ceasefir...	If the people who are in charge of Gaza are the same guys that created October 7th, then we still have the same problem.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the ultimate challenge in the current conflict with Gaza is the fate of Hamas once the ceasefire phases end. In an interview with Megyn Kelly on Thursday, Rubio addressed the possibility of Hamas remaining in power in the Gaza Strip. 'The core problem here remains, and that is ultimately&#8230; an entity like Hamas, whose expressed purpose is the destruction of the Jewish state, and who is willing to commit horrifying atrocities against civilians,' he said. He called Hamas’s governance of Gaza 'a threat to Israel's national security.' He added, 'What country in the world can be expected to live alongside an enemy armed, capable, and willing to commit horrifying atrocities?' Although Rubio said he approved of the ceasefire deal, he acknowledged that it came at an 'extraordinary cost' and called it 'unfair' that 250 terrorists were released for every Israeli hostage. Rubio also observed, 'But it tells you how much, you know, we value life compared to what the other side, the Hamas animals, view this.' 'The real challenge here is going to be what happens when the ceasefire period expires. Who's going to govern Gaza? Who's going to rebuild Gaza? Who's going to be in charge of Gaza? Because if the people who are in charge of Gaza are the same guys that created October 7th, then we still have the same problem,' he continued. Although he acknowledged the severity of the challenge of post-war Gaza, Rubio also highlighted potential advantages and accomplishments. He expressed hope that the Lebanese government would become more powerful than Hezbollah, that relations between Syria's new regime and Israel would remain stable, and that Iran would be weakened, with most of its proxies defeated. Rubio also expressed hope for normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, despite the Saudis’ insistence on a Palestinian state as a precondition. 'So there's a lot of work to be done there. None of it is certain. All of it is hard, but real opportunities that we couldn't have even imagined 90 days ago,' Rubio concluded.

‘A bad but necessary deal’: Five members of his family were murde...	This is a bad deal, very bad, but the alternative is that much worse,' Almog said. 'We must look ahead, put today aside, and recognize that releasing prisoners serves a greater purpose.' By Debbie Weiss, The Algemeiner While the release of three Israeli hostages on Thursday brought relief and elation across Israel, it also triggered a wave of mixed emotions, especially among victims who saw the terrorists responsible for their suffering set free. One of them is Oran Almog, who was just ten years old when a Palestinian terrorist disguised as a pregnant woman blew up the restaurant he was in, killing five members of his family and leaving him blind. Yet, while Thursday’s release of Sami Jaradat — the mastermind behind the October 2003 massacre of Almog’s family — was a deeply personal blow, the return of hostages remained a necessary step, he said. 'That the terrorist who killed my family will find himself free is deeply painful, heartbreaking even,' he told The Algemeiner. 'But at the same time, I know that even today — especially today — I must set aside my personal pain and focus on the significance of this deal. And the significance is clear. We are getting our hostages home, and that is the only thing that matters.' Almog’s father, Moshe Almog, his younger brother, Tomer, his grandparents Admiral (res.) Ze’ev and Ruth Almog, and his cousin, Asaf, were murdered when the suicide bomber, Hanadi Jaradat, a 29-year-old lawyer from Jenin, managed to get past the security guard of the Maxim restaurant — jointly owned by a Jewish Israeli and an Arab Israeli — and blow herself up. Sixteen other people were also murdered in the attack, among them four children. Almog lost his eyesight, and his mother, sister, and aunt were among the 60 injured Israelis. 'Sami Jaradat’s continued imprisonment will never bring my family back, but his release can bring the hostages back home alive,' Almog explained. Emotional meeting between Agam Berger and her family at Beilinson Hospital in Israel. Photo: Haim Zach (GPO) Almog knows firsthand what it means to be on the receiving end of a hostage-prisoner exchange. Just two weeks after marking the 20th anniversary of the Maxim restaurant attack, another tragedy struck his family. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists brutally murdered Nadav and Yam and abducted Chen, Agam, Gal, and Tal from the Almog-Goldstein family in Kfar Azza. Fifty-one days later, in November 2023, they were released from Hamas captivity in a temporary ceasefire deal. Under the current ceasefire agreement reached earlier this month, Hamas will release a total 33 Israeli hostages, eight of whom are deceased, according to the terrorist group. In exchange, Israel will free over 1,900 Palestinian prisoners, many of whom were serving multiple life sentences on terrorism offenses. Thursday saw the release of three Israelis — including IDF surveillance soldier Agam Berger, 20, and civilians Arbel Yehoud, 29, and Gadi Mozes, 80 — and five Thai nationals, who were working in Israeli kibbutzim when they were abducted. 'This is a bad deal, very bad, but the alternative is that much worse,' Almog said. 'We must look ahead, put today aside, and recognize that releasing prisoners serves a greater purpose.' However, Almog expressed hope that Israel would move toward a more decisive and uncompromising approach in its fight against terrorism. 'I sincerely hope that as a country, we will have the wisdom to decisively thwart terrorism,' he said, emphasizing the need to break free from the ongoing cycle of prisoner exchanges. 'I don’t want us to find ourselves trapped in a cycle of releasing terrorists, only for them to return to terror, and then repeat the process again and again,' he added. Almog has previously addressed the UN Security Council, urging action against the so-called 'pay-for-slay' scheme, in which terrorists and their families receive monthly stipends from the Palestinian Authority. The terrorist behind the murder of Almog’s family received $3,000 a month while behind bars, making him almost a millionaire by the time of his release. Still, Almog concluded with a deeply uplifting message for the returning hostages, confident that they would have a chance at a good life, drawing from his own experiences since the terror attack. Oran Almog. Photo: Facebook After his release from the hospital, he began a long rehabilitation process, culminating in third place at the World Blind Sailing Championship with Etgarim, a nonprofit founded by disabled veterans and rehabilitation experts, and supported by the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews (IFCJ). He was chosen to light a torch at Israel’s Independence Day ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the state and, despite his disability, insisted on enlisting in the IDF, serving in an elite unit. Today, he is a managing partner at a financial technology fund, works with Etgarim, and shares his story globally through lectures. 'I know the hostages will be able to return, to live, and to live well. With enough support — and a great deal of willpower — it is truly possible to rebuild life, even after the deepest catastrophes,' he said.

Israel in ‘precarious position’ as China cozies up with Iran, exp...	Any notion that China could serve as a viable alternative to the U.S. as a hegemonic guarantor in the region is illusory,' said Zineb Riboua, a research fellow and program manager at the Hudson Institute’s Center for Peace and Security in the Middle East. By Izzy Salant, JNS Israel is in a 'precarious position,' as China has demonstrated a 'clear inclination' to align with Iran and its proxies after Oct. 7, Zineb Riboua, a research fellow and program manager at the Hudson Institute’s Center for Peace and Security in the Middle East, told JNS. Beijing opposes not only the Jewish state but also U.S. allies in the region, according to Riboua. 'This has been evident both rhetorically and practically,' she said. 'Rhetorically, Beijing has framed the United States as the primary culprit for instability in the Middle East, reinforcing anti-American narratives,' she told JNS. 'Practically, by continuing to purchase Iranian oil, China has provided Tehran with critical financial resources, indirectly enabling its network of regional proxies.' Riboua, who recently published a commentary article about 'China’s ambitions in the Middle East and Africa,' told JNS that China’s shift 'places Israel in a precarious position, where it must now recognize that China cannot be relied upon as a strategic partner on a wide range of issues.' 'Beijing’s interests in the region are fundamentally transactional, and while it may seek to deepen economic ties with Israel—particularly in the high-tech sector—it does so primarily to serve its own technological ambitions rather than to foster a genuine partnership,' she said. In the analysis, Riboua wrote, citing U.S. intelligence sources, that China has provided weapons directly to the Houthis in Yemen in exchange for safe passage of Chinese ships. This has, in part, allowed the Houthis to operate even at a limited capacity since Hezbollah’s collapse last year and the regime’s weakened state, according to Riboua. (The Trump administration is taking action to redesignate the Houthis as a terror group.) Experts told JNS in January 2024 that Israel must decrease its reliance on China before Beijing can disrupt vital infrastructure. Bilateral commodities trading (excluding diamonds) between China and Israel peaked at $21 billion in 2022, according to the Institute for National Security Studies, a think tank affiliated with Tel Aviv University. Riboua told JNS that unlike the United States, 'which provides Israel with military, diplomatic and strategic backing, China offers no real security guarantees and does not share Israel’s core geopolitical concerns.' 'It has consistently sided with actors hostile to Israel, whether through its rhetorical alignment with Iran’s anti-Western axis or its economic support that indirectly empowers Israel’s adversaries,' she said. 'Any notion that China could serve as a viable alternative to the U.S. as a hegemonic guarantor in the region is illusory.' But Riboua thinks that China will probably keep intensifying 'its efforts to cultivate closer ties with Israel, particularly in areas of advanced technology, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity—sectors where Israel is a global leader.' 'Beijing’s strategic interest in these domains stems not from a commitment to Israel’s security or prosperity, but rather from its broader ambition to compete with the United States in next-generation technologies,' she said. 'This dynamic places Israel in a delicate position, as it must balance the economic opportunities of engagement with China against the geopolitical risks of empowering a state that ultimately seeks to undermine U.S. influence,' she added.

Agam Berger and other hostages maintained Jewish observance durin...	Liri Albag: 'Despite the difficult conditions and limited options, Agam chose to stay true to her values and her faith.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Agam Berger, the IDF lookout who was released on Thursday, and other hostages maintained religious observance during their captivity in Gaza. On Thursday, eight hostages were released in Gaza, including five Thai workers and three Israelis: Agam Berger, Yehud, and Gadi Moses. Agam Berger was reunited with the four other female IDF lookouts who were released last week: Karina Ariev, 20; Daniella Gilboa, 20; Naama Levy, 20; and Liri Albag, 19. Liri Albag reported that Agam Berger held fast to her religious observance during her captivity, including keeping kosher and observing Shabbat. 'Despite the difficult conditions and limited options, Agam chose to stay true to her values and her faith,' Liri said. Liri's mother, Merav, said that her daughter did not eat any of the non-kosher meat offered to her during captivity, despite the lack of food. Prior to her daughter's release, Merav Berger requested that if her daughter would be released on Saturday, that those involved and the media should avoid violating Shabbat. 'I will wait for Agam, with G-d's help, when she comes, with as little Shabbat desecration as possible,' she shared. 'From you I ask, those who embrace us and who have gone this entire journey with us, and who have the great merit of bringing our children home - please do not desecrate Shabbat.' In addition to Berger, other released hostages said they refused leavened food during Passover and fasted on Yom Kippur, despite suffering severe malnutrition. For 16 months, Arbel Yehud was kept underground in complete isolation. She also suffered from severe malnutrition and was treated cruelly by her Hamas captors. 'I was alone,' Yehud said after she was freed. Although she was told that her brother, Dolev Yehud, was killed during the October 7th attack, she was unaware of the full extent of the invasion. Videos circulated on social media on Thursday showing a mob of Gaza civilians taunting and harassing hostages as they were being escorted to the Red Cross. One of the most harrowing images was of a frightened Arbel Yehud surrounded by hostile Gazans. Commenting on the video, Yehud said, 'What you saw today—the armed men escorting me—that is just a fraction of the horror.' Gadi Moses, who is 80, said that during his captivity, he focused on the day he would return to rebuild his community of Nir Oz. 'I never broke, I never cried—I just waited for the moment I would be free,' he told his family.

Hamas sends Israel names of hostages slated for release on Saturd...	Hamas propaganda chief Abu Obeida named them Ofer Kalderon, 54, Keith Siegel, 65, and Yarden Bibas, 35, in a post on his official Telegram channel. By JNS Jerusalem has received the names of the three hostages who are set to be released from captivity in the Gaza Strip under the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office confirmed on Friday. 'A detailed response will be provided after reviewing the list and updating families,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said. The captives scheduled for release are three men, Hamas propaganda chief Abu Obeida said, naming them as Ofer Kalderon, 54, Keith Siegel, 65, and Yarden Bibas, 35, in a post on his official Telegram channel. The only men set to be released in this first phase of the ceasefire agreement are those aged 50 and above, or who are ill or wounded. Under the terms of the agreement, the Palestinian terrorist group was obligated to release women and children hostages before men. Bibas’s wife, Shiri, 33, and their two young sons, Ariel, 5, and Kfir, 2, are on the list of the 33 hostages to be released in the first phase of the truce. Hamas, however, has claimed that Shiri, Ariel and Kfir have been killed. Siegel is a dual Israeli-American citizen. According to Israeli estimates, there are 82 hostages still in Hamas captivity in Gaza, including 79 abducted during the Oct. 7 attacks. Of the 251 hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, 172 have been returned or rescued, and Hamas is believed to be holding 35 bodies, 34 of them taken during the cross-border invasion and that of IDF Lt.

Hamas confirms death of terror chief Mohammed Deif months after I...	Deif is believed to have collaborated closely with the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, managing military operations and coordinating with the group’s top commanders throughout the conflict. By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner The Palestinian terrorist group Hamas officially confirmed on Thursday that its military chief, Mohammed Deif, was killed during the Gaza war, almost six months after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported his death. Deif, the architect of Hamas’s military capabilities, is believed to have been one of the masterminds behind the terrorist group’s invasion of and massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 — which sparked the Gaza war. Abu Ubaida, a Hamas spokesperson, also reported the deaths of Deif’s deputy, Khan Younis Brigade commander Rafa Salama, as well as senior operatives Marwan Issa, Ghazi Abu Tama’a, Raad Thabet, Ahmed Ghandour, and Ayman Nofal. According to the IDF, Deif was killed in an airstrike in Khan Younis in southern Gaza on July 13 of last year. Following weeks of intelligence assessments, Israeli authorities gathered evidence to confirm Deif’s death before publicly announcing it in early August. 'IDF fighter jets struck in the area of Khan Yunis, and … it can be confirmed that Mohammed Deif was eliminated in the strike,' the military said. 'His elimination serves the objectives of the war and demonstrates Israel’s ability to carry out targeted strikes with precision.' At the time, Hamas neither confirmed nor denied Deif’s death, but one official, Ezzat Rashaq, stated that any announcements regarding the deaths of its leaders would be made solely by the organization. 'Unless either of them [the Hamas political and military leadership] announces it, no news published in the media or by any other parties can be confirmed,' Rashaq said. In November, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Deif, as well as for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity related to the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza. Deif is believed to have collaborated closely with the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, managing military operations and coordinating with the group’s top commanders throughout the conflict. After Deif’s assassination, then-defense minister Gallant posted an image on social media praising the Israeli military’s accomplishment. 'The assassination of mass murderer Mohammed Deif — ‘Gaza’s Bin Laden’ — is a major step toward dismantling Hamas as a military and governing entity, and achieving the war’s objectives,' he said.

Trump reiterates view that Egypt, Jordan will take in Palestinian...	They will do it. They will do it. They’re gonna do it, OK?' Trump said. 'We do a lot for them, and they’re gonna do it.' By JNS A reporter asked U.S. President Donald Trump during a press conference as the president signed executive orders about Trump’s plan to send Palestinians to Egypt and Jordan. Trump called on Arab nations last week, specifically Egypt and Jordan, to take in more Palestinians to 'clean out' the Gaza Strip. Both King Abdullah II of Jordan and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi have rejected that plan. The reporter asked Trump on Thursday what he planned to do to make the countries take Palestinians in. 'Is there anything you can do to make them do that, I mean tariffs against those countries for example?' the reporter asked. 'They will do it. They will do it. They’re gonna do it, OK?' Trump said. 'We do a lot for them, and they’re gonna do it.' 'What’s amazing about this is that Gaza was Egyptian prior to 1967 and Jordan is majority Palestinian,' wrote the conservative commentator Dave Rubin.

Israeli hostage held in Iraq to be exchanged for Hezbollah terror...	One of the terrorists slated for release is Imad Ahmaz, a senior member of Hezbollah's naval force who was captured three months ago. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli researcher Elizabeth Tsurkov, who was kidnapped in Iraq two years ago, will be released in exchange for eight Hezbollah terrorists. The British website Amwaj reports that, in exchange for Tsurkov, Israel will release Hezbollah terrorists captured since the beginning of the conflict with Lebanon, which began on October 8, 2023, when Hezbollah launched missiles into Israel. One of the terrorists slated for release is Imad Ahmaz, a senior member of Hezbollah's naval force who was captured three months ago in a special operation by Shayetet 13. Last week, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein told Axios that Tsurkov is still alive after two years in captivity, and that Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani is working toward Tsurkov’s release. In a September 2023 interview, the Iraqi Prime Minister said it wasn’t clear who was responsible for abducting Tsurkov. 'The incident damages the reputation of Iraq’s stability and the capability of our security agencies,' he said. Tsurkov’s family stated they spoke with her the day before she was captured, and that nothing seemed out of the ordinary. 'We talked the day before the kidnapping, a completely normal and standard conversation about the interviews she had done, about what was left for her to do,' they said. Tsurkov, a researcher specializing in the Middle East at Princeton University, traveled to Iraq on her Russian passport to conduct research for her doctoral dissertation. However, for Israeli citizens, traveling to enemy nations is prohibited, even with a foreign passport, due to security concerns. Tsurkov was captured by Kataib Hezbollah, a Shiite militia backed by Iran. When the incident occurred, the Israeli Prime Minister’s office issued a statement. 'We hold Iraq responsible for her safety and well-being. She is an academic who visited Iraq on her Russian passport, at her own initiative, to conduct research for her doctorate and academic work on behalf of Princeton University in the US,' the statement said. 'The matter is being handled by the relevant parties in the State of Israel out of concern for Elizabeth Tsurkov’s security and well-being,' it continued.

Despite being left behind, she spent her final moments with the departing captives, braiding their hair as a gesture of love and strength. By Jewish Breaking News In a touching tribute, El Al Airlines employees wore braided hair adorned with yellow ribbons to honor Agam Berger, who was released from Hamas captivity today after 482 days. The gesture carries deep symbolism, as many of the recently freed female hostages returned home with braids done by Agam herself. Despite being left behind, she spent her final moments with the departing captives, braiding their hair as a gesture of love and strength. As an IDF observer stationed at a military base near Gaza, Agam was abducted on October 7, 2023. Her small yet powerful act of kindness during captivity transformed the braid into a symbol of resilience, humanity, and hope. Today, El Al employees proudly continue that legacy, celebrating her return and honoring the strength of all those who endured captivity.

How did so many Thai farmers end up held hostage by Hamas?	Thai ambassador to Israel Pannabha Chandraramya said Thursday that there are now more than 38,000 Thai workers in the country. By The Associated Press Five Thai nationals held hostage by Hamas since its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel were released Thursday. They were among 31 Thais taken by the terrorist group, of whom 23 have already been released. Another two have been confirmed dead, and the status of one remaining person is not clear. According to Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 46 Thais have been killed during the conflict, including the two who died in Hamas captivity. They were among tens of thousands of Thai workers in Israel. Here’s a look at what they were doing there. Why are there so many Thais in Israel? Israel once relied heavily on Palestinian workers, but it started bringing in large numbers of migrant workers after the 1987-93 Palestinian revolt known as the first Intifada. Most came from Thailand, and Thais remain the largest group of foreign agricultural laborers in Israel today, earning considerably more than they can at home. Thailand and Israel implemented a bilateral agreement a decade ago to ease the way for workers in the agriculture sector. Israel has come under criticism for the conditions under which the Thai farm laborers work. In a 2015 report, Human Rights Watch said they often were housed in makeshift and inadequate accommodations and 'were paid salaries significantly below the legal minimum wage, forced to work long hours in excess of the legal maximum, subjected to unsafe working conditions and denied their right to change employers.' A watchdog group found more recently that most were still paid below the legal minimum wage. How many Thais work in Israel? There were about 30,000 Thai workers, primarily working on farms, in Israel prior to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas. In the wake of the attack, some 7,000 returned home, primarily on government evacuation flights, but higher wages have continued to attract new arrivals. Thai ambassador to Israel Pannabha Chandraramya said Thursday that there are now more than 38,000 Thai workers in the country. What happened after they left? Faced with a labor shortage in the wake of the exodus after the Hamas attack, Israel’s Agriculture Ministry announced incentives to try and attract foreign workers back to evacuated areas. Among other things, it offered to extend work visas and to pay bonuses of about $500 a month. Thailand's Labor Ministry granted 3,966 Thai workers permission to work in Israel in 2024, keeping Israel in the top four destinations for Thais working abroad last year. Thai migrant workers generally come from poorer regions of the country, especially the northeast, and even before the bonuses the jobs in Israel paid many times what they could make at home.

Israel releases Palestinian terrorists after delay over ‘horrific...	In photos and videos shared on social media, Yehud was seen scared as she walked through a chaotic crowd, surrounded by rifle-wielding terrorists, toward the Red Cross convoy. By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner Israel on Thursday released 110 Palestinian prisoners after delaying the process due to outrage over the chaotic mobbing of freed Israeli hostages at a handover point in Gaza, the Prime Minister’s Office confirmed. 'Israel insists that the lessons be learned and that strict care be taken in the next phases regarding the safe return of our hostages,' the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement. The Palestinian terrorist group Hamas freed three Israeli and five Thai hostages after 482 days in captivity on Thursday, with the handovers taking place in both northern and southern Gaza. In the southern city of Khan Younis, armed terrorists transferred the hostages to the Red Cross amid chaos — with people chanting for Hamas’s military wing, known as the al-Qassam Brigades, and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who masterminded the terrorist group’s invasion of and massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 and was killed by Israeli forces a year later — while the hostages looked fearful and struggled to walk through the crowd.

In photos and videos shared on social media, Yehud was seen scared as she walked through a chaotic crowd, surrounded by rifle-wielding terrorists, toward the Red Cross convoy. After the incidents, Netanyahu, along with Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, ordered a delay in the release of the Palestinian terrorists scheduled to be freed under the Gaza ceasefire deal with Hamas until the safe exit of hostages in the next phases of the agreement could be assured. Jerusalem demanded that mediators Qatar and Egypt, who helped negotiate the ceasefire, 'guarantee the safety of our hostages,' Netanyahu’s office said in a statement, describing the 'horrific scenes' of Yehud and Mozes being taunted and mobbed. 'This is further proof of the unimaginable cruelty of the Hamas terrorist organization,' the statement continued. Following Netanyahu’s demand, however, 'the mediators have conveyed a commitment, according to which the safe exit of our hostages who are due to be released in the next phases has been assured,' his office said. Earlier on Thursday, Israeli soldier Agam Berger, 20, who was kidnapped from an Israeli military field observers’ base in Nahal Oz, was transferred into Red Cross custody following a Hamas handover ceremony in northern Gaza. All three Israelis were among the 251 hostages who were kidnapped during the Hamas-led rampage across southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were murdered, on Oct. 7, 2023. The five released Thais were all foreign agricultural workers who were also taken hostage during the Oct. 7 onslaught. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) named them as Thaenna Pongsak, Sathian Suwannakhan, Sriaoun Watchara, Saethao Bannawat, and Rumnao Surasak.

During the first 42 days of the agreement, Hamas pledged to release 33 hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, where they have largely been imprisoned for involvement in terrorist activities. Of those set to be released in the coming weeks, 32 were sentenced to life and 48 were serving long sentences, including Zakaria Zubeidi, Mohammad Abu Warda, and Sami Jaradat, according to Israel’s Channel 12 News. Zubeidi, who led the Palestinian faction Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in Jenin and briefly escaped from Israel’s Gilboa Prison in 2021, will not be deported due to his conviction on terrorism offenses rather than murder, and is expected to return to Ramallah. Abu Warda and Jaradat, responsible for attacks that killed 66 Israelis in the late 1990s and early 2000s, are scheduled to be deported and banned from re-entering Israeli territory The post Israel releases Palestinian terrorists after delay over ‘horrific’ Gaza mobbing of freed hostages appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/israel-releases-palestinian-terrorists-after-delay-over-horrific-gaza-mobbing-of-freed-hostages/	2025-01-31T02:11:28-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/F250130FFF002-scaled.jpg
IDF soldier killed, four wounded fighting terrorists in Jenin	Liam Hazi is the first Israeli casualty in 'Operation Iron Wall,' which the IDF initiated on Jan. 21 in Judea and Samaria. By JNS An Israeli soldier was killed in combat and four others were wounded on Thursday during a firefight with terrorists in Jenin in Samaria, the Israel Defense Forces said. Staff Sgt. Liam Hazi, 20, of the Kfir Brigade’s Haruv reconnaissance unit is the first Israeli casualty in 'Operation Iron Wall,' which the IDF initiated on Jan. 21 in Judea and Samariaagainst terrorist networks. Of the four wounded, one was severely hurt, and the three others sustained light wounds, according to the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit. Hazi’s unit was conducting house searches when it encountered a group of armed terrorists who opened fire on the troops at close range, the report said. The terrorists escaped. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the IDF Spokesperson, said in a statement: 'We mourn with the family and accompany them in these difficult hours. We continue to act resolutely against terrorism everywhere, including in Judea and Samaria. Tonight, too, we remember those who fell in the battles on Oct. 7, 2023, and the heavy price paid by IDF regular and reserve fighters throughout the war.' Earlier on Thursday, the IDF said the Israeli Air Force had carried out a strike against terrorists in Samaria on Wednesday, killing 10 of them. Another terrorist, Col. Kassem Aklik, a senior officer in the Palestinian Authority security forces and a member of the Fatah movement of P.A. chief Mahmoud Abbas, was killed by ground troops on Thursday, the army added. The strike is a 'direct continuation of the intensive counter-terrorism activity of the Shin Bet and the IDF against terrorist infrastructures in the northern Samaria region,' read a statement by the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit. Aklik was killed in Nablus, the army said. He had planned several attacks against Israelis and had tried to escape when officers from the Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit approached a building where he was staying, the statement said. Aklik was carrying a pistol, according to the statement. The officers shot and killed him.

Netanyahu spokesman: hostage deal ‘not a failure, but it came at ...	In exchange for 33 Israeli hostages in the first part of the deal, 735 Palestinian prisoners will be set loose from Israeli jails, some of whom have killed Israelis. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Omer Dostri, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s spokesman, told The Jerusalem Post on Thursday that the hostage release deal was not a failure but admitted it came at a price. Just a few days before Netanyahu's departure to Washington to meet with US President Donald Trump, Dostri said, 'I wouldn’t call the deal a failure, but it isn’t perfect – it came at a cost.' He emphasized that the security cabinet's main priority is the release of the hostages. 'Once that is achieved, we will ensure that Hamas is no longer in Gaza,' he said. According to the agreement, 33 Israeli hostages will be released in the first phase of the deal, mainly women, children, the sick, and the elderly. In exchange, 735 Palestinian prisoners will be set free from Israeli jails, some of whom have killed Israelis and are serving life sentences. When The Jerusalem Post asked why Israel seems to be paying a higher price to release these hostages than it did in November 2023, when 100 hostages were freed, Dostri replied: 'In the early days of the war, Hamas was under tremendous pressure – the Biden administration and the international community were fully behind Israel,' he explained. 'Since then, the Biden administration stepped back and placed pressure on Israel, giving Hamas a tailwind. Only recently have we begun reversing that trend, applying military pressure in northern Gaza, while Trump has also pressured Hamas,' Dostri added. He said one of the biggest mistakes the Biden administration made was publicly displaying a shipment of weapons to Israel prior to the IDF entering Rafah. 'I see that as a moral disgrace and a serious operational mistake,' he said. 'If the goal is to eliminate Hamas in Gaza, how do you justify withholding arms from Israel?' Regarding US President Donald Trump, Dostri said, 'His statements continue to show strong support for Israel. There are people in his administration who are very pro-Israel, very hawkish in our favor. We expect a sympathetic government and are happy to cooperate – we can achieve great things with him in the Middle East.' Dostri said that when Netanyahu meets with Trump in the Oval Office, the two are likely to discuss the ongoing ceasefire and hostage negotiations, Iran, the potential normalization of relations with Saudi Arabia, and Trump’s proposal to relocate Gazans to Egypt and Jordan during Gaza's rebuilding phase after the war.

Mossad head concerned Gaza cleanup efforts may damage dead hostag...	Barnea said, 'It’s awful. It could cause more cases like Ron Arad,' referring to the Israeli Air Force officer who was captured in Lebanon in 1986 and declared dead in 2008. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News At a meeting with the families of hostages, Mossad chief David Barnea expressed concern that bulldozers used to clear the wreckage in Gaza might damage the bodies of deceased hostages. Speaking to the families on Monday, Barnea said, 'It’s awful. It could cause more cases like Ron Arad,' referring to the Israeli Air Force officer who was captured in Lebanon in 1986 and, after no information was provided about his condition, was declared dead in 2008. 'We have a responsibility to bring everyone home,' Barnea added. At the meeting, Barnea also informed the families that the list of 33 hostages slated for release in phase one of the current agreement was created immediately after the hostage-release deal in November 2023. The circumstances for many of the hostages have changed since November 23, although there has been limited information about their condition. Hamas reported to Israel early this week that 8 of the 33 captives slated for release are dead. Israel has demanded information and clarity on the status of hostage Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir. The first phase of the hostage-release deal was meant to prioritize women, children, the elderly, and the ill. Although Shiri Bibas and her children were on the list of hostages slated for release in the initial stage, their absence from previous releases has raised concerns. Hamas reported that living hostages would return in the first part of the agreement, and the bodies of deceased captives would be handed over later. Last week, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari expressed 'grave concerns' over the fate of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir. The Israeli government is insisting on clarity regarding their status to provide answers to their family. Relatives of the Bibas family said that their 'world came crashing down' when Shiri and her children were not included in the list of hostages slated for release on Saturday.

Dutch parliament conditions Palestinian NGO funding on recognitio...	This week’s resolution also came two months after a violent attack in Amsterdam against visiting Israeli soccer fans by a mob of rioters, many of them Muslim. By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner The Dutch Parliament passed a resolution on Tuesday to make funding for Palestinian NGOs depend on their recognition of Israel’s right to exist. The Dutch House of Representatives passed a resolution by a margin of 70-67 requiring greater transparency from NGOs, including detailed information about board members and funded projects, while ensuring that subsidized organizations align with the Netherlands’ foreign policy, including recognition of the state of Israel. The motion also addresses terror ties, citing the Netherlands’ decision to halt subsidies to the Ramallah-based Union of Agricultural Work Committee (UAWC) following a terror attack by employees with ties to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), an internationally designated terrorist organization. Last year, Dutch lawmakers discovered that the previous government had continued funding a terror-linked NGO, despite knowing they had subsidized the salaries of two Palestinians convicted in the 2019 murder of a 17-year-old Israeli girl. These two Palestinians were members of the PFLP, while also being employed by the UAWC, which has received over 20 million euros in funding from the Dutch government over the past decade. In 2020, the government suspended funding to the UAWC pending an investigation into the 2019 bombing. This week’s resolution also came two months after a violent attack in Amsterdam against visiting Israeli soccer fans by a mob of rioters, many of them Muslim. Olga Deutsch, vice president of NGO Monitor, an independent Jerusalem-based research organization, explained that the lack of vetting and oversight mechanisms has allowed billions of euros to be diverted to antisemitic, anti-Israel, and terror-affiliated organizations. 'The need to change these practices became even more salient following the Hamas massacre of Oct. 7, 2023,' she told the Algemeiner. Deutsch pointed out that the Dutch government supported numerous organizations that misused aid funds, with a large portion being directed toward political warfare against Israel and the global Jewish community. This 'endangers the safety of global Jewish communities … as it radicalizes discourse, spreads fear, and promotes narratives that translate into attacks against Jews,' she added. Last year, NGO Monitor presented a report to the Dutch Parliament warning that foreign aid to Palestinian organizations was being misused for terrorism and radicalism. NGO Monitor revealed that from 2021 to 2027, Dutch government grantees included NGOs involved in anti-Israel campaigns. These included Al Mezan, which engages in legal action against Israel and has ties to PFLP and Hamas; the Independent Commission for Human Rights (ICHR), which collaborates with terror groups such as Hamas, PFLP, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ); and Oxfam-Novib, which, along with other organizations, sued the Netherlands in 2023 to stop arms exports to Israel. Deutsch emphasized that the latest resolution is crucial as global discussions unfold about Gaza’s future post-ceasefire, urging the international community to rethink and restructure aid distribution. 'The donor community must ensure that aid is not diverted to Hamas and other terror organizations, as was the case before Oct. 7,' she said. During this legislative session, the Dutch Parliament also adopted a motion urging the government to support Gaza reconstruction plans and fundraising efforts. However, lawmakers rejected several proposals related to Israel and the Palestinians, including one to tighten labeling and tariff enforcement on Israeli settlements. They also denied motions to link Dutch aid for Gaza’s reconstruction to Dutch companies and restrict it to civilian infrastructure, as well as to provide January funding to UNRWA, the controversial UN agency for Palestinian refugees that has come under fire for several links to Hamas.

UNRWA activities become illegal in Israel	According to Israel, hundreds of UNRWA workers have engaged in terrorism in recent years, including the killers of Yonatan Samerano, an IDF soldier slain on Oct. 7, 2023, whose body was taken to Gaza. By Canaan Lindor, JNS Laws that ban UNRWA in Israel went into effect on Thursday, barring the United Nations aid agency for Palestinians from maintaining a presence or activities in that country, and prohibiting Israeli officials from engaging in contact with it. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel welcomed the development. 'UNRWA lies at the heart of the Arab-Jewish conflict. It has always been a non-neutral political organization, and it actually paved the way for October 7th. Any other country in the world would have shut down such an organization within 24 hours of its employees having massacred civilians. I will continue to do everything in my power to bring about the complete closure of the organization,' she tweeted. On Oct. 28, the Knesset passed, by large majorities, two laws banning UNRWA following the exposure of UNRWA staff complicity in Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre, and despite pressure from the United States and other countries against the move. Three months later, the laws have come into effect. The ban is by far the most robust step ever taken by Israel against UNRWA, whose largest donors have been the United States and the European Union. The agency has for decades been accused of providing cover and income to Palestinian terrorists while undermining peace efforts, including via its schools’ curriculum. Jerusalem Deputy Mayor Aryeh King celebrated the development by uncorking a bottle of sparkling wine outside the shuttered UNRWA office in Jerusalem’s northeastern Ma’alot Dafna neighborhood. 'It’s a happy, special and historic day,' he said, popping open the bottle to cheers from supporters. Shai Glick from the B’tsalmo human rights group attended the event and spray-painted over the sign of the former UNRWA offices. UNRWA, or the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, 'has an impressive-sounding name, but it’s just a terrorist group,' Glick said. Engaged in terrorism According to Israel, hundreds of UNRWA workers have engaged in terrorism in recent years, including the killers of Yonatan Samerano, an IDF soldier slain on Oct. 7, 2023, whose body was taken to Gaza. Israel identified one of them as UNRWA social worker Faisal Ali Mussalem al Naami. On Jan. 20, President Donald Trump temporarily suspended U.S. foreign aid to UNRWA, pending reviews of existing development programs. Several countries froze their funding to UNRWA, which usually enjoy a budget of about $1 billion annually. Only the U.S. and New Zealand have not reinstated their funding. Switzerland reinstated it only partially, according to UN Watch, a watchdog group based in Geneva. On Saturday, Israel notified the United Nations it must evacuate all UNRWA premises by Jan. 30. UN Watch wrote in a recent report that UNRWA officials meet 'routinely' with Lebanese and Gazan terrorist groups, 'mutually praise each other for ‘cooperation’ and describe each other as ‘partners.’' Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of UNRWA, said that the agency will continue to deliver on its mandate until it physically cannot do so. UNRWA caters to several millions of people it defines as refugees in Judea and Samaria, Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. Israel’s laws may complicate its ability to bring goods and staff into Judea and Samaria and Gaza. Through UNRWA, the United Nations employs a unique refugee definition for Palestinians. UNRWA defines as refugees not only those who fled the war in 1948 but their descendants in perpetuity, until a 'just solution' emerges for their status. The United Nations has a different definition for all other refugees, who cannot give the title to their descendants and often lose it when they are naturalized elsewhere. Critics of the UNRWA definition say it’s designed to perpetuate the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

Barnard names new head of women’s center: Anti-Israel gender prof...	When Columbia slapped suspensions on students who stormed the building and invited police to maintain order on campus, meanwhile, Jordan-Young rallied to their defense. By Jessica Costescu and Jessica Schwalb, The Washington Free Beacon Rebecca Jordan-Young, a gender studies professor at Barnard College, is a member of the school's Faculty for Justice in Palestine chapter. Last spring, she volunteered to serve as a 'protest marshal,' part of a group of faculty members and staff who helped student radicals secure the perimeter of their illegal encampment and stood by as those students stormed a Columbia University campus building, photos obtained by the Washington Free Beacon show. Now, she will lead the Barnard Center for Research on Women. Barnard named Jordan-Young the center's interim director on Friday. The role opened up after Premilla Nadasen, a Barnard history professor, resigned last month, citing her discontent with stricter campus event rules and 'surveillance cameras' implemented in the wake of the illegal encampments that roiled Barnard and Columbia. Jordan-Young's appointment ensures that another ally of anti-Israel students will lead the center, which was established in 1971 to 'assure that women can live and work in dignity, autonomy, and equality.' It has since expanded its scope to encompass a wider array of social justice projects, including the 'gay liberation movement,' the 'histories of racism, slavery, and colonialism' in the field of botany, and the 'intersections of social reproduction, racial capitalism, care, the state, and liberatory social change.' Anti-Israel and pro-Hamas activism is also included within that scope. Under Nadasen, the Center for Research on Women was advertised as the host of the infamous 'Resistance 101' event held last March, which featured a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terror group and saw speakers explicitly call for terrorism against Jews. When a doctoral student complained to Columbia, organizers moved the event. A flyer advertising last year's 'Resistance 101' event. Though Nadasen later denied any affiliation to 'Resistance 101,' her successor has offered explicit support for Barnard and Columbia's campus radicals. Photographs obtained by the Free Beacon show Jordan-Young standing by as student radicals stormed Hamilton Hall in April. In one photo, Jordan-Young is shown standing just steps away from a group of protesters who blocked a side entrance to the building. In a separate video, Jordan-Young is shown conversing with other faculty members as students occupy Hamilton Hall. Metadata from the video show a timestamp of April 30 at approximately 2 a.m., shortly after students first stormed the building. Jordan-Young pictured near a crowd of students during the Hamilton Hall storming. Jordan-Young wore one of the neon vests associated with 'protest marshals,' a group of volunteer faculty members and staff who supported encampment participants by standing guard at the encampment's entrance. A photograph taken on April 29 shows Jordan-Young doing just that. Jordan-Young (far-left corner) helps guard the encampment entrance. When Columbia slapped suspensions on students who stormed the building and invited police to maintain order on campus, meanwhile, Jordan-Young rallied to their defense. She went on strike in May in solidarity with those students, with the Faculty for Justice in Palestine group she belongs to saying its members would 'not return to campus nor engage remotely for administrative service work … until police are removed from our campus.' In her own statement, Jordan-Young said the 'protests on campus were peaceful until the NYPD was called in.' Months later, in September, Jordan-Young's anti-Israel faculty group held a 'Barnard Community in Crisis: Faculty Teach-In.' Jordan-Young dressed in a pink wig and clown makeup and called herself 'Both Sides Bozo,' a reference to a university that she said is all about 'facts and objectivity and established things and not, like, ethics, which really has no place in a university or college.' Jordan-Young as 'Both Sides Bozo.' Shoshana Aufzien, a freshman at Barnard, witnessed that event in person. Jordan-Young's appointment to run the Center for Research on Women, she said, 'undermines [the] institution’s credibility.' Alon Levin, a Ph.D. student at Columbia’s School of Engineering, echoed that assessment. 'In a race to destroy any lasting legitimacy the Columbia brand maintains, the Barnard Center for Research on Women is undoubtedly a top contender,' he told the Free Beacon. The Barnard Center for Research on Women and Jordan-Young did not respond to requests for comment. Jordan-Young’s appointment comes as a new wave of anti-Israel radicalism sweeps Columbia. Student activists, for example, kicked off the spring semester by storming an Israeli history class. They targeted Jews in the class with anti-Semitic flyers that glorified Hamas, depicted a trampled Star of David, and called for violence. One flyer stated, 'THE ENEMY WILL NOT SEE TOMORROW' and featured an upside-down triangle—a symbol Hamas uses to denote Israeli targets—to spell 'TOMORROW.' The flyer depicted a truck full of Hamas terrorists brandishing RPGs and machine guns. Last week, Columbia identified and suspended one student activist involved. Days later, on Monday, the school announced that it identified two more participants from an 'affiliated institution' and referred those participants to their 'home institution for further investigation and discipline.' Columbia's affiliated institutions include Barnard, Union Theological Seminary, and Teachers College.

Netanyahu condemns ‘unimaginable cruelty’ of Hamas after hostages...	Otzma Yehudit Party leader Itamar Ben-Gvir called the display a 'horror' scene demonstrating that 'this is not a total victory but a total failure, in a reckless deal like no other.' By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday condemned the crowds of Gazans that mobbed three Israeli hostages as they were being released by Hamas. 'I view the shocking scenes during the release of our hostages as very serious,' wrote Netanyahu after the release of Arbel Yehud, Gadi Mozes, Agam Berger and five Thai citizens, all of whom were abducted to Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023. 'This is further proof of the unimaginable cruelty of the Hamas terrorist organization. I demand that the mediators ensure that such horrific scenes do not recur, and guarantee the safety of our hostages. Those who dare harm our hostages do so at their own peril,' Netanyahu wrote. Footage from the release shows massive crowds, apparently in a state of jubilation, swarming around cars transporting the hostages and around the Hamas terrorists escorting the Israelis from the vehicles. Otzma Yehudit Party leader Itamar Ben-Gvir, a critic of the ceasefire deal who recently took his party out of the government because of it, called the display a 'horror' scene demonstrating that 'this is not a total victory but a total failure, in a reckless deal like no other. The government, he continued, 'could have withheld humanitarian aid, fuel, electricity and water from the bloodthirsty mob that is now trying to lynch our hostages and crushed them militarily.' Israel has agreed to release 110 terrorists in exchange for the latest group of hostages, including Zakaria Zubeidi, Mohammad Abu Warda and Sami Jaradat, according to Channel 12. Zubeidi led Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in the Samaria city of Jenin and briefly escaped from Israel’s high-security Gilboa Prison in September 2021. Since Zubeidi was not convicted of murder but of other terror offenses, he will not be deported and is expected to be released back to Samaria. The deal that Hamas and Israel initiated on Jan. 19 was for the release of more than 90 hostages for close to 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Israel has agreed to redeploy in the Gaza Strip and allow the repopulation of the area’s north. The first phase of the deal involves the release of 33 hostages in exchange for more than 700 Palestinian prisoners and more than 1,000 detainees over a 42-day period. Of the 33 Israel hostages on the first phase list, 10 have returned so far.

An Israeli security source told the country’s Kan News that Jerusalem’s political echelon had decided to freeze the release of the Arab terrorists in response to the way Yehud and Mozes were treated on Thursday. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Three Israelis and five Thais were redeemed from terrorist captivity in the Gaza Strip on Thursday as part of Hamas’s truce with Jerusalem, 482 days after they were taken captive during the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre. Israeli civilians Arbel Yehud, 29, and Gadi Mozes, 80, were handed over by Hamas to representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross on Thursday afternoon in the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis. Mozes was taken from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz alongside his wife, Margalit, who was one of the first captives released in the 2023 truce. The five released Thais—all foreign workers who taken hostage during the Oct. 7 cross-border assault—were named by the Israel Defense Forces as Thaenna Pongsak, Sathian Suwannakhan, Sriaoun Watchara, Saethao Bannawat and Rumnao Surasak. 'According to information provided by the Red Cross, seven hostages, including an Israeli male and female hostage and five foreign nationals, were handed over to it and are making their way to the IDF and [Israel Security Agency] forces in the Gaza Strip,' the military confirmed. The army subsequently confirmed that the seven returnees have 'now crossed the border into Israeli territory with IDF and ISA forces.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said that Jerusalem appealed to mediators Qatar and Egypt following the 'horrific scenes' of Yehud and Mozes being publicly taunted by their captors and a mob of thousands of Palestinians as they were transferred to the Red Cross. 'This is further proof of the unimaginable cruelty of the Hamas terrorist organization,' Jerusalem’s Prime Minister’s Office stated, demanding that Doha and Cairo work to 'guarantee the safety of our hostages.' Yehud and Mozes had been held by Iranian-backed Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists who participated in the Oct. 7 attack alongside Hamas. Islamic Jihad issued a statement on Thursday morning saying that it had 'completed the procedures for handing over the hostages Arbel Yehud and Gadi Mozes,' in what Hebrew media interpreted as the terror group having transferred the two to Hamas ahead of their release. Earlier on Thursday, Israeli soldier Agam Berger, 20, who was kidnapped from the IDF field observers’ base in Nahal Oz, was transferred into Red Cross custody following a Hamas handover ceremony in Gaza’s north. 'Agam Berger, accompanied by IDF and [Israel Security Agency] forces, recently crossed the border into the territory of the State of Israel,' the military stated. Berger was reunited with her family at the reception point near the border before being evacuated to a hospital, it said. 'Thank God we have reached this moment and our heroine Agam has returned to us after 482 days in the hands of the enemy,' the family said in a statement after the reunion. 'Our girl is strong, believing and brave.' 'We would like to thank the security forces and the entire people of Israel for all the support and prayers,' added the family’s statement. Netanyahu’s office stated, 'The government, together with all security officials, will accompany her and her family. The Israeli government is committed to returning all of the hostages and the missing.' The PMO statement concluded with a quote from the Bible: 'And I will return the captivity of My people Israel' (Amos 9:14). Dr. Lena Koren Feldman, director of Rabin Medical Center’s Beilinson Hospital, told Israel’s Channel 12 News that the four IDF soldiers kidnapped alongside Berger and who were released by Hamas on Saturday screamed with excitement when they saw her being freed. As Berger was being released, U.S. President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, met in Jerusalem with Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Shas Party leader Aryeh Deri to discuss the implementation of the hostage deal. Witkoff, who arrived in the Jewish state on Wednesday, met on Thursday afternoon with the four previously freed soldiers at Beilinson Hospital. The presidential envoy also visited 'Hostage Square' in central Tel Aviv. Jerusalem is preparing to free several high-profile Palestinian terrorists in exchange for the hostages, Hebrew media reported on Wednesday. Among the 110 terrorists scheduled to be released are Zakaria Zubeidi, Mohammad Abu Warda and Sami Jaradat, according to Channel 12. Zubeidi led Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in the Samaria city of Jenin and briefly escaped from Israel’s high-security Gilboa Prison in 2021. Since Zubeidi was not convicted of murder but of other terror offenses, he will not be deported and is expected to be released back to Samaria. Abu Warda and Jaradat were responsible for terrorist attacks that combined killed 66 Israelis in the late ’90s and early 2000s. Both are scheduled to be deported and banned from returning to Israeli territory. However, an Israeli security source told the country’s Kan News that Jerusalem’s political echelon had decided to freeze the release of the Arab terrorists in response to the way Yehud and Mozes were treated on Thursday. The IDF said on Thursday morning that its Judea and Samaria Division had completed 'preparations for the next wave of released terrorists, by reinforcing defense at checkpoints and in various sectors.' The IDF voted to take immediate action against expected 'disturbances and terror activities' surrounding the release of terrorists into the area. The Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) also made 'warning calls' to families of terrorists who are expected to be released, it noted.

Gazans who sped north are deciding on their own to go back south	There is shelter and food for them in the south, whereas the center and northern areas of Gaza are destroyed, they noted. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Some of the over 300,000 Gazans who sped north to get to their hometowns as soon as the IDF allowed them to cross the former no-go zone of the Netzarim Corridor just a few days ago are regretting that decision and have begun returning south, Abu Ali Express reported Thursday. The Israeli Telegram channel ran a translated Arab news clip from Tuesday, where a female interviewer spoke with young men striding along the A-Rashid coastal road that was serving as the main route for Gazans to head back home in the north – but they were using it to go in the opposite direction. When she asked where they were from, they said they had been in the south, they walked to their old neighborhood in the north, and were now returning to the south. 'We walked there yesterday, and today we are coming back,' one told her. When she asked what the atmosphere was like 'in Gaza [City],' and how they found the going, they answered immediately, 'Destruction, complete destruction.' They had no interest in staying under such circumstances, with their houses gone and 'huge sand dunes in their place,' they said. One commented, 'We’ll leave it in God’s hands,' while another young man, with a more practical bent, said, 'Find people a solution. Where should we go?' 'We want to live, sleep, we want to find shelter&#8230; there is no shelter there,' he added, so they were 'returning home,' referring to where they had stayed safe over the course of the war. 'That’s the best solution,' he declared. When the interviewer asked if they really thought that it was the right move to return, he responded, 'Yes, yes. Now that is our place, the one we want to return to.' A whole family then passed by on a horse-drawn cart and when she called out, 'Are you also returning?' they answered, 'Yes, [because] there’s no water, no nothing.' Several people could also be heard saying off-camera to 'Open the crossing points' for them, meaning the border crossings to allow them to leave the Gaza Strip. The only other country besides Israel that has a land border with Gaza is Egypt, and it has kept its gates very firmly shut against any kind of mass influx of Gazan refugees for the entire war. Over the last few days, U.S. President Donald Trump has brought up the idea to both Egyptian and Jordanian leaders of allowing entry to tens of thousands of Gazans at least until the devastation of war can be cleared somewhat, and has been firmly turned down. The interviewer was thrown by what she had seen and heard, saying, 'This is indeed an unusual situation, dear viewers, the return of those who had been uprooted from Gaza City going back to the places they had left' in the south. She specifically named the Al Mouassi safe zone, which was set up by Israel along the coast near Khan Yunis some nine months ago and is well supplied with humanitarian aid. She also noted that there was no problem to walk in either direction on the coast, in which no officials or soldiers of any kind could be seen.

Agam Berger’s separate release in Jabalya used for propaganda pur...	The stage where the IDF observer was taken to be displayed was decorated with pictures of the terrorists’ supposed victory over various IDF divisions. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The separate release Thursday morning of IDF observer Agam Berger was carefully staged for propaganda purposes by Gazan terrorists, according to a report in The Jerusalem Post following the event. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) took Berger to Jabalya to be turned over to the Red Cross, a city that has been the site of months of fighting over several rounds during the course of the war between the IDF and the terrorists. It wanted specifically to declare victory over the IDF there, analyst Seth Frantzman wrote, and decorated the stage where it displayed Berger accordingly. Printed in English and Arabic on a huge poster that formed the backdrop of the stage were slogans such as 'Gaza is the graveyard of the criminal Zionists,' 'Palestine – The victory of the oppressed people vs the Nazi Zionists,' and The Palestinians fighters of freedom will always be the victories [sic].' The bunting in front contained childish approximations of the logos of various IDF divisions and brigades that had fought in Gaza in general and Jabalya in particular, with images of defeat skewering them. Thus, the Givati symbol of a red fox and a sword was turned into a running animal with a sword stabbing it through the back and the caption 'Jabalya is the grave of Givati.' While the IDF did suffer a few dozen losses in Jabalya, thousands of terrorists were killed and captured in the fighting in the city. The image labeled 'Kfir,' another infantry division, had a sword buried in the helmet worn by a skull, while yellow, blue and red lines that form part of the Nachal symbol were shown being scythed in half by a sickle named Beit Hanoun, as if that brigade’s soldiers were defeated in that town, which is the opposite of what really happened there. The terrorists misspelled each one of these divisions’ names, which could be considered an unprofessional touch. Berger was led onto the stage by dozens of uniformed, masked terrorists wearing green headbands who had given her some kind of certificate of release to hold, exactly like other hostages. Black-clad terrorists holding long guns stood on stage and some filmed the proceedings, in which Berger was made to smile for the cameras and an audience of Gazans that was kept at a distance before a stylized handover was enacted and she was whisked away by Red Cross vehicles and transported to safety in Israel. The two other Israeli hostages released Thursday, Gadi Mozes and Arbel Yehoud, and the five Thai hostages, had a seemingly much more frightening time before their release. Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Hamas jointly took them to Khan Younis to be freed close to the destroyed home of assassinated Hamas head Yahya Sinwar. Huge crowds formed and their captors were hard-pressed to open the doors of the cars they had arrived in, needing to push back their fellow citizens. Arab media showed Yehoud completely surrounded by helmeted terrorists who were walking her very slowly toward the Red Cross cars, literally pushing through a huge shouting and jeering mob, in order to get to a Red Cross car.

Almisshal was reportedly put in charge of two separate hostage release ceremonies held in the Gaza Strip after Hamas reached a temporary ceasefire deal with Israel. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon A journalist with the Qatar-funded Al Jazeera news network reportedly produced videos for Hamas documenting its recent release of Israeli hostages. The reporter, Tamer Almisshal, is said to have orchestrated elaborate propaganda ceremonies on the terror group’s behalf, according to Israel’s i24 News. Almisshal is listed on Al Jazeera’s website as a 'producer and presenter of investigative programmes.' He began working at the Doha-based news network in 2008 and spent time as a correspondent in the Gaza Strip before relocating to Qatar. Almisshal is said to moonlight as a producer for Hamas’s propaganda arm, i24 said in a Hebrew-language report televised on Wednesday. He is one of several Al Jazeera journalists alleged to work with the terror group and even serve in its ranks. Israel shuttered Al Jazeera’s offices in May 2024, deeming it a national security threat. Breaking: Senior Al Jazeera Journalist Produced Hamas' Hostage Release Ceremonies According to @BaruchYedid in an exposé for @i24NEWS_HE, the Qatari network's Tamer Mishel produced the ceremonies as well as the recent documentary, 'What is Hidden is Greater,' in which Al… pic.twitter.com/SAyCG3CAdC &mdash; Eitan Fischberger (@EFischberger) January 29, 2025 Almisshal was reportedly put in charge of two separate hostage release ceremonies held in the Gaza Strip after Hamas reached a temporary ceasefire deal with Israel. The Al Jazeera reporter was put 'in charge of the stage, the banners, the narrative, and the idea of dressing the female soldiers in IDF uniforms,' according to an English translation of i24’s report. 'He is the one Hamas designated for this task.' Hamas's elaborate ceremonies drew widespread attention in Israel and raised concerns that the terror group remains a competent fighting force, even after more than a year of war. The Israeli report suggests that the ceremonies were part of a propaganda push by Hamas to demonstrate strength and reassert its control over Gaza. 'So while in Israel we’re racking our brains: Is this staged? Is this real? Does this indicate Hamas’s strength? This is a full theatrical performance, orchestrated by one of Al Jazeera’s most skilled reporters, Tamer Almisshal, originally from Gaza,' i24 said. When the first group of Israeli hostages were released earlier this month, throngs of armed Hamas soldiers surrounded an ambulance delivering the captives back to Israel. The terrorists had traded in their civilian clothes for military fatigues, sending a message to Israel that Hamas is no longer hiding in tunnels and civilian homes. As part of this power play, Hamas released carefully tailored images and videos meant to convey its strength. Almisshal was quoted at the time as saying that Hamas intentionally chose to parade through Gaza's Saraya Square during the first prisoner swap. 'This area, heavily targeted by Israeli operations, sends a message: You didn’t break us—Hamas is still here,' he said. Almisshal is also said to be the producer behind a recent Al Jazeera documentary on Hamas that featured exclusive footage of the terror group’s former leader, Yahya Sinwar. Almisshal reportedly maintains a relationship with Ezzedine Haddad, a commander in Hamas’s armed wing responsible for overseeing the prisoner swaps with Israel. Al Jazeera did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Israeli report. Multiple Al Jazeera journalists celebrated Hamas’s Oct. 7 terror spree and were reportedly embedded with militants as they stormed the Jewish state that morning. 'This is the day that restored the honor and prestige to [our] nation,' Al Jazeera presenter Jamal Rayyan tweeted—and subsequently deleted—at the time. The Doha-based outlet also came under fire for publishing a comedy skit that mocked the Oct. 7 attack. When Israel banned the outlet from operating in the country, officials accused Al Jazeera of 'broadcasting propaganda in the service of Hamas, in Arabic and English, to viewers around the world, and even passing sensitive information to the enemy.'

Passenger jet with 64 aboard collides with Army helicopter while ...	President Donald Trump said he had been 'fully briefed on this terrible accident' and, referring to the passengers, added, 'May God Bless their souls.' By The Associated Press An American Airlines jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew members collided Wednesday with an Army helicopter while landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, prompting a large search-and-rescue operation in the nearby Potomac River. There were multiple fatalities, according to a person familiar with the matter, but the precise number of victims was unclear as rescue crews hunted for any survivors. Three soldiers were onboard the helicopter, an Army official said. There was no immediate word on the cause of the collision, but all takeoffs and landings from the airport were halted as dive teams scoured the site and helicopters from law enforcement agencies across the region flew over the scene in methodical search for bodies. 'We are going to recover our fellow citizens,' District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a somber news conference at the airport Thursday morning in which she declined to say how many bodies had been recovered. Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas said, 'When one person dies it’s a tragedy, but when many, many, many people die it’s an unbearable sorrow.' President Donald Trump said he had been 'fully briefed on this terrible accident' and, referring to the passengers, added, 'May God Bless their souls.' Passengers on the flight included a group of figure skaters, their coaches and family members who were returning from a development camp that followed the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita. 'We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims’ families closely in our hearts,' U.S. Figure Skating said in a statement. The Federal Aviation Administration said the midair crash occurred before 9 p.m. EST when a regional jet that had departed from Wichita, Kansas, collided with a military helicopter on a training flight while on approach to an airport runway. It occurred in some of the most tightly controlled and monitored airspace in the world, just over three miles south of the White House and the Capitol. Investigators will try to piece together the aircrafts' final moments before their collision, including contact with air traffic controllers as well as a loss of altitude by the passenger jet. American Airlines Flight 5342 was inbound to Reagan National at an altitude of about 400 feet and a speed of about 140 miles per hour when it suffered a rapid loss of altitude over the Potomac River, according to data from its radio transponder. The Canadian-made Bombardier CRJ-701 twin-engine jet, manufactured in 2004, can be configured to carry up to 70 passengers. A few minutes before landing, air traffic controllers asked the arriving commercial jet if it could land on the shorter Runway 33 at Reagan National and the pilots said they were able. Controllers then cleared the plane to land on Runway 33. Flight tracking sites showed the plane adjust its approach to the new runway. Less than 30 seconds before the crash, an air traffic controller asked the helicopter if it had the arriving plane in sight. The controller made another radio call to the helicopter moments later: 'PAT 25 pass behind the CRJ.' Seconds after that, the two aircraft collided. The plane’s radio transponder stopped transmitting about 2,400 feet short of the runway, roughly over the middle of the river. Video from an observation camera at the nearby Kennedy Center showed two sets of lights consistent with aircraft appearing to join in a fireball. 'I know that flight. I've flown it several times myself,' said Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas. He said he expected that many people in Wichita would know people who were on the flight. 'This is a very personal circumstance,' he said. The collision occurred on a warm winter evening in Washington, with temperatures registering as high as 60 degrees Fahrenheit, following a stretch days earlier of intense cold and ice. On Wednesday, the Potomac River was 36 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The National Weather Service reported that wind gusts of up to 25 mph were possible in the area throughout the evening. American Airlines CEO Robert Isom expressed 'deep sorrow' for the crash and said the company was focused on the needs of passengers, crew, first responders and families and loved ones of those involved. Some 300 first responders were on scene. Inflatable rescue boats were launched into the Potomac River from a point along the George Washington Parkway, just north of the airport, and first responders set up light towers from the shore to illuminate the area near the collision site. At least a half-dozen boats were scanning the water using searchlights. 'It’s a highly complex operation,' said D.C. fire chief John Donnelly. 'The conditions out there are extremely rough for the responders.' The U.S. Army described the helicopter as a UH-60 Blackhawk based at Fort Belvoir in Virginia. The helicopter was on a training flight. Military aircraft frequently conduct training flights in and around the congested and heavily-restricted airspace around the nation’s capital for familiarization and continuity of government planning. The crash is serving as a major test for two of the Trump administration’s newest agency leaders. Pete Hegseth, sworn in days ago as defense secretary, posted on social media that an investigation has been 'launched immediately' by the Army and the Defense Department. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, just sworn in earlier this week, said at a somber news conference at the airport early Thursday that his agency would provide all possible resources to the investigation. The last fatal crash involving a U.S. commercial airline occured in 2009 near Buffalo, New York. Everyone aboard the Bombardier DHC-8 propeller plane was killed, including 45 passengers, 2 pilots and 2 flight attendants. Another person on the ground also died, bringing the total death toll to 50. An investigation determined that the captain accidentally caused the plane to stall as it approached the airport in Buffalo. Reagan Airport will reopen at 11 a.m. Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration announced. The FAA has previously said it would be closed until 5 a.m. Friday. Located along the Potomac River, just southwest of the city. Reagan National is a popular choice because it’s much closer than the larger Dulles International Airport, which is deeper in Virginia. Depending on the runway being used, flights into Reagan can offer passengers spectacular views of landmarks like the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, the National Mall and the U.S. Capitol. It’s a postcard-worthy welcome for tourists visiting the city. The incident recalled the crash of an Air Florida flight that plummeted into the Potomac on January 13, 1982, that killed 78 people. That crash was attributed to bad weather.

No weapons, malfunctioning bomb shelters: Sderot on Oct. 7th	Hamas terrorists, armed with automatic rifles, easily outgunned members of the city's emergency squad, who had only their personal handguns. By World Israel News Staff Initial findings from a probe of security failures in Sderot on October 7th paint a disturbing picture, as disorganization and logistical issues appear to have exacerbated the horrific events of that day. According to a summary of the report from Hebrew-language outlet Ynet, the city's emergency response squad was woefully underprepared and incapable of effectively battling a terrorist invasion. The report found that the emergency squad members were only armed with their personal handguns, while Hamas terrorists roaming the street had automatic rifles. Months before the invasion, the resignation of Sderot Police Chief Kobi Harush triggered a bureaucratic policy, which required the members of the city's emergency squad members to return their automatic weapons to the IDF's Gaza Division. Harush, who resigned because he was diagnosed with cancer, was designated by the army to be the ultimate authority responsible for the emergency squad's rifles. Army policy required the weapons to be turned over to the military, until a new police chief in the city could be held responsible for the arms once again. Sderot Mayor Alon Davidi was reportedly not informed about the return of the weapons. Prior to the terror onslaught, Ronen Gabbay, Sderot's then-recently appointed Chief of Police, had made a request to the military for the return of the automatic weapons. Lengthy bureaucratic delays meant on October 7th, Gabbay's request was still being processed by the army. Additionally, the IDF did not schedule and carry out consistent training sessions with Sderot's emergency squad, in violation of army and security policies. Sderot's municipal bomb shelters, which were controlled by a central electronic system, failed to open during air raid sirens on October 7th. Families of victims murdered on that day are suing Motorola, which produced the 'smart' shelters, and the city of Sderot. If the doors of the shelters had opened, victims could have been protected from Hamas gunmen and rocket fire, the plaintiffs say.

Behind the release of five Thai hostages	Foreign Minister Gideon Saar urged his Thai counterpart to press the Egyptian and Qatari mediators while final deal details were being discussed. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Five Thai hostages are to be freed Thursday along with three Israelis due to behind-the-scenes diplomatic work of Foreign Minister Gideon Saar. About two weeks before the agreement was signed between Israel and Hamas to exchange 33 Israeli hostages for a ceasefire, a withdrawal of IDF forces to the borders of Gaza, and hundreds of Palestinian terrorists, Saar called his Thai counterpart, Maris Sangiampongsa. He explained the parameters of the incipient deal and told the kingdom’s top diplomat that he believed Thailand could take advantage of it to free at least some Thai hostages as well, just as happened in the only other deal to date, in late November 2023. At that time, over a period of a week, 86 Israeli women and children out of 251 taken captive during the Hamas-led invasion and massacre seven weeks earlier were freed in return for a temporary ceasefire, increased humanitarian aid, and some 250 female and underage Palestinian prisoners. During the staged release, 23 of 31 Thai agricultural workers who had been kidnapped from the border kibbutzim in which they worked were freed in small groups as well, without Hamas demanding anything of Thailand in return. It was reported at the time that Thai officials negotiated for their release through the Iranians, who were not part of any negotiating channel being used by Israel. This time, Saar recommended that the Thais press the American, Qatari and Egyptian mediators who were working hard to get the deal across the finish line before President Trump took office. Saar similarly briefed Nepalese Foreign Minister Dr. Arzu Rana Deuba, as one citizen from her country is also still being held captive in Gaza. These efforts have seemingly been crowned with partial if not full success with the announcement earlier in the week by Hamas that it would free five of the eight remaining Thai hostages. Their first destination in Israel will be the Shamir Medical Center, where their compatriots had been taken care of after their release fourtenn months ago. 'We don't know what their situation is. It can be very complex, and we are prepared to provide the best medical care,' said hospital director Dr. Osnat Levtzion Korach. 'The fact that they have no families and are foreign citizens means that the hospital staff becomes a family for them upon their return to Israel, with a lot of warmth, love, pampering and a lot of attention,' she added. To aid in their psychological rehabilitation, the hospital will provide a Thai-speaking psychologist and interpreters with the assistance of the Thai embassy, with whom they are in constant contact, she said. Also based on their previous experience, the hospital has already prepared a small Buddhist temple for the separate complex where the hostages will recuperate in a homey atmosphere, much like their Israeli counterparts. After this release, there will still be five foreigners left in Hamas captivity, two of whom, a Thai agricultural worker and Nepalese agricultural student, are still believed to be alive. Two other Thais and a Tanzanian agricultural intern are known to be dead.

Who is Arbel Yehud, held hostage in Gaza for 15 months?	Yehud is thought to be the last surviving Israeli female civilian hostage in Gaza. By World Israel News Staff Israeli hostage Arbel Yehud, who was kidnapped from the Gaza-adjacent Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7th, 2023, is expected to be released later today (Thursday, January 30). She was 28 years old when she was abducted from her home, alongside her boyfriend, Ariel Cunio, who will remain in Gaza until the next phase of the hostage deal. Yehud's brother, Dolev, was initially believed to also have been kidnapped. In June 2024, some 8 months after the massacre, his remains were discovered in the kibbutz. Yehud was slated to be freed last Saturday, alongside three female soldiers, in line with the order of releases outlined in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement. However, less than 24 hours before the exchange was set to take place, the Hamas terror group informed Israel that it would release an additional female soldier, rather than Yehud. This change was significant due to the fact that it marked a clear violation of the ceasefire. At the time, Hamas claimed that the delay in Yehud's release was due to a dispute with Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), the terror group that abducted her and has been holding her captive for more than 15 months. PIJ claimed that because Yehud allegedly underwent training as part of Israel's space program, she should be categorized as a soldier, not a civilian. This would force Israel to release a large number of terrorists from prison in order to secure her return. After Israel exerted pressure on Hamas by refusing to allow displaced Gazans to return to their homes in the north of the Strip until Yehud is scheduled for release, the terror group agreed to arrange her release five days later than originally anticipated. Yehud is thought to be the last surviving Israeli female civilian hostage in Gaza. One other civilian woman, Shiri Bibas, who was kidnapped with her toddler and infant sons, is still held captive. Israel has expressed 'grave concerns' regarding the fate of the Bibas family.

Will arch-terrorist Marwan Barghouti be freed in hostage deal?	Hamas appears confident that the mass murderer will be freed during the current ceasefire. By World Israel News Staff One of the most high-profile Palestinian terrorists of the First and Second Intifadas is expected to be released from an Israeli prison during the next phase of the hostage deal, Hamas officials say. Marwan Barghouti, who is serving multiple life sentences for planning deadly terror attacks that killed dozens of Israelis, is widely considered a folk hero among Palestinians. A wildly popular figure in both Gaza and Palestinian Authority-controlled enclaves in Judea and Samaria, polls have consistently found that Barghouti is the Palestinians' top choice for their leader. While Israel refused to release Barghouti in previous exchanges, including the 2011 Gilad Shalit deal, Hamas appears confident that the mass murderer will be freed during the current ceasefire. According to Hebrew-language media outlet KAN News, Hamas has told Barghouti's family to prepare for his release in the near future. 'It’s painful. It’s outrageous. Victims are outraged,' Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, president of the Shurat HaDin advocacy group for victims of terror, told The Media Line. 'How can it be that someone responsible for so many deaths could walk free? This is not just about Barghouti—it’s about justice for all victims.' Darshan-Leitner noted that 'Barghouti is not just any prisoner. His release would send a message that acts of terror can be forgiven, which is a dangerous precedent. The pain of the victims' families cannot simply be ignored in political negotiations.' Barghouti's son, Arab, told The Media Line that he was certain his father would be freed soon. 'We really trust that he will be released at the end of this because he belongs amongst the Palestinian people, and his influence is very positive for the Palestinian unity,' he said. If Barghouti is freed, he may be deported to Turkey, Qatar, or another state that has hosted exiled Palestinian terrorists.

3 Turks attempting to infiltrate from Lebanon killed by IDF	It's unclear if the Turkish nationals were affiliated with Hezbollah or another terror group. By World Israel News Staff Three Turkish nationals attempting to illegally cross from southern Lebanon into Israel were killed by an Israeli Air Force airstrike, according to a media statement from Turkey's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday. ''We wish Allah’s mercy upon our citizens and extend our condolences to their families,' the Ministry said, adding that Ankara is attempting to repatriate the bodies for burial in Turkey. 'We condemn in the strongest terms this unlawful attack that resulted in the death of our citizens,' the statement continued, without acknowledging the suspicious activity in which the slain men were engaged. 'As we have emphasized on every occasion, Israel must immediately end its aggressive policies that disregard human life and escalate tensions in our region,' the Ministry added. While the Turkish Foreign Ministry did not state the location or date of the strike, it appears that Ankara is referring to an incident that took place on January 11. On that day, the IDF released a statement acknowledging that it had killed three suspects who were trying to illegally infiltrate into Israeli territory from the Lebanese side of Mount Dov. The IDF statement did not provide details regarding the identity of the men. It's unclear if the Turkish nationals were affiliated with Hezbollah or another terror group. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is openly hostile towards the Jewish State, having repeatedly expressed support for Hamas and hosting the terror group's leadership. In November 2024, Erdoğan praised the ICC warrants issued against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Erdoğan has previously referred to Netanyahu as 'worse than Hitler' and a 'vampire that feeds on blood.' The Turkish leader has also claimed that Israel is a 'terrorist state' engaged in a 'genocide' against the Palestinian people.

Israel demands Hamas clarify condition of hostage mother Shiri Bi...	Although Shiri Bibas and her children were on the list of the 33 hostages slated for release in the initial stage, their absence from previous releases has been noted. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel has demanded information and clarity on the status of hostage mother Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir. The first phase of the hostage release deal was meant to prioritize women, children, the elderly, and the ill. Although Shiri Bibas and her children were on the list of the 33 hostages slated for release in the initial stage, their absence from previous releases has been noted. Hamas reported that 25 of the 33 hostages slated for release are alive and would return in the first part of the agreement, while the bodies of deceased captives would be handed over later. Last week, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari expressed 'grave concerns' over the fate of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir. The Israeli government is insisting on clarity regarding their status so that they can provide answers to the family. Relatives of the Bibas family expressed that their 'world came crashing down' when Shiri and her children were not on the list of hostages slated for release on Saturday. Yarden Bibas, Shiri Bibas’s husband and the father of the children, is scheduled to be released later in the first phase of the hostage deal. On Saturday night, relatives of the Bibas family released a statement criticizing the Israeli media for not addressing 'our pain, our struggle, and, most importantly, the urgent need to address the complexity and tragedy of their absence from the list.' The statement continued, 'Does the profound worry for their lives override the fact that they are innocent civilians in captivity who must be brought home?' they asked. 'Does the deep concern for Shiri’s life erase the need to show her photo as a kidnapped civilian in Gaza, whose fate remains uncertain?' 'The answer is—no.' The statement went on to express happiness over the release of four female soldiers-Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy, and Liri Albag-on Saturday night, while resolving to continue fighting for the return of the Bibas family. 'Liri, Daniela, Naama, and Karina — We are waiting to see you smile, surrounded by love, back home with your amazing families. Shiri, Yarden, Ariel, and Kfir — We will keep hoping and fighting for your return. It’s not over until it’s over,' the relatives’ statement concluded.

Combative Jewish lawmaker Randy Fine, a Trump favorite, wins Flor...	Soon after announcing his candidacy, he tweeted '#BombsAway' at pro-Palestinian Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, which Muslim-rights groups and the Anti-Defamation League condemned as a threat. By Andrew Lapin, JTA Randy Fine, a Jewish Florida state senator whose bruising demeanor has made him a new favorite on the right, easily won the Republican primary for an open House seat. An Associated Press estimate showed that Fine took more than 80% of the GOP vote on Tuesday. The district is deep red, making his victory in the April 1 special election all but assured. He would replace Michael Waltz, who left Congress to become Trump’s national security advisor. Fine decided to run in the district, even though he does not currently live there, after receiving an enthusiastic endorsement from President Donald Trump. He did not immediately return a Jewish Telegraphic Agency request for comment on his victory. But on social media, he made clear the spiritual reason why he ran. The northeast Florida district has few Jews but many conservative Christians. 'G-d saved @realDonaldTrump’s life so he could save the world,' the state senator wrote on X. 'And tonight, both of them, powered by my amazing family and all of you who voted for me, put me one step closer to being able to help him do that. I swear I won’t let any of you down.' Fine has used his Jewish and ardent pro-Israel background to court controversy. Soon after announcing his candidacy, he tweeted '#BombsAway' at pro-Palestinian Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, which Muslim-rights groups and the Anti-Defamation League condemned as a threat. (Fine denied he meant the remark as a threat.) In his home state he has called progressive Jewish critics 'Judenrat,' a term denoting Jewish councils who helped the Nazis. He has also clashed with the LGBTQ community and with local judges, and was formerly a close ally of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis until Fine became frustrated with DeSantis’s handling of antisemitism and Israel issues. Many Jews have embraced him, and he received endorsements from the Republican Jewish Coalition and the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC, whom he thanked on X after his victory with the message 'Supporting Israel IS America first.' Fine also has a legislative track record of fighting antisemitism, having passed laws in his home state to help law enforcement prosecute white nationalists. He recently prompted a textbook review for antisemitism and anti-Israel bias across Florida’s public university system.

‘It’s devastating to see your home like this’: Returning to ruins...	In Metula, Israel’s northernmost city, hardly any house has been spared from either a direct hit or shrapnel. In the homes that somehow avoided being hit, an atmosphere of neglect and despair pervades. By Anna Epshtein, TPS 'Oh my! There is a rat here!' Lili screams as she opens a drawer in the kitchen. The smell of the dead animal hangs in the air. Curious teenage volunteers who were emptying drawers in an adjoining room approach to look, then scrunch their faces in disgust. Unshaken, Lili takes a serving spoon and uses it to lift the rat into the garbage bag, together with the rest of the drawer’s contents — papers, small plastic containers and scattered toothpicks. Lili Medalsi is a volunteer coordinator at the organization called 'Habaita,' and her job for the near future is helping northern Israelis make their abandoned homes livable — or helping them say goodbye like she did for her own house. 'When my partner and I first came here after the ceasefire, we froze in place and could not move. We stood like this for three hours and then left. Could not do a thing,' Shahaf Daniel, who used to rent the upper floor of this house in Metula, told The Press Service of Israel. 'It’s devastating to see you home like this.' Rat excrement is scattered all over. In a bedroom on the first floor, a hole in a wall – the result of rocket shrapnel – creates an expressive frame through which to view a neighbor’s half-destroyed house. After the war with Hamas broke out on October 7, 2023, more than 70,000 residents of the Israeli north were evacuated from their homes as Hezbollah began launching daily barrages of rockets and drones. In Metula, Israel’s northernmost city, hardly any house has been spared from either a direct hit or shrapnel. In the homes that somehow avoided being hit, an atmosphere of neglect and despair pervades. Since a ceasefire with Hezbollah took effect on November 27, hundreds of volunteers from all over Israel have been coming to the north to help the residents restore not just their homes, but also hope that life can get back to normal. Inside the ‘War Room’ In a small room above the dining hall in Kibbutz Amir, some 10 km from the Lebanese border, a dozen teenagers are juggling Excel spreadsheets on their computers, with a background buzz of phone conversations. A bald, bearded man moves among them, one hand holding a cell phone to his ear, the other hand intensely gesturing. The man is Nathanel Barak, the head of the Upper Galilee Pre-Military Academy, which has more than 200 students. Bringing his military attitude to the civilian task of organizing the volunteers’ work, he partnered with two organizations involved in helping Israeli civilians since October 7 – Lev Ehad and Habaita – to open what everyone here refers to as 'the war room,' where coordinators connect returning homeowners with volunteers. 'When a family enters their home after more than a year, it is often a shock. Rats have eaten the pipes, there is this smell… They don’t just need extra hands for cleaning – they need emotional support, and that’s what volunteers bring,' Barak told TPS-IL. 'What really helps people is this feeling that they don’t deal with this alone, that good people from all over the country come to help them.' Most of the volunteers here are Barak’s students, but many more have come to help from all walks of Israeli society: families with kids, youth and pensioners. Some come to the north for a day, others stay for a week or even more. At nearby Kibbutz Malkiya, once a popular tourist destination right on the border with Lebanon, orange-jacketed workers from Tel Aviv patching up a pock-marked road are the only people around. Seats at a nearby bus stop are covered with a thick layer of faded leaves. Inside a gloomy concrete building that used to house a different pre-military academy, a group of people who could hardly be brought together under any other circumstances are gathering for dinner of couscous and vegetables – several youths from Haifa, a pensioner from Modiin, and an American pastor from Seattle — after a busy day of cleaning homes. 'We helped two nice old ladies in Kiryat Shmona today in their gardens,' Mika Mazor, a twentysomething from Haifa said. 'They were so glad we came. They put on some music, and we chatted, and it felt like we really made some difference there.' One of Mika’s friends interjects, 'It’s so weird that we are here, right?’ We all have lives… But it feels so good to be here now.' Not Staying Medalsi, who helped clean Daniel’s house, told TPS-IL that she also has a house in Metula, but doesn’t intend to continue to living in the city. 'The community is dispersed throughout the whole country. Before businesses here will come back to life -– and I pray they will -– much time will pass,' Medalsi explained. 'Metula is going to be in building scaffolding for a long time. I found myself in another part of the country during the war. But it is a personal victory for me that I am back to the north now, helping people.' She recalled being in her kitchen preparing to bake herself a birthday cake on October 9 when she needed to evacuate. When she returned to her house for the first time after the ceasefire was declared, the ingredients were still sitting on the counter. The dozens of houseplants she cared for were all dead. 'I finally locked my house a week ago after I painted it and fixed the holes. I pressed myself to the wall and said good bye,' she said. 'I’m not coming back.' Meanwhile, Shahaf Daniel and her partner pack all the belongings they want to take with them and take a walk around the empty house. They don’t plan to stay in Metula either. 'I need my country to do something for me to come back here. It’s impossible that Lebanese villages stay like these, so close to us. I do not want to be afraid that they watch me, or that a rocket hits me,' said Shachaf. 'They need to be moved further from the border, and the IDF needs to be here. Then I can start to consider getting back.'

Targeted mRNA therapy holds promise for Crohn’s disease, colitis,...	The findings suggest that lipid composition can direct mRNA-based drugs to target organs, such as the intestines, without passing through the liver. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli researchers unveiled on Wednesday a new method of delivering drugs that could lead to more effective treatments for gastrointestinal conditions such as Crohn’s disease and colitis, and opens a door to targeted therapies for other conditions. Typically, when drugs are injected into the bloodstream, they pass through the liver, where they can either be processed or broken down. This process can limit the effectiveness of medications designed to target specific organs or cells, especially if the liver metabolizes the drugs before they can reach their intended destination. In the case of mRNA-based drugs — which use messenger RNA (mRNA) to instruct cells to produce specific proteins that can treat or prevent disease — the liver is the primary site of drug breakdown. However, Tel Aviv University researchers led by Dr. Riccardo Rampado and Prof. Dan Peer demonstrated that it is possible to bypass the liver and control where in the body mRNA-based drugs are delivered by altering the composition of lipid nanoparticles that encapsulate the mRNA. The study was recently published in the peer-reviewed Advanced Science journal. The findings suggest that lipid composition can direct mRNA-based drugs to target organs, such as the intestines, without passing through the liver. The team’s proof-of-concept study focused on delivering mRNA encoding interleukin-10, an anti-inflammatory protein, to the intestines of animal models suffering from Crohn’s disease and colitis. The mRNA was encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles with a higher phospholipid content than those used in typical mRNA vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccine. The researchers found that increasing the phospholipid ratio to 30% enabled the particles to navigate through the bloodstream directly to the intestines. This approach not only targeted the inflamed tissues but also encouraged immune cells in the intestine to produce the therapeutic protein, significantly improving symptoms of both conditions. By adjusting the lipid composition, the researchers could potentially deliver mRNA-based drugs to other organs, including the pancreas, further expanding the range of treatable diseases. 'It’s all in the formulation,' Peer said. For example, medicine might enable the targeting of immune cells in the pancreas to treat conditions like type 1 diabetes or even autoimmune disorders affecting the pancreas. Similarly, the approach could potentially be adapted to target other organs, such as the brain, liver, or lungs, allowing for more tailored and effective therapies. Moreover, many side effects occur as a result of drugs passing through multiple organs. Direct delivery would minimize those side effects.

IDF downs drone carrying 13 rifles, ammo near Egypt border	On Nov. 27, the IDF shot down another drone carrying weapons and ammo and crossed from Egyptian territory into the western Negev. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces on Wednesday downed an unmanned aerial vehicle carrying 13 rifles with ammunition that had crossed into Israeli territory from Egypt, according to the military. Soldiers of the IDF’s Paran Brigade shot down the drone, which was then handed over to security forces for inspection, the IDF stated. כוחות צה״ל זיהו במהלך הלילה, רחפן שחצה משטח מצרים לשטח מדינת ישראל במרחב חטיבת פארן. הרחפן הופל על-ידי הכוח שהגיע לנקודה ואותרו על הרחפן 13 כלי נשק ומחסניות נוספות. אמצעי הלחימה שהוחרמו הועברו לטיפול כוחות הביטחון pic.twitter.com/ywFBbA6XA9 &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) January 29, 2025 On Nov. 27, the IDF shot down another drone carrying weapons and ammo and crossed from Egyptian territory into the western Negev.

Three Israeli hostages, five Thais slated for release Thursday	Some of the families of hostages scheduled to be released have been informed that there are fears for their loved ones’ lives after Hamas provided Israel with information on the captives on Monday. By JNS Israel received from Hamas a list of three Israeli hostages and five Thai captives expected to be released tomorrow, Israel’s public broadcaster Kan News reported on Wednesday. According to reports, they are expected to be Arbel Yehud, a civilian, Agam Berger, an IDF lookout, and Gadi Moses, an 80-year-old. On Saturday, Hamas failed to provide a list detailing the status of the hostages slated to be released in the initial stage, as required by the terms of the deal, prompting Jerusalem to postpone the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza. However, they were allowed to return on Monday morning. Hamas further violated the agreement by not freeing female civilians first. Instead of releasing Yehud, the Palestinian terror group released four female soldiers on Saturday: Karina Ariev, 20; Daniella Gilboa, 20; Naama Levy, 20; and Liri Albag, 19. Yehud was taken hostage with her boyfriend, Ariel Cunio, from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7, 2023. Cunio, 27, is presumed to be alive but is not listed among those to be released in the first phase of the agreement. Shiri Bibas, 33, another female civilian hostage, and her two young sons are on the list of hostages to be released during the first phase. However, Hamas claimed in November that they had been killed. Some of the families of hostages scheduled to be released have been informed that there are fears for their loved ones’ lives, after Hamas provided Israel with information on the captives on Monday. The list did not specify the status of individuals, and instead only included an overall number of captives who are claimed to be alive. While Israeli officials are unable to provide relatives with definitive news regarding the possible deaths of their loved ones, the numbers were said to match the intelligence Jerusalem already possessed. Three civilian women—Emily Damari, Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher—were released on Jan. 19 in return for 90 terrorists (30 for each civilian) shortly after the ceasefire went into effect.

Israel arrests 12 Arabs for celebrating release of terrorists in ...	The eastern Jerusalem and Aqab village residents had waved Hamas flags and shot in the air to show support for one of the terrorists freed Saturday. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Twelve Arabs were arrested Tuesday night by Israeli authorities after they were involved in a demonstration showing support for a terrorist who was released as part of the exchange for four hostages Saturday. The police and Shabak tracked them down using video footage that was circulated online of the event and conducting several intelligence operations. On the clip, the mix of residents of eastern Jerusalem and the village of Aqab on the northern edge of the capital could be seen celebrating the freedom of Zayeed Ashraf by waving Hamas flags, chanting in support for the Al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, and expressing joy by shooting into the air in the village. When the police, Shabak, Border Police undercover unit and IDF forces raided their homes, they found Hamas flags, posters, fireworks, a large sum of money, and other incriminatory items. One of those arrested was Ashraf’s brother, who played a central role in the celebratory demonstration. The forces also seized the vehicles the suspects used in their party. In 2002, Ashraf sent a suicide bomber to blow himself up on a bus on Allenby Street in Tel Aviv, killing six people, and he was sentenced to six life terms as a result. Immediately upon his release, he gave an interview to the Qatari TV channel Al-Araby to claim that Israel 'starves' its prisoners 'on a daily basis,' although he did not look particularly thin in the video clips showing him being carried on the shoulders of his fellow villagers. Nine other suspects from Kafr Aqab and the village of Kafr A-Ram near Ramallah were also arrested for similarly expressing solidarity with released terrorists. 'The Israel Police and the Shabak will not allow any displays of joy or expressions of identification with and support for the Hamas terrorist organization and terrorists,' the authorities said in a statement. 'The security forces will use all means at their disposal to maintain security and order.' Defense Minister Yisrael Katz had ordered that a joint force be established specifically to prevent such demonstrations, considering them incitement and encouragement of terrorism. The twelve were taken to the Jerusalem District Police's Serious Crimes Unit for further questioning. They will be brought Wednesday to court for the police to ask to extend their detention in custody.

IDF forces to remain in Jenin after operation completed	Israel 'declares war on Palestinian terror in Judea and Samaria,' as defense minister says IDF forces will stay in Jenin even after the current counter-terror operation is completed. By World Israel News Staff Israel's latest counter-terror operation in northern Samaria constitutes a 'declaration of war' on Palestinian terrorism, the Israeli defense chief Israel Katz announced Wednesday, vowing to keep IDF forces in the Palestinian Authority-administered city of Jenin even after the operation is completed. Earlier this month, Israeli forces launched Operation Iron Wall against the Jenin Brigades, an umbrella group of terrorist organizations in the city of Jenin in northern Samaria. The operation was launched after the Palestinian Authority's paramilitary security force failed to wrest control of the city from rival groups during clashes in December and January. On Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) visited IDF forces operating in Jenin, accompanied by Central Command Chief Major General Avi Blot, Judea and Samaria Division Commander Brigadier General Yaki Dolf, Menashe Brigade Commander Colonel A., and other senior officers. During his visit, Katz held a situational assessment on-site and stated that Operation Iron Wall would expand to additional terror camps beyond Jenin. He emphasized the need to act with full force to implement the policy of eliminating terrorists and dismantling terrorist infrastructure in the camp, ensuring that terrorism does not return after the operation concludes. Katz was briefed by IDF officers about the massive weapons seizures in the Jenin refugee camp, which some officers described as being 'just like in Gaza.' The Defense Minister said that Israel has 'declared war on Palestinian terrorism in Judea and Samaria,' and that Operation Iron Wall will 'dismantle the terror infrastructure built in Palestinian refugee camps, funded and armed by Iran.' 'The IDF is operating with full force in the Jenin refugee camp to eliminate terrorists and destroy terror infrastructure, as we have seen here today.' Katz added that IDF forces will remain in Jenin even after the current operation is completed, hinting at a long-term deployment, and a possible alteration to the status quo in the PA-administered city. 'The Jenin refugee camp will not return to what it was. After the operation is completed, IDF forces will remain in the camp to ensure that terrorism does not return.' 'I am sending a clear message to the Palestinian Authority: Stop funding terrorism and the murder of Jews, and start seriously fighting terror. Those who finance the families of terrorist murderers and educate their children to seek Israel’s destruction endanger their own existence.'

Dr. Avner Eckner, of Hebrew University, suggested that the two defendants were either engaged in evading Roman taxes or possibly fulfilling a Biblical duty to redeem enslaved Jews. By Pesach Benson, TPS A newly analyzed papyrus has unveiled a spectacular case of forgery and fiscal fraud in the Roman Empire, providing scholars with rare insight into the legal and administrative workings of the imperial state. Discovered among the collections of the Israel Antiquities Authority and recently published in the international scholarly journal Tyche, the document details a financial crime involving tax fraud and the illegal sale and manumission of slaves in the Roman provinces of Judea and Arabia. The case, which took place against the backdrop of political unrest in the region, offers a direct look at Roman jurisdiction, legal practice, and the turbulent relationship between the empire and its subjects. The Greek-language papyrus, the longest ever found in the Judean Desert with over 133 lines of text, had remained unnoticed for decades after being misclassified as Nabataean. Its significance came to light in 2014 when Professor Hannah Cotton-Paltiel of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem rediscovered it while organizing documentary papyri at the Israel Antiquities Authority’s scrolls laboratory. Upon realizing the misclassification, Cotton-Paltiel exclaimed, 'It’s Greek to me!' In recognition of her role in its rediscovery, the document has been named P. Cotton in line with papyrological conventions. Understanding the importance of the document, she assembled a team of scholars from the Austrian Academy of Sciences, the University of Vienna, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem to decipher the text. They determined that the papyrus contained notes from prosecutors preparing for a trial before Roman officials on the eve of the Bar Kochba revolt (132–136 CE). The text includes a draft transcript of the judicial hearing itself, making it a rare and valuable source for understanding Roman legal procedures. The language is strikingly direct, capturing exchanges between prosecutors as they strategized and assessed evidence. 'This papyrus is extraordinary because it provides direct insight into trial preparations in this part of the Roman Empire,' said Dr. Anna Dolganov of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. The case revolves around two defendants, Gadalias and Saulos, who were accused of tax evasion and document forgery. Gadalias, the son of a notary and possibly a Roman citizen, had a history of criminal activities, including counterfeiting, extortion, and inciting rebellion. Saulos, his accomplice, orchestrated fraudulent transactions with forged documents involving the selling and freeing of slaves. 'Freeing slaves does not appear to be a profitable business model,' said Dr. Avner Eckner of Hebrew University, suggesting that the two were either engaged in evading Roman taxes or possibly fulfilling a Biblical duty to redeem enslaved Jews. Said Dolganov, 'Forgery and tax fraud carried severe penalties under Roman law, including hard labor or even capital punishment.' The historical context surrounding the case adds another layer of intrigue. The trial took place between two significant Jewish revolts against Roman rule: the Jewish Diaspora revolt (115–117 CE) and the Bar Kochba revolt (132–136 CE). The text suggests that Gadalias and Saulos may have been involved in rebellious activities during Emperor Hadrian’s visit to the region in 129–130 CE. Their case also names Tineius Rufus, the governor of Judea at the time the Bar Kochba revolt erupted, suggesting that Roman authorities were deeply concerned about the implications of their actions. 'Whether they were indeed involved in rebellion remains an open question, but the insinuation speaks to the charged atmosphere of the time,' explained Dolganov. Beyond its historical and political implications, the papyrus sheds new light on Roman law in the Greek-speaking eastern empire. It references the governor’s assize tour of his province to hear legal cases and administer justice. The reference to compulsory jury service confirms that legal institutions known from Egypt were also in effect in other provinces. 'This document shows that core Roman institutions documented in Egypt were also implemented throughout the empire,' noted Prof. Fritz Mitthof of the University of Vienna. Additionally, the papyrus highlights the Roman state’s ability to regulate private transactions even in the empire’s distant regions. The outcome of the trial may have been disrupted by the rebellion, leaving unanswered questions about the fate of the accused, the researchers said. The document was likely hidden in a cave in the Judaean Desert during the Bar Kochba revolt.

Senate Dems block bill to impose sanctions on International Crimi...	Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote on Tuesday that he supports imposing sanctions on the court in response to its investigation of Israel but that the bill’s provisions were overly broad. By Andrew Bernard, JNS Democrats in the U.S. Senate blocked a bill on Tuesday that would impose sanctions on the International Criminal Court over its decision to investigate and issue warrants for the arrest of Israeli officials, including the Israeli prime minister. Republicans needed 60 votes to invoke cloture and proceed, but the vote failed 54-45, with Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) the lone Democrat to vote 'yea.' The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Illegitimate Court Counteraction (ICC) Act earlier this month 243-140, with 45 Democrats voting in favor. The bill instructs the U.S. president to impose sanctions within 60 days on anyone who 'has directly engaged in or otherwise aided any effort by the International Criminal Court to investigate, arrest, detain or prosecute' U.S. citizens or the citizens of U.S. allies not party to the ICC’s Rome Statute, including Israel. In November, the ICC, a stand-alone court in The Hague which is not part of the United Nations, issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant, the former defense minister, for alleged 'crimes against humanity and war crimes' in Gaza. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote on Tuesday that he supports imposing sanctions on the court in response to its investigation of Israel but that the bill’s provisions were overly broad. 'The ICC bill is one I largely support and would like to see become law,' Schumer said. 'However, as much as I oppose the ICC’s deep bias against Israel, and as much as I want to see that institution drastically reformed and reshaped, the bill before us is poorly drafted and deeply problematic.' In the floor debate on the bill, Republicans and Democrats disagreed on how wide a net ought to be cast in applying sanctions to ICC employees and contractors. 'Others have said the ICC bill targets ‘citizens of our allies,’' Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said. 'Yes, if you are involved in illegitimately targeting Americans, you could face sanctions.' 'This bill does not, once again, sanction foreign nations like the United Kingdom, but if British nationals at the court are targeting American citizens, you better believe they could face sanctions,' Cotton added. Fetterman wrote that he was 'deeply disappointed' about the outcome of the vote. 'My vote follows Israel—not the ICC that equivocated the democratically elected leader of our special ally to the terrorists and rapists of Hamas,' Fetterman said.

Trump’s intelligence director nominee denies meeting Hezbollah of...	Tulsi Gabbard said she did talk in 2017 with the head of Lebanese intelligence, who was close to the terror group. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News In the runup to her Senate confirmation hearing Thursday, Tulsi Gabbard, U.S. President Donald Trump's nominee for Director of Intelligence, denied meeting with a senior Hezbollah official during a trip to Syria in 2017. A New York Times report Wednesday revealed that during her visit, which she made in her position as a Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, she met with then-dictator Bashar al-Assad, who was overthrown last month by Islamist rebels. Citing 'current and former officials briefed on the intelligence,' the report said that soon afterwards, the Americans intercepted a phone call in which one Hezbollah member told another that Gabbard had met with someone he called in Arabic 'the boss,' or 'the big guy.' Some intelligence personnel thought this was a reference to a high-ranking member of the Iranian terror proxy, while others thought the person may instead have been a Lebanese government official with close ties to Hezbollah, said the report. Gabbard repudiated the idea that she had met directly with a member of the terror organization, but conceded that she had met with several Lebanese officials during her trip. This included the country’s then-intelligence chief, who was considered close to the group that had been a powerful and long-time agent of Iran within the Lebanese government. Hezbollah’s influence has since been considerably diminished after the IDF decimated its leadership and destroyed most of its armaments and offensive military capabilities late last year, and weakened its patron in airstrikes that took out most of Iran’s air defenses after Tehran launched hundreds of missiles at Israel, which were almost all intercepted and did little harm. Gabbard confidantes noted that she had disclosed the identities of all the people she met with on her trip 'and they said the intelligence in question was misinterpreted,' the report said. Although she is essentially an isolationist like Trump with little interest in getting involved in 'counterproductive wars of regime change,' she has also described herself as a hawk 'when it comes to the war against terrorists,' calling Islamic extremists 'the real enemy' of the U.S. Although not always so, she has recently been a firm supporter of Israel, immediately labeling Hamas an Islamist terrorist organization that 'needs to be defeated militarily and ideologically' after the group led a surprise invasion of the Jewish state in October 2023, slaughtering 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages into captivity. She was opposed to a UN ceasefire resolution last year, saying, 'We have to be realists about the threat that continues to exist for the people of Israel. So as long as Hamas is in power, the people of Israel will not be secure and cannot live in peace.' As director of national intelligence, Gabbard would be the head of the entire U.S. intelligence community, acting as the principal adviser to the president, the National Security Council, and the Homeland Security Council for intelligence matters related to national security. In terms of relevant experience for the position, she has no intelligence background but is a Lieutenant Colonel in the army reserves with top-secret security clearance who served in places such as Iraq and Kuwait. The 43-year-old turned Republican and became an enthusiastic Trump supporter two years ago.

Congressional Republicans push to replace ‘West Bank’ with ‘Judea...	Republican lawmakers relaunch bid, supported by President Donald Trump, to end use of the phrase 'West Bank' in all official federal documents in favor of the area's historical name, Judea and Samaria. By World Israel News Staff A Republican congresswoman is rebooting legislative efforts to replace the term 'West Bank' with 'Judea and Samaria' in all official federal documents. New York Rep. Claudia Tenney announced last week at a meeting of the Congressional Israel Allies Caucus that she plans on reintroducing a bill which would replace the term 'West Bank' with the historical name for the territories occupied by Jordan west of the Jordan River from 1948-1967. 'We need to make sure that we don’t allow the language, the tradition, the history of Israel, to be weaponized by terms like ‘West Bank,’' Tenney said, noting that President Donald Trump has expressed support for the move. 'President Trump has said this is going to be a very priority task for him to get this done,' Tenney said. 'It’s the beginning of us shifting the language, and what we’re doing and making sure that we always protect the historical homeland of the Jews, and that is in Israel, and Israel includes Judea and Samaria.' Last February, Tenney introduced a bill, cosponsored by fellow Republican lawmakers Anthony D’Esposito and Randy Weber, which, if passed would 'require all official United States documents and materials to use the term 'Judea and Samaria' instead of the 'West Bank'.' 'The term Judea and Samaria dates back millennia to the ancient Kingdoms of Judah and Samaria,' Tenney said after the drafting of the 2024 bill. 'In 1967, after Israel’s Arab neighbors launched the Six-Day War, Israel reclaimed Judea and Samaria from Jordan. The term 'West Bank' is used to delegitimize Israel’s historical claim to this land.' In December, Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas introduced parallel legislation to the Senate. According to a report by Yedioth Aharanoth, Cotton is also planning to reintroduce his bill this year.

US halts funding for Gaza condoms	Trump White House slams $50 million program funding Gaza condoms as a 'preposterous waste of taxpayer money,' while past attacks suggest Hamas may have used condoms for makeshift balloon bombs. By World Israel News Staff The Trump administration has halted American funding for a program supplying the Gaza Strip with condoms, the new White House press secretary said Tuesday. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt castigated the program during her press briefing representing the Trump administration, telling reporters Tuesday that funding Gaza condoms was a 'preposterous waste' of American tax dollars. 'That is a preposterous waste of taxpayer money. So that's what this pause is focused on, being good stewards of tax dollars,' Leavitt said. According to the White House press secretary, the new Department of Government Efficiency, headed by Elon Musk, and the Office of Budget Management had found 'that there was about to be $50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza.' The two offices also reported that the U.S. was poised to transfer $37 million to the World Health Organization, before Trump cut America's ties with the organization. The $50 million Gaza condom program was cut after Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a directive over the weekend halting nearly all foreign aid programs, pending a systematic internal review of every program receiving American funds. Rubio's internal memo came in response to an executive order issued by President Donald Trump last week on the first day of his second term, ordering federal authorities to pause foreign aid while scrutinizing U.S. funding for programs abroad. Military aid to Egypt and Israel were both granted waivers from the order, as were emergency food programs. A White House official told Fox News that under Trump's executive order, programs contradicting the White House's 'priorities' will see their funding terminated, citing both the Gaza condom program and U.S. funding for the WHO. 'If the activity is not in conflict with the President’s priorities, it will continue with no issues,' the White House official said. 'This is similar to how HHS stopped the flow of grant money to the WHO after President Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the organization. Or how the State Department halted several million dollars going to condoms in Gaza this past weekend.' Aside from concerns over the misuse of American taxpayer funds, the Gaza condom program has raised fears that the aid could indirectly support terrorism by organizations like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which have in the past used condoms for makeshift balloon-based incendiary bombs to spark fires in Israeli territory.

Israeli contractor mistakenly shot dead by IDF in Gaza	We can't fathom that we're speaking about him in the past tense,' says friend of man killed in friendly-fire incident. By World Israel News Staff A civilian contractor working for as an engineer for the Defense Ministry was mistakenly shot and killed by IDF forces in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, the military said in a media statement. Hebrew-language media identified the slain man as Kobi Avitan, a 39-year-old father of three and Eilat resident. According to reports, Avitan was operating an excavator to clear damaged structures in the Netzarim Corridor area of central Gaza. Throughout the war, the Defense Ministry has hired civilian contractors for engineering and other activities within the Strip. This practices eases the burden on IDF troops and allows the military to leverage them for combat missions, rather than other tasks. An initial IDF investigation found that a soldier guarding a post near Netzarim opened fire on Avitan after falsely identifying him as a terrorist. 'Kobi was a man with a huge heart. We can't fathom that we're speaking about him in the past tense. Whatever we needed, he was the first to come and help, always volunteering,' Nati Twito a friend of Avitan, told Walla. 'He volunteered in many places, in anything he could help with, he was there. This is a massive tragedy. Everyone is shocked and in disbelief, unable to comprehend that Kobi is no longer with us,' Twito added. The slaying of Avitan marked the first time since the beginning of the ceasefire that an Israeli was killed in the coastal enclave. The last fatalities before the ceasefire occurred in Beit Hanoun on January 13th, when Hamas terrorists fired an anti-tank missile at a building, killing five soldiers from the Nahal Brigade. In May 2024, another civilian contractor, identified as Liron Yitzhak, 30, was killed during an attack by Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip. 840 Israeli soldiers and police officers have been killed since the war began on October 7th, 2023.

Israeli tourists required to disclose IDF service before entering...	Visa application to New Zealand asks Israelis if they have 'committed or been involved in war crimes, crimes against humanity, or human rights abuses.' By World Israel News Staff New Zealand recently denied a tourist visa to an Israeli citizen who served in Gaza, signaling that the country is adopting a policy similar to that of neighboring Australia. According to a Zman Israel report, New Zealand now requires Israelis to disclose extensive details about their military service when applying for a visa. The country requires Israelis to detail sensitive information about their military service, including their army identification numbers, their roles and details of their duties, locations of the bases where they served, the name of their unit or corps, and more. Israelis who served in classified roles are forbidden from providing many these details, making it impossible for them to apply for a visa at this time, Zman Israel reported. An additional questionnaire asks applicants if they have 'committed or been involved in war crimes, crimes against humanity, or human rights abuses.' The application also asks if Israelis are associated with 'a group or organization that has used or promoted violence or human rights abuses to further their aims.' One Israeli, speaking anonymously to Zman Israel, said that he had been denied a visa after revealing he had performed military service in Gaza, despite answering no to the questions about being complicit in human rights violations and war crimes. Notably, INZ, New Zealand’s immigration authority, did not dispute that they had denied a visa to an Israeli solely because he had served in the Gaza Strip. 'INZ understands the difficult situation this crisis is causing for many and has great sympathy for those separated from their loved ones during this stressful time,' the INZ told Zman Israel. 'A visitor visa can be declined for a number of reasons, and it is difficult for us to comment on why a person’s application was declined without the details of their application. Immigration instructions do not prevent individuals who have served in this conflict from applying for or being granted a visitor visa.'

Emiratis to acquire 30% stake in Israeli security company	Israel’s Ministry of Defense must grant permission for the deal to move forward. By World Israel News Staff A major military technology firm in the United Arab Emirates is gearing up to purchase a large stake in an Israeli security company, illustrating the growing defense-focused ties between the UAE and the Jewish State. The EDGE Group, an Emirati technology and defense conglomerate, is expected to pay more than $10 million for 30 percent of Israeli company Third Eye Systems, which manufactures smart cameras for detecting UAVs and drones. The outline for the deal would see EDGE Group purchase the shares, then the two companies establish a joint venture, according to a report from Hebrew-language outlet Walla. In that new company, which will focus on electrical optical identification systems, EDGE Group will invest an additional $12 million and will hold a controlling 51 percent stake in the company. 43 percent of the new venture will be held by Third Eye Systems, with an undisclosed body holding the remaining 6 percent. However, due to the sensitive nature of the military technology included in the agreement, Israel’s Ministry of Defense must grant permission for the deal to move forward. Third Eye Systems is chaired by retired Major General Didi Yaari, former commander of the Israeli Navy and the ex-CEO of Rafael, Israel’s most prominent defense manufacturing company. Its clients include the Ministry of Defense, Israel Aerospace Industries, and Elbit Systems. Currently, Third Eye Systems is traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange at a valuation of 84 million shekels ($23 million), with its stock surging 23 percent following the announcement of the potential deal with EDGE Group, Walla reported. One of the world’s top manufacturers and suppliers of precision guided munitions, the EDGE Group has made a number of high-profile investments in other defense companies in recent years. In 2021, the EDGE Group signed an agreement with Israel Aerospace Industries to manufacture autonomous vessels for military and commercial use.

Freed hostage Naama Levy: ‘I saw how you were fighting for me’	I’m safe and protected, surrounded by family and friends, and feeling better with each passing day.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Freed hostage Naama Levy posted on social media Tuesday for the first time since her release, thanking her family, the IDF, and Israel. 'I want to thank the IDF soldiers and all the people of Israel. Even in captivity, I saw how you were fighting for me! Thank you, everyone; I love you,' she posted. 'I’m home. After 477 days, I’m finally home,' she wrote. 'I’m safe and protected, surrounded by family and friends, and feeling better with each passing day.' 'During the first 50 days since October 7, I was alone most of the time,' Naama Levy wrote, alluding to reports that she had been kept in tunnels for the first months of her captivity with little or no social contact. When she was able to connect with other female IDF lookouts and civilians held with her, Naama Levy said they gave her 'strength and hope.' She said they 'supported one another until the day of our release and continue to do so afterward.' On Saturday, four female hostages were released: Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy, and Liri Albag. All four were IDF lookouts who were taken captive at their post in Nahal Oz on October 7, 2023. A fifth lookout, Agam Berger, who was captured with them, is expected to be released on Thursday. Naama Levy expressed her hope that Agam would return soon, and wrote, 'We are waiting for Agam and the rest of the hostages to return so that we can complete the recovery process.' Liri Albag, who was freed along with Naama Levy on Saturday, told her family that Gazan civilians were complicit in Hamas's crimes. 'Liri told me, ‘Dad, there are two million terrorists, make no mistake. I sat with an eight-year-old boy, and with four-year-old children who would say 'We spit on the Jews,' do you understand what that means?’ Eli Albag, Liri's father, told 103FM on Monday. He didn't answer questions about how Liri was treated in captivity, given that there are still hostages in danger in Gaza, but said, 'Let’s just say they aren’t our friends. They are our enemy who want to kill us.'

Defense Minister Katz says Israel will remain on Mount Hermon ‘in...	This is the most far-reaching statement Katz has made so far regarding the length of time Israeli troops would be stationed in the Syrian buffer zone. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz declared on Tuesday that Israel will keep troops at the Mount Hermon post in Syria 'indefinitely.' This is the most far-reaching statement Katz has made so far regarding the length of time Israeli troops would be stationed in the Syrian buffer zone. During a visit Tuesday to the military post at the peak of Mount Hermon, Katz assessed the current security situation and spoke with military officers about operational activities to safeguard Israel's border and to defend against hostile forces. 'I’m here to make sure the IDF is fully prepared, both defensively and offensively, for an extended presence at the Hermon posts,' Katz said. 'The IDF will remain on the summit of Mount Hermon and in the security zone for an indefinite period to safeguard the Golan Heights, northern communities, and all citizens of Israel,' he continued. 'We will not return to the horrors of October 7, nor will we rely on others for our defense—here or anywhere else. We place our full trust in the IDF’s commanders and soldiers, both regular and reserve, to ensure the security of Israel’s residents,' Katz stated. He added, 'We will not allow hostile forces to establish a foothold in the security zone in southern Syria and will take decisive action against any emerging threats.' Katz explained that Israel would strive to maintain friendly relations with local populations, with special emphasis on the Druze, given their history of solidarity with Israel. In December, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Israel's newly acquired positions in Syria. Netanyahu said the visit was intended 'to determine the best arrangement' for ensuring Israel’s security. 'I am here at the summit of Mount Hermon,' he said. 'It brings back memories. Fifty-three years ago, I was here with my soldiers on a patrol with the Israel Defense Forces. The place hasn’t changed; it’s still the same. But its significance to Israel’s security has only increased in recent years, especially in light of the dramatic events unfolding below us in Syria in recent weeks.'

Trump’s pick for FBI director faces accusations of jeopardizing s...	The mounting evidence of Patel’s alleged misconduct has galvanized opposition to his nomination hearing this Thursday. By Jewish Breaking News Explosive new allegations have surfaced questioning Kash Patel’s judgment as his confirmation hearing for FBI director fast approaches. According to CBS, a former FBI official has come forward to Senate Democrats with damaging claims that Patel disregarded established security protocols during a 2020 hostage recovery mission in Yemen. While serving at the National Security Council, Patel allegedly leaked details of the delicate prisoner exchange to the Wall Street Journal before the Americans were safely in U.S. custody. It sent shockwaves through the FBI’s Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell who viewed the leak as an unconscionable breach of protocol. This wasn’t an isolated incident either. During a high-stakes rescue operation in late 2020, Navy SEAL Team 6 was tasked with rescuing American citizen Philip Walton, who had been abducted from his farm in Niger and taken across the border to Nigeria. The kidnappers demanded a $1 million ransom for Walton’s release, and intelligence suggested they were considering transferring him to a terrorist group operating in the region. To save Walton, the SEALs needed to parachute into northern Nigeria and trek for miles to reach the compound where Walton was being held. Dangerously, Patel incorrectly assured Defense Department officials that diplomatic clearance had been obtained from Nigeria for U.S. forces to enter their airspace. While ultimately Walton was successfully rescued, Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper later wrote in his memoir that Patel’s actions had needlessly endangered the SEAL team by pushing them to their operational limits before the assault phase even began. The mounting evidence of Patel’s alleged misconduct has galvanized opposition to his nomination hearing this Thursday. Senator Dick Durbin has already declared his intention to vote against confirmation, stating unequivocally that Patel 'has neither the experience, the temperament, nor the judgment to lead the FBI.' However, Patel’s allies have rushed to his defense, dismissing the allegations as politically motivated attacks. Alex Gray, a former National Security Council chief of staff, praised Patel’s leadership capabilities, describing his tenure as marked by exceptional skill and professionalism, and credited him as a key contributor to Trump’s foreign policy team during his first term as president.

UNSC to address crisis at UNRWA ahead of Israeli ban	Danon stressed that months of talks with the United Nations to address the situation have been met with 'blatant disregard.' By Joshua Marks, JNS The United Nations Security Council is set to convene on Tuesday to address the escalating crisis at the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which Israel has outlawed citing allegations that Hamas terrorists were employed by the agency. Algeria, which assumed the Security Council presidency in January, requested the meeting. This will be the second Council session this month dedicated to UNRWA’s situation. UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini and Norwegian Refugee Council Secretary-General Jan Egeland are expected to brief the assembly during the session. Israel notified the United Nations on Saturday that it must evacuate all UNRWA premises in Jerusalem no later than Jan. 30, as Knesset legislation banning the agency’s operations within the Jewish state will take effect on Thursday. 'Israel expects that UNRWA [will] take all the necessary steps to cease its operations in Jerusalem and evacuate all premises in which it operates in the city within the stated time frame,' wrote Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon in a letter addressed to U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres. Outlawing UNRWA in Israel 'came as a direct response to the acute national security risks posed by the widespread infiltration of UNRWA’s ranks by Hamas and other terrorist organizations, and the agency’s persistent refusal to address the very grave and material concerns raised by Israel, and to remedy this intolerable situation,' the letter notes. Danon stressed that months of talks with the United Nations to address the situation have been met with 'blatant disregard.' On Nov. 4, the Israeli parliament terminated the 1967 agreement outlining the terms of its relations with UNRWA. The director general of Israel’s Foreign Ministry sent a letter to U.N. General Assembly President Philémon Yang of Cameroon explaining that Jerusalem 'withdraws its request issued to UNRWA,' and instead 'will continue to work with international partners, including other United Nations agencies, to ensure the facilitation of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not undermine Israel’s security.' Then-Foreign Minister Israel Katz said, 'UNRWA, whose employees took part in the Oct. 7 massacre and many of whose workers are Hamas operatives, is part of the problem in the Gaza Strip, not part of the solution.' The United Nations was 'provided with countless pieces of evidence regarding Hamas operatives who work at UNRWA and about the use of UNRWA facilities for terrorism, and nothing was done,' he added. Lazzarini has warned that the Israeli actions against UNRWA would worsen humanitarian conditions, disrupt the social system and erode Palestinian trust in the international community. Lazzarini also cautioned that banning UNRWA could undermine the fragile ceasefire established on Jan. 19 after more than 15 months of war. He emphasized UNRWA’s essential role, noting it has already provided food aid to over one million people in Gaza during the ceasefire, and stressed the need for the agency’s continued operations to prevent further humanitarian collapse.

Israel shuts down Raed Salah’s ‘Afsha’a Al-Islam’ committees for ...	Salah, who heads the committees, has been arrested several times for incitement in sermons and on social media, and for fundraising for Hamas. By Pesach Benson, TPS The Israeli government declared the 'Afsha’a Al-Islam' committees led by Sheikh Raed Salah a terrorist organization and shut down its offices in Umm al-Fahm on Tuesday. Defense Minister Israel Katz signed the order citing intelligence indicating that the committees are affiliated with the outlawed Northern Faction of the Islamic Movement, which is linked to Hamas. The better-known Hamas is the Muslim Brotherhood’s Palestinian branch while the Islamic Movement was founded as the Israeli branch. The Islamic Movement split in 1996 over the issue of participating in Israeli elections. The Southern Branch, regarded as more pragmatic, is active in Israeli politics. Its party, Ra’am, has five seats in the Israeli Knesset and supported the formation of Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid’s government in 2021 — the first time an Israeli-Arab party ever formally backed a governing coalition. The Northern Branch, led by Salah, was outlawed in Israel in 2015 over its close ties with Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood. The Northern Faction is especially active in Jerusalem. It created the Mourabitoun, a squad of Palestinian men and women specifically to harass Jews visiting the Temple Mount. Jews who appear to be possibly praying may be shouted at, cursed and even physically assaulted by the Mourabitoun. Many are equipped with computers and iPads to record their activities for Hamas media. They are also known for flying Hamas flags and banners on the Temple Mount. Salah, who heads the committees, has been arrested several times for incitement in sermons and on social media, and for fundraising for Hamas.

The full details of Netanyahu’s trip could be announced after Wednesday’s scheduled visit to Jerusalem by U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff. By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seeking a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington next week, Hebrew media reported on Tuesday. While Netanyahu’s visit to the United States has not been finalized, the reported plans are for him to depart on Sunday and return two days later. Asked about the prospects for a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians aboard Air Force One on Monday, Trump revealed he would be discussing the issue with Netanyahu during a meeting in Washington 'in the not-too-distant future.' Following earlier reports about the possible visit, Israeli Prime Minister’s Office Spokesperson Omer Dostri said in a statement posted to social media that, 'contrary to reports, an official invitation for the prime minister to visit the White House has not yet been received.' 'If and when an official invitation to visit is received, we will follow all accepted procedures,' added Dostri. According to unnamed American officials cited by AFP on Tuesday, the full details of Netanyahu’s trip could be announced after Wednesday’s scheduled visit to Jerusalem by U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff.

The last Jews of Damascus: A journey through memory and ruins	Seven old Jews, a locked synagogue, and a ruin. That’s what remains of the Jewish community of Syria. By Jonathan Spyer, The Middle East Forum In Damascus again after a hiatus of nearly eight years, I decided to see what remained of the city’s once flourishing Jewish community. The dictator was gone. The new Islamist rulers had yet to fully stamp their authority on the city and the country. It seemed an ideal time. The Jewish Quarter of Damascus is located in the old city. There were 50,000 Jews in Syria at the beginning of the 20th century – an ancient and historic community dating to antiquity. The Jews of Syria were divided by city origin, with two old communities – Damascus and Aleppo – maintaining a rivalry. A third, newer community had been established later in Qamishli, in the Kurdish-majority northeast. There were 50,000 Jews in Syria at the beginning of the 20th century – an ancient and historic community dating to antiquity. The Jewish community was further subdivided into descendants of Sephardim who arrived after 1492, Jews of Italian descent, Kurdish Jews, and 'Musta’arabin' (Arabized) or Mizrahi Jews, whose families never left the Levant. Of these, the Jews of Aleppo and Qamishli have departed in their entirety. The seven or eight elderly Jewish residents of Damascus are the last remnant. (The exact number is disputed). My friend Firas and I set out from Bab Touma one Saturday morning to see what we could find. Firas is a Syrian Kurd, a former YPG (People’s Defense Units) fighter, and a former resident of Damascus. I had read that one of the three synagogues of the neighborhood, the Elfrange, still had services. I had the vague idea that I might arrive for the Saturday morning prayers and make the acquaintance of whomever I might find there. It took us a while to find the entrance to the synagogue. When we did, the door was padlocked. No one was around. We asked a neighboring shop owner what he knew about the 'Jewish synagogue.' 'Abu Ibrahim has the keys,' he replied. 'He runs a school here. But he isn’t here today. Give me your phone number and I’ll pass it on to him.' We did so without much hope. 'Do you know where we could find any of the Jews still living in the city?' I asked The shop owner considered for a moment. 'There’s an old woman living close by. But she’s lost her mind and can’t tell you much. Then there’s another old woman, two doors down from here. You see that black iron door? That’s where she lives. I think she’s there now. Go and knock and maybe she’ll answer.' So we did. No answer again. Dejected, and with a growing sense of absurdity, we wandered past the dilapidated houses, asking various passersby for clues. 'There’s a Jewish man living in that street right there,' a woman told us, pointing to a street on the left. 'His name’s Ibrahim.' We went down the small, dusty street and asked the owner of a small hummus restaurant whether he knew which house was Ibrahim’s. Our question caused an argument between the young man and his friend who was with him. 'Don’t know,' the friend told us. 'No idea. Don’t know.' Damascus is a city of deep suspicions, covered by a layer of slightly too-sweet politeness. But in this case, the young hummus restaurant owner took pity on us, and pointed to a ramshackle house opposite. 'He’s there. He lives there alone. But he might not answer.' 'He doesn’t want to speak to anyone,' his friend added. We went over and Firas hammered on the door. Once. Twice. And then, more or less despairingly, a third time. As we were about to leave, a small, elderly man appeared on the balcony facing the street. Firas shouted that I was a Jewish journalist who had come to find out about the Jews of Damascus. After a long pause, the old man pulled a string on the balcony that was attached to the front door and it clicked open. Inside, we found everything in an astonishing state of dereliction. Old bicycles, clocks, and ornaments, and rotting carpets and packing cases were all piled up in the courtyard and the adjoining rooms. This had very obviously once been a house owned by a wealthy family. Nothing remained of that. The old man motioned to us to come upstairs. We sat with him next to the balcony. While speaking Damascus Arabic, laced with Hebrew words here and there, he produced a phone with a Channel 11 report on the Jews of Damascus on it. He motioned to me to read the Hebrew. I did so and, satisfied, he began to tell us about himself and his family, the Hilwanis of Damascus. His name is Fuad Hilwani. Most of the family had left in 1992, he said, when Hafez Assad chose to allow the remaining 4,000 Jews in Syria to depart. He described the severely curtailed lives they had lived up to that point, under the pervasive surveillance of the regime’s intelligence branches. Jews needed permission even to leave the neighborhood. He had stayed to look after his ailing mother, who died a few years later. He had a brother in New York, and one in Israel. I congratulated him on his family’s house, saying it must have been illustrious at one time. He gave me a searching look, as though suspecting me of mockery. Then he said: 'This wasn’t our house. It belonged to the Totah family. I’m just watching it so that Abu Ibrahim and those behind him don’t come and take it.' Then he launched into a complicated account of efforts by a power structure connected to the old regime to move in on remaining Jewish properties in the city. He then mentioned a general connected to Maher Assad’s notorious 4th Division, a by-word for criminality and cruelty under the Assads. (Maher is former president Bashar al-Assad’s younger brother.) There had been violence and intimidation, and even an act of murder. I haven’t been able to fully verify these claims, so I won’t repeat them. At the end of this, Hilwani offered to read our fortunes, and following this bade us goodbye. 'Shabbat Shalom,' he wished me, as we stood on the stairs. Back at my hotel in Bab Touma, I searched for anything I could find on the Totah family and their properties in the Jewish Quarter. On a site that collects memories of the vanished Jewish communities of the Arab world, I found the following description: 'The Beit Tuta (also known as Beit Totah) was an opulent Damascene courtyard house owned by the Tuta family from the mid-19th to early 20th century. It boasted both traditional, open-air reception rooms and Western-style reception rooms.' I thought of the junk piled high in the courtyard and the rooms around it, and the old Jewish man, alone, its curious sentinel. THERE WAS still one synagogue I wanted to see – the Eliyahu Hanavi, in the neighborhood of Jobar, a couple of kilometers from the old city. It is described by the 13th-century Jewish traveler Samuel ben Samson as a 'beautiful synagogue situated outside the city' and by Israel Joseph Benjamin in 1864 as 'supported by 13 marble pillars, six on the right and seven on the left side, and everywhere inlaid with marble.' However, the synagogue was destroyed in 2014 during the Syrian civil war by a regime artillery shell. We found a local Jobar man to take us there, but there wasn’t much to see except rubble. Part of a single wall is still standing. I had heard that the area where the synagogue had stood was mined, but our guide immediately clambered up on it, so we followed suit. I saw that there was an UNRWA school close by, and I remembered that the Assad regime had a practice of housing Palestinian refugees close to traditionally Jewish areas of Damascus. After a couple of minutes, we had company. A motorcycle roared up. Two young men, both in black, one with a long black beard, the other wearing a leather jacket, climbed off. Representatives of the new regime. They climbed up to the highest point of the rubble that once was the Jobar synagogue and called us to join them. Out of breath, we did so. 'You can’t film there,' the bearded young man told us matter-of-factly. 'And no photos. This is a Jewish religious site. And of course, we respect all religions.' 'Who are you?' asked Firas, though it was obvious. 'We’re from the ‘organization’ [haya in Arabic, referring to Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham],' the bearded young man replied. 'And if you want to photograph, you should go to the Air Force Intelligence building at the Abbasin Circle, and get permission.' It wasn’t quite clear why having respect for all religions involved forbidding photography of a ruined synagogue. But we didn’t contest the point. After escorting us about 45 meters from the ruin, the two climbed back on their motorcycle and roared off through the dust. So that was the 'mukhabarat' (secret police) of the new regime, it occurred to me. Still learning the trade. The old lot would have checked my camera to see if I had already taken some pictures. They would learn quickly, no doubt. Fuad Hilwani had scoffed at my question whether he thought that the fall of Assad would change anything. Abu Ibrahim, he had said, would make a deal with the new regime, that was all. Fifty-fifty (i.e., of mutual benefit – to the new regime and to Abu Ibrahim). Seven old Jews, a locked synagogue, and a ruin. That’s what remains of the Jewish community of Syria.

PA continues unbridled building on nature reserve	Israeli groups demand government action with the Judean Desert ecosystem under dire threat from the massive illegal construction projects. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israeli groups demanded again Tuesday immediate government action to counter the Palestinian Authority’s ongoing unbridled building on what is supposed to be a protected nature reserve. 'The Judean Desert has more concrete than mountain goats, a dubious achievement, courtesy of the Palestinian Authority,' charged the Regavim Movement, an NGO dedicated to the protection of Israel's national lands and resources. 'We expect - we demand - substantial action to restore the fragile desert ecosystem, which has suffered too long from the Palestinian Authority's rampant illegal construction,' the group said. To illustrate how bad the problem is, Regavim released Tuesday together with the Gush Etzion and Har Hebron Regional Councils, a parody of National Geographic nature films that it called a 'National Catastrophic' documentary that featured 'The Desert Block.' Mimicking precisely the style of the famed series, it showed the desert landscape being destroyed by miles of roads, walls and buildings, while the narrator talks of how the concrete 'desert block knows no fear,' and 'conditions are ideal' so 'it grows wild,' constantly 'invading new areas, striking roots of steel and stone' while being 'sustained' by 'a constant flow of money from around the world.' The government has done nothing for years despite the massive Palestinian encroachment on what is known as the 'Wye-designated nature reserve,' which had been placed under PA jurisdiction in the 1998 Wye River Agreement that constituted the third part of the Oslo Accords. Last June, the Cabinet formally decided to enforce the law to try to belatedly prevent at least part of the decimation of its unique ecosystem. The first enforcement action was finally implemented last month, but only against illegal construction that had taken place since that decision. Even then, no further action was taken, although Regavim’s field coordinators quickly documented additional new development and construction work in the northern part of the reserve, as well as massive construction in the southern part, including road paving, electrical infrastructure and construction of multi-story structures. 'There is no vacuum. Wherever Israeli authorities are absent, hostile elements fill the void,' said Moshe Shmueli, one of the coordinators. 'After too many years of systematic destruction of the Judean Desert's natural resources, there's no time to lose - we must correct this immediately.' Gush Etzion Regional Council head Yaron Rosenthal noted that environmental groups, which should naturally be at the forefront of such a struggle, have not come to their aid. 'The Judean Desert is being systematically destroyed by the Palestinian Authority, with little response from environmental groups,' he said. 'We, who cherish the desert, and the nature, our environment and the Land of Israel, are committed to countering this damage and safeguarding our desert from further harm.'

Iranian FM calls to ‘expel Israelis to Greenland,’ warns against ...	Iran's foreign minister denounces Donald Trump's proposal to relocate 1.5 million Gazans, mockingly calls for deportation of Israeli Jews to Greenland, while warning of a 'very bad disaster' if US or Israel attack Iran's nuclear program. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Iran's foreign minister derided President Donald Trump's proposal to relocate two-thirds of the population of the Gaza Strip to third-party countries, mockingly suggesting instead that Israel's population be deported to Greenland. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi spoke with Britain's Sky News in an interview aired on Tuesday, warning against potential airstrikes by Israel or the U.S. against Iran's nuclear program, calling any such strike 'crazy,' and suggesting it would lead to a 'very bad disaster.' 'We have made it clear,' Araghchi said, 'that any attack to our nuclear facilities would be faced with an immediate and decisive response. But I don't think they will do that crazy thing. This is really crazy. And this would turn the whole region into a very bad disaster.' Araghchi said Tehran is willing to work with Trump, despite his withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal during his first term, and the imposition of tough sanctions on Iran. But the foreign minister mocked the president's efforts to find countries willing to take in large numbers of Gazan refugees, as well as Trump's proclaimed desire to acquire Greenland from Denmark. 'My suggestion is something else,' Araghchi said. 'Instead of Palestinians, try to expel Israelis, take them to Greenland so they can kill two birds with one stone.' Turning to Iran's battered proxies, Araghchi acknowledged that Hamas and Hezbollah 'have been weakened,' but emphasized that both groups are 'rebuilding themselves.' 'Hamas and Hezbollah have been damaged. But at the same time, they are rebuilding themselves, because as I said, this is a school of thought, this is an idea, this is a cause, this is an ideal that will always be there.'

In statement marking 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, President Trump calls for 'end to antisemitism,' while celebrating the 're-founding' of the Jewish national home in Israel. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump called for an 'end to antisemitism' Monday night, while celebrating the establishment of the state of Israel in a statement issued marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. In his statement, released Monday night, the president called the Holocaust, and specifically the genocide at Auschwitz-Birkenau, 'one of the darkest chapters in human history.' Trump lamented the persistence of antisemitism around the globe, and called for its eradication in the U.S. 'The poison of anti-Semitism still courses through the veins of cowards in dark corners of the world. So today, we renew our promise that anti-Semitism has no place in a civilized society, no place in our foreign policy, and no place in the United States of America.' In a nod to historical Jewish claims to the Land of Israel, the president not only reasserted America's 'bonds of friendship with the State of Israel,' but also hailed the creation of the modern State of Israel in 1948 as the 'refounding' of the Jewish national home. 'In the years since the liberation of Auschwitz on this day eight decades ago, the grave offenses that took place during the Holocaust and the cries of the Jewish people have echoed throughout the halls of history,' Trump said. 'In the wake of the oppression, persecution, and injustice committed at Auschwitz and elsewhere in Europe, the Jewish people gallantly persevered to re-found their homeland in the modern State of Israel — our mighty friend. To this day, the Jewish people proudly represent the peak of human tenacity and the pinnacle of human triumph.'

Freed hostage – ‘There are two million terrorists in Gaza’	Albag was one of four soldiers released Saturday who disrupted Hamas’ attempt to humiliate them on a stage, showing their spirits were unbroken. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Liri Albag, one of the four IDF soldiers released Saturday by Hamas in exchange for 200 terrorists, told her father that no one was innocent in Gaza, her father reported to 103FM Monday. 'Liri told me, ‘Dad, there are two million terrorists, make no mistake. I sat with an eight-year-old boy, and with four-year-old children who would say 'We spit on the Jews,' do you understand what that means?’' Eli Albag told interviewers Yinon Magal and Ben Caspit. When asked how his daughter was treated in captivity, he answered that as there are still hostages in danger in Gaza, he couldn’t talk freely, 'but let’s just say they aren’t our friends. They are our enemy who want to kill us.' 'We have to get everyone back and be on guard,' he continued, 'and if they shoot the tiniest thing [at Israel] they should be obliterated.' He also talked about the show of humiliation Hamas tried to put on before letting the young women go, setting up a stage where the four were presented to a crowd of hostile Arabs. 'The Hamas terrorists demanded that the girls speak, so Liri and the others said, ‘Not only will we not speak, we’re going to make a victory gesture and ruin the whole show for them.’ As soon as they made the gesture they took the girls off the stage,' Albag said. As seen by millions around the world, the four raised their arms and waved to the crowd, pointed forefingers in the air to signal they were 'No. 1,' and made the 'V' for victory sign, all the while smiling jubilantly, showing that their spirits had not been broken after 15 months of harsh imprisonment. 'She told me that had they let her speak she would have said one sentence in Arabic – ‘My name is Liri Albag and I’m number one,’' he recounted. The proud father talked of his daughter’s strength, saying that its extent surprised her family, and called her a hero. He said that his daughter had hinted that she had saved the life of Amit Soussana, a 40-year-old kidnapped from Kibbutz Kfar Aza and released along with some 85 women and children in the week-long hostage deal in late November 2023. Soussana, who was the first former hostage to describe publicly how she had been sexually abused and tortured in captivity, will reveal the details that Liri would not talk about on the news show Uvda Tuesday night, he said. Albag took the opportunity on the radio to clarify that his harsh words the previous day against those who opposed the current hostage deal, where he said in part that 'The people will hold you accountable,' were only directed at the country’s leaders. 'God forbid, I don't judge bereaved families,' he said. 'They are our soul. It is thanks to the fallen that my children are here.' 'Every bereaved family has the right to say what they want &#8230; and I will accept everything with love from them. God forbid that what I said is taken out of context,' he added. Bereaved families of fallen soldiers and especially families of those murdered by all the Palestinian prisoners released in the deal so far have spoken out against the agreement, believing it to be a moral capitulation and a future security nightmare for Israel that will cost the lives of many more victims of terror in the future.

Washington Post cites sanctioned terror financier Samidoun in sym...	The U.S. Department of Treasury slapped sanctions on Samidoun just months ago for providing material support to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a terrorist organization that participated in Hamas's Oct. 7 terror attack. By Lexi Boccuzzi, The Washington Free Beacon The Washington Post cited the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, an anti-Semitic organization under U.S. sanctions for providing material support to terrorists, in a sympathetic piece highlighting the 'Palestinian prisoners' freed as part of the Israel-Hamas hostage deal. The Post described Samidoun as an 'activist network supporting Palestinian prisoners' and linked to a blog post on the group's website titled, '90 Palestinian prisoners liberated by the Resistance on the first day of the Flood of the Free.' The blog included photos from Gaza featuring Hamas flags and photos of the terror group's deceased leader, Yahya Sinwar. It also noted that '90 Palestinian prisoners were liberated from the jails of the Zionist occupation regime in the first day of the Flood of the Free (Toufan al-Ahrar) prisoner exchange, achieved by the Palestinian Resistance as part of the first stage of the ceasefire agreement imposed by the occupier.' The Post did not note that the U.S. Department of Treasury slapped sanctions on Samidoun just months ago for providing material support to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a terrorist organization that participated in Hamas's Oct. 7 terror attack. It did, however, cite Samidoun to assert that the freed 'Palestinian prisoners' include 'journalists, activists, teachers, students, and close relatives of high-profile Hamas figures.' The Post went on to highlight a number of the released 'prisoners,' including one member of the PFLP, which the outlet described as 'a small leftist armed group.' In another case, the Post described Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a terror organization that is holding Israeli hostage Arbel Yehoud, a female civilian, as a 'militant group.' The piece reflects the extreme anti-Israel bias seen at the Post in the wake of Oct. 7. As of last summer, at least six members of the Post's foreign desk previously wrote for Al Jazeera, the Doha-based news outlet bankrolled in part by Qatar's Hamas-friendly government, the Washington Free Beacon reported. The Department of Treasury, in a joint action with Canada's government, announced its Samidoun sanctions in October, describing the group as 'a sham charity that serves as an international fundraiser for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) terrorist organization.' The punitive measures bar U.S. citizens from doing business with Samidoun, and the group must forfeit any properties held in the country. The Post's decision to cite Samidoun in the wake of those sanctions aligns the outlet with some of the country's most extreme anti-Israel student groups. In November, less than a month after the Department of Treasury unveiled the sanctions, Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) distributed pamphlets encouraging classmates to 'get involved' with Samidoun, the Free Beacon reported. The pamphlets called for 'revolution and resistance until liberation and return' and encouraged readers to 'let your discomfort be your radicalization' and 'kill the beast from within.' A QR code on the pamphlets, like the Post's article, led to a webpage that directed visitors to Samidoun's site. CUAD is a coalition of Columbia University student groups that formed after the school suspended its Students for Justice in Palestine chapter. The coalition was instrumental in organizing the illegal encampments that plagued Columbia in the spring. Its members distributed the pamphlets just outside of Columbia's gates, and experts argued that they may have provided material support to a terror organization by doing so. 'A reasonable argument could be made that whoever produced these flyers are providing material support to a designated terrorist organization,' Foundation for Defense of Democracies senior vice president for research Jonathan Schanzer told the Free Beacon at the time. 'In short, Samidoun shouldn't be anywhere in the United States anymore.' Niha Masih, one of the Post's authors of the piece, has a long history of accusing Israel of genocide.

Iranian FM: ‘Crazy’ US or Israeli attack on nuke sites won’t happ...	Trump on Jan. 23 said he hoped that Israel would not attack Iran’s nuclear faculties, but appeared to suggest that this was a possibility if the Islamic Republic does not accept a deal on its nuclear program. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Tuesday that he does not believe that the United States or Israel will attack Tehran’s nuclear facilities, calling the idea 'really crazy' in an interview with Sky News Arabia. 'This is not a new threat. And they know that this is not a real threat,' the Iranian diplomat told the U.K. broadcaster. 'They know our capabilities to respond, and we have made it clear that any attack to our nuclear facilities would be faced with an immediate and decisive response.' He continued: 'I don’t think that they will do that crazy thing. This is really crazy,' adding that a strike inside the Islamic Republic would immediately turn the entire region into 'a very bad disaster.' While Iran was prepared to listen to U.S. President Donald Trump, 'lots of things should be done by the other side' for Tehran to commit to negotiating a new nuclear deal with Washington, he said. 'There should be enough confidence for Iran to once again engage into negotiations, and I think we are still a bit far from that—as I said, we are waiting to hear. Yes, to have a deal is nice, of course, but what kind of a deal?' said the Iranian diplomat. 'Diplomacy is based on hopes. So we never lose our hopes for any diplomatic effort and for any initiative.' Asked by Sky News about concerns regarding the Islamic regime’s threats to pursue an 'alternative course' if diplomacy with the United States failed, Araghchi claimed he did not know what Tehran would do. 'We tried the path of negotiations and confidence-building in our peaceful nuclear program,' he said, echoing the Islamic Republic’s oft-repeated claim that it has ramped up uranium enrichment for civilian purposes only. 'But then it turned into a bad experience. Sanctions came back. So what is the alternative? I don’t know,' he added. He claimed that there was an ongoing 'hot debate' inside Iran 'at all levels' regarding what the nation should do if nuclear diplomacy fails. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 85, is believed to have the final say on whether or not the country accepts a nuclear agreement. Trump on Jan. 23 said he hoped that Israel would not attack Iran’s nuclear faculties, but appeared to suggest that this was a possibility if the Islamic Republic does not accept a deal on its nuclear program. 'We’ll have to see. I’m going to be meeting with various people over the next couple of days. Hopefully, that can be worked out without having to worry about it,' Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the possibility of an Israeli strike, according to a readout. 'It would really be nice if that could be worked out without having to go that further step. Hopefully, that can be worked out. Iran hopefully will make a deal, and if they don’t make a deal, I guess that’s OK too,' he said. During his first term in 2018, Trump pulled the United States out of the 2015 JCPOA nuclear agreement with Iran and stepped up sanctions on the regime in Tehran. The deal offered Iran sanctions relief in exchange for its promise to dial back its nuclear program for a maximum of 10 years. Before he began his second term as president, Trump said he planned to renew his 'maximum pressure' campaign on Iran, including by issuing punishing sanctions and targeting Tehran’s oil revenue. Britain’s The Daily Telegraph cited anonymous Iranian government officials as saying over the weekend that the Islamic regime regards Trump’s return to the White House as 'an existential threat.' 'In Iraq and Yemen, [Iranian proxy] forces have been told not to target any American assets, and if they do, they are explicitly warned against using Iranian weapons,' the senior official told the daily. 'They have been told to keep defensive positions for a while and to avoid any actions that might provoke the Americans.' Araghchi in the interview with Sky News Arabia on Tuesday confirmed that the Islamic Republic regards Trump’s second term as commander-in-chief as 'different and much more difficult than the previous time.' Commenting on Trump’s suggestion to allow Palestinians to leave Gaza and build a life somewhere else, primarily in other Arab nations, the diplomat told Sky News that 'Palestinians cannot be expelled.' 'My suggestion is something else: Instead of Palestinians, try to expel Israelis. Take them to Greenland, so they can kill two birds with one stone,' he said, referencing Trump’s plans to purchase the territory. Araghchi dismissed the assassination of Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorist leader Hassan Nasrallah by Israel, as well as the fall of allied dictator Bashar Assad in Syria, as 'things that happen in the world.' Switching to Farsi, he said that while 'the resistance has been rendered several serious blows, we have to know that resistance is a school of thought; a cause that is still alive, it is still there and is still breathing.' 'It is true that Hamas and Hezbollah have been damaged,' Araghchi acknowledged. 'At the same time, they are rebuilding themselves,' he said, vowing that the two Iranian-backed groups will 'always be there.' Earlier this month, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian denied to NBC that Tehran had suffered major defeats during recent conflicts, in which Israel incapacitated its strongest proxy, Hezbollah, in Lebanon. 'We’re more coherent, we’re more robust, we have better participation, we have a more solid security in the country,' the Iranian president claimed in a rare interview with the American television network.

Palestinian statehood a ‘red-line’ for Saudi-Israel normalization...	There is no other solution than the two-state solution,' says Saudi prince and diplomat, insisting that any deal between Riyadh and Jerusalem must include Israel's agreement to the establishment of a Palestinian state. By World Israel News Staff Palestinian statehood is a 'red line' for Saudi Arabia's acceptance of a deal normalizing relations with Israel, a senior member of the Saudi royal family said over the weekend. Riyadh's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Prince Khalid bin Bandar, spoke with Times Radio in an interview aired on Sunday, discussing, among other things, the Trump administration's efforts to expand the Abraham Accords and the possibility of achieving full diplomatic relations with Israel. 'We cannot have a normalization with Israel without a solution for the Palestinians. And the solution for the Palestinians is a state, it is very clear,' the ambassador said, when asked what it would take for Riyadh to join the Abraham Accords. 'That doesn't mean we can't have discussions. Saudi Arabia is a country that engages with everyone, whether we like it or not,' bin Bandar continued, emphasizing that Palestinian statehood is one of his country's 'red lines' for agreeing to normalize relations with Israel. 'We believe engagement is the way to move things forward, and so we are happy to continuously engage in processes with anyone, but we do have some red lines, and for us to end the last 75 years of pain and suffering caused by one problem has to include a Palestinian state.' Bin Bandar said it would be 'difficult' to secure a deal with the current Israeli government, but said the obstacles were not insurmountable. 'I mean, it's difficult, otherwise, we'd have been there. We would have found the solution. But let's not forget, this plot of land has been fought over consistently for 6,000 years.' 'It is not an easy thing to find, whether it's during the Crusades, before every civilization on earth, certainly in the three continents of Asia, Africa, and Europe has fought over the same plot of land. I can't think of anywhere that's had that much done to it.' The 47-year-old Saudi envoy said he was not optimistic regarding the prospects for a deal with Israel in the near future 'because we have a lot of problems in the way,' while acknowledging the legitimate concerns of Israelis following the Hamas invasion of October 7th, 2023. 'We also have to remember, there's another side, we have to find a solution that fits the Israelis.' 'That adds a level of complication, particularly with the current government in Israel, but I think we have to address, when someone is struggling through emotion and trauma and difficulty, which both the Israelis and the Palestinians have been for the last year, you have to hold them, you have to be kind to them, you have to be soft with them, but you also have to be very straight, and we have to be more straight with the Israelis and say, look, this is the only option.'

Trump pushes Gazan relocation plan in call with Egyptian presiden...	I'd like to get Gazans living somewhere they can live without disruption,' Trump says, doubling down on call for Egypt and Jordan to take in Gazan refugees. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Donald Trump is continuing his push to find third-party countries to host Gaza refugees, despite initial opposition to his plan. Speaking with reporters on Air Force One on Monday while en route to Joint Base Andrews, the president discussed his telephone call with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Sunday. Over the weekend, Trump spoke with both Jordan’s King Abdullah II and al-Sisi about the prospect of the two countries taking in some of the roughly 1.5 million Gazans the Trump administration hopes to relocate as part of a voluntary mass migration during which the Gaza Strip could be rehabilitated and rebuilt. In his comments to the press over the weekend, Trump said the move could be either temporary or 'long-term.' While the Egyptian Foreign Ministry immediately rejected the proposal, calling it an 'infringement' on the rights of Palestinian Arabs, Trump said that when he discussed the plan with al-Sisi, the Egyptian president responded by calling for 'peace in the Middle East.' 'His response [was] that he’d like to see peace in the Middle East,' Trump said. 'I’d like to see peace in the Middle East.' 'I’d like to get them living in an area where they can live without disruption and revolution and violence,' the president continued. 'When you look at the Gaza Strip it’s been hell for so many years.' 'It just seems to me there's been various civilizations on that Strip and, you know, it didn't start here. It started thousands of years before, and there's always been violence associated with it.' 'So I think you could get people living in areas that are a lot safer and maybe a lot better and maybe a lot more comfortable.' Trump reiterated his call for Egypt to 'take some' of Gaza’s displaced residents. 'I wish [Sisi] would take some [Gazans]. We helped them a lot, and I'm sure he'd help us. He's a friend of mine. He's in a very rough part of the world, to be honest. As they say, It's a rough neighborhood. But I think he would do it, and I think the King of Jordan would do it too.' The Trump administration has also reportedly reached out to other countries, including Albania and Indonesia - both of which have Muslim majorities - for his Gaza relocation plan. The president declined to say whether he still supports Palestinian statehood, and responded to questions in that vein by stating that he will be 'speaking with Bibi Netanyahu in the not-too-distant future.' 'He's coming here to meet with me,' Trump continued, adding that the meeting will be 'very soon.' Two sources cited by The Times of Israel said that the Prime Minister’s Office is in talks with Washington for a trip to Washington beginning next Sunday and concluding the following Wednesday.

‘Don’t return home, Hezbollah still a danger’ – Mayor to northern...	If someone thinks these concrete slabs will stop Hezbollah, they are mistaken,' says Kiryat Shmona Mayor Avichai Stern. By World Israel News Staff The mayor of Kiryat Shmona slammed the defense and security establishment for failing to secure the northern border, even after 15 months of war against the Hezbollah terror group, in a fiery video posted to social media on Monday. Avichai Stern, the mayor of Israel's northernmost city, called on residents not to return to their homes until the state provides proper protection against a potential Hezbollah invasion. According to official statements, northerners are slated to return to evacuated cities and towns by March 1, 2025. Clad in a bulletproof vest, Stern filmed himself standing near the Israel-Lebanon border fence, adjacent to the Margaliot moshav. Pointing to a chain link fence that had been smashed to the ground, Stern noted that the border appeared to be completely unsecured in the area. He gestured towards large concrete slabs, which did not form a complete barrier and appeared to have been haphazardly placed along the border as a temporary solution. 'Tell me, have we learned nothing?' Stern said, filming past the fence towards a valley, which is Lebanese territory. From the video, it appears that Hezbollah operatives could easily make their way from the other end of the valley into Israel. 'These concrete slabs are really going to stop Hezbollah terrorists? They're going to prevent the next October 7th massacre in the north?' Stern continued, saying that 'if someone thinks these concrete slabs will stop Hezbollah, they are mistaken.' They mayor said that 'it really looks like we've learned nothing from October 7th. This is how we remove threats? They're telling us it's safe to come home when this is the situation?' He sarcastically added that 'maybe [the authorities] will tell us to just live inside of our bomb shelters.' Visibly angry, Stern concluded by saying that 'this is no how you provide security to the residents of the north.'
