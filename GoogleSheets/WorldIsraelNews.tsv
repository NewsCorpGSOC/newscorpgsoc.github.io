Names released of 5 people killed by terrorist shooting at Yaffa ...	The victims named are 42-year-old Ilya Nozadze, 24-year-old Revital Bronstein, 33-year-old Inbar Segev Vigdar, 40-year-old Nadia Sokolenko and 30-year-old Shahar Goldman. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The names of five of the seven people killed by terrorist shooters at the Yaffa rail station on Tuesday night were released. The victims named are 42-year-old Ilya Nozadze, 24-year-old Revital Bronstein, 33-year-old Inbar Segev Vigdar, 40-year-old Nadia Sokolenko and 30-year-old Shahar Goldman. Two terrorist shooters attacked passengers, killing seven and wounding dozens. Two of the five murdered in the attack have not been named, and an additional three are in serious condition. Inbar Segev Vigdar, who owned a Pilates and fitness studio in Tel Aviv, was at the train station with her 9-month-old infant, who was unharmed and taken to safety. Witnesses reported that Vigdar shielded the baby with her body, saving his life. Eric Marchenkov, who was wounded in the attack, said, 'The mother hugged her baby. This was the most powerful picture of a mother hugging her baby covered in blood. It is a miracle that the baby is alive from all the bullets that were flying there. The mother was hit, but he survived.' A passenger told Ynet, '[Segev Vigdar] went to get off the train and was shot. We heard the baby screaming. We pulled him out of the carrier. One of the policemen took me and the baby in a van to Wolfson [Hospital].' Inbar Segev Vigdar is survived also by her husband Yaari Vigdar, who fought in the reserves in Gaza and the north. Yaari Vigdar said that when his wife did not answer, he rode his bicycle to the station. 'After a thorough search, I found our dog shot while passers-by were taking care of her. I looked for Inbar in the whole neighborhood and realized that I had to go to the hospital because I didn't get a response from anywhere.' He went to the hospital and saw his 9-month-old son in the arms of a doctor. Shahar Goldman was from Lod and is survived by her husband, Tai, her sisters Astar, Dikla, and Merav, and her parents, Avraham and Ruth Goldman. Revital Bronstein was from Bat Yam, was working on her master's degree in computer science and won awards for her work in artificial intelligence. Nadia Sokalenko was a stylist from Tel Aviv and is survived by her husband Vadim a six-year-old daughter named Maya. She also has relatives living in Moldova and Denmark. Ilya Nozadze was a truck driver from Georgia and was taken to the hospital with three bullets in his chest. His wife and two children, 17 and 14, live in Georgia. The two terrorist shooters were identified as Mohammed Ragev and Hassin Tamimi, two illegal residents from Hebron. One of the terrorists was armed with an M-16 and the other with a knife, and they began attacking people on the light rail.

On same day Iran fires 200 ballistic missiles at Jewish state, US...	Hashomer Yosh, a nonprofit, has said that it does not engage in violence and that the U.S. sanctions are based on false information. By JNS On the same day that Iran fired some 200 ballistic missiles at the Jewish state and two Palestinian terrorists killed seven people in Tel Aviv-Jaffa, the U.S. State Department announced sanctions against two Israelis in Judea and Samaria whom Foggy Bottom accused of 'undermining peace, security and stability in the West Bank.' The State Department said the two are 'a violent Israeli settler and the CEO and director of U.S.-designated Hashomer Yosh.' 'The actions of these individuals have contributed to creating an environment where violence and instability thrive,' Foggy Bottom stated. 'Their actions, collectively and individually, undermine peace, security and stability in the West Bank.' (The Biden administration refers to part of Judea and Samaria as the 'West Bank.') Hashomer Yosh, a nonprofit, has said that it does not engage in violence and that the U.S. sanctions are based on false information. The U.S. Treasury Department identified the two Israelis as Eitan Yardeni and Avichai Suissa. It also designated Hilltop Youth, which the State Department said is 'a violent extremist group that has rampaged through Palestinian communities in the West Bank.' 'It has carried out killings, mass arson and other so-called ‘price tag’ attacks to exact revenge and intimidate Palestinian civilians,' the State Department said. 'Hilltop Youth has repeatedly clashed with the Israeli military when it tries to counter Hilltop Youth’s destructive activities.' The Biden administration called on the Israeli government to 'take action and hold violent actors, like those designated today, accountable.' It added that 'we will continue to use our tools to promote accountability for violence that threatens peace and stability in the region, no matter the national origin, ethnicity, race or religion of the perpetrators of such violence.' 'The worsening violence and instability in the West Bank are detrimental to the long-term interests of Israelis and Palestinians, and the actions of violent organizations like Hilltop Youth only exacerbate the crisis,' stated Bradley Smith, acting under secretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence. 'The United States will continue to hold accountable the individuals, groups and organizations that facilitate these hateful and destabilizing acts,' Smith stated. The State Department sent a fact sheet and press release on the sanctions to reporters hours after every civilian in Israel sheltered as the Islamic Republic bombed the Jewish state, the Israeli military said. David Milstein, who advised Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s presidential campaign and worked for David Friedman, then-U.S. ambassador to Israel, wrote when the Treasury Department first announced the sanctions that they came 'as Israel is fighting a war of survival against Iran and its terror proxies on seven fronts, and on the same day Iran is poised to launch another major escalatory attack from Iranian soil.' 'The Biden-Harris administration has shamefully abused sanctions authority to impose more illegitimate sanctions on Israeli organizations,' he wrote. 'This is truly reprehensible.'

Only fatality from mass Iranian missile attack is Palestinian man...	In April, during Iran’s first direct missile attack on the Jewish state, Amina Alhasoni, a seven-year-old girl from a Bedouin village in the Negev, was the one wounded by an Iranian missile. By The Algemeiner A Palestinian man in the West Bank village of Nu’eima, near Jericho was killed by falling fuselage from an intercepted missile during a massive Iranian missile attack against Israel, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The man, Sameh Asli, 37, a Palestinian from Jabalia in Gaza, is currently the only reported death from the Iranian attack against Israel. Israeli rescue services said that only two people were lightly wounded by shrapnel in Tel Aviv amid the Iranian missile attack, while several others were treated for minor injuries after falling over while running or for acute anxiety. In April, during Iran’s first direct missile attack on the Jewish state, Amina Alhasoni, a seven-year-old girl from a Bedouin village in the Negev, was critically wounded by an Iranian missile. In July, she was released from Soroka Medical Center in Beersheva. Alhasoni was the only severely injured Israeli in the April barrage. Iran fired a salvo of ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday, forcing the Jewish state’s entire civilian population to take cover in bomb shelters. 'A short time ago missiles were launched from Iran into the territory of the State of Israel,' a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. 'You are asked to be vigilant and act exactly according to the instructions of the Home Front Command. The IDF is doing and will do everything necessary to protect the citizens of the State of Israel.' The IDF posted on X/Twitter that 'all Israeli civilians' were sheltering from the Iranian attack. Alarms sounded across Israel and explosions could be heard in Jerusalem and the Jordan River valley. Reuters journalists reported seeing missiles being intercepted in the airspace of neighboring Jordan. According to Israeli authorities, more than 180 missiles had been launched into Israel from Iran. 'The air-defense system is fully operational, detecting and intercepting threats wherever necessary, even at this moment,' said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the IDF spokesman. 'However, the defense is not hermetic.' Israel’s military later said Israelis were free to leave their shelters. 'Following the situational assessment, it was decided that it is now permitted to leave protected spaces in all areas across the country,' the military said. Iran had initially vowed to retaliate for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in late July. The Israeli government has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the assassination, although the Iranian regime blamed Jerusalem. It was widely expected that Iran would launch a direct attack on Israel; however, no such attack ever came. Then Iran said it would retaliate following Israeli airstrikes over the last two weeks that killed the top leaders of its Hezbollah allies in Lebanon, including longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Iranian commander Abbas Nilforoushan was also killed in the same strike as Nasrallah.

Israel preparing ‘powerful’ response to Iran’s attack – report	One senior official said Israel has 'full legitimacy for an unprecedented strike on Iranian soil.' By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel is preparing a 'powerful' response to the direct attack Tuesday night in which Iran launched more than 180 ballistic missiles at the Jewish state, government and IDF officials said after the attack was successfully thwarted. The IDF said Tuesday night that it would carry out 'powerful airstrikes throughout the Middle East' after Chief of Staff Maj.Gen. Herzi Halevi had said more vaguely, 'We will choose when to exact the price and prove our precise and unexpected attack capabilities.' The threat could be read in several ways. According to a Tuesday report in The Wall Street Journal, Tehran had warned Jerusalem in advance via Arab intermediaries what its attack would be, and Jerusalem had responded with the message that it would react with a 'direct hit' on such strategic assets in Iran as its nuclear or gas facilities for the smallest damage caused by the missiles. Two people were lightly hurt by falling shrapnel, several others were injured while running to safe areas, and damage was recorded in several locations, including about a hundred homes that were damaged in Hod Hasharon by the missiles. Unnamed Israeli officials are talking tough, with one saying 'Israel has full legitimacy for an unprecedented strike on Iranian soil—this is the time to strike at the head of the Iranian snake.' Ynet reported that the possibility of striking Iran’s nuclear facilities is 'now on the table of the decision-makers more than at any other point in the last decade.' It can be assumed, however, that the Americans would be completely against such a move, deeming it too much of an escalation that would cause an all-out war with Iran, something that they have repeatedly warned against. Hitting Iran’s oil and gas industry, whose products are the only export that is keeping the Islamic Republic’s economy afloat, would also fit the definition of the 'severe response' an Israeli defense official said was in the works. A limited versus an overwhelming strike may get the green light from the Biden administration, which has promised to cooperate with Israel on some kind of retaliation after the president and vice-president 'unequivocally condemned' Iran for the attack. Remaining vague, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told a press briefing after the missile strike that 'We have made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack, and we will work with Israel to make that the case.' Haaretz reported Wednesday that while a political decision has yet to be made as to any military response due to the need to coordinate with the U.S., Israel will be demanding that the global community immediately deepen Iran's international isolation, declare the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist organization and impose crippling economic sanctions on the country.

Iran’s Ayatollah and Dutch lawmaker spar – in Hebrew	Leader of the Netherlands' largest political party excoriates Iran's supreme leader in a Hebrew tweet, after Iran launches massive ballistic missile barrage at Israel. By World Israel News Staff A senior Dutch lawmaker ripped Iran's supreme leader Tuesday in Hebrew, hours after the Shi'ite cleric posted his own message in Hebrew, following the Islamic republic's massive ballistic missile attack on Israel. Geert Wilders, founder of the Party for Freedom (PVV) and leader of the party's delegation in the Dutch House of Representatives, took aim at Ayatollah Ali Khamenei Tuesday night, penning a riposte in Hebrew via X/Twitter, after Khamenei published a message lauding terror attacks against Israel. On Tuesday, Iranian forces launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles towards Israel, the second major direct strike by Iran on the Jewish state, following a combination ballistic missile and drone attack in April. A majority of the incoming missiles were either shot down or landed in open areas, with the single fatality, a Palestinian construction worker, occuring in the Palestinian Authority city of Jericho. Shortly after the attack, Khamenei, the 85-year-old spiritual leader and head of state of Iran, published a comment on his X/Twitter account in Hebrew. 'With God's help,' Khamenei wrote, 'the blows of the uprising front will become stronger and more painful on the worn and rotting body of the Zionist regime.' An hour later, Wilders responded in kind, penning a Hebrew retort on X/Twitter. 'You are a psychopath, a dangerous maniac, a sick person who will lose because logic, democracy and freedom will win and we will always support Israel.' Wilders, a long-time critic of multiculturalism and large-scale Islamic immigration to the Netherlands, has long expressed support of Israel, having visited the country dozens of times and living in the Jewish state for several years in his youth.

Survey: Strong US backing for Israeli military action against Ira...	A total of 56% want to maintain U.S. military action at the same level, while 27% want to increase it and 17% want to decrease American military action. By JNS Three-quarters of Americans want to maintain or strengthen U.S. support for Israel’s military actions against Iran’s proxies, even as the U.S. administration pushes a ceasefire, according to a survey released on Monday. The polling comes as Israel’s war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon, triggered by Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre, approaches its one-year mark. Some 50% of Americans want to keep support for Israel’s military efforts against Iranian proxies at about the same level, while 25% each want to either increase or decrease the backing, according to the survey, commissioned by the non-partisan New York-based Council for a Secure America. Fifty-four percent of Americans agree that Iran and its allies, including Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen pose a direct threat to the United States and its Western allies, while 36% neither agree or disagree, and 10% disagree, the survey found. At the same time, most Americans want to maintain the current level of U.S. military action against both Iran and its proxies, which has been primarily defensive, the poll found. A total of 56% want to maintain U.S. military action at the same level, while 27% want to increase it and 17% want to decrease American military action. Overall, 62% of Americans feel that the United States’ relationship with Israel is important, with the highest support being found among older Americans and the lowest among 'Generation Z'; only 9% felt that the ties between the two countries are not important, the survey showed. 'As we approach the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 massacre and the ensuing war with Iran’s proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah, American support for Israel’s military actions remains strong,' said CSA executive director Jennifer Sutton. 'A majority of American voters feel that both Israel and the United States should continue their military efforts, and that Iran and its proxies pose a direct threat to the U.S. and our allies in the region,' the statement continued. The survey was conducted from Sept. 18 through Sept. 20 by Morning Consult, after the pager and walkie-talkie attacks against Hezbollah attributed to Israel but before the Israeli assassination of Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah. It cited a margin of error of 2%.

Iran’s attack on Israel tops Walz-Vance vice presidential debate	You can't ignore October 7th' - Tim Walz warns 'fickle' Trump not capable of demonstrating the 'stability' needed to deal with Iranian threat, as JD Vance blasts Biden administration for unfreezing billions in Iranian assets. By World Israel News Staff Democratic Vice Presidential nominee and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz wrangled over Middle Eastern foreign policy with his Republican counterpart, Ohio Senator and 2024 Vice Presidential hopeful J.D. Vance, in a debate hosted by CBS News in New York City Tuesday night. Coming just hours after Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles at Israel Tuesday, the vice presidential debate opened with questions regarding America's position vis-a-vis an Israeli strike on Iran. Both Walz and Vance highlighted October 7th in the opening of their responses, with Walz emphasizing the need for the U.S. to maintain 'steady leadership' in the region and to work with 'our Israeli partners and our coalition.' Trump, Walz accused, is temperamentally unfit to hold 'the coalitions together,' while lauding the Biden administration, crediting its support for Israel in the downing of many of the ballistic missiles launched Tuesday, saying the U.S.-aligned coalition was 'able to stop the incoming attack.' 'When our allies see Donald Trump turn towards Vladimir Putin, turn towards North Korea, when we start to see that type of fickleness around holding the coalitions together, we will stay committed?' Vance, in turn, appeared to blame the Biden administration for both the October 7th invasion of Israel and Tuesday's ballistic missile strikes, linking them to sanctions waivers granted by President Joe Biden and to billions of Iranian assets unfrozen by the White House. 'Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration,' Vance said. 'What do they use that money for? They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching against our allies and, God forbid, potentially launching against the United States as well.' 'You can't ignore October the 7th, which I appreciate Governor Walz bringing up. But when did Iran and Hamas and their proxies attack Israel? It was during the administration of Kamala Harris.'

‘World War 3’ – Trump blames Iran attacks on Biden, Harris	Former President Donald Trump says White House 'enriched, empowered' Tehran, 'enabling Iran and its terror proxies' to carry out attacks on Israel and US targets. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Former President Donald Trump blamed the Biden administration Tuesday for a massive Iranian missile attack at Israel, accusing the White House of 'enabling' Tehran and its terrorist proxies. On Tuesday, nearly 200 ballistic missiles were launched from Iran towards Israel, forcing millions of Israelis into bomb shelters. While the attacks caused some damage across the country, only one fatality, an Arab construction worker in the Palestinian Authority city of Jericho, was reported, with two Israelis and two Jordanians injured by shrapnel. Shortly after the attacks, Trump spoke at a campaign rally in Wisconsin, blaming the Biden administration and its handling of Middle Eastern foreign policy for the attacks. 'Iran just launched 181 missiles at Israel, and I've been talking about World War III for a long time,' Trump said. 'The world right now is spiraling out of control. A short time ago, Iran launched over 200 ballistic missiles at Israel and we are closer than ever to global catastrophe.' 'We have a non-existent president and our Vice President, who should be in charge, is going to fundraisers in San Francisco and staging fake photo ops using phones that are not even connected. No one is in charge and it’s not even clear who is more confused: Biden or Kamala.' 'Neither has any idea what is going on.' Later on Tuesday, Trump issued a statement condemning President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for the sanctions waivers granted to Iran, linking them to Tuesday's attack. 'When I was President, Iran was in total check,' said Trump. 'They were starved for cash, fully contained, and desperate to make a deal. Kamala flooded them with American cash and, ever since, they’ve been exporting terror all over, and unraveling the Middle East.' 'Under 'President Trump,' we had NO WAR in the Middle East, NO WAR in Europe, and Harmony in Asia, No Inflation, No Afghanistan Catastrophe. Instead, we had PEACE.' 'Now, War or the threat of War, is raging everywhere, and the two Incompetents running this Country are leading us to the brink of World War III. You wouldn’t trust Joe or Kamala to run a lemonade stand, let alone lead the Free World.'

US National Security Adviser calls Iran’s attack against Israel ‘...	Sullivan: 'We have made clear that there will be severe consequences for this attack, and we will work with Israel to make that the case.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Following Iran's launch of 200 missiles into Israel on Tuesday, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan called the attack a 'significant escalation.' He added, 'We have made clear that there will be consequences, severe consequences, for this attack, and we will work with Israel to make that the case,' said Sullivan. As sirens were sounded off all over the country and Israeli residents were told to shelter in place, there were no reported casualties from the massive attack. Sullivan characterized Iran's offensive as 'defeated and ineffective.' Sullivan reported that 'US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defense units in firing interceptors to shoot down' some 200 'inbound missiles.' The previous Iranian attack against Israel was in April, just a few days before Passover. Iran vowed to strike Israel again and threatened that if the US defended Israel, They would target American military bases. Iran's mission to the United Nations wrote on X, 'Should the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue.' Iranian officials said that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered the attacks against Israel in retaliation for the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and other key terrorists in an airstrike in Beirut last Friday, as well as the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July. However, Israel has not claimed responsibility for the killing of Haniyeh. Khamenei deviated from this usual protocol and issued a direct threat against the Jewish State on his X account, vowing that there would be additional attacks and each 'will become stronger and more painful on the worn and rotting body of the Zionist regime.' On Monday night, the IDF entered southern Lebanon for the first time since the 2006 Lebanon War. As Iran attacked Israel on Tuesday, US President Joe Biden reported that he 'convened our national security team to discuss' the situation. Sullivan reported that Biden and Harris 'monitored the attack and the response from the White House Situation Room.'

IDF raids foiled Hezbollah plot for an Oct 7th-style invasion of ...	The IDF discovered maps Hezbollah provided to its terrorists as part of a plan to occupy Galilee. By David Isaac, JNS The Israel Defense Forces revealed on Tuesday that it had carried out dozens of secret ground operations into Southern Lebanon over the past year to reduce Hezbollah’s war-making capability, destroying the terror group’s tunnels and hidden weapons caches. The raids were part of an effort to prepare for the larger ground operation, which got underway this morning. The goal was to cripple Hezbollah’s ability to invade Israel. IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told press that IDF forces discovered more details of Hezbollah’s plan to invade northern Israel, which was to be spearheaded by the group’s Radwan Force. Israel killed Ibrahim Aqil, the head of the terror group’s special operations unit, on Sept. 20. Holding up a map, Hagari said: 'We found this map inside one of the compounds that our fighters raided. It is a map that Hezbollah planned to give to its terrorists during a broad infiltration into the territory of the State of Israel as part of the ‘Plan to occupy the Galilee.’ ' 'As you can see, it has a legend marking Israeli settlements, IDF posts, access roads and attack targets that Hezbollah planned to conquer. This map was supposed to be used by thousands of Hezbollah terrorists on the day of the order to raid the territory of the State of Israel, as Hamas did on Oct. 7,' he said. Hagari also detailed three IDF raids into Southern Lebanon, including the villages of Meiss El Jabal, Kfarkela and Ayta ash Shab. In Ayta ash Shab, soldiers found dozens of underground shafts and tunnels to a depth of 20 to 25 meters (65 to 83 feet), rocket launchers and more than 10 ammunition stores. In Meiss El Jabal, soldiers entered the houses of the village, where they found an ammunition depot for an entire company of Radwan terrorists in a 12-meter-deep shaft just 30 meters (98 feet) from the border with Israel. Weapons stores were meant for future use in the planned invasion of Northern Israel, Hagari said. Terrorist infrastructure was destroyed by a combination of ground demolitions and air attacks. Some of the raids took Israeli forces 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) into Lebanon, but most were a distance of two to three kilometers (1.2 to 1.8 miles) from Israel’s border. Israeli forces would sometimes spend a few days in enemy territory. But their work was carried out in secret, unchallenged by Hezbollah terrorists, according to the IDF.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Following Iran's launch of 181 missiles throughout Israel on Tuesday, Israeli officials said that the Islamic State will pay a steep price for the escalation. Israel's Military Chief of Staff, Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi issued a statement after a security assessment of the situation. 'We proved our capability to prevent the enemy from succeeding by combining exemplary civil behavior and a powerful air defense system,' he said. 'We will choose when to exact the price and prove our precise and unexpected attack capabilities in accordance with the will of the political sphere,' Halevi added. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said, 'This attack will have consequences. We have plans. We will act where and when we decide. We are in a high state of readiness for defense and offense - we will defend the citizens of the State of Israel.' Despite sirens sounding off all over the country, there were no reported casualties 'thanks to the responsible conduct of the public,' Hagari said. 'We ask not to give information to the enemy and not to publish footage from areas struck by missiles,' he added. Following the attack, Cultural and Sports Minister Miki Zohar said that 'the foolish Iranian leader who made the worst decision in its history will pay a very heavy price. This is the beginning of the end of the cursed Iranian regime.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich added, 'Like Gaza, Hezbollah, and the state of Lebanon, Iran will regret this moment.' National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir called for 13,000 emergency squad volunteers be deployed throughout the country. A US official told Kan News, 'A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will result in severe consequences for Iran.' 'We are in the midst of a campaign against the axis of evil of Iran. These are days of great achievements and great challenges,' they continued.

By JNS Eight people were killed in a terrorist shooting on Jerusalem Boulevard in Tel Aviv-Jaffa on Tuesday night, according to Hebrew-language media. Three others are in serious condition and additional people were wounded in the attack. Two terrorists were killed at the scene. 'There are several wounded with varying degrees of injuries,' the Magen David Adom medical response group said in a statement. The organization declared a mass casualty event. The victims were taken to Wolfsin Medical Center in Holon and Sourasky Tel Aviv Medical Center (Ichilov Hospital). A police officer on the scene said the terrorist attack involved at least two gunmen who exited a train car and opened fire at people waiting at one of the light rail stations on Jaffa’s Jerusalem Boulevard. מתל אביב יפו: פיגוע ירי קשה מאוד בשדרות ירושלים ביפו.שתי זירות בתחנת רכבת ובית כנסת : שני מחבלים10 נפגעים אנוש וקשה pic.twitter.com/m379mToZIZ &mdash; יוני בן מנחם yoni ben menachem (@yonibmen) October 1, 2024 This is a developing story.

Iran launches massive missile barrage at Israel	The extent of the attack is not yet known. Hebrew-language media reports that Iran has fired more than 100 missiles. By JNS Iran has fired a barrage of missiles at Israel forcing the entire civilian population of the country to be ordered into bomb shelters, the Israel Defense Forces said Tuesday. 'A short while ago, missiles were launched from Iran towards the State of Israel,' the IDF stated. 'You are instructed to remain alert and precisely follow the Home Front Command’s instructions.' The IDF wrote on X/Twitter that 'all Israeli civilians' are sheltering from the attack. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the IDF spokesman, asked Israelis to remain vigilant. 'The air-defense system is fully operational, detecting and intercepting threats wherever necessary, even at this moment,' he said. 'However, the defense is not hermetic.' The extent of the attack is not yet known. Hebrew-language media reports that Iran has fired more than 100 missiles. Three Israeli officials told The New York Times that the feared assault could involve suicide drones and missiles fired towards the Jewish state. One U.S. official told the Times it would involve ballistic missiles, while another said that it was unclear what kind of attack would be launched. The targets of the Iranian attack are believed to be three Israeli Air Force bases, as well as an IDF military intelligence headquarters just north of Tel Aviv, which was reportedly evacuated on Tuesday afternoon. Israel informed Washington that an attack from Iran was imminent earlier on Tuesday. A direct Iranian attack on Israel will carry 'severe consequences' for the Islamic Republic, a senior White House official told JNS. 'A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran,' the White House official added. In April, Iran conducted its first-ever direct attack on Israeli territory, launching some 300 missiles and drones, the vast majority of which were shot down in a multinational effort. It said it attacked in retaliation for an April 1 strike that killed a top Iranian general in Damascus. In recent months, Iran and its allies have vowed to avenge the alleged Israeli killing of Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s 'political' bureau, and Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah, assassinated by Israel on Sept. 27. The United States Embassy in Jerusalem reportedly sent its employees home on Tuesday afternoon and told them to be prepared to enter bomb shelters, the first such order given since the April attack.

Mexico’s Sheinbaum takes office, making history as first Jewish w...	Sheinbaum’s inauguration caps an unlikely four-decade climb that has taken the daughter of activist academics to the presidential palace. By The Algemeiner and Reuters When Claudia Sheinbaum takes her oath of office on Tuesday, formally becoming Mexico’s first Jewish woman president, she will adopt a new government logo that nods to the aspirations of young girls. 'A young Mexican woman will be the emblem of Mexico’s government,' Sheinbaum wrote a day earlier in a post on social media, unveiling the logo showing a young woman in profile hoisting a Mexican flag, her hair pulled back into a ponytail not unlike the incoming president’s signature look. Sheinbaum has embraced her historic feat in one of Latin America’s more socially conservative countries, which until now has been ruled by a series of 65 men since winning its independence from Spain two centuries ago. The former mayor of the sprawling Mexican capital, Sheinbaum has been bolstered by the popularity of outgoing leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, her political benefactor going back nearly a quarter century. But as the former climate scientist steps out of her predecessor’s shadow to lead the world’s largest Spanish-speaking nation, Sheinbaum will also face doubts and opposition from critics alarmed by the outgoing president’s 11th-hour reform drive. Enacted last month, the reforms included a judicial overhaul that will over the next three years replace all of the country’s judges with new jurists elected by popular vote. 'Our hard-won democracy will be transformed, for all practical purposes, into a one-party autocracy,' wrote former President Ernesto Zedillo in a Sunday guest essay for Britain’s Economist Magazine. Critics of Lopez Obrador and Sheinbaum fear their ruling Morena party has too much power, and that democratic checks on executive power will be undermined. The judicial overhaul’s implementation will fall to Sheinbaum, who will also face a widening government budget deficit that could crimp popular welfare spending and costly crime-fighting initiatives at a time when the economy is only expected to grow modestly. The 62-year-old Sheinbaum promised continuity on the campaign trail, and now faces the balancing act of advancing Lopez Obrador’s state-centric economic polices, especially over natural resources such as oil and minerals, while also making progress on issues seen as his weak points like the environment and security. She also makes history as the first president of Jewish heritage in the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country. A BIGGER LANDSLIDE Sheinbaum’s inauguration caps an unlikely four-decade climb that has taken the daughter of activist academics to the presidential palace. Six years ago, she made history as Mexico City’s first elected woman mayor. Until she stepped down last year to run for president, Sheinbaum was known as a data-driven manager, winning plaudits for reducing the megacity’s homicide rate by half, by boosting security spending on an expanded police force with higher salaries. She has pledged to replicate the strategy across Mexico, where drug cartels exert widespread influence. Sheinbaum has also promised to continue generous social spending on old-age pensions and youth scholarships, even though the government’s 2024 fiscal deficit is estimated at nearly 6 percent of gross domestic product. While she has expressed interest growing renewable energy projects, she has also said she will ensure the dominance of Mexico’s state-owned oil and power companies while opposing any privatizations. In 1995, Sheinbaum earned her doctorate in energy engineering from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and then pursued an academic career, including a stint on the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which later shared a Nobel Peace Prize with former US Vice President Al Gore. She launched her political career in 2000, when Lopez Obrador, then-Mexico City’s newly elected mayor, tapped her to be his environmental chief, tasked with improving the smoggy capital’s air quality, highways and public transport. Sheinbaum served as the chief spokesperson for Lopez Obrador’s first campaign for president in 2006, which he narrowly lost. In 2015, she was elected to run Mexico City’s largest borough, Tlalpan, and became the capital’s mayor three years later. That was the same year that Lopez Obrador’s third bid for the presidency ended in his own triumph, winning by a margin of more than 17 million votes. Last June, Sheinbaum bested her mentor’s margin of victory, polling more than 19 million votes ahead of her closest competitor, who was also a woman.

US announces $336 million in aid to Palestinian Arabs	Monday’s announcement brings the total U.S. humanitarian assistance for Palestinian Arabs to more than $1 billion since October 2023. By JNS On Monday, the United States announced nearly $336 million in additional humanitarian assistance for Arabs living in the Gaza Strip and Judea and Samaria. The additional funding will help those 'affected by the ongoing conflict,' according to a statement released by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The funding will enable USAID partners to continue providing humanitarian aid, food assistance, emergency health care, psychosocial services, safe drinking water, hygiene products and sanitation services, the statement said. It will also support emergency shelters to displaced Gazans ahead of the coming winter months.

Report: Biden administration leaked details of Israeli operation ...	Biden White House attempted to pressure Israel into limiting scope of Lebanon ground operation by leaking details of the incursion, senior Israeli official claims. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Biden administration leaked details of Israel's ground operation in southern Lebanon in a bid to pressure Jerusalem into limiting the scope and duration of the incursion, a senior Israeli official has claimed. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official told Israel's Kan News Tuesday morning that while the U.S. has given its blessing for a limited ground operation in southern Lebanon to root out Hezbollah forces and to secure Israel's northern border, the Biden administration is pressuring Israel to 'limit' the operation. According to the official, the White House leaked information regarding the operation itself, a 'dangerous' move which he said endangered Israeli troops. 'We didn't like that. It's clear to us that the U.S. is concerned — which is why they have 'tricks' to try and limit this matter,' the official said. The leak allegations may refer to comments by a senior American official who told media outlets Monday that Israel was preparing for an operation in Lebanon, emphasizing that the incursion would be 'limited.' Earlier on Tuesday, IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told foreign media outlets that the IDF is in the midst of a series of 'limited and targeted raids' along the Israel-Lebanon border, targeting Hezbollah positions. 'These localized ground raids will target Hezbollah strongholds that threaten Israeli towns, kibbutzim, and communities along our border.' Hagari added that the Israeli operation was planned in response to intelligence suggesting Hezbollah was preparing an invasion of northern Israel mirroring Hamas' invasion on October 7th. 'Hezbollah turned Lebanese villages near the Israeli border into military bases, all ready for an attack on Israel.' 'Hezbollah had prepared to use those villages as a staging ground for an October 7th-style invasion of Israeli homes.' The IDF last month said that it had killed members of Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force allegedly responsible for the planned invasion of northern Israel.

Turkey lobbies UN Security Council to force end to Israeli operat...	Denouncing IDF ground operation in southern Lebanon as 'unlawful invasion,' Ankara demands United Nations Security Council intervene and 'take necessary measures' against Israeli 'occupation' of Lebanon. By World Israel News Staff The Turkish government called Tuesday for the United Nations Security Council to force Israel to halt its ground operation in southern Lebanon, denouncing the counter-terror action as an 'unlawful invasion.' On Monday, Israeli forces crossed the Blue Line into Lebanese territory, launching what the IDF on Tuesday called a 'limited' operation in southern Lebanon. The incursion is aimed at pushing back Hezbollah forces from the Israeli border and preventing future attacks on northern Israeli towns, which have been evacuated since last October. In response, the Turkish foreign ministry released a statement castigating the Israeli operation, dubbing it an 'illegal invasion attempt' and calling on the United Nations to intervene to force Israel to withdraw its forces. 'Israel's violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon by launching a ground attack is an illegal invasion attempt. This attack must come to an end immediately, and Israeli troops must withdraw from Lebanese territory,' the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Ankara warned that if continued, the Israeli ground operation in Lebanon would spark a destabilizing wave of mass migration which would empower 'extremists all around the world.' 'This attack targets the security and stability of the region and beyond. This dangerous invasion attempt is likely to spark a new wave of migration and to give ground to extremists all around the world. These developments will also affect the countries that provide political support and arms to Israel.' 'The UN Security Council must uphold international law and take the necessary measures against this attack that aims the occupation of Lebanon. Every crime committed by Israel is also a blow to international law and the UN Charter.' Turkey also reiterated its call for the United Nations to force a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and to prevent Israel from continuing its operations against Hamas. 'The main step that must be taken to restore peace in the region is to achieve immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza. Bringing peace to Gaza is the responsibility of the entire humanity.'

Three injured as Hezbollah missiles pound central Israel in attac...	The Lebanese terror group launches missile barrage targeting Mossad headquarters in central Israel, hitting a freeway and injuring three people. By World Israel News Staff At least three people were injured Tuesday morning, after Hezbollah terrorists operating out of Lebanon launched a barrage of missiles and rockets at central Israel. At least five projectiles were launched towards Israel Tuesday morning, including a number of Fadi-4 missiles, one of the longer-ranged weapons in Hezbollah's arsenal. The terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it had targeted the headquarters of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency in Glilot, near Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv. Debris from an intercepted missile and the interceptor missile itself were reported in the central Israeli city of Kfar Saba, one missile launched Tuesday morning scored a direct hit on Highway 6, near Route 444, close to the city of Kfar Qassem. One man was struck by shrapnel from the missile impact, leaving him in moderate condition. The victim has been identified as a 54-year-old bus driver. He is said to have sustained shrapnel wounds to his head. A second driver was lightly injured as a result of being forced to abruptly stopping on the road to avoid the missile impact, while a police officer was lightly injured while assisting the first victim. Emergency first responders from Magen David Adom (MDA) and United Hatzalah were dispatched to the scene to treat the victims and to evacuate the bus driver to Beilinson Medical Center in Petah Tikva. Moshe Saadon, the head of United Hatzalah’s Elad branch, reported from the scene: 'We are providing initial medical aid to a man, approximately 50 years old, who sustained a head injury due to shrapnel.' 'At this stage, his condition is defined as moderate and stable. Fire department teams are operating at the scene due to the nature of the incident.' In addition to the missile attacks on central Israel, Hezbollah terrorists fired at least 30 rockets at northern Israel Tuesday, including at least 15 launched at the Western Galilee. The IDF responded to the attacks with airstrikes on Hezbollah weapon caches in Lebanon. Israeli ground forces entered southern Lebanon Monday night, the IDF announced Tuesday, as part of a 'limited' operation to clear Hezbollah threats from the Israeli frontier.

Texas to mark Oct. 7 anniversary with moment of silence, lowered ...	Texas will always stand with the State of Israel and the Israeli people as they continue to defend their freedoms in the face of pure evil,' the governor said. By JNS Texas Gov. Greg Abbott plans to hold a state-wide moment of silence at 7 a.m. on Oct. 7 to mark the one-year anniversary of Hamas’s invasion of southern Israel. The governor, a pro-Israel Republican, also announced that state and U.S. flags will be at half-staff in Texas that day. 'I ask all Texans to join me in a moment of silence to remember the men, women and children who were brutally murdered or injured during acts of war committed by Hamas and for the seven Americans still held hostage,' Abbott stated. 'Texas will always stand with the State of Israel and the Israeli people as they continue to defend their freedoms in the face of pure evil,' he added. 'Cecilia and I continue to pray that this war will be brought to a swift, victorious conclusion for the Jewish community and the State of Israel.' Abbott added in a proclamation that he saw the 'carnage caused by Hamas' firsthand when he visited Israel in November. 'Meeting with displaced Israelis, including many families, and visiting with victims recovering in a hospital in Tel Aviv, it was sheer evil and savagery unmatched by anything I’ve ever seen,' he stated. 'What we have seen is gut-wrenching acts of war committed by Hamas.' 'The State of Israel is right and, moreover, righteous in pursuing the elimination of Hamas, and the State of Texas will do everything in our power to support the Jewish people here in Texas and in their defense of their homeland,' he added.' October 7, 2023 was a day of unimaginable horrors for Israel.

Trump’s would-be killer pleads not guilty to attempted assassinat...	Routh hid outside a fence overlooking the sixth hole of the course, where authorities found an AK-47-style rifle. By Reuters and The Washington Free Beacon The man charged with attempting to assassinate Donald Trump after allegedly positioning himself with a rifle outside one of the former president's Florida golf courses on Sept. 15 pleaded not guilty on Monday to five federal charges. Ryan Routh, 58, entered the plea to charges that include attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate during a hearing in federal court. He has already been ordered to remain in jail to await a trial. Prosecutors have said Routh intended to kill Trump as he golfed at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. Routh condemned the Republican presidential candidate in a self-published book and dropped off a letter left months earlier with an associate referencing an attempted assassination on Trump, according to prosecutors. 'This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you,' the suspect wrote, according to a court filing by prosecutors. Lawyers for Routh suggested at a Sept. 23 court hearing that the letter may have been an attempt by their client at gaining publicity and highlighted what they called Routh's efforts to promote democracy in Ukraine and Taiwan. Routh hid outside a fence overlooking the sixth hole of the course, where authorities found an AK-47-style rifle, a bag of snacks, a digital camera, and bags containing metal plates meant to withstand return fire by the U.S. Secret Service, according to prosecutors. A Secret Service agent patrolling the course ahead of Trump spotted Routh and opened fire after noticing the rifle sticking through a fence. Routh fled and was later arrested along a Florida highway, prosecutors said. Routh was initially charged with gun-related offenses. An indictment last week added the attempted assassination charge along with assault on a federal officer and possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence. The Florida incident was the second apparent assassination attempt on Trump in a roughly two-month span, raising questions about protection of the candidate ahead of the Nov. 5 election. A gunman wounded Trump's right ear and killed an attendee at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 before being killed by a Secret Service sniper.

Biden Defense Secretary speaks with Israeli defense chief as IDF ...	Israeli defense minister discusses scope of new ground war in Lebanon, as well as Israel's goals after IDF ground forces enter southern Lebanon. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant (Likud) spoke by phone with U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin overnight, the Israeli Defense Ministry announced Tuesday morning. The two spoke shortly after Israeli ground forces entered Lebanon, launching the IDF's much-anticipated ground campaign against Hezbollah. During their conversation, Gallant discussed the scope of the new ground operation and its goals, emphasizing the centrality of ensuring the safe return of Israel’s citizens to their homes in the north. Gallant also briefed the Defense Secretary on the operational and strategic measures required to achieve this objective. The Israeli Defense Minister and Austin agreed on the importance of dismantling the terrorist infrastructure along Israel's northern border to prevent attacks by Hezbollah against Israeli citizens. To this end, Gallant discussed the localized and targeted raids that the IDF launched overnight, against Hezbollah terror targets in the border area of southern Lebanon. These ground operations, he said, build on the recent and ongoing measures taken to eliminate senior Hezbollah leadership and to degrade Hezbollah’s offensive capabilities, including Friday's killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, and the pager and radio bombings earlier this month which killed dozens of Hezbollah operatives and injured thousands more. Minister Gallant and Secretary Austin also discussed ongoing threats posed by Iran and its proxies in the region, including Iranian proxies and militias in Iraq, Yemen and Syria. They discussed the importance of U.S. force posture and the interoperability of U.S. and Israeli defensive capabilities. Austin and Gallant also discussed ongoing military efforts in the southern arena. The Israeli defense chief reiterated his determination to achieve a framework that will enable the return of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, and highlighted the critical timing and current window of opportunity to advance this issue.

New evidence Hamas burned children to death on October 7th	Video and forensic evidence gathered over months shows the Islamists burned and shot 27 minors to death, including infants. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News After eleven months of painstaking investigation, the Israel Police reported Thursday that it had proof of Hamas terrorists’ massacre of fully 27 children during their October 7 invasion of Israel. 'We collected 11,666 videos that provide a comprehensive evidentiary basis gathered from various sources from just one kibbutz, which will enable us to file some of the most severe indictments against the perpetrators of these brutal terror acts,' said Superintendent Reut Anoim, head of Lahav 433’ cyber investigation division that led the meticulous effort. Video evidence was collected from victims’ phones, home surveillance and street cameras in the entire Gaza envelope, as well as the GoPro cameras that the terrorists themselves wore to record their atrocities and the clips they posted to social media glorifying their war crimes. Eyewitness testimony by survivors, evidence gathered by those finding the dead in the aftermath, such as volunteers of the ZAKA Search and Rescue units, together with the thorough work of forensic specialists examining the remains, were also used to prove conclusively that despite Hamas denials, its men murdered minors from infanthood to age 17 in horrific ways. 'That children were burned, shot and murdered alongside their parents is a proven fact,' said Dudi Katz, the head of the 433 cyber unit. 'Children witnessed their parents being murdered and we found a scene with a pile of bodies from the same family more than once.' In one case, Katz said, there was evidence that a young child of six or seven had been burned alive. 'His glazed expression indicated that he had been burned alive.' The police were determined to build an airtight legal case against the perpetrators, ultimately going through over 200,000 video clips, some of which were found to be bogus. 'We worked hard to maintain the highest standards of verification and cross-referencing, compared to the fake materials circulating on social media,' Anoim said. The question now is when will justice be served. The IDF has captured thousands of Hamas terrorists since taking the war into Gaza, an unknown number of whom took part in the surprise attack in which 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals were massacred overall and 251 taken hostage. The army’s Unit 504, Shabak and police investigators have all participated in interrogating prisoners, with authorities even publicizing clips of some terrorists confessing the crimes they committed in Gaza envelope communities on the day Israel calls 'the black Sabbath.' Yet to date, no indictments have been filed against any terrorist. Israel has yet to decide whether to try them in a standard court, as if the Islamic extremists were regular, though heinous, criminals, in a military court as they acted as an organized, if illegal, fighting force, or in a special court, as terrorists are not legally defined as military personnel. According to a Walla report last month, some people in the state prosecutor’s office want to delay bringing charges because of the possibility that captured terrorists may still shed light on additional murders their compatriots in prison have committed. The police reacted to the report by saying that the arrest of Hamas fighters in Gaza is ongoing and will probably last a long time, and it is time to start using the mountains of evidence they have collected against specific terrorists.

‘Mafia tactics’: How Hezbollah intimidates Christians, steals sou...	We’re talking about extortion, forcing Christians to pay protection money, burning houses and cars and kidnapping businessmen,' said Elias Zarina, co-founder and community manager of the Jerusalemite Initiative. By Pesach Benson, TPS The phone rests on the car’s dashboard filming nothing out of the ordinary as it passes the green pasture of the southern Lebanese village of Aanquon. The driver carefully lifts the phone, as if to take a selfie, but there’s no cheerful smile on his face. In the background over his shoulder — on the other side of the street in front of a small house — is a rocket launcher attached to a truck. It passes out of view as the car drives past. But it is unmistakable. The video, shared with The Press Service of Israel, is a symbol of the 'mafia tactics' Hezbollah has adopted in southern Lebanon, embedding its forces in Christian communities, stealing property and extorting business owners. 'For almost 20 years, Hezbollah groups have been systematically oppressing Christians in southern Lebanon, seizing homes and factories for use by Hezbollah members,' one southern Lebanese Christian told TPS-IL after evacuating to Beirut. He works in health care in the town of Marjayoun, but otherwise insists on anonymity. 'I will be killed along with my family members on charges of collaborating with Israel, without trial or justice, [but with] executions in public squares.' Elias Zarina, co-founder and community manager of the Jerusalemite Initiative, a Jerusalem-based non-profit that encourages Arab-speaking integration into Israeli society has been hearing similar stories from his contacts in Lebanon. Zarina is also a researcher and specialist in the Middle East’s Christian and other minority communities. 'Hezbollah uses mafia tactics in south Lebanon,' he tells TPS-IL. 'We’re talking about extortion, forcing Christians to pay protection money, burning houses and cars and kidnapping businessmen. Those are the tactics they use. The Lebanese government doesn’t do anything. It’s dominated by Hezbollah.' Lebanon’s 2.24 million Christians make up one-third of the country’s population. 'The Lebanese avoid sharing these stories because they’re afraid. If there’s an attack from Israel, if Hezbollah sees you filming, they take your phone or camera and break it. Not just Christians, but Muslims too. They’ll be in trouble. Everyone’s afraid,' Zarina said. ‘They Show Up in the Village’ Explaining the video, Zarina told TPS-IL, 'Hezbollah stores the trucks and launchers at a facility in, say Nabatieh. When they’re ready to fire, they show up in the village and choose a time to launch it.' The home beside the launcher is Christian, he added. 'Radical Islamic terrorists all have the same strategy,' Zarina explained. They always want to pressure Christians to force the Western countries to go against Israel. They want to put Christians between them and Israel to portray Israelis as Nazis.' Aanquon is a microcosm of what Hezbollah is trying to achieve. 'In 2000, before Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon, Aanquoun was about two-thirds Christian,' said Zarina. 'Today, Christians are about 18%. From 2000 to today, the Christian population shrunk. Hezbollah has been trying to take over the houses, forcing them to leave. Hezbollah’s goal is to take control of all of south Lebanon and store missiles inside private homes. The more property they control, the safer it is for Hezbollah figures to operate.' Said the anonymous health care worker to TPS-IL, 'The Christian world must understand that Christians in Lebanon in general – and in the south in particular – have become an ethnic minority after they were masters of this country. Iran occupied Lebanon through its arm,' referring to Hezbollah. The evacuation from southern Lebanon has exacerbated those tensions. A well-respected southern Lebanese Christian who tweets anonymously under the name Sobalaan, wrote on Friday, 'They monitor empty apartments and expatriate homes, and there may be subsequent attempts to break into them.' Zarina adds that his contacts have shared reports of empty Christian homes being looted by Hezbollah. When Israeli forces abruptly withdrew from southern Lebanon in May 2000, members of the Southern Lebanese Army, a Christian militia that worked with Israel fled, mostly to Israel or North America. But the Christians who were not associated with the SLA stayed because 'They thought they were safe,' Zarina said. 'But they’re the ones being pressured to sell their property to Hezbollah.' Asked if he has any message for the Israelis, the resident told TPS-IL, 'We trusted them [Israelis] and fought together against the terrorists, and in the end, they betrayed the covenant and gave southern Lebanon to the Shi’ites,' without elaborating. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, the Iran-backed Hezbollah began firing rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities, killing 49 people. According to figures released by the government on Sept. 29, more than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. Israel’s war goals include securely returning northern residents to their homes. Israeli officials demand that Hezbollah to be disarmed and removed from southern Lebanon in compliance with UN Security Council resolution 1701 which ended the Second Lebanon War of 2006. This includes all areas south of the Litani River such as the cities of Nabatieh and Tyre, as well as the Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon.

‘The worst Democratic performance in a generation’: CNN sounds al...	Earlier this month, Harris became the first Democratic presidential nominee not to receive the Teamsters endorsement in nearly 30 years. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon CNN data reporter Harry Enten admitted that Vice President Kamala Harris has the 'worst' support among union households for a Democratic presidential candidate 'in a generation,' while Donald Trump is 'doing very, very well' with the historically Democratic voting block. 'You know, you go back to 1992, Bill Clinton won that union vote by 30 points, and Hillary Clinton only won it by 12 points back in 2016,' Enten told CNN host Sara Sidner on Monday. 'But look at where Kamala Harris is today. She’s only leading by 9 points. That would be the worst Democratic performance in a generation, 10 points off the mark of Joe Biden.' The polling comes just one day before the International Longshoremen’s Association union is set to strike across all Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports from Maine to Texas. Port and business leaders blamed the Biden-Harris administration’s lack of leadership for the strike, which is expected to have detrimental effects on America’s supply chain and cost the economy about $5 billion a day, according to a JP Morgan analysis. Former president Trump is 'doing very, very well' among working-class voters as well as with other demographics that have previously voted for Democratic presidents, Enten said. 'And this is part of a larger trend that we’re seeing throughout our politics in which Republicans, specifically Donald Trump, is doing very, very well among working-class voters, whether they were in unions, whether they went to trade school, or whether they’re voters of color,' Enten added. Trump has more working class support than any GOP presidential candidate in a generation. He's on track for the best performance among union voters in 40 years. He's up 31 points among trade school grads. He's doing 17 pts better among nonwhite non-college voters than in 2020. pic.twitter.com/0ObrWWNzYf &mdash; (((Harry Enten))) (@ForecasterEnten) September 30, 2024 Earlier this month, Harris became the first Democratic presidential nominee not to receive the Teamsters endorsement in nearly 30 years. The union declined to back a candidate after a strong majority—59.6 to 34 percent—of its rank-and-file members voted to endorse Trump. The Teamsters, one of the country's largest unions, has historically supported Democratic candidates for president. Trump holds a 31-point advantage over Harris among vocational and trade school graduates. In 1992 pre-election polling, Bill Clinton led that vote over George H.W. Bush by 7 points. 'That has moved from being a core Democratic group to now being a core group of Donald Trump’s massive amount of support among the working class,' the CNN reporter noted. Harris has also been polling worse among 'non-college voters of color' than Democrats have in previous elections, while Trump has gained support within that demographic, according to CNN. 'Joe Biden won that group by 45 points. Look at where Kamala Harris’s support is today. She’s still leading amongst that group, but that lead is down &#8230; to just 28 points,' Enten said. 'The fact is Donald Trump seems to have gone into a hotbed of traditional Democratic support and made a lot of movement in ways I don’t think a lot of people would have thought when he went down that escalator just back in 2015.'

IDF to Lebanese: ‘Don’t go south of the Litani’	Hezbollah is using civilians as human shields to carry out attacks against Israel,' warns IDF spokesman. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli military warned Lebanese citizens not to travel south of the Litani River in an Arabic-language message on Tuesday morning, hours after Israeli soldiers began a late-night invasion of the region. 'There is intense fighting in southern Lebanon, in which Hezbollah operatives are using the civilian environment and you as a human shield to organize to carry out attacks,' Col. Avichay Adraee, the IDF’s Arabic-language spokesman, said in a recorded video statement published on social media platform X. 'For the benefit of your personal safety, we ask you to avoid traveling in vehicles&#8230;south of the Litani River. This warning is in effect until further notice.' The vast majority of civilians had already evacuated from their villages in southern Lebanon prior to the escalation between Israel and Hezbollah, which began about two weeks ago. Days before the beeper explosions served as an opening salvo to an intensive bombing and assassination campaign, it was believed that just 20 percent of southern Lebanon's residents had remained in their homes. The invasion comes after Israel assassinated Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, along with the entirety of the terror organization's senior leadership. Some one million Lebanese have been displaced by the ongoing fighting between Hezbollah and Israel, with tens of thousands said to have crossed the border into neighboring Syria. 'Lebanon is facing one of the most dangerous stages in its history,' Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati told representatives from UN aid organizations and international ambassadors on Tuesday. The decision to invade Lebanon is 'important, correct and necessary,' Public Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said in a statement on Tuesday. 'At the same time, this is the time not to stop, [we must] continue doing everything to crush Hezbollah, with all our might,' he continued. 'I pray for the success of the IDF soldiers who are currently fighting in difficult conditions in southern Lebanon; the people of Israel stand behind them.'

22 dead in Israeli airstrikes in Syria as IDF enters southern Leb...	Israeli warplanes bomb Iranian base in eastern Syria and regime positions in Damascus, killing at least 22, as IDF ground forces enter southern Lebanon. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli airstrikes killed at least 22 people in two separate attacks in Syria overnight, according to a state media outlet and an opposition observer organization. According to a report by SANA, the Syrian state-controlled broadcaster, Israeli warplanes and unmanned aircraft struck Damascus at 2:05 a.m. Tuesday, approaching the Syrian capital from the direction of the Golan Heights. Three people were killed in the attack, SANA claimed, including television news anchor Safaa Ahmed. Nine others were injured in the strikes, SANA reported. In a separate attack overnight, Israeli fighter jets hit an Iranian base in eastern Syria, and a number of weapons caches and warehouses. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a group opposed to the Assad regime, reported that 19 members of pro-Iranian militias were killed in the strikes, with 18 more injured in the attacks. The dead included seven Syrian nationals, nine Iraqis, and three'non-Syrians' whose nationality was not reported. The strikes reportedly targeted Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps positions in Deir Ezzor, 56 miles (90 kilometers) from the Iraqi border, and outside of Al Bukamal. The targets included an Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps guesthouse in the village of Al-Heri, two weapons caches in Al-Hizzam, a warehouse in Al-Suwaiyah, the IRGC regional headquarters in Deir Ezzor, and a radar facility. The airstrikes came just hours after IDF ground forces entered southern Lebanon. On Tuesday, the IDF confirmed that a limit ground operation in Lebanon had begun. 'The IDF is operating according to a methodical plan set out by the General Staff and the Northern Command which IDF soldiers have trained and prepared for in recent months,' the Israeli military said. 'The Israeli Air Force and IDF Artillery are supporting the ground forces with precise strikes on military targets in the area.'

Biden admin offers cautious support for Lebanon invasion	Washington reiterates it supports Israel's right to defend itself, but urge ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff Several prominent Biden administration officials offered cautious support for the Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon which began late Monday evening, though many continued calling for a ceasefire between Israel and the Hezbollah terror group. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin wrote on social media platform X that he had spoken to his Israeli counterpart, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and expressed his support for an Israeli incursion limited to areas directly adjacent to the border. 'I made it clear that the United States supports Israel’s right to defend itself. We agreed on the necessity of dismantling attack infrastructure along the border to ensure that Lebanese Hezbollah cannot conduct October 7-style attacks on Israel’s northern communities,' Austin said. But, he continued, 'a diplomatic resolution is required to ensure that civilians can return safely to their homes on both sides of the border.' Austin did not reference nearly a year of failed talks aimed at achieving such a diplomatic solution. 'I reiterated the serious consequences for Iran in the event Iran chooses to launch a direct military attack against Israel,' he added. 'Israel has a right to defend itself against Hezbollah. If you look at how this conflict across Israel’s northern border started, it was Hezbollah that started launching attacks on Israel on October 8th. And those attacks continued and have continued and are continuing,' U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Tuesday morning. 'If you look at what the acting leader of Hezbollah said just today, it’s that their attacks on Israel will continue. So Israel has a right to defend itself against those attacks. That includes in targeting terrorist infrastructure inside Lebanon.' Miller concluded by stressing that Washington 'ultimately want to see a diplomatic resolution to conflict in the Middle East that provides long-term security for the people of Israel, the people of Lebanon, and the Palestinian people.' When asked by a reporter if he was aware that Israel had begun its ground invasion of Lebanon, Biden responded that 'I'm more aware than you might know, and I'm comfortable with them stopping. We should have a cease-fire now.'

By World Israel News Staff An Iranian elite intelligence unit aimed at thwarting Mossad activity was thoroughly infiltrated by the Mossad, said former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in a bombshell interview with CNN Turkey on Monday. 'Israel can even threaten the safety of the [Supreme Leader Ali] Khamenei with its intelligence network operating in Iran through the Mossad. Let me give an example from eight years ago to understand the kind of power Israel has achieved within Iran through the Mossad,' Ahmadinejad said. 'Israel organizes complex operations inside Iran,' he continued. 'They can easily obtain very important information. Iranian authorities are still silent about this situation. Mossad had such a large network of agents in Iran, both on the streets and within the government, that they could have assassinated anyone they wanted to.' Ahmadinejad added that the Iranian in charge of the country's anti-Mossad unit 'was an Israeli agent.' The former president also said that this individual, along with 20 others in the unit, were responsible for the theft of classified documents regarding Iran's nuclear program, which were presented to the United Nations by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2018. Those double agents also were responsible for the assassination of several Iranian nuclear scientists, then fled the country. 'The Mossad has infiltrated various state units in Iran over the past ten years. All government officials now need to fear for their lives,' former Iranian foreign minister Ali Younesi said in a 2022 interview. 'Things have gotten to a point where they have started openly threatening government officials. As someone who worked in the intelligence ministry, the situation pains me.' According to recent reports, the Mossad has foiled some 50 terror attacks since the October 7th massacres. A recent failed suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is thought to have been planned by Iran.

Israeli tanks cross into Lebanon for the first time since 2006 – ...	Areas in northern Israel, including Metula, Misgav Am, and Kfar Gilad, were declared a closed military zone, and entry was prohibited. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News As of 10:30 on Monday night, Al-Arabiya reports that Israeli tanks crossed the border into southern Lebanon. The Lebanese army withdrew from areas in southern Lebanon, and IDF began to open fire. Areas in northern Israel, including Metula, Misgav Am, and Kfar Gilad, were declared a closed military zone, and entry was prohibited. Earlier on Monday, Israel intercepted missiles coming from Lebanon targeting Central Galilee and Haifa Bay. This occurred after the IAF destroyed a storage area for missile launchers close to the Beirut airport. In addition, Israel destroyed dozens of terror targets in Lebanon, including command centers, weapons storage facilities, terrorist cells, launchers, and additional terror infrastructure sites. The Wall Street Journal reported early on Monday that Elite units have been making short intelligence raids for weeks and even months in anticipation of acting on the necessity of permanently removing the Hezbollah terrorist organization from the border via a ground invasion. Their probes have included terror tunnels built by Hezbollah right up to Israel’s northern border, dug to enable its specialized Radwan force to invade the Galilee much as Hamas did on October 7, which sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. The fear of such a future invasion has led some 60,000 residents of the north to say that they will refuse to return home until the threat is nullified. A senior US official told Fox News on Monday that Israel is preparing to launch a 'limited' ground war in Lebanon. The war with Lebanon is expected to be smaller and shorter in duration than in 2006. Despite US President Joe Biden’s insistence on Sunday that the US would not send more troops into Lebanon, the Pentagon said it would deploy a few thousand soldiers to supplement the US forces already in the region. The purpose of the deployment is to protect US troops already there and, if necessary, to defend Israel.

Israeli security forces warn Iran is recruiting Israelis for assa...	Iranians using false identities on the internet are contacting Israelis and paying them to carry out random, even seemingly innocent tasks. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Shin Bet, Israel's security agency, is warning the public to be vigilant that Iranians are recruiting Israelis to carry out assassination plots. The security agency has had to take measures to quell such attempts, several of which were in advanced stages. Iranians using false identities on the internet are contacting Israelis and paying them to carry out random, even seemingly innocent tasks. They are attempting to contact Israelis through digital currency sites, job platforms, and Israeli finance sites. The agents persuade their contacts to do simple tasks, such as burying devices and money or distributing flyers for large amounts of money. The requests often escalate to writing graffiti, setting vehicles on fire, and, in some cases, physically harming people. Shin Bet has asked the Israeli public to be on guard against being contacted by strangers who ask them to carry out errands and simple tasks for large amounts of money. Earlier in the month, The Shin Bet foiled an Iranian plot to assassinate high-profile figures in Israel, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. After Hamas politburo head Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran – an act which was widely attributed to Israel, but for which Jerusalem has not officially claimed responsibility – Iran sought to kill an Israeli leader in retaliation. Iranian intelligence also considered killing Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar, and former prime minister Naftali Bennett, the Shin Bet said. Iran recruited a Jewish-Israeli businessman living in Turkey as part of their plot, smuggling him twice into Iran to discuss carrying out missions for the Islamic regime in exchange for payment. The Israeli businessman, 73, had lived in Turkey for long periods of time. Tehran was said to have made contact with the man via Turkish businesspeople. The Israeli, who has not been publicly named, was arrested last month. A gag order on reporting about the pending criminal case against him was recently lifted. During his visits to Iran, which occurred in April and August 2024, the Israeli met with high-level Iranian intelligence officials. He was asked to engage in surveillance activities, such as photographing public places in Israel. The Israeli knew that the discussions' goal was to 'advance assassination attacks' on Israeli officials, the Shin Bet said.

Houthis are causing a shofar shortage ahead of Rosh Hashana celeb...	The Houthis, an Iran-backed Yemenite terror group, are interfering with deliveries. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News As Rosh Hashana approaches, the nearly year-long war is causing a shortage of shofars, the traditional ram's horn instrument that makes a plaintive cry during the Jewish New Year prayer service. Many of these instruments arrive in Israel through the port of Eilat, and the Houthis, a Yemenite Iran-backed terror group, are interfering with deliveries. Shippers have re-routed shofar deliveries, causing delays and fewer shofars delivered to Israel. Jan-Elazar Refoua, who sells Judaica and gifts in downtown Jerusalem and specializes in shofars, reported that he usually sells six shofars a day in the period leading up to Rosh Hashana, but this year, he often sells just one daily. Refoua spoke with Jerusalem Post about the difficulties leading up to Rosh Hashana, 'I went to order merchandise, and they would say, 'OK, it will be another week, or another two weeks,'' he explained. The prices were 15% to 20% higher when the shofars were finally available. The shortage has not created the problem of scarcity since tourism has also declined dramatically during the war, and therefore, fewer people are buying them. However, despite the hardship created by the war, Refoua still hopes his business will survive and even thrive after the war. 'I have been here in this store for 42 years. We got through all the terror attacks and coronavirus,' he added that his wife was injured in a terror attack. Refoua, who has three sons in reserves in Gaza, said, 'The main thing is that there should be more quiet and peace and that the soldiers will return in peace; that is what really matters.' 'We are like a sword – it gets stronger from being in the flame – heated and cooled,' he added. 'Shofar is godly music,' he said. 'Sometimes you don't hear it with your ears; you hear it with your heart. It's a different feeling.'

Do most Israelis think now is the time to attack Iran’s nuclear f...	The Israeli public was asked whether Israel should now seize the momentum it has gained through its recent strikes on Hezbollah to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. By Caroline B. Glick, JNS Israelis are almost unanimous in their support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision not to coordinate the airstrike that targeted Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah with the Biden administration in advance of its commission, a new JNS poll conducted by Direct Polls show. 'According to reports, Israel did not coordinate with the United States in advance of it carrying out its operation to assassinate Hassan Nasrallah. Do you think it was the right decision or the wrong decision? Eighty-three percent of respondents responded that it was the right decision. Nine percent felt it was the wrong decision. Eight percent did not know. For the past several decades, Hezbollah ground forces and missile arsenal in Lebanon have deterred Israel from attacking Iran. Fearing that Iran would order Hezbollah to attack Israel with daily barrages of thousands of missiles and order its ground forces to invade the Galilee, Israel delayed acting directly against Iran’s nuclear and missile installations. The public was asked whether Israel should now seize the momentum it has gained through its recent strikes on Hezbollah to attack Iran's nuclear facilities before the U.S. elections. Sixty-two percent of the public answered affirmatively. Twenty-six percent said that Israel should abstain from using its momentum to attack Iran’s nuclear facilities ahead of the U.S. elections. Twelve percent said they did not know. Finally, JNS asked which candidate for U.S. president Israelis believe will be more sympathetic to Israel’s interests. Sixty-five percent of respondents said Republican candidate Donald Trump would be more sympathetic to Israel’s interests. Just 13% of Israelis believe that Democratic candidate Kamala Harris would be more supportive of Israel. Fifteen percent of respondents said that both would be equally sympathetic to Israeli interests and 7% said neither would be sympathetic to Israel’s interests. The results of the JNS poll align with results of one commissioned by Channel 14 and conducted last week by Direct Polls. That survey, carried out the day before Israel’s elimination of Nasrallah, asked the public whether they believed that the U.S. has weakened or strengthened Israel in its struggle to remove military threats to its national security from the south and the north of the country. Fifty-seven percent of respondents said the U.S. has weakened Israel. Thirty-five percent responded that the U.S. has strengthened Israel. Eight percent didn’t know. The thrust of both polls indicate that Israelis believe that the Biden administration does not share or support Israel’s war goals and are concerned that the administration will use the lame-duck period between the Nov. 5 presidential election and the inauguration of the next president on Jan. 20, 2025, to undermine Israel’s capacity to win the war.

State of Israeli tourism after a year of war	Most of the visitors to Israel over the past year have been Jewish (62%) with 29% being Christian (Catholic and evangelical). By JNS On the eve of Jewish year 5785, the Israeli Tourism Ministry has published an overview of the state of the country’s tourism industry after a year of war, and its efforts to handle Israel’s tens of thousands of internal evacuees, many of whom have been placed in hotels. Israel suffered a loss of about 18.7 billion shekels ($5 billion) from incoming tourism and 756 million shekels ($203 million) from domestic tourism, according to the ministry. Since the outbreak of war, around 853,000 tourist entries have been registered, mainly from (in descending order): the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Russia and the Philippines. The Swords of Iron War disrupted the tourism industry’s recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. Based on the pace of tourist arrivals until the war, a new incoming tourism record appeared in the offing, surpassing 2019’s 4.5 million entries. But in 2023, only 3 million tourist entries were recorded. And in 2024 only 1 million arrivals are expected. Most of the visitors to Israel over the past year have been Jewish (62%) with 29% being Christian (Catholic and evangelical). About 44% came to visit friends and family, 28% gave classic tourism as the reason for their visit and 13% came for business. Seventy-three percent of tourists had previously visited Israel. Of the evacuees, 68,712 have not yet returned home, most of them from northern communities. Of those, 53,113 are staying within the community, while 15,599 are being hosted in hotels. Shortly after the war’s start, Tourism Minister Haim Katz requested and received authority to manage the evacuation of residents living along the conflict line. The ministry’s involvement in managing the evacuation has saved the state about 5.2 billion shekels ($1.4 billion) by eliminating agent commissions for hotel placements and due to the difference between hotel rates and grants for evacuees choosing other accommodation options. 'Our individualized and sensitive treatment of evacuees helped strengthen the home front’s resilience during Israel’s prolonged campaign,' said Katz. To date, the evacuation has cost 8.6 billion shekels ($2.3 billion), including 5.5 billion shekels ($1.5 billion) paid to hotels. The ministry booked approximately four million rooms and 13.5 million overnight stays. An additional 3.2 billion shekels (860 million) was paid in accommodation grants. 'We worked to preserve the infrastructure needed for the tourism industry for the day after and we continue our efforts to encourage tourism even during these challenging times,' said Katz. Despite the tourism crisis, the ministry continues to receive many grant requests for hotel construction and expansion. In 2023, grants were approved for the construction of 2,122 hotel rooms. Since the start of the war, seven hotels have opened with the assistance of the ministry, adding 765 rooms.

‘We refuse to be silent’ – First European memorial for October 7t...	Sweden hosts the first-ever memorial in Europe to the victims of the October 7th massacres. By World Israel News Staff The first European memorial event for the victims of October 7th was recently held in Sweden, marking a moment of solidarity against rising anti-Semitism and violence. Hundreds gathered at the Kristet Center in Örebro, Sweden, in a powerful display of support for the State of Israel and the Jewish people. The event featured a heartfelt address from the President of Israel, Isaac Herzog, who sent his message from Jerusalem. 'Today, we mark one year since the terrible force of hatred was unleashed against our people in our own land,' President Herzog said. 'One year since our women and our children, our people, were hunted down in their beds, burned to death, beheaded, raped, and shot. One year since hundreds of our people were dragged into captivity, dead or alive.' Herzog’s words brought a somber reality to the forefront – that these acts of terror were not just against Israel, but against humanity itself. Quoting the Book of Lamentations, he said, 'O wall of the daughter of Zion, let terror run down like a river, day and night. Give thyself no rest.' He emphasized that these were not only Israel's tears but also the tears of all who stand against hatred and injustice. In the face of continued anti-Semitism and hostility towards Israel, President Herzog praised the unwavering support of the Christian community in Sweden, declaring: 'When the arrows of hatred and anti-Semitism are still turned on Israel and the Jewish people, you do not rest either. When hostages are still being held in the dungeons of Gaza, you, friends, are not silent, not in your hearts and not in your deeds.' Pastor Per-Åke Eliasson, the Senior Pastor of Kristet Center Örebro, expressed his congregation’s deep commitment to standing with Israel. 'We refuse to be silent in the face of such evil,' he declared. 'Our support for Israel is rooted in love, in faith, and in the belief that we must stand up against hatred wherever it exists. This is not just Israel's fight – it is a fight for humanity, for decency, and for the right to live in peace.' 'We stand with Israel not just in times of celebration, but especially in times of suffering. Our voices will rise against injustice, and our prayers will strengthen those who fight for freedom and peace.' As the event drew to a close, President Herzog’s final words echoed through the hall: 'Let us continue to hold the faith in our hearts that love will overcome hatred, that our hostages will come back home soon and make us whole again, and that we will live to see prosperity and peace in our region.'

Netanyahu to Iranian people: ‘You deserve better’	Tehran's 'puppets are eliminated,' Netanyahu says in statement to Iranian people, calling for overthrow of 'Iran's tyrants.' By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a video statement Monday directed at the people of Iran, urging them to defy their government, warning that it is pushing Iran 'closer to the abyss,' adding that Tehran’s proxy war against Israel was a losing battle. 'I speak a lot about the leaders of Iran,' Netanyahu said. 'Yet at this pivotal moment, I want to address you – the people of Iran. I want to do so directly, without filters, without middlemen.' 'Every day, you see a regime that subjugates you, makes fiery speeches about defending Lebanon, defending Gaza. Yet every day, that regime plunges our region deeper into darkness and deeper into war.' Referencing the targeted killings of Hamas’ military commander in the Gaza Strip, Mohammed Deif, and Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Netanyahu boasted that the IDF was rapidly destroying the leadership of two of Iran’s largest proxy forces. 'Every day, their puppets are eliminated. Ask Mohammed Deif. Ask Nasrallah. There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach. There is nowhere we will not go to protect our people and protect our country.' 'With every passing moment, the regime is bringing you — the noble Persian people — closer to the abyss.' 'The vast majority of Iranians know their regime doesn't care a whit about them. If it did care, if it cared about you, it would stop wasting billions of dollars on futile wars across the Middle East. It would start improving your lives.' Offering a vision of globalized trade and investment, Netanyahu said that a post-Islamist Iran would 'finally be at peace' – including with Israel. 'When Iran is finally free and that moment will come a lot sooner than people think – everything will be different. Our two ancient peoples, the Jewish people and the Persian people, will finally be at peace. Our two countries, Israel and Iran, will be at peace.' 'Don't let a small group of fanatic theocrats crush your hopes and your dreams,' Netanyahu continued. 'I know you don’t support the rapists and murderers of Hamas and Hezbollah, but your leaders do. You deserve more. The people of Iran should know – Israel stands with you.'

How a handshake led to Hezbollah chief’s assassination	The IDF has managed to infiltrate Hezbollah by all intelligence means, which has led to the almost complete decapitation of the terrorist group. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel succeeded in assassinating Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah Friday because someone shook his hand in greeting, Saudi Arabian station Al Hadath reported Sunday. Quoting anonymous sources, the station said, 'A person met with Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, shook his hand, and then smeared his hand with a substance that allowed Israel to track him.' The only identifier posited for that person was that he was from Iran. Whether true or not, it points to the undeniable fact that Israel’s intelligence that led to this strategic blow to the country’s most immediate and formidable military foe has recently revealed itself to be extraordinary. According to a Sunday report in the Financial Times (FT), over the last 18 years, Israel has managed to thoroughly infiltrate Hezbollah by any and all means, both human and electronic. Citing former Israeli intelligence officials and Lebanese politicians, the paper said that the breakthrough came in 2012, when Hezbollah leaped to aid Syrian leader Bashar al Assad put down an internal rebellion. They started publicly revealing information on their men that used to be top secret, said Yezid Sayigh, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center, becoming 'complacen[t]' and 'flabby.' Israel took the free information and then expanded their files on the senior members by old-fashioned methods such as having them followed, and newer means, like hacking their phones and breaking into Lebanese surveillance cameras. Israeli officials told FT that the IDF figured out that whenever the terrorists’ practices strayed from their ordinary routines, that meant they were expecting to attack Israel. This is what occurred on Friday, when military intelligence learned that Nasrallah was on his way to his fortified bunker, buried 60 feet under a civilian apartment building in Beirut that he used as his human shield – and the order was given to blast it with 80 tons of bombs. Nasrallah’s assassination perhaps put an exclamation point on the fact that due to its intelligence successes, over the last several weeks, Israel has almost completely decapitated the terrorist organization, seriously damaging its entire command structure. Twenty other senior terrorists were killed along with the Hezbollah chief in his bunker, while dozens of the highest-ranking commanders of Hezbollah’s most important units and sectors along Israel’s border have been eliminated by precision IAF airstrikes. This is besides some 3,000 mid-level Hezbollah fighters being injured and over two dozen killed by their exploding pagers and walkie talkies in an attack for which Israel has not claimed formal responsibility. Through years of painstaking aerial surveillance and work on the ground, the IDF has also built up a huge pool of worthy Hezbollah targets to hit. This has been on display throughout the last 11 months of war, as the air force and artillery have responded to the nearly 10,000 aerial attacks Hezbollah has launched since the Israel-Hamas war began, by striking terrorist military targets across Lebanon that have resulted in about 500 more terrorist deaths.

IDF special forces already operating in Lebanon – report	Elite units are making short intelligence raids in preparation for a ground invasion, says The Wall Street Journal. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News IDF forces are already secretly in Lebanon, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. Elite units have been making short intelligence raids for weeks and even months, the paper said, in anticipation of acting on the necessity of permanently removing the Hezbollah terrorist organization from the border via a ground invasion. Their probes have included terror tunnels built by Hezbollah right up to Israel’s northern border, dug to enable its specialized Radwan force to invade the Galilee much as Hamas did on October 7, which sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. It is the fear of such a future invasion that has led some 60,000 residents of the north to say that they will refuse to return home until the threat is nullified. They have been internal refugees for nearly a year, with their lives in limbo ever since they were evacuated from their homes after Hezbollah immediately began launching thousands of rockets, missiles, and UAVs over the border to support Hamas. 'The IDF has made a lot of preparations for a ground incursion,' former senior military official Amir Avivi told the paper. 'Overall, this always includes special operations. This is part of the process.' It is still not certain when, and even if, the ground operation will commence, as the U.S. is putting heavy pressure on Israel not to enter full force. The Biden administration has been very forthright about its fear that this could lead to a regional war that included Iran, since Hezbollah is its most important terror proxy and Tehran has promised to help defend it from Israel. Various American government spokesmen have stated for weeks that the U.S. believes diplomacy can still work to de-escalate the volatile situation, even as Israel has ramped up its bombing of Hezbollah sites and senior personnel, including the assassination Friday of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. President Joe Biden said Sunday that he would soon be speaking to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu because 'we really have to avoid' what he called 'an all-out war' in the Middle East. 'We’re working like hell with the French and many others to avoid [more] war,' he told reporters. Most of Israel’s government and legislators, including from the Opposition, believe that now is the time to deal a very heavy, if not fatal blow to the terrorist group, up to and including holding onto a strip of Lebanese territory to ensure that Hezbollah cannot threaten the north as it as done for decades. The IDF has had immense success in recent weeks in decapitating Hezbollah’s military and political leadership, seriously damaging its communication network, and destroying thousands of missile launchers and tens of thousands of rockets. Last week alone, the air force hit over 2,000 targets in Lebanon, keeping up the relentless pressure. It came along with a clear threat to invade, as Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Herzi Halevi told some of the thousands of troops that Israel has brought northward in the last several days, who are now training for this scenario. 'We are preparing the process of a maneuver, which means your military boots, your maneuvering boots, will enter enemy territory,' he said.

‘Nasrallah assassination not the final step’ – Israel’s defense m...	If someone on the other side didn't understand what are capabilities entail, we mean all capabilities,' says Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. 'Eliminating Nasrallah was not the final step.' By World Israel News Staff Israel's Defense Minister hinted Monday at additional 'steps' against the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah, days after a massive airstrike on the organization's Beirut headquarters left its chief, Hassan Nasrallah, and nearly two dozen other operatives dead in the worst blow to the Iranian proxy in decades. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant (Likud) visited Israel’s northern border on Monday, where he met with troops serving in the IDF's Brigade 188 and the Golani Brigade. Minister Gallant was briefed by commanders on the ground regarding the readiness of troops for the possibility of expanding activities in the northern arena. The Defense Minister also spoke to battalion and company commanders, who discussed their activities in Gaza and their deployment to the northern front. During his visit, Gallant alluded to new strikes against Hezbollah calling Friday's airstrike killing Nasrallah a 'very important step,' adding that it is 'not the final one.' 'The elimination of Nasrallah is a very important step, but it is not the final one,' said Gallant. 'We will employ all the capabilities at our disposal, and if someone on the other side did not understand what those capabilities entail, we mean all capabilities, and you are part of this effort. We trust you to accomplish every mission at hand.' 'Our goal is to ensure the [safe] return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes. We are prepared to make every effort necessary to accomplish this mission. We will use all the means that may be required – your forces, other forces, from the air, from the sea, and on land.'

Israel selects one Chief Rabbi but remains deadlocked on second	Halevi and Bar, both vying to replace Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi David Lau, currently serve as the Chief Ashkenazi Rabbis of Petah Tikva and Netanya respectively. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel selected a Sephardi Chief Rabbis on Sunday night, ending a nearly three-month vacancy in the position, but failed to elect an Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi. The members of an assembly of 150 rabbinical figures, Knesset members, and local officials meeting in Jerusalem voted for Rabbi David Yosef, who teaches in Jerusalem, to succeed his brother, Rabbi David Yosef. Their faher, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, held the same position from 1973-1983. However, the assembly was unable to elect a Chief Ashkenazi Rabbi. From a field of five candidates, Rabbis Micha Halevi and Kalman Bar both secured 40 votes each, forcing a run-off vote. Halevi and Bar, both vying to replace Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi David Lau, currently serve as the Chief Ashkenazi Rabbis of Petah Tikva and Netanya respectively. It wasn’t immediately clear why the run-off could not be held immediately. No date was set for the second round of voting, but it is widely believed the run-off will take place about one week after Rosh HaShanah, the Jewish New Year. The holiday begins on Wednesday at sundown. The former Chief Rabbis stepped down from their positions on July 1 when their 10-year terms expired. It was the first time the positions were vacant. The Chief Rabbinate has jurisdiction over issues of personal status, such as marriage, divorce, conversions, as well as burials, kosher certification, holy sites, rabbinical courts, religious seminaries and ritual baths. The Chief Rabbis often represent Israel abroad. Religious affairs and issues of personal status such as marriage, divorce and conversion are determined by leaders of Israel’s recognized religious communities — Jewish, Muslim and Druze, as well as 10 Christian denominations. By law, elections for Chief Rabbis are supposed to be elected at least 21 days before the end of the previous rabbis’ term. A vote was originally supposed to be held in August 2023. But the Knesset postponed the vote, at the request of Religious Affairs Minister Michael Malkieli who argued that the timing would interfere with municipal elections scheduled for October 31. Critics accused Malkieli of trying to get individuals onto the assembly with more favorable views for certain candidates. But municipal elections were postponed to February when war with Hamas broke out. In August, the High Court of Justice ordered the assembly to meet by the end of September. Ten of the assembly’s 150 members were barred from voting because they were related to candidates, raising concerns for nepotism. Israel has two chief rabbis because Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews have distinct customs and interpretations of Jewish law. Ashkenazi Jews are primarily from Eastern and Central Europe while Sephardi Jews trace their roots to Spain, Portugal, North Africa, and the Middle East.

Air Haifa takes off—just not from the north, for now	The new Haifa-based airline will operate three fuel-efficient ATR 72-600 propeller planes to service the small Haifa runway. By Etgar Lefkovits, JNS It’s wheels up for Israel’s fourth airline. Air Haifa is scheduled to launch operations on Monday, though currently not out of its base in the northern Israeli port city due to the war against Hezbollah in Lebanon. The airline’s inauguration comes at a turbulent time for the Israeli aviation industry amid nearly a year of war, with many foreign carriers, including all three U.S. legacy airlines, still not flying to and from Tel Aviv, and many major European carriers who had resumed flights halting service anew this month due to the escalating security situation in the north. The new, low-cost airline, Israel’s first since the 1990s, will start service Monday morning with two daily domestic flights from Israel’s main airport near Tel Aviv to the southern Red Sea resort city of Eilat for 99 shekels ($27) each way until Oct. 11. Subject to the security situation, Air Haifa said it plans to begin operating the first flight from Haifa International Airport to Eilat after Yom Kippur on Oct. 13, and on Oct. 14 from Haifa to Cyprus. A one-way flight from Haifa to Eilat currently sells for 139 shekels, or about $38, while a ticket from Haifa to Larnaca is going for 239 shekels, or $65. The airline, which received final approval to fly this month and had its three airplanes and crew ready to go, decided not to delay its launch despite the flare-up in Lebanon making its planned flights out of Haifa temporarily impossible. Hezbollah has rained nearly 10,000 rockets on northern Israel since Oct. 8. 'When the war in Lebanon ends, servicing the north could be economically viable, but for now and in the short term there is no market for them,' Mark Feldman, Jerusalem director at Diesenhaus Tours, told JNS on Sunday. Last weekend, the European Commission and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) recommended airlines not fly to Israel and Lebanon through the end of October, prompting a new wave of airline cancellations ahead of the Jewish High holidays, in a move criticized as politically-motivated by Israeli aviation officials. Northern carrier The small Haifa airport, which is located at the eastern entrance to the city, was established by the British in 1934. It was the first international airport in Israel before the construction of Ben-Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv that same year. With a runway only 4,324 feet long, limiting plane size and range of destinations, the Haifa airport—even before the war began last year—has had very minimal service. The new Haifa-based airline will operate three fuel-efficient ATR 72-600 propeller planes to service the small Haifa runway. Air Haifa was founded last year by a team of entrepreneurial Israeli aviation professionals, led by the American-Israeli founder of cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks, Nir Zuk, together with former senior executives of the Jewish state’s flagship carrier, El Al Israel Airlines.

IDF intercepts explosive drone headed for offshore oil rig	Explosive drone launched likely launched by Hezbollah waws targeting Karish gas field, near Israel-Lebanon maritime border. By World Israel News Staff The IDF announced on Monday that it successfully intercepted an explosive drone off Israel’s territorial waters, which was likely en route to the Karish offshore gas rig. In a clip released by the military, an Israeli Navy missile boat is seen firing on the UAV, which was probably fired from Lebanon. Hezbollah has repeatedly threatened to target one of Israel’s most important sites for natural gas drilling, which is located in the Mediterranean Sea, near the maritime border with Lebanon. Following Israel’s retaliatory bombings of the Hudaydah Port in Yemen after numerous unprovoked attacks on Israel, the Houthis have pledged to target the Karish gas field. In July 2024, the Israeli Navy shot down a drone nearing the oil rig, though it was unclear if the UAV was explosive or being used for reconnaissance purposes. Throughout the ongoing war, various Iranian proxy groups - including Shia militias in Iraq and Syria, along with the Houthis - have attempted to attack Israel’s maritime assets. Several explosive drones have struck the Port of Eilat during the course of the conflict, most recently last week. The terror groups have also made multiple attempts to strike the ports of Haifa and Ashkelon. In July 2022, Hezbollah launched three attack drones at the Karish gas field, all of which were intercepted by the Israeli Navy. 'The message was delivered,' Hezbollah said at the time. In October 2022, the Israeli government led by then-Prime Minister Yair Lapid signed a contentious U.S.-brokered deal regarding the Karish gas field. The gas field had been claimed by both Lebanon and Israel, and the legal dispute over ownership meant that extracting gas from the resource was delayed. The deal, which some have argued Lapid did not have the legal authority to sign, saw profits from the field distributed between Israel and Lebanon.

Hamas commander in Lebanon killed in airstrike also worked for UN...	More than 100 survivors of Hamas’s October 7 attacks filed a $1 billion lawsuit against UNRWA in June, accusing the agency of 'aiding and abetting' the terror group. By Pesach Benson, TPS Hamas said on Monday that the commander of its forces in Lebanon, Fateh Sherif, was killed in an Israeli strike in the southern Lebanese city of Tyre. He was also an employee of the embattled United Nations Relief and Works Agency. Sherif was the principal of UNRWA’s Deir Yassin School in Tyre and also headed the UNRWA teacher’s union in Lebanon. UNRWA placed Sherif on administrative leave in March without publicly specifying why. Thousands of Palestinian students in Lebanese UNRWA schools went on strike and held sit-ins in protest. Israeli officials have yet to comment. UNRWA, which supports Palestinian refugees, has been under fire for months, with Israeli officials demanding the agency be stripped of its authority in Gaza and defunded amid revelations that members of the agency’s staff participated in Hamas’s October 7 attacks. The Israeli government is bypassing UNRWA in distributing humanitarian aid and advancing legislation to label the agency as a terror organization and remove its diplomatic immunity, tax-exempt status and other legal benefits. More than 100 survivors of Hamas’s October 7 attacks filed a $1 billion lawsuit against UNRWA in June, accusing the agency of 'aiding and abetting' the terror group. According to the suit, the lead plaintiff, 84-year-old Ditza Heiman of Kibbutz Nir Oz, was held captive for seven weeks in the home of a Palestinian man who said he was a UNRWA teacher at a boy’s school. Israel’s largest bank froze UNRWA’s account in February over suspicious financial transfers that the agency failed to adequately explain. That same month, Israeli forces discovered a Hamas complex located directly under the UNRWA’s Gaza City headquarters and connected directly to the agency’s electricity system. The facility included numerous computer servers belonging to the terror group. Palestinian refugees are the only refugee population with its own dedicated.UN agency. The rest of the world’s refugees fall under the mandate of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Israeli officials have called for UNRWA to be closed and for Palestinian refugees to be brought under the responsibility of the UNHCR. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Report: US working with Israel to prepare for major Iranian repri...	The Biden administration fears Iran poised for major retaliatory strike on Israel following killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, and is working to prepare defenses in the region. By World Israel News Staff The U.S. is gearing up for a possible Iranian strike on Israel, CNN reported Sunday night, in response to the assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah on Friday. Nasrallah, who headed Hezbollah for the past 32 years, was killed, along with 20 other Hezbollah terrorists, when a squadron of Israeli F-16I fighter jets struck Hezbollah’s underground headquarters in Beirut, dropping over 80 heavy bombs on the complex. Citing a U.S. official, CNN reported that the Biden White House fears that Iran could attempt a major strike on Israel in retaliation for the killing of Tehran’s senior ally – and a close friend of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The U.S. is working jointly with Israel to prepare for a possible attack, the official said, while declining to specify what kinds of threats are considered realistic, and what preparations are being made. Over the weekend, the Pentagon dispatched American troops to Cyprus to assist with the evacuation of American citizens from the region should a full-scale war erupt between Israel and Hezbollah – or Iran. The U.S.S. Wasp, carrying F-35 stealth fighters, and its amphibious ready group, is deployed in the Eastern Mediterranean, ready to respond should a wider conflict break out. In addition, the Navy has dispatched the U.S.S. Harry S. Truman, a Nimitz-class nuclear-powered super carrier, to bolster American assets in the area. Last week, the U.S. and France pushed a proposed 21-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, amid reports citing U.S. officials that such a truce was on the verge of going into effect following a breakthrough in talks. One official told CNN last Wednesday that approved a statement which said a ceasefire was in the offing. However, Israeli officials said there was an 'honest misunderstanding,' that Jerusalem had understood the French-American effort as the 'start of a process,' not the signaling an agreement was in the immediate future.

‘We can’t go back to pre-October 7th reality’ – Northerners	Residents of Kiryat Shmona wary about casualties from potential ground invasion, but urge decisive military victory over Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff IDF soldiers and residents of Israel's north are gearing up for a ground invasion of Lebanon, expressing that the move is critical for a decisive military victory over Hezbollah that would facilitate the return of the some 60,000 displaced and rehabilitation of the region. Kiryat Shmona, the northernmost city in Israel, was evacuated shortly after the October 7th Hamas massacres. Since then, the city has endured near-daily missile, rocket, and explosive drone attacks that have damaged hundreds of homes and businesses. Though Kiryat Shmona was officially evacuated, a small number of residents chose to remain. IDF Major A, who was identified only by his first initial, stayed in Kiryat Shmona to guard the city as part of his reserve duty. His family relocated to Gush Etzion, near Jerusalem. 'It's strange to drive along these roads, the way I used to take my kids to school and after-school activities, and see all these Shi'ite villages in the distance where they are shooting anti-tank misiles at us,' A told Ynet. 'We can't go back to the reality where we're constantly wondering if we're under threat' from Lebanese villages directly adjacent to the border, he added. Lilach Saadia, the manger of Nehamiah Mall who did not leave the city, told Ynet that arriving at the shopping center each morning 'is like a punch to the stomach all over again.' Saadia explained that all of the mall's business, save for the Super-Pharm drugstore, have been shuttered for nearly a year. 'Seeing the display windows with last year's Rosh HaShana specials' is a stark reminder that Kiryat Shmona has become a ghost town, she said. Unlike many other residents of the north, Saadia is wary of a potential ground invasion of Lebanon. 'If there's one thing I don't want, it's that,' she said. Her nephew, IDF soldier Liran Saadia, was killed as he participated in a ground incursion during the Second Lebanon War in 2006. 'Every time I hear calls for a ground invasion, I think about the price that comes with that.'

IDF turned down opportunity to kill Hamas chief – report	Israel's military reportedly had a clear shot at assassinating Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, but declined to take advantage of it, fearing it would lead to deaths of Israeli hostages used as human shields. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli military had a clear shot at eliminating the chief of Hamas forces in the Gaza Strip, but turned down the opportunity amid fears an assassination would risk the lives of Israeli hostages being used as human shields, a Hebrew-language report published Sunday claimed. On Sunday night, Israel's Channel 12 published an exclusive report claiming that the IDF had received intelligence which placed it in the position to carry out an operation to kill Yahya Sinwar, the 61-year-old commander of Hamas' Gaza forces and since August, chairman of the terror group's politburo. Sinwar, who went into hiding early on in the current war, is believed to be living in Hamas' massive underground terror tunnel network beneath the Gaza Strip, moving from one makeshift subterranean saferoom to another to avoid capture by the IDF. The terror chief is also reportedly keeping a number of Israeli captives in his immediate proximity at all times, using them as human shields to discourage the IDF from attempting to assassinate him. Last week, multiple Hebrew media outlets reported that the IDF’s Military Intelligence Directorate is unsure whether Sinwar is still alive, with some within the MID arguing that the Hamas leader died in an airstrike several months ago. While some within the Directorate have questioned this view, advocates say the lack Sinwar's months-long silence and indications messages written in his name were penned by others indicate he was likely killed. Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency has reportedly criticized this assessment, with the agency believing Sinwar to be still be alive and operating out of the Gaza Strip. Senior IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said last Monday that he had no clear information to confirm either that Sinwar was killed or is still alive. 'I cannot confirm, and cannot deny' said Hagari. 'I do not have information that he is dead.'

‘An extraordinary leader’ – Ex-MK mourns Nasrallah	Former Israeli MK offers tribute to slain Hezbollah chief on Facebook, calling him a 'champion for the oppressed.' By World Israel News Staff A former member of the Israeli parliament released a statement praising slain Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, calling the arch-terrorist 'a hero for the oppressed.' EX-MK Issam Makhoul, who served iFn the Knesset from 1999-2006 as part of the Arab-Jewish communist Hadash party, penned an ode to Nasrallah on Facebook after news of his killing. Referring to him by the Islamic honorific 'Sayyed,' Mahoul posted that Nasrallah was an 'extraordinary leader' and 'hero to the oppressed.' Makhoul said Nasrallah had been a champion for those 'struggling for national and social liberation.' Nasrallah's legacy will be superior to that of 'his assassins, the petty politicians and military men obsessed with war and war crimes,' Makhoul added. Since leaving politics, Makhoul has worked as an intermediary between communist groups in Israel and the Chinese Communist Party. In 2011, Mahoul's brother Ameer was convicted of spying on behalf of Hezbollah. He served nine years in prison and was released in 2019. When Hebrew-language news outlet Walla asked asked Makhoul for comment on an article about the post, the former politician stood by his words. The Facebook post 'was an analysis of the event, the person, its impact, its importance, its nature and the meaning of the' assassination, Makhoul told Walla. 'I don't think it's possible to disagree on&#8230;Nasrallah's credibility, which surpasses Netanyahu's credibility in the eyes of the Israelis themselves.' Lina Makhoul, a popular Arab-Israeli singer, also triggered backlash with her social media posts around Nasrallah's assassination. In recent years, Makhoul has leveraged her platform to promote pro-Hamas rhetoric, leading to her becoming increasingly isolated from the mainstream Israeli pop world. When Nasrallah's fate after the bombing was still unknown, Makhoul posted 'May Allah protect him' on her Instagram account. Despite being an Israeli citizen, Makhoul describes herself in her Instagram bio as being '100 percent Palestinian.'

Sa’ar to re-enter Israel’s Netanyahu-led government	Sa’ar’s entry into the coalition as minister-without-portfolio was unanimously approved by government ministers, By JNS New Hope Party leader Gideon Sa’ar will re-enter the Israeli government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the two announced in a joint press statement on Sunday night. 'When war broke out, I immediately set about establishing a broad and stable government. I greatly appreciated it when Benny Gantz and Gideon Sa’ar joined the government and I regretted it when they left,' Netanyahu said of the wartime coalition formed on Oct. 11, 2023, in the aftermath of Hamas’s massacre in southern Israel. 'For this reason, I appreciate it that Gideon Sa’ar acceded to my request and agreed to return to the government today,' the premier added. 'This move contributes to unity among us, and unity against our enemies.' Sa’ar, who will join as a member of the Security Cabinet, noted his up-and-down ties with the premier, marked by periods in which the two maintained 'a close and very good working relationship,' but also years of 'political and personal rift.' 'Believe me, beloved citizens of Israel, since the morning of Saturday, October 7, this is meaningless to me,' said Sa’ar in reference to the Hamas invasion. 'In light of the current situation, and after consideration, I concluded that there is no point in me continuing to sit in the opposition, where the positions of most of its members on the subject of the war are different and even far removed from mine,' said Sa’ar. Sa’ar’s entry into the coalition as minister-without-portfolio was unanimously approved by government ministers, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said following the official announcement. Once a member of Netanyahu’s Likud Party, Sa’ar launched New Hope in 2020, ahead of Israel’s fourth of five election rounds between 2019 and 2022. He then served as justice minister in the government led by Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett. In the November 2022 general election, the shared Gantz and Sa’ar slate received 432,482 votes, resulting in 12 Knesset seats. Until two weeks ago, Sa’ar appeared set to replace Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, whom Netanyahu reportedly wanted to fire due to their differences on how to prosecute the war against Hamas and Hezbollah. Sa’ar announced his decision to quit the previous unity government on March 25, two weeks after breaking up his political alliance with Gantz’s National Unity Party. At the time, Sa’ar blamed the government for what he described as a failure to accomplish its war goals and said the military campaign against Hamas had been managed 'contrary to the national interest.' When Gantz left the unity government, Netanyahu made clear that his door would 'remain open to any Zionist party willing to shoulder the burden and help attain victory over our enemies and ensure the safety of our citizens.'

Israeli opposition party leaders push for ground invasion of Leba...	Gantz: 'An army of terror will not be deployed on our borders and threaten our citizens.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Following the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on Friday, members of Israel's Opposition parties are encouraging a ground invasion of Lebanon to secure the border with Israel and to ensure the safe return of evacuees to their homes in the north. During a visit to kibbutz Kfar Giladi on the border with Lebanon, Democrats Party chairman Yair Golan said Israel should take control of the Lebanese village opposite so residents of the community 'would not be in the line of fire.' Golan said in an interview that evacuees will 'not be able to return to their homes if the terrorists are so close.' 'A ground invasion of Lebanon is necessary in order to ensure that there is no Hezbollah presence south of the Litani River,' Golan said. MK Avigdor Liberman, head of Yisrael Beytenu, said the Lebanese towns should be 'flattened' prior to an IDF invasion, and mines and tunnels should be neutralized. Regarding the civilians in these Lebanese communities, Liberman said there were 'no uninvolved people' and 'whoever remained there were Hezbollah members.' National Unity chairman MK Benny Gantz said that if diplomacy doesn't work and if a solid deal isn't possible, Israel's military should begin an invasion of Lebanon so that 'an army of terror will not be deployed on our borders and threaten our citizens.' Gantz added, 'The attack needs to be continuous, and the operation should be carried out speedily, continuously, and in a way that is lethal for Hezbollah.' Yesh Atid chairman MK Yair Lapid emphasized diplomacy, although he did not rule out a military solution. He said, 'In parallel to the operational activity, now is the right time to take a diplomatic step, when we have an advantage, when we are winning,' Lapid said. 'Our goal is a hostage deal in the South and a diplomatic agreement that will distance Hezbollah from the northern border,' he said. Lapid criticized the strategy in the Gaza war as a 'ground war without a diplomatic goal' and said Israel should 'get the Americans on board without quarreling with them.

Nasrallah died by suffocation – report	Gases released by the intensive bombing and poor ventilation might have combined to cause his death. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News According to a report by Channel 12 news, Hassan Nasrallah likely died of suffocation during an Israeli strike in Beirut on Friday. The notion that Nasrallah died from suffocation is deduced by the fact that his corpse was whole when it was exhumed rather than showing signs of fatal trauma from the airstrike. The report also speculated that the gases released by the intensive bombing and the poor ventilation in the underground area where Nasrallah was staying might have combined to cause his death. In addition to Hassan Nasrallah, 20 other Hezbollah terrorists were killed in the Israeli strike. Some of these terrorists included Ibrahim Hussein Jazini, the head of Nasrallah's Security Unit; Samir Tawfiq Dib, Nasrallah's long-time confidant and advisor on terrorist activities; Abed al-Amir Muhammad Sablini, Head of Hezbollah's Force-Build Up and Ali Naaf Ayoub - responsible for coordinating Hezbollah's firepower. Following the successful operation, the IDF released a statement: 'In a precise airstrike carried out by the Israeli Air Force, directed by the Intelligence Directorate, fighter jets struck and eliminated Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Hezbollah terrorist organization, and Ali Karaki, the Commander of Hezbollah's Southern Front, who was one of the remaining senior commanders in the organization before the strike.' A senior Hezbollah official, Nabil Qaouk, was killed in an IDF airstrike on Saturday in the Dahiyeh suburb of Beirut, the IDF announced on Sunday. Qaouk held a significant role within Hezbollah as the commander of its 'preventive security unit' and was a senior figure on the group's central council. The IDF spokesperson's division said that Qaouk was closely aligned with Hezbollah's leadership and had recently played a key role in planning attacks against Israel and its citizens. Also on Sunday, Hezbollah confirmed the death of Ali Karaki, the commander of the Southern Front, which oversees the group's military operations in southern Lebanon along the Israeli border. Karaki was killed, along with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, in a large-scale Israeli airstrike on Beirut on Friday. Karaki had survived an earlier Israeli assassination attempt earlier that week.

Former British Commander: ‘No Western military has achieved what ...	Kemp said the elimination of Hezbollah's command structure has 'undermined the capability to launch large-scale coordinated attacks.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Former Commander of the British forces in Afghanistan, Col. Richard Kemp, said no Western country's military has achieved 'anything even remotely close' to the progress Israel has made against Hezbollah in Lebanon the last two weeks. Speaking to Arutz Sheva following the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Kemp said, 'Israel's rapid attrition against Hezbollah in the last two weeks is unprecedented in any military campaign that I know of.' He continued,'Certainly, no other Western country has achieved anything even remotely close in any modern war.' He added, 'The damage done to Hezbollah's leadership by precision airstrikes as well as the pager attacks must be added to repeated strikes by the IDF since Hezbollah began its unprovoked war of aggression nearly a year ago.' 'Key leaders have been progressively eliminated throughout that time as well as the destruction of significant quantities of Hezbollah's weapons capability,' Kemp explained. Although Hezbollah may have a large number of missiles and drones as well as terrorists who are still fighting for Hezbollah and can be replaced, the extensive losses to Hezbollah's chain of command have caused irreparable damage to the terror organization' ability to function. Kemp explained, 'Any military or terrorist organization does depend heavily on a command structure, and the elimination of so much of that will have seriously undermined the capability to launch large-scale coordinated attacks.' Even though Nasrallah has been replaced by his cousin, Hashem Safieddine, who has extensive experience with the terror organization, Kemp said it would be hard to replace a leader like Nasrallah, who has headed Hezbollah for over three decades. In addition, given the losses to Hezbollah's command structure and the psychological blow dealt the terror organization by the beeper incident that wounded thousands, Hezbollah's ability to recruit new members may have been hampered. Kemp said, 'There is also a psychological element for those who might be thinking of stepping up. They were stunned by the pagers episode and are reeling daily from what is befalling their bosses. How many will want to step up to the plate against the fear that they will be next.'

Republican attorneys general back lawsuit charging Americans for ...	The suit seeks to hold the anti-Israel groups accountable under the Anti-Terrorism Act for allegedly 'providing material support to Hamas,' according to the AGs' brief. By Jessica Costescu, The Washington Free Beacon A group of Republican attorneys general has filed an amicus brief backing a lawsuit against American Muslims for Palestine and National Students for Justice in Palestine, the anti-Israel groups accused of providing material support to Hamas. The coalition of 22 attorneys general, led by Virginia's Jason Miyares and Iowa's Brenna Bird, filed the brief late last week, urging the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to 'decline to dismiss' a lawsuit brought on by survivors and family members of those killed by Hamas on Oct. 7. The defendants stand accused of serving as 'the propaganda and recruiting wing of a Foreign Terrorist Organization in the United States.' American Muslims for Palestine and National Students for Justice in Palestine have galvanized anti-Israel and anti-Semitic activists across the country in the wake of Oct. 7, calling for a 'Unity Intifada' against the Jewish state and vowing to 'contribute to the fight for Palestinian liberation.' The suit seeks to hold the anti-Israel groups accountable under the Anti-Terrorism Act for allegedly 'providing material support to Hamas,' according to the AGs' brief. 'Attorneys General, as their States' chief law enforcement officers, have a deep interest in holding terrorists and their supporters accountable,' says the brief. 'That accountability helps ensure that citizens of their States receive financial compensation from the individuals and organizations who supported the terrorists that engaged in the horrific attacks that harmed family members and loved ones—fully acknowledging that no amount of financial compensation can ever make up for the tragic losses these citizens have experienced.' Miyares and Bird told the Washington Free Beacon that organizations that abuse their 'nonprofit' status to promote terrorism must be held accountable. 'Sunlight is the best disinfectant and we are working to get to the truth. Groups such as AMP and NSJP are alleged to have abused their nonprofit status in order to promote Hamas' dangerous ideological campaign of hatred,' Miyares said. 'Their inconsistent financial reporting, particularly in Virginia, raises serious concerns about whether donations to these organizations are in fact being funneled to support activities far from their publicly stated mission.' 'It is not only despicable but illegal for any person or group to provide support to terrorists. I stand with the victims and families whose loved ones were murdered on October 7,' Bird added. 'They deserve the chance to take their fight against terrorism to court and to hold accountable any group that leverages its 'nonprofit' status to act as Hamas foot soldiers and promote terrorism.' In Virginia, where American Muslims for Palestine is based, Miyares opened a separate investigation in October probing allegations that the organization maintains fundraising ties to Hamas. Salah Sarsour, one of the group's board members, is alleged to have played a direct role in raising funds for a Hamas front group in the late 1990s, according to an FBI memorandum. A judge ordered the group in July to disclose its funding channels. Virginia and Iowa are joined by attorneys general from Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia. American Muslims for Palestine and National Students for Justice in Palestine did not respond to requests for comment.

Game-changing 3D-printed virus detector promises quicker diagnosi...	This technological advance promises to change how viruses are monitored and managed in healthcare settings, providing a rapid, accurate, and portable tool for health professionals. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli and German researchers unveiled a groundbreaking new method for detecting viruses and nanoparticles that offers faster, more accurate results at a fraction of the cost of traditional techniques. The method combines advanced microscopy techniques with a 3D-printed setup. Its portable nature means it can be deployed in hospitals, clinics, and even mobile units in remote or underserved areas, making virus detection accessible in places where advanced lab facilities might not be available. This innovative approach, led by Prof. Dr. Eitan Lerner of the Hebrew University, PhD candidate Mrs. Paz Drori, and colleagues from Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich and the Technical University of Dortmund, combines advanced microscopy techniques with a 3D-printed setup. Traditionally, virus detection relies heavily on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods, which, while highly accurate, can be time-consuming and require specialized lab equipment. In contrast, antigen-based tests, though quicker, tend to lack the precision and sensitivity needed to reliably detect small quantities of virus. The new method developed by Lerner’s team addresses these shortcomings by offering a faster, more cost-effective alternative capable of identifying single virus particles with great accuracy. The team’s approach merges confocal fluorescence microscopy with microfluidic laminar flow, an innovative technique allowing researchers to examine nanoparticles and viruses in real time. This combination of technologies is further enhanced by a 3D-printed microscopy device, known as Brick-MIC, which offers a portable and affordable solution for virus detection. Brick-MIC uses laminar flow within a microfluidic channel to direct the movement of viruses or nanoparticles, while fluorescent dyes and labeled antibodies help distinguish specific virus particles with unparalleled sensitivity. The development of this method also saw collaboration with Prof. Dr. Thorben Cordes’ group from Ludwig-Maximilians University and the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR). Together, the teams were able to test the technology on both fluorescent beads and real viruses, including those carrying the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. These trials demonstrated the system’s high level of accuracy and specificity in detecting clinically relevant virus concentrations. One of the critical innovations of this method is its hydrodynamic focusing capability, which significantly boosts sensitivity and allows for the detection of viruses at low concentrations—something crucial for clinical and diagnostic applications. This technological advance promises to change how viruses are monitored and managed in healthcare settings, providing a rapid, accurate, and portable tool for health professionals. During viral outbreaks or pandemics, the technology could be used for mass screening in airports, schools, or workplaces. It could also be integrated into public health infrastructure for continuous monitoring of viral outbreaks in real time, allowing for faster responses and better containment strategies. In addition, the ability to detect specific virus strains at a nanoparticle level would allow for more personalized healthcare interventions. For example, doctors could use this technology to better understand the virus type affecting an individual, allowing for more precise and effective treatments, such as antiviral drugs or vaccines suited to the specific pathogen. Patients with chronic conditions or weakened immune systems could benefit from regular health monitoring using this rapid detection system, enabling early intervention before infections worsen. The system could be used to regularly screen for viruses in high-risk environments like hospitals, especially in ICU wards, to prevent hospital-acquired infections. It would help in quickly identifying viral threats and isolating infected patients to protect vulnerable populations. Routine use of the technology could also ensure that healthcare workers are not unknowingly carrying viruses. Studies on this new approach to detecting viruses were recently published in the peer-reviewed iScience and Science Advances journals.

Israeli fighter jets strike Houthi terror assets in Yemen	The purpose of the attack is to exact a heavy price for the attacks by the Houthis. If they continue to attack Israel, the attacks will increase,' an Israeli official said. By JNS Israeli Air Force fighter jets carried out dozens of airstrikes on Houthi terrorist targets in Yemen’s port city of Hodeidah on Sunday afternoon, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed in a statement. 'In a large-scale operation, dozens of Air Force aircraft, including fighter jets, refueling and intelligence planes, under the direction of the Military Intelligence Directorate, attacked military targets of the Houthi terrorist regime in the areas of Ras Issa and Hodeidah in Yemen,' the IDF said. 'The IDF attacked power plants and a seaport, which are used to import oil,' according to the military statement. 'The attack was carried out in response to the latest attacks carried out by the Houthi regime against the State of Israel,' it added. 'The Houthi terrorist regime has been operating under the direction and funding of Iran and in cooperation with Iraqi militias, in order to harm the State of Israel, undermine regional order, and disrupt freedom of navigation.' #BREAKING: Reports that #Israel conducted another strike on the Port of Hodeidah in #Yemen which is used by #IRGCterrorists and the #Houthis for weapons smuggling.

'The purpose of the attack is to exact a heavy price for the attacks by the Houthis. If they continue to attack Israel, the attacks will increase,' an Israeli official told the country’s Ynet outlet. 'The message to Iran is that Israel can attack with tremendous power even at a distance of 2,000 kilometers [≈1,200 miles]. It can do it simultaneously in several arenas. 'Today, we attacked in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen,' the official said. The leader of the Houthis, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, on Saturday night claimed that a surface-to-surface missile it had launched at central Israel hours earlier was timed to coincide with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s return to the Jewish state from the United States. The IDF announced that the military’s aerial defense array had downed the Houthi terrorist missile 'outside of the country’s borders.' In a televised speech, the Houthi leader also vowed that the targeted killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut on Friday would 'not be in vain.' Yemen’s Houthi militia, an Iranian proxy force, have launched multiple attacks on the Jewish state in support of Hamas in the wake of the Gaza terror group’s Oct. 7 invasion of southern Israel. Israel’s 'Arrow' defense system intercepted a surface-to-surface ballistic missile fired at the Jewish state from Yemen on Friday, according to the Israel Defense Forces. On Sept. 15, Israeli air defenses intercepted fragments of a surface-to-surface missile launched from Yemen that exploded over central Israel. In July, a Houthi suicide drone killed an Israeli civilian in central Tel Aviv, in response to which Israel struck Hodeidah port in a major attack.

Top Hezbollah commander killed in latest IDF airstrike, 20 others...	Sheik Nabil Qaouk, commander of Hezbollah's security unit, killed in additional round of IDF airstrikes on Hezbollah positions in Beirut. By World Israel News Staff A senior Hezbollah official, Nabil Qaouk, was killed in an IDF airstrike on Saturday in the Dahiyeh suburb of Beirut, the IDF announced on Sunday The strike is part of Israel’s ongoing military offensive against the Iranian-backed Hezbollah terror group. Qaouk held a significant role within Hezbollah as the commander of its 'preventive security unit' and was a senior figure on the group’s central council. The IDF spokesperson’s division said that Qaouk was closely aligned with Hezbollah’s leadership and had recently played a key role in planning attacks against Israel and its citizens. Qaouk's involvement with Hezbollah dates back to the 1980s. The 60-year-old cleric and Hezbollah commander had previously served as the deputy head and later the chief of the southern Lebanon region on Hezbollah’s executive council, along with holding the position of deputy head of the same council. Also on Sunday, Hezbollah confirmed the death of Ali Karaki, the commander of the Southern Front, which oversees the group’s military operations in southern Lebanon along the Israeli border. Karaki was killed, along with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, in a large-scale Israeli airstrike on Beirut on Friday. Karaki had survived an earlier Israeli assassination attempt earlier that week. Both Nasrallah and Karaki were killed Friday when a squadron of Israeli F-16I fighter jets dropped over 80 bombs, including heavy bunker busters, onto Hezbollah headquarters in Beirut, demolishing the complex’s subterranean fortifications. More than 20 other terrorists were killed in Friday's strike, the IDF said, identifying a number of prominent Hezbollah operatives eliminated in the attack, including Nasrallah confidants Ibrahim Hussein Jazini and Samir Tawfiq Dib, as well as other senior Hezbollah officials including Abed al-Amir Muhammad Sablini and Ali Naaf Ayoub. Meanwhile, the IDF reported that Israeli fighter jets conducted airstrikes late Saturday night and early Sunday morning on multiple Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, including rocket launchers aimed at Israel and buildings used to store weapons. Hezbollah terrorists operating out of southern Lebanon launched a barrage of rockets on northern Israel Sunday morning, targeting the Galilee, including the city of Tiberias.

Biden’s defense secretary outraged after Israel gave minimal noti...	Secretary of State Lloyd Austin reportedly fuming after Israel only informed US of impending airstrike against Hezbollah headquarters after the jets were already airborne. By World Israel News Staff U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was outraged with his Israeli counterpart over the weekend, according to a report by The Jerusalem Post, after Israel gave the Biden administration only minimal prior notice before the airstrike that killed Hezbollah chairman Hassan Nasrallah Friday. A squadron of Israeli F-16I fighter jets pounded Hezbollah headquarters in Beirut on Friday, dropping over 80 bombs, including heavy bunker busters, on the complex's fortified subterranean saferooms. While Israel did inform the U.S. prior to the strike itself, the notice was reportedly given only minutes before the bombings began and after the fighter planes were already airborne and en route to their target. While Israeli Defense Minister Gallant has since October 7th consistently kept Austin updated on major military actions, recently, Israel has at times declined to inform the Biden administration of impending actions, including a string of pager and radio bombings earlier this month targeting thousands of Hezbollah operatives. According to senior American officials, the Biden administration had no foreknowledge of the attacks. Nevertheless, Gallant and Austin have met more frequently than some of their predecessors due to the continuous crises brought on by the war, and they have maintained an exceptionally high level of communication, speaking by phone over 125 times, sometimes multiple times a day. Despite the strong rapport that has developed between them, Austin was reportedly incensed by the last-minute notice of the Nasrallah operation. The core issue for Austin and the Biden administration throughout the conflict has been preventing a wider regional war, particularly one involving Hezbollah. Washington has repeatedly urged Israel to exercise restraint to avoid escalating tensions into a larger confrontation. In this instance, it appears Israel intentionally delayed informing the U.S. to avoid diplomatic pushback that might have pressured them to reconsider the operation. The decision to proceed without early coordination, especially given the expected U.S. opposition to such a high-risk move, further fueled Austin's personal frustration with Gallant, even though he generally views Gallant as one of the more pragmatic and reliable figures in Netanyahu's government, known for respecting U.S. counsel more than others.

Top Turkish newspaper calls for annihilation of Israel	Newspaper aligned with ruling Turkish party runs front page article advocating for the destruction of Israel, after President Erdogan called Israeli premier 'Hitler' from the podium of the UN. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A Turkish paper considered close to the regime of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan plastered a headline across its front page Sunday that said 'The world will not be safe until Israel is destroyed.' The article in Yeni Safak came as a direct response to the IDF assassination Friday night of Hezbollah terrorist leader Hassan Nasrallah in his bunker in Beirut. The paper claimed that 'images of the moment and aftermath of the attack revealed that Israel does not care about any moral code' accusing it of committing a 'massacre' as 'dozens of civilians' allegedly lost their lives in the airstrike. Israel has not commented on any civilian casualties who might have been caught in the bombing. The Jewish state had warned Lebanese citizens days ago to leave areas where Hezbollah terrorists were located, for their own safety. The IDF did say that several other terrorists were caught in the airstrike, which reportedly used some 80 one-ton bombs, including a few senior members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, Hezbollah’s chief backer and paymaster. The paper went on to list many of the senior Hezbollah, Hamas and Iranian military commanders that the IDF has recently eliminated, castigating the world for remaining silent over 'all these acts of terror.' It did not mention that the reason for Israel’s actions was the Hamas’ invasion of Israel and massacre of 1,200 people on October 7 that sparked the ongoing war in Gaza, and that Hezbollah has rained some 10,000 missiles, rockets and UAVs on the Jewish state since October 8 to support Hamas, acting as if Israel had decided out of the blue to attack its neighbors. Yeni Safak’s unfounded charges against Israel also included that it was committing 'genocide in Gaza,' that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now intends to 'start a major regional war,' and that Nasrallah had been assassinated 'under the name of the ‘New Order,’ with the 'goal of [re]designing the region.' The phrase 'New Order' cannot help but remind the world of Adolf Hitler’s use of the slogan for Nazi Germany. Turkish President Recep Erdogan often called Netanyahu 'Hitler,' even before the Israel-Hamas war began, but revved up his use of the epithet in recent months as his government’s strident pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel rhetoric has increased over the course of the war. On Wednesday, during his speech to the UN at the opening of the General Assembly, he again made the odious comparison when claiming that Israel was committing 'massacres' in Gaza. 'Just as Hitler was stopped by an alliance of humanity seventy years ago, Netanyahu and his murder network must be stopped by an alliance of humanity,' he said. The media in Turkey is almost completely under the thumb of the government. Turkey is among the world’s worst offenders in imprisoning journalists who don’t toe its political line, according to Reporters Without Border, with nearly 50 detained over the course of 2023.

Houthi terrorists launch ballistic missile at Israeli airport dur...	Pro-Iranian Yemenite terrorists claim ballistic missile attack on central Israel targeted Prime Minister Netanyahu's plane as it arrived at Ben Gurion Airport. By World Israel News Staff Iranian-backed Houthi rebels operating out of Yemen launched a ballistic missile towards Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plane as he returned to Israel from New York, a spokesman for the terrorist group claimed Saturday. A surface-to-surface ballistic missile launch from Yemen towards Israel was detected Saturday, the Israeli military announced. The missile was intercepted and destroyed before it reached Israeli airspace, an IDF spokesperson said, though a piece of the projectile landed on a road outside of Jerusalem, near the town of Tzur Hadassah, causing minor damage. The attack came just 35 minutes after the prime minister's state aircraft, a Boeing 767 dubbed the 'Wing of Zion', touched down at Ben Gurion International Airport. Shortly after the attack, Ameen Hayyan, a spokesman for the Houthi rebels, issued a statement saying that missile attack had directly targeted Netanyahu. 'The missile force in the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out an operation targeting what is [sic] Israeli called 'Ben Gurion,' Jaffa Airport, during the arrival of the criminal Benjamin Netanyahu,' Hayyan wrote. 'The operation was carried out with a Palestine 2 ballistic missile. The Yemeni Armed Forces, alongside all of the honorable and free people of the nation, continue to respond to the crimes of the Israeli enemy and will not hesitate to upraise the level of escalation in response to the requirements of the ongoing stage and to participate in defending Gaza and Lebanon.' 'These operations will not stop until the aggression on Gaza and Lebanon stops.' Like Hezbollah and Hamas, the Houthis are armed and supported financially by Tehran. Saturday's attack marks the third time in September that Houthi forces have launched ballistic missiles towards central Israel.

Iran ‘checkmated’ by Nasrallah killing, split over potential resp...	Iran's Supreme Leader releases cautious statement standing by Hezbollah, but refuses to commit to rescuing the terror group. By World Israel News Staff Iran’s senior leadership is currently roiled by internal debate on the country’s response to the assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. Over the past three decades, Tehran is believed to have invested billions of dollars in training and arming Hezbollah, making it the largest Iranian proxy group threatening Israel in the region. The Israeli Air Force airstrikes that killed Nasrallah last Friday night come days after beeper explosions - widely attributed to Israel - and intensive bombing campaigns throughout Lebanon seriously crippled Hezbollah’s military capabilities. According to a New York Times report, Iranian officials’ opinions are split as to how Tehran should proceed, following Nasrallah’s slaying. If Iran was to directly attack Israel, that would grant the Jewish State casus belli to strike sensitive sites inside of Iran, such as its nuclear development centers and oil fields. But failing to respond to Nasrallah's killing would make Iran appear weak in the eyes of its proxies and the Muslim world. Iran is 'completely checkmated by Israel at this moment,' Sanam Vakil, the director for Middle East at Chatham House, told the Times. Moderates, such as recently-elected President Masoud Pezeshkian, have signaled that they are in favor of a 'limited' response to the strike. Conversely, conservatives are urging Iran to assume a 'forceful' retaliatory posture. 'Israel has attacked the nucleus cell of the resistance and thus we cannot be indifferent,' said an influential cleric, Ayatollah Mohammad Hassan Akhtari. Ultimately, all decisions are made by Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei. 'All of the forces in the resistance stand by Hezbollah,' Khamenei said in a recent public statement. 'It will be Hezbollah, at the helm of the resistance forces, that will determine the fate of the region.' Those remarks are notable, as they could indicate that Iran is unwilling to intervene in order to save Hezbollah, as the terror group endures ongoing blows from Israel. 'Khamenei’s statement is indicative of the gravity of the moment and the caution,' Vakil said. 'He is not publicly committing to anything that he can’t deliver.' According to the Times report, Iranian dissidents and others who have suffered at the hands of the Islamic Regime quietly celebrated Nasrallah's killing. In some cities, sweets were distributed in celebration of the Hezbollah chief's assassination.

‘Genocide Lover’ – Anti-Israel vandals trash NY congressman’s off...	The epithets accused Rep. Adriano Espaillat of being a 'genocide lover' and had a Hamas’ inverted 'targeting' triangle painted on the window. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A New York congressman’s office was covered in anti-Israel graffiti Thursday night, with police immediately opening an investigation to find the culprits. Democrat Adriano Espaillat, who represents the heavily-Jewish neighborhood of Washington Heights in the northern part of the New York City, is a strong Israel supporter. He has had the posters of many hostages hanging prominently in his office-front window for many months. Small groups of Hamas supporters have regularly picketed the place. According to surveillance videos the police examined, the crime was committed around 11 pm. The words 'Terrorist,' 'F*** Israel,' 'genocide lover' and '40K dead' were spraypainted in red across the window and glass door, along with an inverted triangle that Hamas has used in its propaganda to denote that it is targeting the building or person it pictures. Down the same street and a nearby subway entrance, the vandals had also sprayed the red triangle, 'Free Gaza,' 'F*** Israel NYPD Cop City,' and 'A terrorist in uniform is still a terrorist.' The protective metal shutter that usually covers the entrance to Espaillat’s district office had been vandalized in November as well, soon after the posters had been hung. The graffiti there had read in black paint, 'Espaillat is complicit in genocide,' 'No more aid to Israel!' and 'Free Palestine!' The vandalism was committed just hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had addressed the opening of the General Assembly of the UN and defended Israel’s right to destroy both the Hamas and Hezbollah terrorist groups that have been attacking the Jewish state since October 7, 2023. A group of anti-Israel organizations had held a joint protest before his speech near the United Nations building, carrying signs with such slogans as 'End the War Now,' and an effigy of the prime minister with handcuffed, 'bloody' red hands. Espaillat is not the only New York congressman to be targeted in this way. Also in November, Brooklyn Rep. Dan Goldman’s office was defaced with slogans such as 'Blood on ur [sic] hands' and 'Let Gaza live.' On Christmas, employees in the South Bronx office of outspoken Israel defender Rep. Ritchie Torres found a doll outside the door covered with red paint that was called 'a Palestinian child messiah.' Torres immediately called it out on X as an attempt by anti-Israel extremists to scare him off, but said, 'I, for one, will not be intimidated.' That same week, GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of Hudson Valley had such epithets as 'Child murderer' written on signs stuck to his office window, as well as calls for a ceasefire in Gaza. He pushed back on X, posting, 'I will not be intimidated & I will not waver from supporting our greatest ally as they fight to stop Hamas’ terror once & for all & rescue their people.'

The funeral of the great martyr will be a day of work stoppage in all public administrations, municipalities, and public and private institutions,' according to a government statement. By JNS The Lebanese government has declared a three-day mourning period for Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, CNN Arabic reported on Saturday. Nasrallah was killed in an Israel Defense Forces strike on Hezbollah’s headquarters in Beirut on Friday evening. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati announced that the government would observe an official mourning period from Monday through Wednesday, which would include the lowering of flags to half-mast. 'The funeral of the great martyr will be a day of work stoppage in all public administrations, municipalities, and public and private institutions,' according to a government statement. At the start of Saturday’s government meeting, Mikati called on lawmakers to 'observe a moment of silence.' He said that his government 'is doing everything in its power to confront this destructive, hateful war waged by Israel.' 'The law of the jungle that rules the world has made the Israeli enemy thwart all ceasefire efforts and continue its war against Lebanon,' Mikati said.

‘Father figure’: Mainstream media eulogize Hezbollah butcher Nasr...	Many in the Middle East had a different reaction. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon Following Hassan Nasrallah's death at the hands of an Israeli airstrike, mainstream media outlets portrayed the now-former Hezbollah leader as an erudite 'father figure,' a 'moral compass,' a 'savior,' and a 'roly-poly figure' who 'empowered' Lebanon's 'downtrodden.' The vast majority failed to mention that he was a brutal terrorist leader who killed scores of Americans, Israelis, and innocent civilians across the Middle East. Nasrallah rose to the top of the terror organization in February 1992. A month later, Hezbollah operatives killed 29 people in a suicide bombing attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires. The terror group's subsequent 1994 attack on the AMIA Jewish community center in Buenos Aires killed 85. The aftermath of the 1994 Jewish center bombing in Buenos Aires. (Ali Burafi/Agence France-Presse—Getty Images) In 1983, one year after Nasrallah helped found Hezbollah, the terror organization murdered 32 Lebanese, 17 Americans, and 14 visitors in its bombing of the U.S. embassy in Beirut. The attack's planners became commanders under Nasrallah, who died a rich man, carrying a net worth of $250 million thanks mostly to illicit drug smuggling. The aftermath of the U.S. embassy bombing in Beirut. (State Department) Most of those details were left out of lengthy obituaries published in the Washington Post, New York Times, and Associated Press. The Post lauded Nasrallah's 'folksy yet articulate manner' and described the terrorist as a 'savior' among his followers. The Times billed Nasrallah as a 'charismatic religious and political leader and military strategist who had dedicated his life to ‘resistance,’ or the fight against Israel.' The AP lamented the Jewish state's dangerous 'escalation' in killing Nasrallah and called him a 'charismatic and shrewd strategist.' The Washington Free Beacon compiled a roundup of passages from the three obituaries: Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah leader and force in Middle East, is killed (Washington Post) 'Hasan Nasrallah, a Shiite cleric who oversaw the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah for decades and became one of the most powerful and divisive leaders in the Middle East, revered by his followers as a savior and condemned by his foes as a terrorist, died Sept. 27 in Beirut.' 'Among his followers, Mr. Nasrallah was seen as a father figure, a moral compass and a political guide. He was lauded as the man who empowered Lebanon’s once downtrodden and impoverished Shiite community and protected it from Israeli incursions by turning Hezbollah into a formidable deterrent force.' 'Wearing the black turban that signifies descent from the prophet Muhammad, he delivered advice on topics ranging from complicated regional events to personal hygiene during the covid pandemic, sometimes speaking for hours without notes, always in the folksy yet articulate manner that established him as a skilled orator.' 'The death of his 18-year-old son, Hadi, in a battle with Israel in 1997 burnished Mr. Nasrallah’s leadership credentials, establishing him as a man who had shared in the suffering of those battling the Israeli occupation.' 'He and his wife, Fatima Yassin, are believed to have had four other children. A list of survivors was not immediately available.' Hassan Nasrallah, Who Led Hezbollah for Decades, Killed at 64 (New York Times) 'In Lebanon, Mr. Nasrallah enjoyed tremendous devotion from Hezbollah’s Shiite Muslim base, who saw in him a charismatic religious and political leader and military strategist who had dedicated his life to 'resistance,' or the fight against Israel and American influence in the Middle East.' 'He came across as less dour than most Shiite clerics, partly because of his roly-poly figure, a slight lisp and a propensity to crack jokes. He never pushed hard-line Islamic rules, like veils for women in the neighborhoods that Hezbollah controls.' 'He could be by turns avuncular and menacing.' 'In his broadcasts, Mr. Nasrallah always appeared tranquil, assured, sincere and well informed, in command of both the facts and the situation, utterly dedicated to his cause and to his men. He was aloof yet tried to lend his secretive, heavily armed organization an air of transparency by sharing battlefield details.' (This passage, which can be viewed here, appears to have been removed.) 'He was known to have read the autobiographies of Israel’s prime ministers. He had long called for the liberation of Jerusalem and referred to Israel as 'the Zionist entity,' maintaining that all Jewish immigrants should return to their countries of origin and that there should be one Palestine with equality for Muslims, Jews and Christians.' Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah transformed the militant group into a potent regional force (Associated Press) 'Seen by his supporters as a charismatic and shrewd strategist, Nasrallah had reshaped Hezbollah into an archenemy of Israel, cementing alliances with the ayatollahs in Tehran and Palestinian militant groups such as Hamas.' 'A fiery orator viewed as an extremist in the U.S. and much of the West, as well as in some oil-rich Gulf Arab countries, he was also considered a pragmatist compared with the firebrand militants who dominated Hezbollah after its founding in 1982, during Lebanon’s civil war.' 'Idolized by his Lebanese Shiite followers and respected by millions of others across the Arab and Islamic world, Nasrallah held the title of sayyid, an honorific meant to signify the Shiite cleric’s lineage dating back to the Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam.' 'Wearing spectacles and sporting a bushy gray beard like many religious Shiite men, Nasrallah’s image was far from that of a militant who commanded thousands of heavily armed, well-trained and battle-hardened followers.' 'He often paused in his speeches to make jokes or break into local dialect and once, responding to a reporter asking about his monthly salary during a television interview, Nasrallah said it was about $1,300.' Some Democratic officials expressed their dismay at the Israeli strike that killed Nasrallah. Anti-Semitic Rep. Rashida Tlaib (R., Mich) condemned the attack as a 'bloodbath,' saying 'the U.S. government are conspirators to the war criminal Netanyahu's genocidal plan.' Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called for a 'diplomatic solution,' saying during a CNN interview that an 'all-out war between Lebanese Hezbollah and Israel would be devastating for both Lebanon and Israel. And again, we anticipate that we’d see a number of people displaced, casualties that, you know, equal or exceed what we’ve seen in Gaza.' Many in the Middle East had a different reaction. Syrians in the country's northwestern area, for example, were seen celebrating in the streets and handing out candy following early reports of Nasrallah's death. Nasrallah was crucial in defeating the Syrian revolution, backing the country's dictator, Bashar al Assad, as he massacred hundreds of thousands of civilians.

Israeli Navy intercepts drone over Red Sea	Since October, the Houthis have launched hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel. By Pesach Benson, TPS The Israeli Navy intercepted a drone fired toward Israel from the direction of the Red Sea, the Israel Defense Forces said on Sunday morning. Sirens sounded in the Red Sea resort city of Eilat and surrounding areas. The drone, presumably launched by Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, was shot down by an Israeli Navy Saar 4.5 missile corvette 'outside the country’s borders.' Following the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike on Friday, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, leader of the Yemeni terror group vowed to take revenge. 'We will move towards escalation and developing our military performance,' al-Houthi said in televised remarks. Since October, the Houthis have launched hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel. The Houthis vowed in early December to target any Israel-bound ship in the Red Sea, regardless of its ownership. They have attacked or harassed numerous ships, hijacked the MV Galaxy Leader in November and are holding its crew of 25 hostage. From bases along the Yemeni coast, the Iran-backed Houthi rebels have threatened ships in the Red Sea as they traverse the Bab el-Mandeb Straits, a narrow maritime choke point between the Arabian Peninsula and Africa. The majority of the world’s oil passes through the strait from the Indian Ocean towards the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean Sea. Expectations of an Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon rose on Wednesday following comments by Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi and an announcement that the military was remobilizing two reservist brigades for the northern front. Immediately following a meeting of the Security Cabinet, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu departed for the US, where he is scheduled to address the opening session of the United General Assembly on Friday. Around 63,500 residents of northern Israel were forced to evacuate their homes when Hezbollah began launching rockets and drones in October. The terror group has launched more than 9,300 rockets and drones, killing 49 people on the Israeli side. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they will continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. Israeli officials have been calling for Hezbollah to be disarmed and removed from southern Lebanon in compliance with UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War.

‘I don’t care about Palestinian issue,’ says Saudi crown prince	Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, says he does not care about Palestinian statehood - but explains why Riyadh continues to insist on two-state solution regardless. By World Israel News Staff The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia has little interest personally in Palestinian statehood and would not link normalization of relations with Israel to the two-state, were it not for his concerns over how his nation's citizens relate to the issue, the prince admitted in a candid conversation with The Atlantic. Speaking with the magazine in an interview published last week, Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, heir apparent to the throne and prime minister who has served for years as de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom, shared his views on Palestinian statehood and its relation to attempts to normalize ties with the Jewish state. Prior to the Hamas invasion of southwestern Israel on October 7th of last year, Riyadh was engaged in talks with Washington for a comprehensive deal which would include increased American aid and support for a Saudi nuclear program, along with normalization of ties with Israel. Saudi Arabia has gradually softened its position vis-a-vis Israel, fueling speculation of formal recognition following the 2020 Abraham Accords, which established ties between Israel and several moderate Arab states. The Biden administration and Riyadh appeared on the verge of a breakthrough that would enable Israel and Saudi Arabia to establish formal relations for the first time in history, with Netanyahu reportedly vowing to the U.S. he would modify his governing coalition to ensure him backing for such a deal. Throughout the talks, the Saudis insisted that Palestinian statehood would be a necessary part of an deal with Israel - a condition that directly contradicted Netanyahu's stated policies and the position of his coalition allies. The Hamas invasion, however, and subsequent war in Gaza and burgeoning conflict between Israel and Hezbollah took a Saudi-Israel normalization deal off the table, with Riyadh issuing several sharp criticisms of Jerusalem over its handling of the war. Yet privately, bin Salman has expressed continued interest in normalizing ties with Israel, albeit after the current war in Gaza has ended. According to The Atlantic, when asked by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken what were the prerequisites for resuming efforts towards a normalization deal, bin Salman said that the war in Gaza must come to a conclusion and Israel leave Gaza. Bin Salman said he understood Israel might need to reenter the coastal enclave for security purposes at a later date, but said it could not occur close to any public moves towards normalization. 'They can come back in six months, a year, but not on the back end of my signing something like this,' bin Salman was quoted as saying. The Crown Prince emphasized that while he personally is uninterested in the Palestinian question, he is concerned by how the Israel-Palestinian conflict could enflame public opinion in his country, particularly should Riyadh commit to normalizing ties with Israel. 'Seventy percent of my population is younger than me,' bin Salman was quoted as saying. 'For most of them, they never really knew much about the Palestinian issue. And so they’re being introduced to it for the first time through this conflict. It’s a huge problem. Do I care personally about the Palestinian issue? I don’t, but my people do, so I need to make sure this is meaningful.' The Atlantic noted that a Saudi official later claimed that the report's description of bin Salman's comments was 'incorrect.'

Israel to launch ‘very limited ground invasion’ of Lebanon – repo...	Israeli troops on border say they're ready for ground incursion, want to fight to ensure Hezbollah is crushingly defeated. By World Israel News Staff A senior U.S. official said that Israel is preparing for a 'very limited ground invasion of Lebanon,' following the IDF calling up multiple reserve units and stationing thousands of troops on the northern border. According to an ABC News report, Jerusalem will soon order troops to enter southern Lebanon, in order to ensure that the region is free of Hezbollah terrorists and facilitate the return of displaced residents of northern Israel to their homes. A separate, later report from ABC indicated that the IDF may have already begun, or is about to begin, 'cross-border movements' on Sunday morning. Tropps would focus on targeting Hezbollah outposts directly adjacent to the Israel-Lebanon border, clearing the area of terrorists who aim anti-tank missiles and other short-range weaponry at communities and military assets in northern Israel. 20-year-old soldier Lior Papismadov told The Washington Post that Israeli troops 'are prepared for' a ground incursion, adding that 'we don’t know if it’s going to happen, but we are preparing.' 'Mobilization opens an option,' Assaf Orion, a former IDF head of strategic planning, told the Post. 'That allows whoever needs to decide, to take the action — and also sends a signal to the other side that this might be coming.' Orion said that an incursion would likely start off with intensive bombing of the region, in order to decrease the likelihood that troops on the ground will encounter terrorists. Then, he said, 'you will see the fence opening and forces moving [in.]' Nati Aroush, a reserve soldier mobilized to northern Israel, told the Post that he is ready to fight 'as long as needed.' Aroush stressed that the soldiers were willing to sacrifice in order to ensure that Hezbollah is decisively defeated. 'We want that it will be finished,' he said. 'That there will be quiet. That they won’t have an option to strike back.'

Kushner: US must tell Israel to ‘finish the job’ with Hezbollah	Donald Trump's son-in-law and long-time confidant Jared Kushner lauds Israel's assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, says US must encourage IDF to use the opportunity to strike mortal blow to Hezbollah. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Former President Donald Trump's son-in-law and long-time advisor Jared Kushner praised Israel's recent offensive against the Iranian-backed Lebanese terror group Hezbollah, and called on the Biden administration to encourage Israel to 'finish the job' vis-a-vis the Iranian proxy. In a pair of tweets late Saturday night, Kushner, who served as senior advisor to the president during the Trump administration and was one of the architects of the 2020 Abraham Accords, wrote that the rapid series of blows delivered by the IDF and Mossad against Hezbollah's leadership had created a rare opportunity to cripple the organization. 'Moments like this come once in a generation, if they even come at all,' Kushner tweeted. 'The Middle East is too often a solid where little changes. Today, it is a liquid and the ability to reshape is unlimited. Do not squander this moment.' The 43-year-old businessman hailed Friday's assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah as 'the most important day in the Middle East' since the Abraham Accords normalized relations between Israel and moderate Arab states. 'There is not an expert on earth who thought that what Israel has done to decapitate and degrade them was possible,' Kushner continued. Not only have the attacks on Hezbollah's leadership - including the airstrikes killing much of the group's leadership and pager and radio bombings which killed or crippled thousands of officers and terror operatives - pushed the group to its nadir, Kushner argued, Hezbollah's decline has also deprived Iran of one of its key offensive assets. 'This is significant because Iran is now fully exposed. The reason why their nuclear facilities have not been destroyed, despite weak air defense systems, is because Hezbollah has been a loaded gun pointed at Israel. Iran spent the last forty years building this capability as its deterrent.' Calling the degradation of Hezbollah's capabilities a 'silver lining' to the fighting since last October, Kushner hailed Israel's 'brilliant, rapid-fire tactical successes' which have left the terror group's military assets 'unguarded and unmanned.' 'Iran is reeling, as well, insecure and unsure how deeply its own intelligence has been penetrated. Failing to take full advantage of this opportunity to neutralize the threat is irresponsible.' Kushner urged the Biden administration to encourage Israel to 'finish the job,' a tacit critic of the White House's recent efforts in conjunction with the Macron government to secure a ceasefire and avoid an Israeli ground operation into southern Lebanon. 'The right move now for America would be to tell Israel to finish the job. It’s long overdue. And it’s not only Israel’s fight.'

‘Volatile situation’ – US orders diplomats’ families to leave Leb...	US Embassy orders employees, families of staff to leave Lebanon; ambassador and critical embassy not yet evacuated. By World Israel News Staff The American embassy in Beirut has ordered the mandatory evacuation of the families of diplomats stationed in Lebanon, as well as instructed non-essential embassy workers to leave the country. Citing the 'volatile and unpredictable security situation' in Lebanon’s capital, the State Department urged all of its employees and their loved ones - except for critical embassy workers and diplomats - to flee from Lebanon, In a statement released Saturday, the State Department reiterated its call for U.S. citizens to 'depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available.' The order was made less than a day after the Israeli Air Force's Friday night strike on Hezbollah military headquarters in the Dahiyeh quarter of south Beirut. That strike, which involved the use of numerous bunker-busting bombs, killed Hezbollah Chief Hassan Nasrallah, along with other members of the terror group's senior leadership. The U.S.'s push to ensure that Americans leave the country indicates that Washington believes further deterioration in Lebanon's security is inevitable. While Iran, Hezbollah's patron, has so far shied away from becoming directly involved in the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel, Nasrallah's slaying may trigger a response from Tehran. Iran invested billions of dollars in funding, training, and arming Hezbollah, which served as their largest and most intimidating proxy group on Israel's borders. As Israel's military campaign against Hezbollah intensified, the terror group reportedly turned to its patron for help, asking Iran to strike Israel. Tehran reportedly refused that request, claiming that the timing for such an attack 'was not right.' A senior Iranian commander, Brig. Gen. Abbas Nilofouroshan, was also killed in Friday night's bombing. Nilofouroshan is one of the most senior Iranian military officials assassinated by Israel since the outbreak of the war last year.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A black-turbaned cleric and cousin of Hasan Nasrallah, who is head of the terror group's executive council, Hashem Safieddine, is most likely to become the next leader of Hezbollah after Nasrallah's killing on Friday. Hasan Nasrallah, who led the Lebanese terror group for 32 years, was killed in an underground area of a building in Beirut where the terror group was embedded. Safieddine, a maternal cousin of Nasrallah, is a cleric who wears a black turban, indicating direct descent from Mohammed. As head of the executive council, Safieddine is in charge of the political affairs of the terror group. He also has a seat on the Judicial Council which controls military operations. The US State Department designated Hashem Safieddine as a terrorist in 2017. He has strong ties with Iran and completed religious studies in Qom. Safieddine's son is married to the daughter of IRGC General Qasem Soleimani, who was killed in a 2020 airstrike in Iraq. At the funeral of a Hezbollah commander, Safieddine threatened Israel when he exclaimed, 'Let [the enemy] prepare himself to cry and wail.' He has expressed strong solidarity with the Palestinian cause and its struggle with Israel. At an event in Dahiyeh in Beirut, he said, 'Our history, guns, and rockets are with you.' In a speech in Beirut in July, Safieddine discussed Hezbollah's view of succession when he said, 'In our resistance&#8230; when any leader is martyred, another takes up the flag and goes on with new, certain, strong determination.' Phillip Smyth, an expert who studies Iran-backed Shiite terrorist organizations, said Nasrallah 'started tailoring positions for him within a variety of different councils within Lebanese Hezbollah. Some of them were more opaque than others. They've had him come, go out, and speak.' Safieddine had harsh words for the US, and in 2017, he said, 'This mentally impeded, crazy US administration headed by [Donald] Trump will not be able to harm the resistance.

The operation was complex because it required planning, precision and secrecy to prevent Hezbollah from discovering Israel's plans. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The strike on Friday that killed Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah required long-term planning and coordination of 'precise intelligence,' according to the IDF. The afternoon operation was carried out by fighter jets that targeted Hezbollah's 'central headquarters,' which were 'embedded under a residential building' in a suburb of Beirut. This area has long been a stronghold of the Lebanese terror group. Hasan Nasrallah assumed the leadership of Hezbollah 30 years ago. He was responsible, with the help of Iran, for the growth of the terror group to one of the largest non-state militaries in the region. . In a statement Saturday, Israeli Army Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said Nasrallah's killing proved that 'anyone who threatens the citizens of Israel — we will know how to reach them.' Brig.-Gen. Amichai Levine, the newly appointed commander of Hatzerim Airbase, said the mission to eliminate Nasrallah required the Israeli Air Force's unique, world-class capabilities. The operation was complex because it required planning, precision, and secrecy to prevent Hezbollah from discovering Israel's plans. 'The operation succeeded perfectly,' Levine said and credited the ground crews and technical teams for the smooth execution. The teams were responsible for ensuring the readiness of the aircraft and managing the munitions. He added, 'About a hundred munitions were used, with bombers dropping them every two seconds in perfect precision.' Levine credited the 69th Squadron, known as the 'Hammers,' which operates F-15I Ra’am fighter jets and has carried out a number of crucial operations in Lebanon and Syria. He added that for the last 11 months, the 69th Squadron's regular and reservist pilots have been on constant alert for missions across the Middle East. Levine said, 'We executed a historic operation of immense strategic importance. Nasrallah is seen as the most central figure in the Shi’ite axis.' He explained, 'This will significantly impact the Middle East and move us closer to achieving our war goals. The operation was long planned and reflects extraordinary collaboration with the Military Intelligence Directorate and the Air Force. I know all the intelligence officers who contribute incredible capabilities.'

Biden calls the Israeli strike killing Hezbollah’s Nasrallah a ‘m...	Biden also noted that Hezbollah under Nasrallah’s watch has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of Americans. By The Associated Press President Joe Biden on Saturday called the Israeli strike that killed Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah a 'measure of justice' for his four-decade reign of terror. The comments came after Lebanon’s Hezbollah group confirmed earlier Saturday that Nasrallah, one of the group’s founders, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the previous day. Biden noted that the operation to take out Nasrallah took place in the broader context of the conflict that began with Hamas’ massacre of Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023. 'Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a ‘northern front’ against Israel,' Biden said in a statement. He also noted that Hezbollah under Nasrallah’s watch has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of Americans. The White House sees the death of Nasrallah as a huge blow to the group. At the same time, the administration has sought to tread carefully as it has tried to contain Israel ‘s war with Hamas, which, like Hezbollah, is backed by Iran, from exploding into an all-out regional conflict. The White House and Pentagon were quick on Friday, shortly after the strike, to say publicly that Israel offered it no forewarning of the operation. The confirmation of Nasrallah’s death comes during a week that began with Biden’s top national security aides working on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly to build support for a 21-day Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire that they hoped might also breathe new life into stalled efforts to secure a truce in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a defiant speech Friday to the United Nations, vowing to keep up operations against Hezbollah until tens of thousands of Israeli citizens displaced by rocket attacks can return home. Shortly after, Israel carried out the strike killing Nasrallah. Biden reiterated on Saturday that he wants to see cease-fires both in Gaza and between Israel and Hezbollah. 'It is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability,' Biden said. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian accused the United States of supporting the killing that took out Nasrallah and several other commanders. 'The world community will not forget that the order of the terrorist strike was issued from New York and the Americans cannot absolve themselves from complicity with the Zionists,' Pezeshkian was quoted as saying in a statement read on Iranian state television. The State Department on Saturday ordered the departure of the families of U.S. diplomats who are not employed by the embassy in Beirut and authorized the departure of those who are, as well as nonessential employees because of 'the volatile and unpredictable security situation' in Lebanon’s capital. The move comes after an Israeli strike on Friday killed the leader of the Hezbollah terrorist group, intensifying the fighting along another front of war, this time between Israel and Hezbollah. The State Department has previously advised American citizens to consider leaving Lebanon and reiterated its warning against all travel to the country. 'Due to the increased volatility following airstrikes within Beirut and the volatile and unpredictable security situation throughout Lebanon, the U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available,' the department said in a statement Saturday. The State Department routinely orders or authorizes the departure of nonessential embassy staffers and the families of diplomats when security conditions deteriorate in the country where they are posted. An ordered departure is not technically an evacuation but does require those affected to leave. An authorized departure allows those affected to leave the country voluntarily at government expense.

Hezbollah confirms its leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an I...	Israel’s Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said Saturday that the elimination of Nasrallah was 'not the end of our toolbox,' indicating that more strikes were planned. By The Associated Press Lebanon’s Hezbollah group confirmed on Saturday that its leader and one of its founders, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the previous day. A statement said Nasrallah 'has joined his fellow martyrs.' Hezbollah vowed to 'continue the holy war against the enemy and in support of Palestine.' Nasrallah, who led Hezbollah for more than three decades, is by far the most powerful target to be killed by Israel in weeks of intensified fighting with Hezbollah. The Israeli military said it carried out a precise airstrike on Friday while Hezbollah leaders were meeting at their headquarters in Dahiyeh, south of Beirut. The Lebanese Health Ministry said six people were killed and 91 injured in the strikes, which leveled six apartment buildings. Ali Karki, the commander of Hezbollah’s Southern Front, and other commanders were also killed, the Israeli military said. Iran announced Saturday that a prominent general in its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard sanctioned by the U.S. died in the same airstrike. Abbas Nilforushan, 58, who the U.S. identified as the deputy commander for operations in the Guard, was killed Friday, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency reported. The recent strikes in Lebanon and the assassination of Nasrallah are a significant escalation in the war in the Middle East, this time between Israel and Hezbollah. Air raid sirens sounded across central Israel on Saturday afternoon, including at the Tel Aviv International Airport, shortly after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu landed after a trip to the U.S. The Israeli military said it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen. It was not immediately known if the missile strike was aimed at Netanyahu’s flight. Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli army spokesperson, said the airstrike Friday in Beirut was based on years of tracking Nasrallah along with 'real time information.' He declined to say what munitions were used or provide an estimate on civilian deaths. He said Israel takes measures to avoid civilians whenever possible. The Palestinian terrorist group Hamas in a statement issued condolences to its ally, Hezbollah. Nasrallah frequently described launching rockets against northern Israel as a 'support front' for Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza. It said 'assassinations will only increase the resistance in Lebanon and Palestine in determination and resolve.' Immediately after the confirmation from Hezbollah, people starting firing in the air in Beirut and across Lebanon to mourn Nasrallah’s death. 'Wish it was our kids, not you, Sayyid!' said one woman, using an honorific title for Nasrallah, as she clutched her baby in the western city of Baabda. News of Nasrallah’s killing stunned travelers at Lebanon’s only international airport, where hundreds of people were scrambling to leave the country despite limited flights. Some cried. Others talked on their phones in disbelief. One woman screamed: 'No! It was just an announcement! No, he didn’t die!' Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Tehran after Nasrallah’s killing was announced. Protesters chanted 'Death to Israel' and 'Death to Netanyahu the murderer' while waving Hezbollah flags. Thomas Juneau, a professor at the University of Ottawa’s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, said Iran will be under significant pressure to respond to Nasrallah’s killing without escalating violence in the region. 'At the same time, Iran is severely constrained in its ability to respond,' Juneau told The Associated Press. 'Iran understands that its military options are limited, given the conventional military superiority of Israel and the U.S.' Israel vows to keep up attacks on Hezbollah Israel’s Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said Saturday that the elimination of Nasrallah was 'not the end of our toolbox,' indicating that more strikes were planned. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant called it 'the most important targeted strike since the founding of the State of Israel.' Israel has vowed to step up pressure on Hezbollah until it halts its attacks that have displaced tens of thousands of Israelis from communities near the Lebanese border. The recent fighting has also displaced more than 200,000 Lebanese in the past week, according to the United Nations. The military said Saturday it was mobilizing three more battalions of reserve soldiers to serve across the country. It already sent two brigades to northern Israel to prepare for a possible ground invasion. Shoshani, the army spokesperson, said Israel has inflicted heavy damage on Hezbollah’s capabilities over the past week by targeting immediate threats and strategic weapons, such as larger, guided missiles. But he said much of Hezbollah’s arsenal remains intact and that Israel would continue to target the group. The Israeli military updated guidelines for Israeli citizens, canceling gatherings of more than 1,000 people due to the threat. Approximately 60,000 Israelis have been evacuated from their homes along the Lebanese border for almost a year. This month, Israel’s government said halting Hezbollah’s attacks in the country’s north to allow residents to return to their homes is an official goal. A year of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah Hezbollah started firing rockets on Israel in support of Gaza on Oct. 8, a day after Hamas terrorists launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and abducting another 250. Since then, the two sides have been engaged in escalating cross-border strikes. Earlier this month, thousands of explosives hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah detonated, killing dozens of people and maiming thousands, including many civilians. Israel is widely believed to be behind the attack. Israel has killed several other top Hezbollah commanders in Beirut, especially in the past two weeks, in addition to the attack that killed Nasrallah. A window of opportunity for Israel and Lebanon Orna Mizrahi, a senior researcher at the Tel Aviv-based think tank Institute for National Security Studies and former intelligence analyst for the Israeli military and prime minister’s office, noted that Nasrallah was sometimes a 'voice of reason,' interested in engaging Israel in a war of attrition and holding the terrorist group back from using the full force of their formidable arsenal against Israel. Nasrallah’s death could prompt some less senior members of Hezbollah to unleash much stronger weapons than have been used in the nearly yearlong exchange of hostilities, Mizrahi said. The biggest question mark right now, though, is how Iran will respond. She said Nasrallah’s death could provide a window of opportunity — while the organization is significantly weakened — for Lebanon to dilute Hezbollah’s influence, especially in the south, that threatens to drag Lebanon into a full-scale war with Israel. Continuing strikes on both sides of the border On Saturday morning, the Israeli military carried out more than 140 airstrikes in southern Beirut and eastern Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, including targeting a storage facility for anti-ship missiles in Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh. Israel said the missiles were stored beneath civilian apartment buildings. Hezbollah launched dozens of projectiles across northern and central Israel and deep into the Israel-occupied West Bank, damaging some buildings in the northern town of Safed. In Beirut’s southern suburbs, smoke rose and the streets were empty after the area was pummeled overnight by heavy Israeli airstrikes. Shelters set up in the city center for displaced people were overflowing. Many families slept in public squares and on beaches or in their cars. On the roads leading to the mountains above the capital, hundreds of people could be seen fleeing on foot, holding infants and whatever belongings they could carry. A total of 1,030 people — including 156 women and 87 children — have been killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon in less than two weeks, the country’s health minister said Saturday.

US agency announces sanctions against Iran-connected company and ...	According to the Department of Treasury, Iranian state actors have attempted to 'gain access to individuals with direct access to the presidential campaigns' to exercise 'influence' over the American elections. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner The United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced Friday sanctions on 7 individuals, US officials say are tied to Iranian efforts to influence the American 2024 presidential election. In a Friday statement, the Department of Treasury claims that Iranian 'state actors' engaged in a number of activities, such as hack-and-leak operations and spear-phishing, to impact American elections. The agency says that these individuals have attempted to 'undermine confidence in the United States’ election processes and institution .' Thus, the U.S. government will block 'all property and interests' belonging to the implicated parties. 'The U.S. government continues to closely monitor efforts by malicious actors to influence or interfere in the integrity of our elections,' said Bradley T. Smith, the Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. 'Treasury, as part of a whole-of-government effort leveraging all available tools and authorities, remains strongly committed to holding accountable those who see to undermine our institutions.' Government agencies first acknowledged Iranian attempts to create instability among the American public in the summer of 2024, amid a deluge of demonstrations condemning Israel’s response to the Oct. 7 Hamas slaughters of roughly 1200 people across the Jewish state. According to the Department of Treasury, Iranian state actors have attempted to 'gain access to individuals with direct access to the presidential campaigns' to exercise 'influence' over the American elections. The agency alleges that government actors for Iran, the chief global sponsor of terrorism, have utilized 'hacking' attacks to impact the upcoming elections. According to the agency, Iranian agents have engaged in 'cyber-enabled operations' during the 2020 and 2024 presidential elections in the U.S. Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) members have gained unauthorized access to multiple accounts belonging to high-ranking members of a 2024 presidential campaign. These agents subsequently leaked the information to the media in an effort to influence electoral outcomes. The agents reportedly used 'technical infrastructure' tied to Masoud Jalili, an actor with reported IRGC ties. OFAC also claims that six employees and executives of Emennet Pasargad, an Iran-based cybersecurity firm, implemented an 'online operation to intimidate and influence American voters.' The individuals—Fatemeh Sadeghi, Elaheh Yazdi, Sayyed Mehdi Rahimi Hajjiabadi, Mohammad Hosein Abdolrahimi, and Rahmatollah Askarizadeh—accomplished this through sending 'threatening emails to intimidate voters.' In April, a confidential document leak indicated that the IRGC has helped plan a litany of anti-Israel protests in the United States. Iran’s support for anti-Israel demonstrations in the United States is well documented. The regime’s so-called 'supreme leader,' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has repeatedly heaped praise on anti-Israel protesters, referring to the demonstrations as a 'courageous, humane resistance movement.'

IDF: Hassan Nasrallah is dead	The commander of Hezbollah’s terror activities in Southern Lebanon, Ali Karaki, was also killed in the attack. Karaki, the Iranian proxy’s No. 3 terrorist, had narrowly evaded an Israeli targeted killing attempt earlier this week. By Charles Bybelezer, JNS Terror master Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israel Defense Forces strike on Hezbollah’s headquarters in Beirut, the military confirmed on Saturday. There was no immediate official reaction from the Lebanese government, but a source close to Hezbollah said contact with him had been 'lost.' Several hours later, Hezbollah confirmed Nasrallah’s death. pic.twitter.com/mv9IXNSxih &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) September 28, 2024 The Israeli Air Force conducted the massive airstrike targeting the headquarters, built underground beneath residential buildings, in the heart of the Dahiyeh district of the Lebanese capital on Friday evening. The operation to assassinate Nasrallah was named 'New Order.' The commander of Hezbollah’s terror activities in Southern Lebanon, Ali Karaki, was also killed in the attack. Karaki, the Iranian proxy’s No. 3 terrorist, had narrowly evaded an Israeli targeted killing attempt earlier this week. On Saturday, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei was transferred to a location with heightened security, Reuters reported, citing two regional officials. Beforehand, Khamenei called on Muslims to 'stand by the people of Lebanon and the proud Hezbollah with whatever means they have and assist them in confronting the … wicked regime [of Israel],' according to a statement carried by Iranian state media. 'The fate of this region will be determined by the forces of resistance, with Hezbollah at the forefront,' he added. Khamenei convened on Friday night an emergency session of the Supreme National Security Council to discuss a response, according to The New York Times. Iran’s embassy in Lebanon condemned the strike on Nasrallah and vowed to 'bring its perpetrator an appropriate punishment. 'This reprehensible crime … represents a dangerous escalation that changes the rules of the game,' stated the mission. In a separate strike, the IDF killed Mohammed Ismail, the commander of Hezbollah’s missile array in Southern Lebanon, the military announced on Saturday. He was responsible for numerous attacks, including Wednesday’s ballistic missile launch at Tel Aviv. 'The is not the end of the tools in the toolbox,' said IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi of the targeted killings. 'The message is simple, to anyone who threatens the citizens of the State of Israel, we will know how to get to them.' הרמטכ״ל מפקד על מבצע ״סדר חדש״ לחיסול מנהיג חיזבאללה, חסן נסראללה, בבור חיל האוויר עם חברי פורום המטה הכללי pic.twitter.com/htpEYxpmp3 &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) September 28, 2024 War against Hezbollah rages Earlier on Saturday, the IDF called on Lebanese civilians to evacuate from several buildings in Dahiyeh, a known Hezbollah stronghold, as the Israeli Air Force carried out waves of strikes across Lebanon. Among the targets were weapons manufacturing and storage facilities, along with a Hezbollah command center, in Beirut, as well as other terrorist infrastructure in the Beqaa Valley in the country’s east. 'The terrorist organization Hezbollah and its leader Hassan Nasrallah joined the war against the State of Israel on Oct. 8. Since then, Hezbollah has continued its attacks against the citizens of the State of Israel, and has dragged the State of Lebanon and the entire region into escalation,' the IDF said in a statement released on Saturday. 'The IDF will continue to harm anyone who promotes and engages in terrorism against the citizens of the State of Israel,' it added. במהלך הלילה, מטוסי קרב של חיל האוויר, תקפו בהכוונת פיקוד הצפון מבנים בהם אוחסנו אמצעי לחימה, משגרים שכוונו לעורף מדינת ישראל ומבנים צבאיים בהם פעלו מחבלים מארגון הטרור חיזבאללה >> pic.twitter.com/XgDgptrN08 &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) September 28, 2024 Meanwhile, Hezbollah continued on Saturday to pummel the Jewish state with rocket fire, with a surface-to-surface missile launched from Lebanon hitting an open area in central Israel, the IDF said. In accordance with protocol, air raid sirens were not triggered, as the projectile was not headed for populated areas. Hezbollah also fired a volley of Fadi-1 rockets at Kibbutz Kabri in the Western Galilee, as well 10 rockets towards Safed in the Eastern Galilee. Additionally, a long-range missile struck in Samaria, reportedly hitting a Palestinian home in Hawara, near Nablus. There were no reports of injuries. U.S.-led ceasefire push Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who delivered a defiant speech on Friday morning in New York City during the 79th Session of the U.N. General Assembly, cut his trip short and was en route back to Israel, making the exceedingly rare decision to fly on Shabbat. Netanyahu has urged Lebanese citizens to rise up against Hezbollah while warning that the military would not hesitate to strike anywhere in Lebanon. 'I say to the people of Lebanon: Our war is not with you. Our war is with Hezbollah. Nasrallah is leading you to the edge of the abyss,' said Netanyahu on Tuesday after a visit to an intelligence base somewhere in Israel. 'I told you to evacuate homes in which there is a missile in the living room and a rocket in the garage,' he said. 'Whoever has a missile in the living room and a rocket in the garage will no longer have a home.' Nevertheless, Netanyahu said on Thursday that he 'shares the aim' of the U.S.-led diplomatic push to end the intensifying war with Hezbollah, speaking hours after insisting that the IDF would not back down amid reports of an imminent ceasefire. The United States, Australia, Canada, European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar called jointly on Wednesday night for an 'immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a diplomatic settlement.' Before the statement went out, U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron stated that 'it is time for a settlement on the Israel-Lebanon border that ensures safety and security to enable civilians to return to their homes.' Neither statement mentioned Hezbollah. IDF in escalation mode On Thursday, the IDF killed the head of Hezbollah’s aerial forces in an airstrike in Beirut’s Dahiyeh district. Senior terrorist Muhammad Hossein Sarur commanded numerous attacks with 'cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles launched at the Israeli home front,' the IDF said. On Tuesday, Israeli Air Force jets carried out another strike in Dahiyeh, killing Ibrahim Qubaisi, the commander of Hezbollah’s missile array. Last week, the IDF took credit for strike in Dahiyeh that killed more than a dozen senior Hezbollah terrorists, including Ibrahim Aqil, whom Washington also wanted for his involvement in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Beirut. Jerusalem has escalated strikes on Hezbollah since adding the return of evacuated Israeli civilians to the north as an official war goal on Sept. 17. Hezbollah has attacked Israel nearly daily since Oct. 8, firing some 9,000 rockets, missiles and drones. The attacks have killed more than 40 people and caused widespread damage. Tens of thousands of Israeli civilians remain displaced internally due to the violence.

AOC’s NY district has become ‘like Bangkok’ with brothels, illega...	She (AOC) doesn't come over here. She has totally neglected us.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The district of Progressive NY congresswoman and Squad member Alexandria Occasio-Cortez, popularly known as AOC, has become a crime-ridden red-light district where legitimate business owners and respectable citizens have to flee. Roosevelt Avenue in Queens, once known as a community of hardworking immigrants, has devolved into a trash-filled area characterized by prostitution and illegal scam businesses, to the chagrin of people who have lived in the neighborhood for years. Ramses Frias, a local activist, is angry at the deterioration of his neighborhood and told Fox News, 'It feels like Bangkok with women outside locations and pulling men off the street.' However, AOC has not been seen in the neighborhood where she once focused her campaign since August 2023, when she sharply criticized law enforcement for cracking down on illegal vendors. Frias said, 'She does not visit this area. This is actually an area where she campaigned the hardest, and a lot of people went out [to vote] for her, and she doesn't come over here. She has totally neglected us.' When FoxNews contacted AOC's office for comments, she did not reply. Roosevelt Avenue in Queens is now known sardonically as 'The Avenue of Sweethearts,' where children going to school and people coming home from work have to pass scores of prostitutes on any given night. This occurs in the heart of the Queens borough, underneath the area's main subway track, which connects it to Manhattan. Illegal vendors sell their wares and elbow out legitimate, tax-paying businesses. One business owner spoke to FoxNews on condition of anonymity, lest the violent pimps and madams take revenge on the shop owner for talking to the media about the situation. He said, 'I'm so scared. This is my business. ' He added that customers are now avoiding his store, and he may need to close. Frias lamented, 'This doesn't feel like my home. I've been here my whole life, and it feels like I'm a tourist in a Third World country. This is not how this is supposed to look; this is not how it's supposed to feel.' He added, 'This is a neighborhood and a community full of hardworking individuals, immigrants, and second-generation Americans that worked really hard to be here and are facing all this evil and all these bad things. &#8230; And it's just causing more issues daily, and our quality of life just continues to drop.'

IDF eliminates several Hezbollah commanders in Beirut	These terrorist commanders had worked for Hezbollah for years and were crucial to the planning and execution of the terror group's attacks against Israel. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In a series of strikes in Beirut, the IDF eliminated several terrorist commanders this week who played crucial roles in Hezbollah. In addition to killing Ibrahim Muhammad Qabisi, Head of Hezbollah's Missiles and Rockets Force, the IDF announced on Friday that several others were also eliminated in the same operation. Qabisi's deputy, Abbas Ibrahim Sharaf Ad-Din, and a senior terrorist from Hezbollah's missile unit, Hussein Hany, a close friend of Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah's head of Hezbollah's Strategic Unit eliminated in July, were also killed in the strike. Fuad Shafiq Khaz'al Khanafer, who played a crucial role in Hezbollah's surface-to-surface missile unit, was also eliminated. These terrorist commanders had worked for Hezbollah for years and were central to the planning and execution of the terror group's attacks against Israel. 'The IDF will continue to operate with determination against the Hezbollah terrorist organization in order to restore security to the citizens of northern Israel and the State of Israel as a whole,' the IDF stated. On Thursday, the IDF eliminated the head of Hezbollah's aerial forces in an airstrike in Beirut's Dahiyeh district. The Israel Defense Forces on Thursday killed the head of Hezbollah’s aerial forces in an airstrike in Beirut’s Dahiyeh district. Senior Hezbollah terrorist Muhammad Hossein Sarur commanded numerous attacks with 'drone, cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles launched at the Israeli home front,' the IDF stated. Sarur also was a leader in drone production in Lebanon and established sites to construct explosive and intelligence-gathering drones 'including some located under civilian buildings in Beirut and other areas in Lebanon,' the Israeli army said. He joined Hezbollah in the 1980s and was part of the Azuz unit responsible for launching attacks from Lebanon to Israel. Hezbollah has attacked Israel nearly daily since Oct. 8, firing thousands of rockets, missiles, and drones. The attacks have killed more than 40 people and caused widespread damage.

Lebanese civilians are ‘praying for a ceasefire’	Israel has 'shattered the illusion' of Hezbollah as a resistance organization capable of defeating its enemies. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Despite Hezbollah's aggressive rhetoric, many Lebanese civilians are hoping for a ceasefire and dread a full-scale war with Israel that could further devastate the country. a Lebanese woman from the Keserwan district told Israel Hayom, 'We're praying for a ceasefire. The American and French mediators working towards a ceasefire have been utterly disappointing.' She added that she and many Lebanese hope that Hezbollah will cease launching missiles against Israel in solidarity with Hamas as they have been since October 8th. The nearly year-long conflict between Lebanon and Israel, initiated when Hezbollah fired rockets into Israeli territory after the October 7th massacre, has led to a refugee crisis affecting both Lebanon and Syria. The woman explained, 'Nobody is taking in refugees from the south except for Tripoli. Many have fled to Syria. In Christian areas, rents have skyrocketed. There are virtually no apartments available in my area. I've had to turn down over ten rental requests; we can't rent to strangers. I've heard that one town has converted a school into a shelter for the displaced.' According to the Saudi news channel Al-Hadath, 23,000 people have crossed the border into Syria, including 10,000 Syrians who sought refuge in Lebanon during the country's civil war. In addition to displacement, these refugees are vulnerable to kidnapping and robbery by gangs exploiting the conflict for financial gain. In total, it's estimated that 500,000 Lebanese are being displaced by a conflict that began when Hezbollah fired at Israel 11 months ago, and a full-scale war could make the situation worse. Lebanese researcher Joumana Gebara told Israel HaYom that Hezbollah has lost a lot of its former clout and influence with the Lebanese public. 'The organization has suffered both moral and physical damage, with the moral blow being particularly severe,' he said. Gerbara explained that Hezbollah has touted itself as a 'resistance organization' capable of fighting off all enemies, but 'Israel has shattered that illusion.'

By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that he 'shares the aim' of the U.S.-led diplomatic push to end the intensifying war with Hezbollah, just hours after insisting that the IDF would not back down amid reports of an imminent ceasefire. 'Due to a lot of misreporting around the U.S.-led ceasefire initiative, it is important to clarify a few points. Earlier this week, the United States shared with Israel its intention to put forward, together with other international and regional partners, a ceasefire proposal in Lebanon,' Netanyahu said. 'Israel shares the aims of the U.S.-led initiative of enabling people along our northern border to return safely and securely to their homes. Israel appreciates the U.S. efforts in this regard because the U.S. role is indispensable in advancing stability and security in the region,' continued the premier. 'Our teams met [on Thursday] to discuss the U.S. initiative and how we can advance the shared goal of returning people safely to their homes. We will continue those discussions in the coming days,' he added. Earlier, Netanyahu had pushed back against reports that Israel was about to agree to a ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon. 'The news about a ceasefire is incorrect. This is an American-French proposal that the prime minister has not even responded to,' his office said, while Netanayhu was en route to New York to speak at the United Nations General Assembly on Friday. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer—a close adviser to Netanyahu—was scheduled to meet with top U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on the sidelines of the summit. Sources in the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office cited by Israel’s Channel 12 News said that Dermer received a green light to continue negotiations. 'The report of an alleged instruction to moderate the fighting in the north is also contrary to the truth,' according to Netanyahu’s statement. 'The prime minister has instructed the IDF to continue the fighting with full force and according to the plans presented to him,' his office said. Minutes later, Foreign Minister Israel Katz posted to X: 'There will be no ceasefire in the north. We will continue to fight against the Hezbollah terrorist organization with all our strength until victory and the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes.' The statements came as Netanyahu’s coalition members rejected the U.S.-France proposal for a 21-day ceasefire.

Israel announces $8.7 billion US military aid package	This substantial investment will significantly strengthen critical systems, such as Iron Dome and David’s Sling,' the Israeli Ministry of Defense stated. By JNS Israel’s Ministry of Defense announced that it had secured an $8.7 billion military aid package from the United States on Thursday. According to the ministry, $3.5 billion of the money is for 'essential wartime procurement' and the remaining $5.2 billion is for air defense systems, including Iron Dome and David’s Sling. 'This substantial investment will significantly strengthen critical systems, such as Iron Dome and David’s Sling while supporting the continued development of an advanced high-powered laser defense system currently in its later stages of development,' the ministry stated. Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir, director general of the Israeli Ministry of Defense, led the negotiations in Washington on behalf of Yoav Gallant, the defense minister. The ministry said that Zamir’s trip to Washington reflects 'the ironclad commitment to Israel’s security, particularly in addressing regional security threats from Iran and Iranian-backed militias by ensuring Israel’s overall capabilities.' Washington provides Israel with $3.8 billion in annual military aid under the terms of a 10-year memorandum of understanding that the two countries signed in 2016. In April, U.S. President Joe Biden signed into law a supplemental aid package that included $14.3 billion in direct military aid to Israel on top of the annual aid. A U.S. Department of State spokesperson told JNS that the funding announced Thursday was derived from April’s supplemental foreign aid bill. 'This $8.7 billion comes from the $14-plus billion emergency supplemental Congress approved in April 2024, with $3.5 billion being initially announced in August 2024 and the remaining $5.2 billion being announced today,' wrote David Milstein, who advised Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s presidential campaign and worked for David Friedman, then U.S. ambassador to Israel. 'It has been months,' Milstein wrote.

Irangate: Iran’s plan to stop Trump and elect Kamala	Unlike Russiagate, Irangate is real and has roots in the White House. By Daniel Greenfield, FrontPage Magazine In the last two months, Iran set up fake news sites to defame Trump and promote Kamala, hacked the Trump campaign and tried to pass stolen documents to the Harris-Walz campaign and its media allies, and finally plotted to assassinate former President Trump and his officials. These rather definite statements of Iran’s intentions in the presidential election have been dismissed with generic Russiagate buzzwords that describe the Islamic terrorist state as being out to 'destabilize and sow chaos'. When Iran hacked the Trump campaign, we were told that it was to 'sow chaos' and now that Trump has been briefed on the assassination threats, once again it’s been described as a plot to 'destabilize and sow chaos' in the United States. But if Iran is out to only 'sow chaos' then why isn’t it trying to assassinate Biden or Kamala? Where are the Iranian agents soliciting useful idiots to take a shot at current administration officials rather than former Trump administration officials? And why didn’t Iran hack into the Kamala campaign and then email the stolen files to the Trump-Vance campaign? Iran isn’t trying to 'sow chaos' which is a meaningless buzzword the intel community seem to have come up with to project its own nation building paradigm abroad onto American politics. The Islamic Republic is out to win. And it defines winning as Trump’s political defeat or death. America’s leading middle eastern enemy actively interfering in a presidential election ought to be bigger news than it is. The Clinton campaign spun Russia’s awkward efforts to recruit black nationalists into backing its Syria agenda after the election into the great Russiagate hoax complete with British ex-secret agents, micturating hookers in Moscow hotel rooms, secret bank internet connections and a multi-year investigation fronted by a senile former FBI boss. The revelation that Iran is trying to stop Trump and elect Kamala by any means occasions no more from the White House and the intel community than a reluctant briefing and some boilerplate prose about sowing chaos as if there is no motive or agenda to these activities. No one has brought ‘Irangate’ into being even though there’s more than enough materials. After September 11, Joe Biden suggested, 'this would be a good time to send, no strings attached, a check for $200 million to Iran.' Biden urged restoring an American diplomatic presence to Tehran where our diplomats had been held hostage and cutting off Radio Liberty broadcasts undermining the Iranian regime. Biden’s 2008 presidential campaign was backed by Iran Lobby figures and he believed that Iranian support was so vital to his campaign that he attacked Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for being insufficiently pro-Iran, and used his vote against designating the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the key player behind Hamas, Hezbollah and the murder of hundreds of American soldiers, as a terrorist organization to argue that he would make a better president. For Iran. After being part of an administration that provided Iran with the massive sanction relief and clearance that enabled it to build a massive missile arsenal and nuclear program, Biden left office and misappropriated classified documents involving Iran that he took home with him. Biden stayed loyal to the Iran Lobby and it to him. Iranian hackers with the IRGC tried to interfere in the 2020 presidential election to stop Trump and aid Biden. In the 2020 election, Jamal Abdi, the executive director of National Iranian American Council (NIAC) Action, often described as the Iran Lobby, was exposed as one of Biden’s biggest bundlers, and NIAC claimed its members had run phone banks and donated $385,000 to him. NIAC Action had endorsed Biden and celebrated the election outcome by declaring that, 'our long, national nightmare is almost over. AP has called the race for Joe Biden'. Iran’s president cheered Biden’s election win by expressing the hope that 'the next American administration will surrender to the Iranian nation.' The Islamic terror state leader was not to be disappointed. The Biden-Harris administration offered billions in sanctions relief to Iran while attempting to restore the failed nuclear deal with the terror state. It dropped support for the Saudi campaign against the Houthis in Yemen which allowed the Iran-backed terrorists to arm up and terrorize shipping in the Red Sea leading to 9 months of fighting in what has been described as the 'most intense combat since World War II' for the U.S. Navy. The Biden-Harris administration was filled with Iranian sympathizers and lobby figures, including Rob Malley, Biden’s envoy to Iran, under FBI investigation for mishandling classified information, whose actions were illegally covered up by State Department figures. It even brought in Ariane Tabatabai, an Iranian immigrant who had worked with the Iranian government to advise it and spread its propaganda, before working with Malley on the Iran negotiations, to act as a senior adviser to the Office of the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control, exactly where Tehran would have wanted her, before making her a Pentagon Chief of Staff. Over the next four years, the Biden-Harris administration gave Iran everything it wanted from endless sanctions relief to a hostage trade that not only freed Iranian agents but allowed them to remain and continue their activities inside the United States. This year the Biden administration was still at it, warning the British and French not to censure Iran at a vote in the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency despite its nuclear violations When the chopper carrying Iran’s previous president crashed, the Biden administration sent its condolences and Deputy UN Ambassador Robert Wood stood for a moment of silence in the memory of the leader of a regime that had recently been responsible for killing U.S. soldiers. The Biden-Harris administration now not only allowed sanctioned Iranian figures into the country but warned journalists away from filming outside the hotel where the Iranian delegation was staying. What did their cameras catch? The former head of NIAC, the Iran Lobby group linked to the Biden-Harris administration, entering the hotel. Is it any wonder that when Iran hacked the Trump campaign, it sent the materials to Harris-Walz staffers who did not report it to the FBI? There is no shortage of materials for a theory of ‘Irangate’. The Biden-Harris administration has been even better for Iran that the previous low-water marks set by Carter and Obama. Iran is not trying to 'sow chaos' but to swing a presidential election in favor of its candidate. The Islamic regime has also had a longtime obsession with Trump ever since he approved the operation that took out the IRGC’s deadly terror boss Qasem Soleimani. Even with Trump out of office, the official website of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei published a video simulating a drone strike on Trump’s home with the message, 'Revenge is Inevitable' Unlike Russiagate, Irangate is real and has been taking place out in the open for us to see. An enemy of the United States is doing everything possible to stop a free election from taking place. It already used fake news, hacking and assassination plots to stop Trump. Those tactics are likely to pick up as Election Day approaches. Facing defeat in Gaza and Lebanon, Iran is not about to give up. And the most troubling question at the heart of Irangate that needs to be asked is how much support do Iran’s agents have inside this country, and inside the Biden-Harris administration and the intel community.

Ballistic missile launched from Yemen at central Israel	Millions of residents of central Israel rush to bomb shelters as ballistic missile from Yemen launched towards Tel Aviv metro area. By JNS Israel’s 'Arrow' defense system intercepted a surface-to-surface ballistic missile fired at the Jewish state from Yemen, the Israel Defense Forces stated early on Friday morning. The missile was downed 'outside [Israel’s] borders,' according to the military. 'Sirens and explosions were heard following the interception and falling shrapnel,' the IDF said. Some 15 minutes earlier, the IDF stated that 'millions of Israelis are running to shelter as sirens sound across all of central Israel.' The IDF Home Front Command said there was no change in directives for residents of the country’s center. On Sept. 15, Israeli air defenses intercepted fragments of a surface-to-surface missile launched from Yemen that exploded over central Israel. In July, a Houthi drone killed a man in Tel Aviv, in response to which Israel struck Yemen’s Hodeidah port. The Iranian terror proxy has launched dozens of drones and missiles at Israel in support of Hamas in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023. On Wednesday, the IDF intercepted a surface-to-surface ballistic missile fired by Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon at central Israel. Hezbollah claimed that the attack targeted the headquarters of the Mossad intelligence agency.

If Eric Adams steps down, New York City’s next acting mayor will ...	New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams expected to replace Mayor Eric Adams, should he resign over corruption scandal. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner The next acting mayor of New York City might be a left-wing activist and staunch critic of the Jewish state. US prosecutors charged New York City Mayor Eric Adams on Thursday with soliciting illegal campaign contributions from foreign nationals and bribery. Adams’s potential departure from office could prove consequential for New York City’s estimated 960,000 Jewish residents, representing roughly 10 percent of the Big Apple’s population, and supporters of Israel living in the city. If Adams resigns as a result of the federal charges against him, New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams is widely expected to step into the mayoral role as his replacement. A review of Williams’s social media history reveals a pattern of denigrating Israel, raising questions over whether the public advocate would defend the city’s Jewish community. Williams has condemned Israel’s defensive military operations in Gaza as a 'war crime' and criticized the US Congress for inviting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak in July. 'Aside from basic humanity, under accepted [international] Law Benjamin Netanyahu is quite literally, at this moment, engaged in [international] war crimes/human rights violations,' Williams posted on X/Twitter at the time. 'Instead of Congress trying to stop it, they gave a platform.' Williams issued a statement on Oct. 11 of last year, four days after the Hamas terror group’s Oct. 7 massacre across southern Israel, lamenting the terrorist attacks on the Jewish state before calling on Jerusalem not to retaliate and shifting attention to alleged 'oppression' of Palestinians. 'We can, we have to be able to, at once grieve the hundreds of innocent lives taken in Israel, and oppose the escalating violence of retaliation, the endless war, the systemic violence and oppression of Palestinians too often ignored, excused, or condoned,' Williams wrote. On Oct. 14, one week after Hamas’s brutal slaughter of roughly 1,200 people in southern Israel, Williams condemned 'shameful' New York elected officials that 'won’t even mention [Palestine] or [Gaza].' Five days later, less than two weeks after the largest single-day mass-murder of Jews since the Holocaust, Williams called for an immediate 'ceasefire' between the Jewish state and the terrorist group. Israel had not yet launched its military offensive in neighboring Hamas-ruled Gaza to dismantle the terror group’s military capabilities and free the 251 hostages kidnapped from southern Israel on Oct. 7. He also drew an equivalency between Israel’s military operations to the Hamas atrocities. 'The moral compass of our leaders shows stunning irregularities,' Williams wrote on Instagram. 'On point in condemning horrendous attacks on Israel and demanding hostages be returned,' he added. '[Yet, failure] to recognize the [United Nation’s] description of a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, let alone support de-escalation and ceasefire.' On Oct. 24, Williams declared Gaza a 'humanitarian crisis' and added that 'all of us who rightly condemned Oct 7 on Israel should be rightly demanding a [ceasefire] now and before any ground invasion.' Israel began striking Hamas targets after repelling the Oct. 7 invasion but did not launch a ground offensive into Gaza until Oct. 27. In February, Williams appeared at a press conference conducted by the 'NYC 4 Ceasefire' coalition to demand an end to Israel’s military operations in Gaza. During the event, participants referred to the Gaza war as a 'genocide' and honored Palestinian 'martyrs.' 'We have gathered here today to show city-wide support for an immediate and permanent ceasefire and end to the genocide in Palestine,' said Jawanza Williams, organizing director of left-wing activist group VOCALNY. Williams harbors ties to the vehemently anti-Israel Democratic Socialists of America group (DSA). In a 2018 interview with the left-wing media outlet Jacobin, Williams said, 'I have no problem saying I’m a Democratic Socialist.' Williams has solicited an endorsement from the group while running for office in New York City. DSA has routinely praised Hamas’s so-called 'armed struggle' against Israel. The group issued an explicit endorsement of Hamas, stating that the terrorist organization is a cornerstone in the 'resistance' against the 'Zionist project.' DSA has also accused Israel of committing 'genocide' and praised the Hezbollah terrorist group for attempting to pummel the Jewish state with missiles.

‘Temple Mount is Muslim-only property,’ Palestinian Authority chi...	The head of the Palestinian Authority also said that Israel doesn’t deserve membership in the world body, as he nods to anti-Israel protesters in America, saying 'we are grateful' to them. By Mike Wagenheim, JNS In an address to the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday morning, Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas called the holiest Jewish site—the Temple Mount in Jerusalem—the 'exclusive property of Muslims' and referred to Israel as a 'terrorist state' that does not deserve membership in the United Nations. Abbas, whose presidential mandate expired in 2009–the last time P.A. elections were held–told those watching that 'the world is responsible' for what he asserted were crimes against humanity taking place in the Gaza Strip amid Israel’s defensive war against Hamas. He claimed that Israel 'took advantage of what happened' on Oct. 7, when Hamas launched a massive assault in southern Israel—murdering, raping and torturing 1,200 people and taking some 250 others hostage—to 'launch a genocide' in the Gaza Strip. Abbas also said Israel has just launched a second 'war of genocide' in Lebanon, calling into question what kind of hostilities the Jewish state could be involved in that wouldn’t qualify as one. He also referred to Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir as a terrorist for calling for a Third Temple to be built on the mount. Abbas saved a heavy dose of criticism for the Biden administration. He said he 'regrets' that the White House 'furnished Israel with deadly weapons it used to kill thousands of innocent civilians' while utilizing its veto power in the U.N. Security Council three times to thwart efforts to force a ceasefire on Israel with no guarantee that its hostages would be released from Gaza. 'As long as the U.S. is supporting' Israel, posed Abbas, 'why not keep going?' He also took Washington to task for denying the Palestinians full membership in the United Nations. 'We don’t deserve membership in the eyes of America,' he stated. 'I don’t understand.' Abbas did acknowledge protesters across America who 'are marching in the streets.' Many of them have called for the end of Israel, including its inhabitants, and have expressed explicit support for terror groups; have harassed Jews verbally and physically; and have disrupted Jewish life, including on college campuses. 'We are grateful to them,' said Abbas. He laid out a 12-step laundry list of requests and demands for a 'day-after' scenario, referring to the end of the war against Hamas and end of the terror group’s governance of Gaza. Those measures have all been laid out in one form or another in various public statements by the P.A., the United Nations and other international officials. On that list was 'an end to military aggressions by terrorist settlers' in Judea and Samaria, and eastern Jerusalem. Abbas said he would be submitting a request to the General Assembly regarding what he said was Israel’s lack of qualification to hold U.N. membership. His citation for such a claim was unclear, as he referred to Israel’s acceptance of the 1947 U.N. Partition Plan, but provisions he said Israel has never accepted or implemented. He also said that he would ask the world body to pass a resolution to ensure that Israel does not obstruct a visit by Abbas to the Gaza Strip, which he says he is trying to arrange. Abbas did not fall back on Holocaust denial or revisionism—a staple of previous UNGA speeches. Israel sent what appeared to be a staffer from its U.N. mission to attend the speech. Danny Danon, Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations released a statement, pointing out that Abbas’s 26-minute speech contained no mention of Hamas. 'Since the massacre of Oct. 7, Abbas has failed to condemn Hamas for their crimes against humanity,' Danon wrote. 'The Palestinian Authority under his leadership pays salaries to terrorists who kill Israelis: Whoever kills more, Abbas pays him more. Only when he stands on the U.N. platform does he talk about a peaceful solution.' Danon said the P.A. leader’s legacy 'is one of chronic weakness in the face of terrorism and hatred.'

Trump ally accused of being a Nazi after he changed the price of ...	Whether Lindell realized it or not, $14.88 has been identified as a Nazi symbol. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News When staunch Trump ally Mike Lindell changed the price of his pillow to $14.88, he most likely didn't expect accusations of Nazism to follow. However, white Supremacists on social media began liking his prices, and not because they were low. When Lindell lowered the price of his Standard Classic MyPillow from its usual range of between $29.99 to $49.98 down to $14.88, people began to allege that he was sending a Nazi message. Whether Lindell realized it or not, $14.88 has been identified as a Nazi symbol. The number 14 stands for a white supremacist motto that contains 14 words. David Lane, a member of the white supremacist group The Order, originated the motto: 'We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.' The double eights refer to the fact that 'H' is the eighth letter of the alphabet, and 88 stands for 'Heil Hitler,' both words beginning with 'H.' Lindell's MyPillow ad received 8,000 likes on X and 415 likes on Facebook. Balkanomic reposted their order of the pillows, saying: '$14.88? How could you pass up such a great deal?' An X user called 'Goy division,' whose bio shows white supremacist symbolism (including a Nazi SS-esque lightning bolt and the phrase 'Fourteen words, eighty-eight precepts'), wrote, '6,000,000 positive reviews can't be wrong.' 'Yes, I think we have a deal,' wrote one user who refers to himself as an 'ethnostatesman' and posted a picture of Pepe the Frog, a well-known white supremacist symbol. However, Mike Lindell insists it wasn't his intention to signal white supremacy, and he points out that many items at Walmart are sold for amounts ending in 88 cents. Lindell has often expressed the view that the 2020 election was rigged in favor of Joe Biden, and for his views, his pillow brand has been removed from shelves of Bed, Bath and Beyond, Kohl's, and Walmart. 'When they have a sale on a sale, right? That 88,' he said on FlashPoint, a conservative online talk show. 'I get a call from all the media around the country and the world, all the way to the Daily Mail, saying, what are you, a Nazi?' He added, 'I'm going, 'Who comes up with this stuff?'' When asked if he would change his prices from $14.88, Lindell insisted he wasn't budging. 'It's another attack on MyPillow because their CEO wants to go to paper ballots and counting. It's as simple as that,' he said.

Israeli security forces foil terror plot to bomb Jewish holy site...	Security forces said the actions are 'are even more severe when being carried out by Israeli citizens during wartime.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Shin Bet, Israel's security agency and the police foiled a terrorist plan to bomb Jewish holy sites in the north of Israel last month and to shoot worshippers who prayed there. On Thursday, the agencies announced the arrest of Basel Abahara, a 23-year-old who lives in the Galilee region, and two minors in mid-August. This week, they were indicted for planning terrorist acts and keeping weapons. During interrogations, Abahara admitted that he had been planning to bomb the holy sites and then to shoot Jewish worshippers there. He also said he built the explosives based on advice from contacts in Judea and Samaria. Abahara enlisted the aid of minors to carry out the attack. Shin Bet said the planning of the attack was in the early phases, and they managed to seize communication devices, bomb-making materials, and a military vest. Abahara also admitted to throwing a Molotov cocktail not far from his home. Shin Bet said in a statement that the planning of such an attack was even more severe than usual because it involved 'Israeli citizens during wartime.' 'The Shin Bet and Israel Police treat any involvement of Israeli citizens in activity that endangers the state's and citizens' security with great severity, will continue to operate accordingly under the authority afforded to them, and will use the means at their disposal to thwart threats,' they said. Last Thursday, the IDF and Shin Bet eliminated a terror leader who planned numerous attacks in Northern Samaria. Shadi Zakarneh was killed alongside other terrorists by an IAF strike on his vehicle after Shin Bet saw him traveling in Qabatiya. The strike that killed Zkarneh also eliminated two other terrorists in the vehicle, and a strike on an additional vehicle killed three others. The second vehicle was laden with explosives, and the strike caused multiple blasts.

Macklemore in hot water after ‘F—k America’ rant	While political statements from artists are nothing new, this one seems to have struck a nerve. By Jewish Breaking News What happens in Vegas doesn’t always stay in Vegas, especially when it comes to high-profile festival drama. Last Tuesday, Neon City Festival promoters proudly unveiled their star-studded lineup, with Grammy-winning rapper Macklemore featured among the headliners. By Monday, his name had vanished without a trace, leaving fans and industry insiders scrambling for answers. Neon City organizers have remained tight-lipped, citing only 'unforeseen circumstances' in a public statement for Macklemore’s sudden departure. However, sources close to the festival cited by Digital Music News point to a controversial performance Macklemore gave Saturday night. At a pro-Palestinian benefit concert in Seattle, the 'Thrift Shop' singer let loose with a sharp 'f—k America' during his set. While political statements from artists are nothing new, this one seems to have struck a nerve. The antisemitic rapper himself finally broke his silence yesterday with a lengthy social media post on X. While stopping short of a full apology, Macklemore admitted to getting 'caught in the moment' while performing. 'My thoughts and feelings are not always expressed perfectly or politely,' he wrote. 'Sometimes I slip up and get caught in the moment. Saturday night was one of those times.' 'But do not misconstrue the word ‘f—k’ for the word ‘hate.’ It’s different to be angry than to disown,' Macklemore continued. 'I’ve lost endorsements, I’ve lost business ties. I am still here, unwavering in my support for a Free Palestine.' Out of all the antisemitic A-listers spreading misinformation, Macklemore has been particularly harsh on Israel’s defensive war in Gaza. Just mere weeks after Hamas murdered 1,200 innocents in Israel on October 7, he signed a star-studded open letter calling for a ceasefire without preconditions. In May, he released a protest song titled 'Hind’s Hall,' ironically in support of the same violent campus takeovers being fought by congressional leaders in the Senate this week.

New York Mayor Eric Adams indicted following corruption probe: Re...	The case is likely to complicate any Adams bid for re-election in 2025. By Reuters and The Washington Free Beacon New York City mayor Eric Adams has been indicted after a federal corruption investigation, but the indictment is sealed and it is unclear what charges he will face, the New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The charges come after the FBI last November searched Adams' electronic devices, and in the wake of a slew of resignations by top city officials in recent weeks as multiple federal corruption investigations entangle his administration. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, which brought the charges, declined to comment. Adams' lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. One of his lawyers has said that the mayor, a Democrat, was cooperating with an investigation but did not say what it was about. The case is likely to complicate any Adams bid for re-election in 2025. Other Democratic politicians, including New York City comptroller Brad Lander, plan to challenge Adams—once a key ally of President Joe Biden—for the party's nomination. The Times, citing a search warrant, reported in early November 2023 that federal authorities were investigating the possible acceptance by Adams' 2021 campaign of illegal donations, including by the Turkish government. The probe, conducted by the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, focused on whether Adams' 2021 mayoral campaign conspired with a Brooklyn construction company to funnel foreign money into the campaign through a straw-donor scheme, the Times said. Authorities have also sought information about Adams' interactions with Israel, China, Qatar, South Korea and Uzbekistan, according to the Times.

Nasrallah’s dilemma: A crisis of strategic choices	Despite the setbacks, Nasrallah shows no sign of backing down from his support of Hamas. By Baruch Yedid, TPS Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is at a critical crossroads. Will he back down from fighting, or risk an Israeli invasion of Lebanon? His decision will come amid the loss of numerous key Hezbollah leaders in airstrikes, the shocking attack on the terror group’s communication devices, and the demands of his Iranian patrons. This crisis is compounded by an unprecedented wave of displacement — nearly half a million Lebanese fleeing Hezbollah strongholds in southern Lebanon and the Beqaa Valley. Thousands of Lebanese are staying in makeshift shelters while at least 5,000 have crossed into neighboring Syria. Exacerbating Nasrallah’s troubles, the displaced Lebanese are now largely dependent on international aid and may become a bargaining chip in future negotiations. On the political front, Hezbollah’s leadership appears fragmented, with reports of internal discord between the organization’s leadership and its southern military command. Nasrallah banked on the international community pressuring Israel to quickly end its war with Hamas. He expected his pre-October 7 arsenal of an estimated 200,000 rockets to deter Israel. Instead, the fighting in Gaza is approaching its first anniversary. Nasrallah has not provided Hamas with any meaningful support. The elite Radwan Force is in disarray. The sabotage of thousands of communications devices has made Hezbollah a source of ridicule. And a ground war in Lebanon is looking increasingly likely. Hezbollah figures are increasingly resorting to the rhetoric of martyrdom, indicating a growing sense of desperation. Despite the setbacks, Nasrallah shows no sign of backing down from his support of Hamas. Hezbollah still maintains significant firepower, but Iran is currently restraining Hezbollah. It is believed Iran will intervene if Hezbollah’s situation deteriorates. Tehran has invested far more in Hezbollah than Hamas. Around 63,500 residents of northern Israel were forced to evacuate their homes when Hezbollah began launching rockets and drones in October. The terror group has launched more than 9,300 rockets and drones, killing 49 people on the Israeli side. Israel has defeated Hamas enough that it is now turning its attention to safely bringing its evacuees home. Israeli officials have been calling for Hezbollah to be disarmed and removed from southern Lebanon — from all locations south of the Litani River — in compliance with UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War. Nasrallah can back down, sparing Lebanon from a destructive war, but lose his credibility as a leader in Iran’s so-called 'Axis of Resistance.' Or Nasrallah can fight to the end and sacrifice Lebanese lives.

Israeli airstrike kills terrorist brothers who participated in Oc...	The IDF added that forces in the Rafah area of southern Gaza have killed 15 terrorists in the last day. By Pesach Benson, TPS Two brothers who participated in Hamas’s October 7 massacre were eliminated in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces said on Thursday. The IDF said Suleiman Abu-Lafi and his brother, Abdullah were killed in Rafah last week. According to the army, Suleiman smuggled weapons. From Gaza he managed to direct terror attacks in Judea and Samaria. Abdullah was a member of Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Both participated in the October 7 attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border. A separate airstrike killed another commander of Hamas’s Nukhba Force who also participated in the October 7 massacre. The IDF added that forces in the Rafah area of southern Gaza have killed 15 terrorists in the last day. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

30,000 Jewish visitors to make Rosh Hashanah pilgrimage to Ukrain...	Earlier this month, Ukraine warned Hasidic Jews to forgo this year’s pilgrimage to Uman due to the war with Russia. By The Algemeiner Some 30,000 Hasidic Jews will reportedly go on this year’s annual Rosh Hashanah pilgrimage to the Ukrainian city of Uman to visit the tomb of Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, the revered founder of the Breslover Hasidim. An Israeli diplomat had told The Times of Israel that the number of worshipers this year could reach a record 50,000. However, due to flight cancellations caused by escalating tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, the Iran-backed terrorist organization in Lebanon, thousands of pilgrims will not be able to make the trip, according to the Ukrainian News Agency. Citing the United Jewish Community of Ukraine and the Historical and Cultural Center of Uman charitable foundation, the news agency reported on the lower-than-expected attendance. 'This year, due to the escalation in the north of Israel, a number of airlines canceled the flights that the Hasidic pilgrims were supposed to use to reach European countries in order to get to Ukraine,' the charitable foundation said in a message. 'Although the interested parties are looking for a way out of this situation, a significant part of the thousands of pilgrims who want to get to Uman will not be able to do so.' Each year, tens of thousands of Jewish pilgrims visit Uman, a major pilgrimage site for Hasidic Jews to pray at Nachman’s tomb on the occasion of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, which will take place next week. Up to 500 Hasidim had already arrived in Uman as of last week, with a mass arrival of pilgrims expected in the coming days, according to the State Migration Service of Ukraine. Since 2020, Ukrainian officials have warned against making the pilgrimage, first due to COVID-19 and then because of the war with Russia. The pilgrimage became more complicated when many commercial flights to Ukraine were suspended following Russia’s invasion of the country in 2022. Earlier this month, Ukraine warned Hasidic Jews to forgo this year’s pilgrimage to Uman due to the war with Russia. 'Russia’s ongoing full-scale military aggression against Ukraine poses real threats to people’s lives and safety, [making] it impossible to guarantee the safety of foreign citizens on the territory of Ukraine,' the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Kyiv added that there is a 'legal regime of martial law which provides for a number of additional regulations, including restrictions on freedom of movement, a curfew and enhanced patrols, a ban on holding mass events and gatherings, as well as the application of coercive measures against persons who will not comply with the established restrictions.' Therefore, the ministry wrote, Ukraine 'urges Hasidic pilgrims to refrain from this year’s pilgrimage to Uman as part of the celebration of Rosh Hashanah.' The statement went on to say that due to the war, there are not enough bomb shelters or medical personnel in Uman, and the transportation infrastructure has been compromised due to shelling. The foreign ministry’s warning came two days after the governor of the region where Uman is located issued a similar statement to Jewish worshipers ahead of Rosh Hashanah. Like the ministry, Cherkasy Region head Igor Taburets did not say that the pilgrims would be prevented from coming but asked them not to make the trip. Nonetheless, local authorities were preparing for the pilgrimage with enhanced security measures, according to Taburets. Earlier this month, Moldova said it would not allow pilgrims to pass through the country on the way to Uman, citing security costs and the limited capacity of their facilities. Some 20,000 pilgrims used Chisinau airport last year to get to Ukraine. An alternative route into Uman has been prepared through Romania. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke about preparations for the pilgrimage last month. The United States recently issued a travel warning for Uman, urging American citizens not to visit the city due to the security situation. Uman has been targeted by Russian forces on several occasions during the ongoing war. Last April, at least 20 people, including three children, were killed during a missile and drone barrage launched by the Russians. Located in the south of Ukraine in the Cherkasy region, Uman was once home to a thriving Jewish community. In 1941, however, the Nazis deported the city’s entire Jewish community, murdering 17,000 Jews and destroying the local Jewish cemetery — including Nachman’s grave, which was later recovered and relocated. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, several Jewish Orthodox families have moved to Uman. Last year, more than 35,000 worshipers celebrated Rosh Hashanah at the grave of Nachman, despite Ukrainian authorities issuing similar warnings as they are now about visiting the city amid war with Russia.

Mayim Bialik expresses solidarity with Israelis in rocket-attacke...	She added that her ancestor was 'a Zionist visionary, a gifted poet, and a lover of Israel.' By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Jewish actress and neuroscientist Mayim Bialik shared on Tuesday a message of support for residents of Kiryat Bialik, a northern city in Israel named after her great-great-grandfather’s cousin, after it was hit with heavy rocket fire this past weekend from the Lebanese Hezbollah terrorist group. 'You may have seen that Iran-backed Hezbollah hit Kiryat Bialik this weekend,' the former 'The Big Bang Theory' star wrote in an Instagram post. 'Thousands of rockets have been fired upon Israel by Hezbollah over the last year, and the situation in the north is intensifying in terrifying ways … My heart is with all the innocent civilians of Kiryat Bialik.' The city was named after Israel’s national poet laureate Haim Nahman Bialik, who is related to the actress. He died in 1934 of a heart attack at the age of 61 in Vienna, Austria. Bialik House, his former home in Tel Aviv, has been converted to a museum dedicated to the poet and his work. Most major cities in Israel also have a street named after him, Bialik noted in her Instagram post. She added that her ancestor was 'a Zionist visionary, a gifted poet, and a lover of Israel.' Hezbollah launched more than 100 rockets and drones at northern Israel over the weekend and three people suffered shrapnel wounds. Bialik was honored with the Ambassadors for Peace award on Tuesday night at a gala hosted by Creative Community for Peace (CCFP), a nonprofit organization comprised of members of the entertainment industry who have the shared goal of combating antisemitism and the cultural boycott of Israel while using the arts to promote peace. Upon accepting the award at the CCFP gala on Tuesday night, Bialik spoke about 'feeling overwhelmed' since the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre that took place in southern Israel. 'I took my oldest son to college this week as my family is sleeping in bomb shelters in Israel. That contrast is what many of us are feeling for this entire year,' she said. 'CCFP was founded over a decade ago but I do admit that it wasn’t until Oct. 7 that the work of CCFP became an integral part of my daily life. I want to thank everyone at CCFP for the support that has given me the ability to stand strong in the face of intimidation, threats, hatred, and ignorance.'

IDF strike in Beirut kills top Hezbollah aerial commander	The slain terrorist joined Hezbollah in the 1980s and served in a variety of positions, including as the commander of the surface-to-air missile unit and the 'Aziz' unit. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces on Thursday killed the head of Hezbollah’s aerial forces in an airstrike in Beirut’s Dahiyeh district. Senior Hezbollah terrorist Muhammad Hossein Sarur commanded numerous attacks with 'drone, cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles launched at the Israeli home front,' the IDF stated. Sarur was also a drone production 'project leader' in Lebanon, who established sites to build explosives and intelligence-gathering drones, 'including some located under civilian buildings in Beirut and other areas in Lebanon,' the Israeli army said. היום, 26 בספטמבר 2024, בהכוונה מודיעינית מדוייקת של חיל האוויר ואגף המודיעין, מטוסי קרב תקפו בביירות וחיסלו את מחמד חסין סרור, מפקד היחידה האווירית של ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה>> pic.twitter.com/9btewwdOwE &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) September 26, 2024 The slain terrorist joined Hezbollah in the 1980s and served in a variety of positions, including as the commander of the surface-to-air missile unit and the 'Aziz' unit, responsible for terror operations on Lebanon’s southern border with the Jewish state. Sarur also served as the Iranian-backed terrorist organization’s envoy to the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Lebanon’s Al Mayadeen televisoin channel, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, reported that four people were killed in the Israeli airstrike. Two Lebanese 'security sources' confirmed that Sarur, also known as Abu Saleh, was among the dead, Reuters reported. מרגעי התקיפה בביירות pic.twitter.com/0CPsHLAbLV &mdash; בז news (@1717Bazz) September 26, 2024 'The IDF will continue to undermine the capabilities of the Hezbollah terrorist group and to dismantle the organization’s top command,' the Israeli military stated on Thursday afternoon. Shortly before the IDF announcement, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office released a photo of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approving the assassination during his flight to the United States. On Tuesday, Israeli Air Force jets carried out another strike in Dahiyeh, killing Ibrahim Qubaisi, the commander of Hezbollah’s missile array. That strike came fewer than 24 hours after the attempted assassination of Hezbollah’s No. 3 terrorist commander, Ali Karaki, in the same area. On Friday, the IDF took credit for a airstrike in Dahiyeh that killed more than a dozen senior Hezbollah terrorist officials, including Ibrahim Aqil, whom Washington also wanted for his involvement in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Beirut. Jerusalem has escalated attacks on Hezbollah since adding the return of evacuated Israeli civilians to the north as an official war goal on Sept. 17. Hezbollah has attacked Israel nearly daily since Oct. 8, firing thousands of rockets, missiles and drones. The attacks have killed more than 40 people and caused widespread damage. Tens of thousands of Israeli civilians remain displaced internally due to the violence.

Ben-Gvir threatens to freeze role in coalition amid reports of 21...	He added that a truce 'conveys weakness, endangers the security of your citizens, and proves that you do not intend to win.' By JNS Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir vowed on Thursday to suspend his role in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing coalition if Jerusalem agrees to a temporary ceasefire with Hezbollah. If a truce is signed, Ben-Gvir’s Otzma Yehudit Party would 'relieve itself of any commitment to the coalition,' including voting in the Knesset and attending cabinet meetings, the right-wing leader warned. 'The most basic and understandable thing is that when your enemy is on his knees, you do not allow him to recover, but work to defeat him,' Ben-Gvir said. He added that a truce 'conveys weakness, endangers the security of your citizens and proves that you do not intend to win.' Should a temporary ceasefire in Lebanon become permanent 'as part of an ‘outline’ of some sort, all ministers and Knesset members from Otzma Yehudit will resign from the government and coalition,' Ben-Gvir added. The United States, Australia, Canada, European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar called jointly on Wednesday evening for an 'immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a diplomatic settlement.' Minutes before the announcement, U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron released a similar, joint statement. On Thursday, other members of Israel’s coalition government rejected the proposal, which made no mention of Hezbollah terror. Netanyahu has pushed back against reports that Jerusalem was about to agree to the ceasefire terms, saying that 'this is an American-French proposal that the prime minister has not even responded to.' In a call with reporters Wednesday night, two senior U.S. officials said that Israel and Lebanon 'are familiar with the text, and we’ll let them speak with their actions of accepting the deal in the coming hours.' 'I can share that we have had this conversation with the parties and felt this was the right moment to issue the call based on our discussion,' one of the senior officials said.

Hamas to surrender control of Gaza to Palestinian Authority – rep...	Israeli government has repeatedly rejected the idea, considering the Palestinian Authority a terror supporting entity. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Hamas has agreed that the Palestinian Authority (PA) can control the Gaza Strip, including the crossings into Israel and Egypt, on the ‘day after’ the war with Israel ends, Saudi news channel Al-Hadath reported Thursday. The channel cited an unnamed Hamas official as its source. Eleven days ago, Osama Hamdan, a member of Hamas’ policy-setting Political Bureau, told AFP that the terror organization wants 'joint Palestinian rule' in Gaza. Referring to a Chinese effort in July to make peace between the PA’s main backer, the nationalist Fatah movement, and the Islamist Hamas, along with 12 other smaller factions, Hamdan added, 'We went to Beijing&#8230;and we agreed to form a national unity government that will run Palestinian affairs in Gaza.' The highlight of the so-called Beijing Declaration was a plan to form an interim reconciliation government to run both Gaza and the PA that would lead eventually to the establishment of a Palestinian state 'with Jerusalem as its capital.' It also declared that the Palestinians had a right to 'resist Israeli occupation.' On Wednesday, PA Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa said that a meeting to sign an agreement would take place in Egypt next week, and that 'everyone' will participate in managing the coastal enclave. Meanwhile, a 'senior PA official' told Ynet Thursday that the PA already controls much of civilian life in Gaza, even without a reconciliation deal. 'The PA manages civil affairs in the Gaza Strip anyway - education, health, the water and energy authority,' the official said. 'For Hamas, this is a headache, so it will hand it over to the PA in order to continue to control security and military [matters]. 'Hamas understands that Israel will not give up control of the crossings from a security point of view, so it will let the PA face Israel,' he added. 'We will wait and see what happens at the meeting in Cairo, but there are not too many expectations for an agreement.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly declared that the PA can play no role in Gaza after the war is over, as its constant anti-Israel rhetoric, lawfare tactics and glorification of terrorists, whether from Fatah or any other Palestinian group, make it no better than Hamas. Despite the government’s agreement with Netanyahu, the Biden administration has consistently pushed the idea of the PA stepping in to rule Gaza on the day after. In August, Channel 12 reported that the PA had presented a plan to the U.S. outlining how it could do so. The report said, however, that the proposal did not include any explanation of how Hamas would be prevented from rebuilding its military strength, or how the PA could block any group from launching rockets again at Israel. It also did not propose solutions for how to prevent smuggling operations under the Egyptian-Gaza border area, known as the Philadelphi Corridor, which Israel has called 'Hamas’ lifeline' for weaponry that Jerusalem insists it can never allow the Palestinians to control again.

Netanyahu departs for New York, denies report of impending truce ...	Israel has yet to respond to American-French proposal for a ceasefire with Hezbollah, Netanyahu says, denying claims by US officials of an impending truce. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday denied reports that his government and the Lebanese terror organization Hezbollah are set to begin a three-week truce within the next few hours. Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, departed via Ben Gurion International Airport before dawn Thursday morning, flying to New York for the prime minister's address to the United Nations General Assembly. The premier, who made no statements to the press before his departure, which was delayed this week following the latest round of fighting between the IDF and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon and a Hezbollah ballistic missile attack on the Tel Aviv area, did release a statement while en route to New York regarding an alleged truce set to go into effect 'in the coming hours.' The prime minister's office issued a statement rebutting claims made by senior U.S. officials, denying that Israel had agreed to the plan, drafted by the Biden administration and the Macron government, for a three-week truce between Israel and Hezbollah. 'The report about a ceasefire is incorrect. This is an American-French proposal that the Prime Minister has not even responded to.' 'The report about the purported directive to ease up on the fighting in the north is the opposite of the truth. The Prime Minister has directed the IDF to continue fighting with full force, according to the plan that was presented to him.' 'The fighting in Gaza will also continue until all the objectives of the war have been achieved.' Earlier on Thursday, Sky News quoted senior American officials who said that a breakthrough had been reached on a ceasefire, and that the truce was set to go into effect within a matter of hours. Opposition Leader Yair Lapid pushed back against the planned three-week ceasefire, saying Israel should only agree to a single-week truce, so as to avoid giving Hezbollah time to regroup after a wave of Israeli attacks. Coalition members and local leaders across northern Israel expressed outrage following the Sky News report, demanding the government continue combat operations against Hezbollah.

Scientists unlock photosynthesis secrets, paving the way for more...	Genetically modifying plants to optimize photosynthesis could lead to higher yields, especially in regions with inconsistent sunlight, poor soil, or challenging climates. By Pesach Benson, TPS An Israeli study of photosynthesis in plants could open new avenues of innovation in agritech and the development of more efficient crops. Photosynthesis is a biochemical process by which plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of glucose, a type of sugar that can be used to fuel their activities. A key byproduct of this process is the release of oxygen from the plant. Between 50-80% of Earth’s oxygen is the result of photosynthesis. It is also responsible for sequestering carbon dioxide, providing the foundation for the planet’s food chain. Scientists at the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, led by Dr. Reinat Nevo under the guidance of Professor Ziv Reich, found that photosynthesis adapts to varying levels of sunlight by reorganizing the structure of its chloroplast membranes. The process of photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts, organelles within plant cells that house specialized membranes. These membranes are crucial for facilitating the flow of electrons between proteins, a key aspect of converting solar radiation into usable chemical energy. Until recently, scientists believed that the spatial structure of these membranes posed a challenge to photosynthesis by forcing electrons to travel longer distances between proteins, thereby slowing down the process. However, Nevo’s research team discovered that these membranes are not static. Instead, they shift their organization depending on the amount of available light. The study was recently published in the peer-reviewed Nature Plants journal. Much like how human pupils dilate or constrict in response to light exposure, the membranes in chloroplasts change their alignment when moving between darkness and light. The study found that as plants transition from dark to light conditions, the chloroplast membranes adjust, bringing proteins closer together and shortening the distance that electrons must travel. This realignment helps the photosynthetic process operate more efficiently under different light intensities. The ability of chloroplast membranes to reorganize themselves ensures that plants can optimize energy use, regardless of fluctuating sunlight. To uncover these findings, Nevo’s team used cutting-edge technology, including cryo-scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, to observe chloroplast membranes in both light and darkness. Contrary to previous assumptions, the study revealed that while the proteins themselves did not change position, the spatial arrangement of the membranes did. This shift in membrane alignment plays a vital role in regulating the distance between proteins, facilitating a faster and more efficient photosynthesis process. One reason for this dynamic adjustment is to protect the plant. Under low-light conditions or during nighttime, photosynthesis is minimal. In these situations, the membranes distance themselves, isolating proteins and preventing them from being overstimulated by weak light, which could potentially damage them. Building on this discovery, the research team conducted an experiment using genetically modified plants. In one group, the plants’ chloroplast membranes were locked in the 'light mode,' keeping the proteins close together even in darkness. In another group, the membranes remained perpetually in 'dark mode,' with proteins spaced further apart. The results were striking: plants with the locked light-mode configuration grew larger and exhibited higher rates of photosynthesis compared to those in dark mode. These findings suggest a promising future for genetically engineered crops designed to optimize photosynthesis. By manipulating the spatial structure of chloroplast membranes, plants could potentially grow more efficiently under weaker or artificial light. Genetically modifying plants to optimize photosynthesis could lead to higher yields, especially in regions with inconsistent sunlight, poor soil, or challenging climates. It also raises new possibilities for indoor and vertical farming in urban areas, while reducing the amount of energy required to grow food in controlled environements like greenhouses.

70 weapons depots, 80 missiles, and 3 senior commanders: How a we...	The ongoing aerial assault is being viewed as a regional game changer, proving to Hezbollah that it is not as untouchable as its leaders once believed. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon Israel has destroyed scores of Hezbollah missiles, drones, and rocket launchers across Lebanon over the past several days, orchestrating an unprecedented series of pinpoint airstrikes and intelligence-driven operations that have quickly degraded swaths of the terror group's arsenal—and eliminated at least three of the group's senior commanders. Israel's air force is pummeling Hezbollah's arms depots and targeting its senior leadership, marking the 'most extensive' strikes 'ever carried out in its history,' according to the country's military leaders and regional news outlets. Hezbollah, long known as Iran's preeminent regional terror proxy, is being defanged by the Jewish state's armed forces in the process. It has lost almost half of its medium and long-range missiles in a series of Israeli raids designed to annihilate 'surveillance equipment, command rooms, and other infrastructure' used by Hezbollah to rain terror on Israel's northern border. On Wednesday, Israel continued its offensive, showing no signs of backing down from a fight that it largely avoided for months as it turned its attention to Hamas in the wake of the Oct. 7 terror spree. Around 60 key targets belonging to Hezbollah's 'intelligence division' were struck across Lebanon, with Israeli military leaders promising to destroy 'all of their rocket capabilities' and bases. All told, Israel has logged close to 3,000 flight hours, using more than 250 warplanes to drop an estimated 2,000 munitions across 200 separate locations in Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed to the Washington Free Beacon. The strikes have destroyed around 400 medium-range rocket launchers, 70 weapons storage depots, and around 80 drones and cruise missiles. They've also killed at least three senior commanders—rocket and missile division head Ibrahim Qubaisi, military operations head Ibrahim Aqil, and training unit head Ahmed Wahbi—along with other top fighters. The coordinated attacks, Israel says, are 'changing the operational situation in the north, changing the reality,' for Hezbollah as the terror group goes on defense after nearly a year of nonstop terror strikes on Israeli towns throughout the country. The ongoing aerial assault is being viewed as a regional game changer, proving to Hezbollah that it is not as untouchable as its leaders once believed. Still, experts who spoke to the Free Beacon emphasized that Israel has a long way to go in its bid to defeat the terror group. Hezbollah has missiles 'dispersed and buried' across Lebanon, said David Schenker, the State Department's former assistant secretary for Near Eastern Affairs. 'They still have capabilities, and I think that they always manage to surprise,' he said. 'There's no knockout blow here.' At the same time, there's 'still a long way Israel can go up the escalation ladder,' Richard Goldberg, a former White House National Security Council member, told the Free Beacon. The Jewish state, for example, is reportedly readying a full-blown ground invasion into Lebanon after a Hezbollah missile attack targeted Tel Aviv for the first time in the conflict on Wednesday. Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the Israeli military's chief of staff, reportedly told forces stationed along the northern border 'to prepare the terrain' for a possible ground incursion. For Goldberg, Israel's actions leading up to the potential invasion have helped provide a strategic advantage. 'Israel is finally committed to climbing the escalation ladder until its primary objective is achieved: the return of 60,000 civilians to their homes,' Goldberg said. 'Israel has disrupted communications, eliminated key leadership assets, degraded command and control, and is now working through every target in the bank to degrade Hezbollah's strategic capabilities.' Israel's airstrikes kicked off last week, shortly after the country launched a devastating surprise attack on Hezbollah's communications infrastructure. Pagers and handheld radios across Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq simultaneously detonated, sidelining an estimated 1,500 Hezbollah fighters, according to Times of Israel military reporter Emanuel Fabian. Israel is particularly interested in Hezbollah's massive cache of sophisticated Iranian missiles and drones, which the terror group has relied on in recent weeks to strike deeper and deeper into the Jewish state's territory. Many of these sites are located in civilian homes and areas, a tactic employed by Hamas and Hezbollah to maximize casualties. Lebanese authorities say that more than 600 have been killed—the highest casualties since Israel's 2006 war on Hezbollah—with Israel assessing that 'many Hezbollah operatives are among the dead.' Over the weekend, as Hezbollah launched hundreds of missiles at Israel, the Jewish state's air force published dramatic footage of planes hitting approximately 180 of the terror group's missile launchers. Hezbollah's command structure has also taken an unprecedented hit, with Israel in recent months assassinating 16 of the group's top leaders, including some who have been eluding authorities for decades due to their role in international terror attacks. Those leaders include Aqil, the head of Hezbollah's operations unit and its elite Radwan Forces. Aqil was killed last week during an airstrike that also eliminated scores of Radwan fighters. Israel also killed Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah's highest-ranking military commander, in July. These operations, however, have come with repercussions, as Hezbollah unleashes some of its most advanced missiles to strike as far south as Tel Aviv. The terror group has launched nearly 10,000 attacks on Israel since the war began, using cruise missiles and armed drones to burn almost 200 million square meters of land.

Iranian FM: Tehran to back Lebanon with ‘all means’	Iran’s new president said on Monday that Israel seeks to drag the Middle East into a full-scale war by provoking Tehran to join the conflict in Lebanon. By JNS Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Wednesday evening that Tehran would back Lebanon by 'all means' if the war between Israel and Hezbollah continues to intensify. 'Iran has already shown tremendous patience and restraint for the sake of regional peace and stability,' Araghchi said on the sidelines of the 79th Session of the U.N. General Assembly in New York City. He also told reporters that 'the region is on the brink of a full-scale catastrophe,' adding that Israel had crossed 'all red lines,' according to Reuters. Israel has repeatedly come under fire from the General Assembly podium this week, with condemnations by U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Jordanian King Abdullah and others. Iran’s new president said on Monday that Israel seeks to drag the Middle East into a full-scale war by provoking Tehran to join the conflict in Lebanon, Reuters reported on Tuesday. 'We want to live in peace, we don’t want war. It is Israel that seeks to create this all-out conflict,' said Masoud Pezeshkian. Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon told reporters before a Security Council meeting on Wednesday that Israel would welcome a ceasefire and preferred a diplomatic solution, but noted that Iran was the nexus of violence in the region and that peace required dismantling the threat. Hezbollah’s attacks, which have continued nearly daily since Oct. 8, have forced tens of thousands of Israelis to flee their homes along the border. Israel has in recent days dramatically ramped up its response to Hezbollah’s aggression, after adding the return of its northern residents to their homes to its official war goals.

Word salad sandwich: Harris dodges softballs in friendly chat wit...	Doing what comes naturally, Harris deployed an excessive amount of words to say very little of substance about pressing issues. By Andrew Stiles, The Washington Free Beacon Vice President Kamala Harris recited familiar talking points and dished out indecipherable word salads Wednesday evening during her first solo interview with a national network, MSNBC, and her second interview this month with a media figure who openly supports her campaign, Stephanie Ruhle. (Last week Harris sat down with Oprah Winfrey, the billionaire tycoon.) Most significantly, perhaps, Harris finally weighed in on the Washington Free Beacon's detailed report on the curious nature of her claim to have worked at McDonald's during college. 'I come from the middle class,' Harris said for roughly the thousandth time since accepting the Democratic Party's nomination for president. She also believes in the middle class, as well as 'new industries,' and 'entrepreneurs' and 'bringing down costs.' She is 'serious' about her 'enthusiasm for small businesses' but has also 'spent a lot of time with CEOs' who agree that her policies, such as they are, would revive the economy after four years of failed leadership under President Joe Biden. Ruhle, who just days earlier defended Harris for refusing to give interviews, asked a series of softball questions about the economy, nodding along and helpfully interrupting at times to steer the VP toward a different talking point. Ruhle hardly seemed bothered when Harris made dubious claims a serious journalist could easily fact check in real time, or when Harris didn't even bother to answer her questions. Asked about the American voters 'who don't see themselves' in her economic proposals, Harris concocted one of her signature cocktails of uplifting nonsense. 'Well, if you are hardworking, if you have, uh, the dreams and the ambitions and the aspirations of what I believe you do, um, you're in my plan,' she said. 'You know, I have to tell you, I really love and am so energized by what I know to be the spirit and the character of the American people.' Harris recited familiar Democratic talking points about raising taxes on corporations as well as individuals slightly richer than the college-educated young urban professionals who earn just $395,000 a year and vote for Democrats. Ruhle attempted to press Harris on how she would raise corporate taxes if Republicans won control of the Senate, but Harris declined to give a serious answer. 'We're gonna have to raise corporate taxes,' she said. 'That's just it.' She gave a similar answer when asked about how to solve the immigration crisis. 'It needs to be fixed,' she said. 'We need a comprehensive plan.' Despite falsely claiming that 'top economists in our country,' including the CEO of Goldman Sachs, have endorsed her economic policies, Harris declined to defend the specifics of her plan to combat so-called price gouging that many economists have dismissed as unserious. The VP went on to attack Donald Trump as unserious for failing to think deeply about the issues. 'One must be serious, and have a plan, and a real plan that's not just about some talking point ending in an exclamation at a political rally,' Harris said. Ruhle asked Harris what actions the federal government could take to increase the housing supply in America, and the VP answered in characteristic fashion. First she acknowledged that 'home ownership for too many people in our country now is elusive' under the Biden administration in which she serves. There was 'too much bureaucracy' under Biden, and Harris acknowledged the need to 'reduce the red tape' that her administration has failed to address thus far. Doing what comes naturally, Harris deployed an excessive amount of words to say very little of substance about the issue. She seemed rather proud of herself for remembering to say the word 'holistically' several times. 'Some of the work is gonna be through what we do in terms of giving benefits and assistance to state and local governments around transit dollars, and looking holistically at the connection between that and housing, and looking holistically at the incentives we in the federal government can create for local and state governments to actually engage in planning in [a] holistic manner that includes prioritizing affordable housing,' Harris explained, sort of. Ruhle eventually got around to asking the question on everyone's minds. Did Harris really work at McDonald's, a detail about her life she first shared publicly in 2019 during her disastrous campaign for president in the Democratic primary? As the Free Beacon reported last August, one of the candidate's biographers hadn't even heard about the job at McDonald's, and the campaign has already walked back Harris's initial claim to have worked at the fast food chain to 'pay her way' through college. Harris reiterated her claim but declined to offer definitive evidence. 'I did fries,' she cackled. 'Yes, but I did.' The alleged job gave her 'perspective on the needs of the American people,' which is why she talks about it, Harris said. For whatever reason, though, Harris stopped mentioning the McDonald's job in her stump speeches following the Free Beacon report. 'You have laid out policy in great detail,' Ruhle said with unflappable credulity before concluding the interview with a series of softballs, such as 'When's the last time you had to make a gut decision?' (choosing her running mate, Minnesota governor Tim Walz) and 'Can we trust you?' ('Yes. I'm not perfect but I will tell you I'm always going to put the needs of the American people first.') MSNBC's Chris Hayes hosted the segment. His awkward presence on screen prior to the interview and after the commercial breaks may have alienated some undecided voters. When it was finished, Hayes congratulated Ruhle on 'a great interview' that was 'refreshingly substantive.' He didn't appear to be joking. Minutes before the interview aired, playwright Jeremy O. Harris (MFA, Yale School of Drama) ranted to MSNBC's Ari Melber about how Democrats should respect young voters who sympathize with terrorists and want the United States to place an 'arms embargo' on Israel 'at the very least.' Minutes after it aired, Ruhle said it was all good that Harris didn't give substantive answers. 'One could watch that and say, 'Well, she didn't give a clear, direct answer,'' Ruhle said. 'That's okay, because we are not talking about clear or direct issues.'

‘Dangerous error’ – Israeli officials slam potential Hezbollah ce...	Coalition ministers and local leaders vocally oppose pause in fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff Reports claiming that a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah is imminent have sparked serious backlash in Israel, as officials voice their opposition to the potential pause in the fighting. Senior Biden administration officials told Sky News that they expected an official acceptance of the proposal, which would see both parties lay down their arms for at least 21 days, 'within hours.' Several members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition responded with outrage to the proposed deal, which American officials hinted had been green-lighted by the prime minister. 'The campaign in the north should end in one scenario — crushing Hezbollah, denying its ability to harm the residents of the north,' wrote Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on social media platform X. 'The enemy must not be given time to recover from the heavy blows it received and to reorganize for the continuation of the war after 21 days,' he added. Culture Minister Miki Zohar, who is a close ally of Netanyahu, told Hebrew-language media that he hoped reports about a ceasefire were 'not true.' A pause in the military campaign against Hezbollah, Zohar said, would be 'a serious error that endangers Israel’s major security achievements in recent days.' David Azoulay, the mayor of Metula, a town adjacent to the Lebanese border where some 50 percent of the houses have been damaged by Hezbollah's near-daily rockets, missiles, and explosive drones, warned that a ceasefire would pave the way 'for the next October 7th.' Azoulay stressed that 'without decisively defeating' Hezbollah, the terror group still poses a tremendous risk to residents of the community. 'There is a time for negotiations, but this is not the time,' said Upper Galilee Regional Council’s chairman Amir Sofer. 'We must not be misled by international pressure,' he added. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said he was convening an 'urgent meeting' of his Religious Zionism party members to discuss next steps, should the reports of the ceasefire be true. Netanyahu is currently en route to New York to speak at the UN General Assembly. His office refused to comment on the reports of an emerging ceasefire.

Israel, Hezbollah on verge of truce, say US officials	Senior US officials say fighting on the Israel - Lebanon border to be halted for three weeks, with truce expected to be announced 'in coming hours,' with hopes for more expansive ceasefire. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israel and the Lebanese terror group Hezbollah are poised to halt hostilities during a three-week truce, senior American officials claimed early Thursday morning. Speaking with Sky News, senior U.S. officials said they expect a 21-day truce to be initiated between the two sides 'in the coming hours.' 'The ceasefire will be for 21 days along the blue line,' a Biden administration official said, referring to the boundary between Israel and Lebanon. 'During those 21 days, the parties will negotiate towards a potential resolution of the conflict that has been ongoing since Hezbollah launched the attack on October 8, and to reach a comprehensive agreement along the blue line that allows for residents to return to their home in both Lebanon and Israel.' Israeli Opposition Leader Yair Lapid, head of the center-left Yesh Atid faction, said he supported a temporary truce, but did not endorse the proposed three-week cessation of fighting, saying it could enable Hezbollah to regroup, after the pro-Iranian organization suffered heavy losses in Israeli attacks over the past week and a half. 'The State of Israel needs to announce this morning that it accepts the Biden-Macron proposal for a ceasefire, but only for seven days, so that it does not enable Hezbollah to rebuild its command structure and reestablish its control,' Lapid tweeted. 'We will not accept any proposal that does not include distancing Hezbollah from our northern border.' The United States, Britain, and France earlier this week called on Israel and Hezbollah to accept a three-week ceasefire. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told the United Nations Security Council that 'a diplomatic solution is indeed possible,' expressing optimism a three-week truce could be achieved. 'In recent days, we've worked with our American partners on a temporary ceasefire platform of 21 days to allow for negotiations.' Late Wednesday night Barrot claimed that significant progress had been made towards achieving the proposed truce.

Hinting Iran was behind assassination attempts, Trump threatens t...	Former President Trump suggests Iran may have been behind two attempts on his life, repeatedly threatens to blow Iran 'to smithereens.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Former President Donald Trump intimated Wednesday that the two attempts made on his life this year may have been orchestrated by the Iranian government, after the Republican 2024 presidential nominee was informed by the Biden administration of 'real and specific threats' by the Tehran regime to assassinate him. During a campaign rally in North Carolina Wednesday evening, Trump hinted that Iran may have been involved in the July 13th shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania that left him wounded in the ear, and in the September 15th, shooting at Trump's golf club in Florida. 'As you know, there have been two assassination attempts on my life that we know of, and they may or may not involve - but possibly do - Iran,' Trump said. The former president then threatened repeatedly to retaliate against Iran for any possible future assassination attempts by bombing the country 'to smithereens.' 'If I were the president, I would inform the threatening country, in this case Iran, that if you do anything to harm this person, we are going to blow your largest cities and the country itself to smithereens.' The United States, Trump continued, has been 'threatened very directly by Iran,' emphasizing the need to provide a credible threat of retaliation for any potential future attacks. 'The best way to do it is through the office of the president, that if you do any attacks on former presidents or candidates for president, your country gets blown to smithereens, as we say.' Trump made the comments a day after the Biden administration is said to have informed the former president of 'threats' by Iran to assassinate him. 'President Trump was briefed earlier today by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence regarding real and specific threats from Iran to assassinate him in an effort to destabilize and sow chaos in the United States,' Cheung said late Tuesday night. This is not the first time Trump has hinted at a possible link between the attempts on his life and the Iranian government. In July, following the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, Trump wrote on his Truth Social account that were he to be assassinated, the U.S. should wipe Iran 'off the face of the Earth.' 'If they do 'assassinate President Trump,' which is always a possibility, I hope that America obliterates Iran, wipes it off the face of the Earth - If that does not happen, American Leaders will be considered 'gutless' cowards!' On Thursday, Trump announced plans to return to Butler, Pennsylvania, the scene of the first assassination attempt, for a campaign rally, slated for October 5th.

Explosive drone hits Eilat port, wounding two	Iran-backed proxy group takes responsibility for explosion at Eilat Port caused by drone impact. By World Israel News Staff An explosive drone fired by an Iranian proxy group penetrated Israeli airspace and struck the Port of Eilat on Wednesday evening, wounding two people. The Iran-affiliated Islamic Resistance in Iraq launched two UAVs bound for Eilat, one of which was intercepted over the Red Sea by the Israeli Navy.

Two civilian employees at the port, a 68-year-old man and a 28-year-old man, were lightly wounded by shrapnel and treated at the scene by Magen David Adom paramedics. Both men did not require hospitalization, the ambulance and first-responder medical service added. Footage circulating on social media showed a large plume of smoke rising over the impact site. Hebrew-language media reported that the blast had sparked fires in the port area and near the nearby Herod's Palace hotel. Since October 2023, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq has launched numerous explosive drones at the Jewish State. Early Wednesday morning, the terror group's drone impacted an army base near the small Negev desert community of Sapir. The IDF said that the drone had caused damage to the base, but that no troops were injured. Also on Wednesday, the group attempted to attack numerous sites in the southern Golan Heights, triggering sirens in Ramat Magshimim, Avnei Eitan, and other communities. In June, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq launched a drone that exploded near Eilat, though it failed to reach its likely target of the port. The group has also claimed to have launched crise missiles at Israel, all of which have been intercepted.

US, France demand immediate Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire	Backed by European Union and Arab countries, U.S. and France demand 21-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macros released a joint statement on Wednesday evening calling for an immediate 21-day ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah terror group. 'We call on all parties, including the governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary ceasefire immediately… and to give a real chance to a diplomatic settlement,' read the statement, which was released after an emergency UN Security Council meeting on the ongoing fighting in Lebanon. Biden and Macron claimed that negotiations for an agreement 'cannot succeed amid an escalation of this conflict,' before calling for 'an immediate 21 day ceasefire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a diplomatic settlement.' The statement did not acknowledge that the U.S. has been attempting to broker a ceasefire for nearly a year, and has repeatedly failed in its efforts. 'The situation between Lebanon and Israel since October 8th, 2023, is intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation,' the text read. Notably, the statement refrained from providing important context regarding that date, including Hezbollah had launched an unprovoked attack on Israel just one day after the Hamas massacres. 'This is in nobody’s interest, neither of the people of Israel nor of the people of Lebanon,' the statement continued. 'It is time to conclude a diplomatic settlement that enables civilians on both sides of the border to return to their homes in safety.' That statement was endorsed by the European Union and several Arab countries. Israel and Lebanon are expected to announce 'within hours' if they accept the proposal, claimed a Biden administration official speaking anonymously to media. 'We have had this conversation with the parties and felt this was the right moment,' the official added. The official did not elaborate regarding which parties within Lebanon had been privy to the potential agreement. The government of Lebanon has said on numerous occasions that it cannot enforce policies on the Hezbollah terror group or influence its actions.

Democratic senators pushing bill imposing arms embargo on Israel	Bernie Sanders joined by other progressive Democrats in introducing bill which would block the sale of over $20 billion in arms to Israel. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A group of progressive Senate Democrats are pushing legislation which would impose a sweeping arms embargo on Israel, blocking tens of billions of dollars-worth of planned weapons sales to the Jewish state amid its ongoing war against the Hamas terror organization and escalating conflict with the Lebanon-based Hezbollah terrorist group. On Wednesday, Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders formally introduced a bill to the U.S. Senate aimed at blocking weapons sales to Israel, accusing the Jewish state of waging an 'immoral' and 'illegal' war against Gaza following the invasion of October 7th. 'Israel has egregiously violated' rules laid out by the 1961 Foreign Assistance Act, Sanders claimed in a statement to the press Wednesday. The senior Vermont senator and former presidential hopeful also cited the Biden administration's efforts to achieve a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 'extremist' government of intentionally preventing an agreement from being reached. 'Every time an agreement appears close, Netanyahu introduces new demands and sinks the deal,' Sanders continued. 'It is clear that Netanyahu is prolonging the war to cling to power and avoid prosecution for corruption. Meanwhile, his government has also overseen record illegal settlement expansion in the West Bank and unleashed a wave of violence there that has killed nearly 700 Palestinians, including 150 children, and several Americans over the last 11 months.' 'Sending more weapons to Netanyahu’s extremist government is unacceptable.' The Senate bill would bar the U.S. from selling a number of weapons systems to the Israeli military, blocking existing procurement orders valued at roughly $20 billion. The embargo would, if passed, bar the U.S. from selling Joint Direct Attack Munitions - a smart-bomb apparatus used to convert simple aerial munitions into guided bombs - along with tank and artillery shells, tactical ground vehicles, and F-15 fighter jets and associated parts and weapons. Two progressive Senate Democrats, including Oregon's Jeff Merkley and the junior Senator for Vermont, Peter Welch, signed on to most of the bans proposed in Sanders' Joint Resolutions of Disapproval, while declining to join his call to ban the sale of F-15s.

Pentagon says it’s not sharing intelligence or providing support ...	Pentagon: 'When it comes to Lebanon, the U.S. military has no involvement in Israel's operations.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Pentagon said it's not proving intelligence support to Israel in its operations against Hezbollah, Reuters reports. When Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh was asked if the US was providing support, including sharing intelligence, with Israel during its operations against Hezbollah, she replied, 'No, no support.' She also said it didn't appear that an Israeli ground invasion of Hezbollah was imminent. 'When it comes to Lebanon, the U.S. military has no involvement in Israel's operations,' Singh said. Nonetheless, Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said on Monday, 'In light of increased tensions in the Middle East and out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional US military personnel' to augment those already in place.' The U.S. already has considerable forces in the region, including an aircraft carrier strike group. Although not publicly criticizing the operations, US President Joe Biden is reportedly opposed to Israel's defense against Hezbollah, according to Politico. The US officials warned their Israeli counterparts on Monday that operations against Hezbollah would put a halt to a diplomatic solution, one they preferred to military strikes. On Monday, Hezbollah launched a barrage of missiles, many of which targeted cities around Haifa, Tiberias and the Galilee region. In response, Israel launched extensive strikes in Lebanon, killing dozens of Hezbollah terrorists. In a speech on Tuesday to the UN General Assembly, Joe Biden said, ''Full-scale war is not in anyone’s interest,' 'The situation has escalated…. A solution is still possible. In fact, it remains the only path to lasting security and to allow the residents of both countries to return to their homes.' In July, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the US would support Israel if a war broke out with Lebanon. 'If Israel is attacked.. we will help to help Israel defend itself. We’ve been clear about that from the very beginning, but again, we don’t want to see that happen,' Austin said. 'Israel will do what it needs to defend itself. And it’s demonstrated that you know, time and again,' Austin explained. 'Certainly that’s not a scenario that we’d like to see occur,' Austin said. Austin said, 'We remain concerned about the potential of this escalating into a full fight. And I don’t believe that a fight is inevitable.' 'I think that you know, we’d like to see things resolved in a diplomatic fashion,' he added.

During the Syrian civil war, Hezbollah perpetrated numerous atrocities as they were deployed in various areas in the country to crush Sunni resistance. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Many Syrians are celebrating Israel's operations against Hezbollah because of the terror group's role in atrocities during its civil war. During the Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, Hezbollah assisted the government of Syria's Alawite president, Bashar al-Assad, as part of the Iranian-Shia so-called 'axis of resistance.' Hezbollah perpetrated numerous atrocities as they were deployed in various areas in Syria to crush Sunni resistance. Syrians have taken to social media amid Israel's operations and are rejoicing over the Jewish State's targeted strikes in Lebanon. Syrian journalist Hadi al-Abdallah wrote, 'Even if the devil himself came and killed Hezbollah's thugs, we'd be just as happy.' He added footage of Hezbollah's attacks against Syrian civilians and wrote, 'This footage shows Hezbollah fighters attacking the city of Zabadani in Syria's Qalamoun region. Blind hatred. They attacked civilian homes and everyone in them—women, children, the elderly. All that mattered to them was that they were killing.' Al Arabiya said the strikes were a just punishment against the terror group for its 'raping women and killing children.' Another Syrian posted on social media, 'My problem with Hezbollah is that they killed my brother and my cousins. They killed our neighbor's daughter, a baby less than a year old, while she was in her mother's arms. They killed my people in Madaya. My problem with Hezbollah is that they destroyed my country.' Many social media users in Syria commented on the assassination of individual terrorists and including the death of Radwan commander Hussein Ali Ghandour. Hussein Ali Ghandour was known as the 'Butcher of Madaya' who trapped and starved Syrians and buried them alive. 'Hezbollah participated in the killing of the Syrian people in the worst ways, including sieges and starvation. All the free people and those oppressed by Iran and its militias have the right to rejoice today,' one wrote. Syrians also welcomed the news that explosion-laden beepers killed dozens and injured thousands of Hezbollah terrorists. 'The pagers exploded. What great news. We Syrians aren't used to hearing such good news,' one person wrote.

The BBC has regularly received criticism for its policy of not referring to members of organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorists. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Yariv Mozer, director of the 'We Will Dance Again' Nova music festival documentary, recounted how the BBC wouldn't allow the film to be aired unless any reference to Hamas as terrorists was edited out. The documentary, which combines interviews with survivors and actual footage, began as a project on Israeli documentary channel Hot8 in collaboration with MGM and eventually Paramount. It is being shown in the United States as a Paramount + documentary. Mozer told the Hollywood Reporter, 'Then, the BBC, the version they’ll air won’t describe Hamas as terrorists. It was a price I was willing to pay so that the British public will be able to see these atrocities and decide if this is a terrorist organization or not.' He also discussed how often broadcasters hesitated about showing the Nova festival massacre because they considered the film political. 'I was pitching this to several U.S. streaming platforms and what I was told is that they’re afraid of touching this subject matter, the 7th of October, because of concerns about the political situation,' he said. However, he insisted the film is not political but rather a testament to the victims of terrorism and a means of telling their stories. 'The film isn’t political. It’s told from the eyes of the survivors and from the eyes of Hamas. There is one truth about what happened,' he added. The BBC has regularly received criticism for its policy of not referring to members of organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorists. Not only did the BBC decline to call assassinated Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, one of the masterminds of the October 7th massacre, a terrorist, but a story on the terror leader after his death described him as 'moderate and pragmatic.' 'Despite his tough rhetoric, analysts generally saw him as moderate and pragmatic, compared to the more hardline Gaza-based leaders,' the BBC report said. In May, the then Foreign Secretary of the UK, David Cameron, was staunchly critical of the broadcasting company for declining to use the word 'terrorist' in connection with Hamas. 'If you kidnap grandmothers, kidnap babies, you rape people, you shoot children in front of their parents, what more do they need to do for the BBC to say, ‘Look, these are terrorists?’' The post BBC agreed to air Nova festival massacre documentary only if Hamas not described as 'terrorists' appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/bbc-agreed-to-air-nova-festival-massacre-documentary-only-if-hamas-not-described-as-terrorists/	2024-09-25T13:00:07-07:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/shutterstock_1162642912.png
Argentina’s Milei scorches UN for anti-Israel bias	Following the speech, Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon thanked him for supporting the Jewish state. By JNS Argentine President Javier Milei criticized the United Nations for what he said was its anti-Israeli bias during a fiery address at the General Debate of the General Assembly’s 79th session in New York on Tuesday. He called out the world body for systematically voting against the Jewish state, 'the only democracy in the Middle East, which protects liberal democracy,' adding that the United Nations has 'simultaneously shown a total inability to respond to the scourge of terrorism.' The libertarian leader also observed that 'in this same house, that purports to defend human rights, we have also included bloody dictatorships in the Human Rights Council, including Cuba and Venezuela, without reproach.' Following the speech, Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon thanked him for supporting the Jewish state. 'I was moved to hear the speech of the President of Argentina at the General Assembly.

Rare document that shows contributions of Jewish financier to Ame...	Salomon was also one of the founders and main donors to Mikveh Israel, a Philadelphia synagogue, still active today, nicknamed the 'Synagogue of the American Revolution.' By Jackie Hajdenberg, JTA After 10 years on display at Philadelphia’s Weitzman National Museum of American Jewish History, a document penned by James Madison linking Jewish financier Haym Salomon to the American Revolution is now for sale. The document, a sheet from the ledger of Madison, who later became the fourth U.S. president, showed the Virginia delegation’s expenses and receipts during the 1780 Continental Congress. It lists contributions from Salomon, a Sephardic Jewish immigrant from Poland who came to America in 1775 and is considered one of the leadingJames Madison funders of the Revolutionary War effort. The sheet containing Salomon’s name is the only known surviving page from Madison’s ledger. The page is currently owned by the Raab Collection, an international firm that specializes in the buying and selling of important historical documents. The Raab Collection has previously sold a letter from Theodore Roosevelt stating that he wanted a Jewish person at his side during his nomination for the Republican presidential ticket in 1904 and an original copy of the United States’ official recognition of the State of Israel, signed by President Harry Truman. 'Jews in early America were strong patriots and fought for freedom alongside their Christian friends and neighbors,' Nathan Raab, the collection’s president, said in a statement. 'This meant that our Founding Fathers had Jewish friends, supporters, and allies at the dawn of our nation. This document shows that vividly.' Salomon was a financial broker for merchants. A backer of the American Revolution, Salomon joined the Sons of Liberty in 1775 and was arrested the following year by the British and accused of being a spy for Gen. George Washington. He was arrested again in 1778 and sentenced to death, but reportedly bribed his jailer and escaped to Philadelphia, where he continued his work as a broker, providing loans to prominent American figures including Madison. Salomon is estimated to have given about $600,000 of his personal fortune toward the American Revolution — about $23 million in today’s dollars. He died at 44 in 1785, less than two years after the treaty ending the war was signed, and was destitute because his loans had not been repaid. Salomon’s significance went unrecognized for nearly a century and was then disputed for some time. In 1927, after the United States had celebrated its 150th birthday, New York City rejected an offer by a Jewish immigrants’ group to build a statue of Salomon in Madison Square Park, citing an assessment that he was merely a mercenary and not a true believer in the American cause. Later, infighting between Polish and German Jews in the city caused a second memorial plan to be scuttled. A memorial was finally erected in Chicago, where it had the support of a large Polish population, in the 1930s. Herald Square Monument bronze sculpture of George Washington, Robert Morris, and Haym Salomon by Lorado Taft. (Shutterstock) By the following decade, a positive narrative had solidified around Salomon. Salomon was also one of the founders and main donors to Mikveh Israel, a Philadelphia synagogue, still active today, nicknamed the 'Synagogue of the American Revolution.' There is contemporaneous evidence of Madison’s relationship with Salomon but the ledger page, which the Raab Collection has priced at $50,000, is the only document from the era showing the amount of money he loaned the nascent United States. 'I have for some time been a pensioner on the favor of Haym Salomon,' Madison wrote in a 1782 or 1783 letter to Edmund Randolph, who later became secretary of state. 'The kindness of our friend near the coffeehouse is a fund that will preserve me from extremities, but I never resort to it without great mortification, as he obstinately rejects all recompense.' Whether the document remains on public view will be the decision of the buyer, if there is one. A spokesperson for the Weitzman Museum, which is seeking to become part of the public Smithsonian network of museums, said on Friday that she was unaware of the potential sale.

Only 1% of young US voters ‘most concerned’ about Israeli-Palesti...	The data calls into question whether Democrats actually benefit from seeking to placate the anti-Israel forces within their own ranks. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner Americans aged 18-29 are overwhelmingly indifferent to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war and the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a new poll has found, casting doubt on conventional wisdom that the country’s youth are enraged over the Jewish state’s defensive military operations in Gaza. When asked which issue concerned them most, a meager 1 percent of respondents within the youngest age bracket of eligible US voters answered the 'Israel/Palestine conflict,' according to the poll by Harvard University’s Institute of Politics. In contrast, young voters expressed far more interest in domestic issues such as the economy, inflation, and abortion. The Democratic Party’s recent overtures to anti-Israel activists could potentially be wrongheaded, according to the polling data, which found that young voters are not likely to trust Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris more than Republican nominee Donald Trump to resolve the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Among voters aged 18-29, 28 percent said they 'trust' Trump on the war in Gaza and 26 percent 'trust' Harris. Harris performed far better against Trump among young voters on an array of domestic issues such as gun control, abortion, health care, and education. Though activists have insisted that embracing an arms embargo on the Jewish state will help Harris consolidate youth support ahead of Election Day in November, Harvard’s polling data paints a more complicated picture. Among young voters, 32 percent indicated they support implementing an 'arms embargo with Israel,' and 20 percent said they were opposed. A plurality, 44 percent, responded they 'don’t know' if they support blocking weapons transfers to Israel. The data calls into question whether Democrats actually benefit from seeking to placate the anti-Israel forces within their own ranks. In recent months, Harris has attempted to win over pro-Palestinian voters by adopting a more adversarial posture toward the Jewish state. The Democratic National Convention (DNC), where Harris officially became the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee, hosted a panel on 'Palestinian Human Rights' for the first time in history, in which activists accused Israel of committing a 'genocide' in Hamas-ruled Gaza. While accepting the presidential nomination, Harris vowed to end the Israel-Hamas war and secure an elusive ceasefire deal, along with a new era of 'dignity, security, freedom, and self determination' for Palestinians. Despite the extensive focus of media outlets, lawmakers, and commentators on the anti-Israel campus protests at elite universities such as Harvard, the latest polling data suggests that the typical young voter in the US shows minimal engagement with foreign affairs.

What would a ground war in Lebanon look like?	If Israel does launch a ground war, how deep into the Lebanese territory would it reach? By Anna Epshtein, TPS Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly vowed to prevent 60,000 evacuated residents of northern Israel to return to their homes, prompting escalating rocket attacks and Israeli airstrikes — all raising the likelihood of a ground invasion of Lebanon. Experts described to The Press Service of Israel different war scenarios but stressed that a ground operation could be avoided. Israel’s escalating airstrikes 'Are not preparation for a ground op, it’s a way to escape it,' Professor Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at Tel Aviv University’s Institute for National Security Studies, told TPS-IL. Israel is demonstrating its capabilities, showing it is not afraid of war in order to make Hezbollah agree to a diplomatic solution,' he said. Echoing that point, Yaakov Lappin, a research fellow at the Alma Research Institute and a military analyst for the Jewish News Syndicate told TPS-IL, ‘What is happening now is an Israeli ultimatum to Hezbollah, and also to Iran. The ultimatum says that the phase of the war of attrition is over, and now Nasrallah and Khamenei must decide – a ceasefire in the north or a full-scale war.' The Litani River If Israel does launch a ground war, how deep into the Lebanese territory would it reach? 'The Litani River is a natural border,’ said Prof. Eyal Zisser, a vice-rector of Tel Aviv university and a senior research fellow at Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern Studies. The Litani is Lebanon’s longest river, originating near the city of Baalbek, following the Beqaa Valley south before turning west and reaching the Mediterranean near the city of Tyre. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, Hezbollah is forbidden from operating south of the Litani. However, Israel may decide to go deeper into Lebanese territory. There are two possible scenarios, said Prof. Eitan Shamir, managing director of the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, who lectures on political science at Bar-Ilan University. He is also a former head of the national security doctrine department in the Israel Ministry of Strategic Affairs. 'In scenario A, the ground op will be a very limited one, where Israel does not cross the Litani river. The goal is to move Hezbollah from the border and to let the residents of the Israeli north to get back home,' Shamir said. 'This will not help against the rockets, because the rockets are launched from deeper inside Lebanon. But first, there will be no anti-tank missiles,' he added. 'And secondly, Hezbollah won’t sit on the fence, threatening the Israeli residents with an October 7-like invasion.' Scenario B, Shamir explained, would be a riskier, larger scale invasion reaching Beirut to destroy Hezbollah’s military capabilities as much as possible. 'Like we did to Hamas in Gaza,' he said. But according to Michael, once Israeli soldiers cross the Lebanese border, a 'limited operation' will not be an option. 'If a ground operation starts, it means an all-out war, and the goal of it will be to critically hurt Hezbollah, as well as to destroy the terrorist infrastructure in Lebanon,' Michael insisted. ‘It Needs to Be Done Quicker’ Most of the analysts agreed that it would take anywhere from three weeks to three months for Israel to create a security zone in Lebanon to enable norther residents to return home. 'We can’t allow another 11 months to deal with Hezbollah in the north,' Michael stressed. 'It needs to be done quicker.' Lappin said an invasion’s first phase would be 'an intensive attack on Hezbollah’s capabilities, military forces, launchers, operatives, tunnels, bunkers, command and control centers, while dealing with Hezbollah’s defense lines and territorial unit.' The second phase, said Lappin would deal with eliminating Hezbollah’s attempts to rebuild, which could take at least six months. Asked about exit strategies, the analysts agreed that Israel would need to ensure that Hezbollah is not able to cross the Litani again. 'The question is not when we leave Lebanon, but what the day after will look like,' said Zisser. According to Lappin, leaving Lebanon will depend on resolving who enforces Security Council Resolution 1701. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, he added, 'has utterly failed in enforcing this.' Said Michael, 'You don’t need to stay in the security zone forever to ensure it’s quiet there. The army can enter it whenever necessary, based on intelligence – as it does in Jenin or in Tulkarem.' But Shamir noted that Israel would have to stay in the security 'at least for a while,' adding, 'And every temporary thing tends to become permanent, so maybe Israel will stay de-facto.' Said Zisser, 'Everybody was afraid of entering Gaza, and the army fought there excellently. We know how to win. This is what the army can take with it from Gaza to Lebanon.'

‘World’s oldest Hebrew book’ unveiled at DC exhibit	According to the museum, the book includes oldest extant version of the Haggadah, the Jewish book read during the Passover Seder. By JNS The Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday unveiled what it says is the oldest Hebrew book ever discovered, dating to the 8th century and originating with Jews living in a Buddhist civilization in modern-day Afghanistan. Located just two blocks south of the National Mall, the institution titled the exhibit 'Sacred Words: Revealing the Earliest Hebrew Book.' It runs through Jan. 12, 2025. It will also make a stop in New York at the library of the Jewish Theological Seminary, according to the Jewish Telegraph Agency. The 'world's earliest Jewish book' isn't quite what it sounds like, but it's an 8th-century Afghan manuscript with a fascinating story, now on display at @museumofBible Report from @Jerusalem_Post pic.twitter.com/oH6l77Zvta &mdash; Mosaic (@mosaicmag) September 19, 2024 The ancient manuscript in book form, known as a codex, is 1,300 years old based on carbon dating, a relic of the Silk Road—an ancient trade route linking China with the West. According to the museum, the book was created by Jews living as a minority among Buddhists who ruled the Bamiyan Valley in the central highlands of what is today Afghanistan. The book measures five inches by five inches and includes Hebrew texts written by different sources—prayers, poems and, according to the museum, the oldest extant version of the Haggadah, the Jewish book read during the Passover Seder. The museum’s claims are based on the work of a team of researchers, whose findings will be published by Dutch publisher Brill in April.

Israel beginning ‘new stage’ of battle against Hezbollah, says ge...	The commander of the IDF's forces on the northern front says Israel is beginning a 'new stage' in its battle against the Hezbollah terrorist organization. By World Israel News Staff Israel's military is entering a 'new stage' in its military campaign against the Hezbollah terrorist organization in Lebanon, a senior IDF officer said yesterday. On Tuesday, Major General Ori Gordin, chief of the IDF's Northern Command, visited the field office of the army's 7th Brigade and met with the brigade's soldiers and officers during a readiness exercise near the Lebanese frontier. During his visit, Gordin held an operational assessment with brigade officers, discussing the force's preparedness for a new major operation on the northern front aimed at restoring security to the Galilee and enabling the roughly 70,000 evacuees to return home, an IDF spokesperson said. Gordin said the IDF was at the cusp of a 'new stage' in the conflict with Hezbollah, following major escalations between Israel and Hezbollah. 'We are beginning a new stage in the battle, and we are in the midst of Operation Northern Arrows,' Gordin said. 'We have entered a new phase of the campaign and we are now in the midst of Operation Northern Arrows.' 'The operation began with a significant blow to Hezbollah's capabilities, focusing on their firepower capabilities, and a very significant hit on the organization's commanders and operatives.' 'In light of this, we need to change the security situation, and we must be fully prepared for maneuvers and action.' On Monday and Tuesday, Israeli warplanes pounded hundreds of Hezbollah positions across southern and eastern Lebanon, targeting buildings - including private homes - used to store missiles and rockets. According to the Lebanese health ministry, more than 570 people were killed in the airstrikes, with over 1,600 others injured. On Friday, the IDF bombed a Beirut gathering of members of the Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force, killing sixteen terrorists, including two senior Radwan officers. Last Tuesday and Wednesday, thousands of Hezbollah operatives were injured and dozens killed after pagers and radios issued by the terrorist group simultaneously exploded in three apparent Israeli attacks.

Kibbutz hit in rocket attack, leaving man seriously injured	Two men injured, one of them seriously, after rocket directly hits kibbutz in northwestern Israel near the Lebanese border. By World Israel News Staff Two men were injured in a Hezbollah rocket attack on northern Israel Wednesday afternoon. The strike occurred in Kibbutz Sa'ar in the northwestern Galilee outside of the city of Nahariya, near the Lebanese frontier at just after 1:30 p.m. A rocket fired by Hezbollah terrorists operating out of southern Lebanon scored a direct hit on the kibbutz, spreading shrapnel which injured two men, both of whom have been identified as construction workers. One of the victims, a 35-year-old man, was seriously injured in the attack, while the second, a 52-year-old man, is listed in moderate condition. Emergency first responders from Magen David Adom (MDA) and United Hatzalah were dispatched to the scene to treat the two victims before evacuating them to the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya for further treatment. United Hatzalah volunteer EMTs Dror Nir, Doron Almog, and Radi Hadad, who responded to the attack, relayed from the scene: 'There was a direct hit to a building undergoing renovations.' 'We provided initial treatment at the scene to two construction workers - a 35-year-old man in serious condition and a 52-year-old man in moderate condition. Both suffered shrapnel injuries. Members of United Hatzalah's Psychotrauma and Crisis Response Unit provided assistance to several people who suffered from emotional shock.' According to a statement by Magen David Adom, the seriously injured victim suffered shrapnel wounds to his upper torso, while the second victim was wounded by shrapnel in his lower body. The rocket attack comes just hours after Hezbollah terrorists launched a ballistic missile towards the Tel Aviv metropolitan area Wednesday morning, the first attempt by Hezbollah to hit the center of the country since fighting broke out last October. The missile, which was shot down by Israel's defense network, was intended to hit Mossad headquarters, Hezbollah claimed.

Israel’s population tops 10 million	Ahead of Jewish new year's, Israel's population estimated at just over 10 million, rising 118,000 over in 2023, with 183,000 new babies born. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The population of Israel is estimated to have topped 10 million people this year, based on data released by the government bureau of statistics. On Wednesday, the Central Bureau of Statistics published data on the population of Israel, ahead of the upcoming Rosh Hashanah holiday, marking the Jewish new year's. According to the report, at the end of 2023, Israel's total population numbered 9,915,000, with an annual growth rate of 1.6%, down from 2.2% the year before. Israel's growth rate was fueled primarily by natural growth, with some 183,000 babies born in Israel during 2023, compared to approximately 46,000 total immigrants to Israel, and a net negative migration balance. Some 55,300 people emigrated from Israel in 2023, while 27,800 Israelis moved back. A total of roughly 55,000 people died during 2023. Based on Israel's growth rate in 2023, the country is estimated to have topped 10 million earlier this year. Broken down by demographic groups, 77.0% of Israel's population was in the 'Jewish and others' category at the end of 2023 with 7,632,000 people, compared to 20.8% in the Arab sector, with 2,067,000 people. In addition, Israel at the end of 2023 was home to 216,000 foreign nationals who do not carry Israeli citizenship. By September 2024, the number of citizens had risen from less than 9.7 million to nearly 9.8 million, with the figure for the total number of residents rising to just over 10 million once foreign nationals are included. Nearly half (43.5%) of Israeli Jews identified themselves religiously as 'not-religious, secular,' compared to 11.3% who said they are ultra-Orthodox, 12.5% who categorized themselves as 'religious,' 13.0% who defined themselves as 'religious-traditional,' and 18.9% who described themselves as 'traditional, not-so-religious.' During 2023, 51,643 couples were married, while 15,196 couples got divorced. There were a total of 2,920,300 households across Israel at the end of 2023, with an average of 3.19 people per household. Of those, 2,297,400 were defined as nuclear family households.

Israel pushing Middle East towards ‘all-out war’ – Arab countries	Egypt, Jordan, and Iraq blame Israel for current tensions, do not condemn Hamas or Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff Three Arab countries released a statement blaming Israel for rising tensions in the region, ignoring the previous eleven months of Hezbollah's near-daily attacks on the Jewish State. The statement, from the foreign ministries of Egypt, Jordan, and Iraq, also refrained from mentioning the October 7th Hamas massacres, which triggered the current conflict. The officials, who released the statement from the UN General Assembly in New York, said that restoring stability to the Middle East begins with stopping 'the Israeli aggression on Gaza.' Reining in Israel is the only way to halt the 'dangerous escalation underway,' they charged, while failing to denounce the Hamas and Hezbollah terror groups. The Jewish State is entirely to blame for the current tensions in the Middle East, which 'will have serious consequences on the entire region,' they said. 'Israel is pushing the entire region into an all-out war,' the foreign ministers stressed. The statement also demanded that the UN security council and international actors to 'to bear their responsibilities to stop the war.' Jordan and Egypt have peace treaties with Israel, but their political leaders often make public statements that are extremely hostile towards Israel. Earlier in September, three Israelis were murdered by a Jordanian terrorist at the Allenby Border Crossing, which connects the Hashemite Kingdom with Palestinian Authority-administered territory in Judea and Samaria. The terrorist was hailed as a national hero in Jordan. 'Lebanon is at the brink. The people of Lebanon, the people of Israel, and the people of the world, cannot afford Lebanon to become another Gaza,' UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said. Guterres ignored the fact that Hezbollah has been bombarding northern Israeli communities with missiles, rockets, and explosive drones for nearly a year, and did not provide any context for the current fighting in Lebanon.

US grants Qatar visa-free travel despite terror ties	This decision raises some eyebrows, as Qatar has also hosted leaders from Hamas and the Taliban, yet now enjoys privileges typically reserved for longstanding U.S. allies. By The Associated Press The Gulf nation of Qatar on Tuesday became just the second Muslim-majority country to be admitted into a program that allows its citizens to travel to the United States without first obtaining a U.S. visa. The departments of State and Homeland Security jointly announced that Qatar had met stringent eligibility requirements to join the visa waiver program. Those requirements include a low visa refusal rate, a low rate of visa overstays and a demand of reciprocal treatment of American travelers, who are already allowed to visit Qatar without a visa for up to 30 days. 'Qatar has been an exceptional partner for the United States, and our strategic relationship has only grown stronger over the past few years,' the departments said in a statement. 'This is further evidence of our strategic partnership and our shared commitment to security and stability.' Qatar, which has played a key role in trying to negotiate a cease-fire deal in Gaza and was an instrumental U.S. partner before and during the American withdrawal from Afghanistan, is the 42nd country to be admitted to the program. This decision raises some eyebrows, as Qatar has also hosted leaders from Hamas and the Taliban, yet now enjoys privileges typically reserved for longstanding U.S. allies. Most countries whose citizens can visit the U.S. without a visa are longstanding allies in Europe and Asia. The only other Muslim-majority country in the program is the tiny Southeast Asian nation of Brunei. Although Qatar’s population is just over 3 million people, only a small percentage of those — about 320,000 — are actually Qataris who would be eligible for the program if they hold valid passports. The vast majority of people who live in Qatar are foreign workers and other expatriates who do not hold Qatari passports. The program allows citizens of qualifying nations to enter the U.S. for business or tourism without a visa for up to 90 days, although they must still obtain approval through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization, or ESTA, which is done online and doesn’t require an in-person interview as visa applications do. After Oct. 1, U.S. citizens will be allowed to stay in Qatar without a visa for 90 days.

US asks Israel to protect its citizens in Lebanon during evacuati...	The American embassy in Beirut has urged U.S. citizens to 'depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available.' By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The Biden administration has asked Israel to protect American citizens in Lebanon during a possible evacuation process, Axios reported Monday. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin raised the issue of installing a 'deconfliction' mechanism with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, on Saturday, so that the IDF doesn’t accidentally hit Americans who are trying to leave the country. Axios reported that 'while there has been no decision to move forward with an evacuation, the Israelis are receptive to the U.S. concerns.' In commenting on the phone call, Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement that 'Secretary Austin emphasized his concern for the safety and security of U.S. citizens in the region.' The call came after the IDF began massive airstrikes on Hezbollah targets, which have yet to stop, and the terrorists have responded with hundreds of rocket and missile attacks on Israel that have reached deeper into the country than ever before. The exchange of aerial assaults is the worst since the 2006 Second Lebanon War, when the U.S. did evacuate its citizens due to Israel’s ground invasion, which was limited to the southern part of the country. Currently, Israel’s air force is going much further, pummeling Hezbollah forces in its neighborhoods in Beirut and strongholds in the Bekaa Valley, some 60 miles into Lebanon. The IDF has also successfully eliminated many of the Iranian terror proxy’s most senior commanders in the last week, including assassinating the head of Hezbollah’s missile and rocket array, Ibrahim Qubaisi, on Tuesday in Beirut. The danger of an all-out war breaking out is thus clear, and the State Department is telling U.S. citizens that they should use any means available to get out, for their own safety. 'Due to the unpredictable nature of ongoing conflict between Hezbollah and Israel and recent explosions throughout Lebanon, including Beirut, the US Embassy urges US citizens to depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available,' it said in a new travel advisory Monday. The U.S. already has considerable forces in the region, including an aircraft carrier strike group. On Monday Ryder also announced, without giving any more details, that 'In light of increased tensions in the Middle East and out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional US military personnel' to augment those already in place. In August, after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran credited to Israel and the IDF’s admitted hit on Hezbollah chief of staff Fuad Shukr, tensions had also risen to the extent that the U.S. embassy in Beirut 'encouraged' its citizens in Lebanon to 'book any ticket available to them.'

Biden opposed to Israeli attacks on Hezbollah – report	Differing with Israel, the Biden administration still believes a diplomatic solution is the best way to de-escalate from possibility of regional war. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The Biden administration has quietly opposed Israel’s recent attacks on Hezbollah, despite not airing any sharp public criticism, Politico reported Wednesday. American officials had warned their Israeli counterparts before Israel’s massive aerial assault on Hezbollah targets began Saturday would put a halt to diplomatic moves that they still believed was the best way to de-escalate a situation in which Hezbollah has launched some 9,000 missiles, rockets and UAVs at Israeli communities over the last year and some 60,000 Israelis are still evacuated from their border homes as a result. The fear, as expressed by President Joe Biden in his speech Tuesday at the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, is that the military escalation could quickly lead to a region-wide conflict, something the U.S. has no desire for. 'Full-scale war is not in anyone’s interest,' Biden said in his speech. 'The situation has escalated&#8230;. A solution is still possible. In fact, it remains the only path to lasting security and to allow the residents of both countries to return to their homes.' According to the report, Jerusalem is not against a diplomatic solution to the crisis, having agreed for months to limit its retaliations for the indiscriminate aerial assaults on its sovereignty in order to give negotiations a chance. The decision was finally made to differ with the Americans as to how to achieve a resolution. The report said that during his trip to Jerusalem last week, the Israelis told U.S. Special Envoy Amos Hochstein that 'Hezbollah had shown no signs of wanting to engage in serious diplomatic talks and that Israel was set to ramp up the pressure on the group.' Politico also cited an Israeli official who said that in their discussions on the issue, the Biden administration was told that now was the time for the Jewish state to 'escalate [in order] to de-escalate.' The report said that American opinions are divided on the efficacy of the military pressure, with several defense and intelligence officials saying they don’t think it will drive Hezbollah to the negotiating table, but rather impel the Iranian terror proxy to up the ante. Despite the IDF recently saying it has been successful in destroying tens of thousands of Hezbollah rockets and much of its launch capabilities, the group still has many tens of thousands of projectiles in its arsenal, although its supply of the exponentially more dangerous precision-guided and cruise missiles is much more limited. Hezbollah also has the proven capability of carrying out terror attacks against Israeli and American targets around the world. In what may be a sign of hope that regional war is not yet at hand, Iran has signaled that it doesn’t want to engage Israel militarily right now. According to an Axios report, Tehran recently rejected a plea from its chief proxy to attack Israel directly, telling Hezbollah officials that 'the timing isn’t right.'

Hezbollah’s use of civilian homes sparks evacuation crisis and se...	In one incident in Beirut’s Christian suburb of Ain El Remmaneh, the Lebanese army was forced to step in when residents refused to accommodate Shiites from the south. By Baruch Yedid, TPS Sectarian tensions in Lebanon are soaring as tens of thousands of southern Lebanese residents flee their homes amid Israeli airstrikes on Hezbollah. There have been numerous instances of Sunni and Christian residents in safer areas of the country refusing to host or rent displaced people from predominantly Shi’ite areas. Many suspect that members of Hezbollah are among the evacuees who would make their villages targets for Israeli intelligence. In one incident in Beirut’s Christian suburb of Ain El Remmaneh, the Lebanese army was forced to step in when residents refused to accommodate Shiites from the south. It was only after the army’s intervention that the displaced Shi’ites were evicted from homes they tried to take over. Hezbollah fears that the mass evacuation from the south will facilitate Israel’s creation of a buffer zone in the region. Israeli officials have been calling for Hezbollah to be disarmed and removed from southern Lebanon — all areas south of the Litani River — in compliance with UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War. On Monday, Israel called on residents of southern Lebanon and the Beqaa Valley to flee homes where the Iran-backed Hezbollah stored missiles. The IDF disclosed that Hezbollah was preparing to launch a cruise missile hidden inside a civilian home. The army released footage, including of the airstrike that destroyed it. Sarit Zahavi, president and founder of the Alma Research Center, told The Press Service of Israel in August that Hezbollah doctrine makes extensive use of civilian homes. 'Hezbollah stores their weapons everywhere, both between villages and within the villages themselves,' she said. 'By and large, every third house in the Shi’ite villages of south Lebanon is used in some way by Hezbollah for military purposes, be it weapons storage, the entrance of a tunnel, or a launchpad for shooting rockets at Israel,' she explained. More than 60,000 residents of northern Israel were forced to evacuate their homes when Hezbollah began launching rockets and drones in October. The Iran-backed terror group has launched more than 9,000 rockets and drones, killing 26 civilians and 22 soldiers on the Israeli side. Hezbollah leaders have said they will continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes, which Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah reiterated in a speech on Thursday night.

Swing state voters trust Trump over Harris on foreign affairs: Po...	The poll, conducted from Aug. 15 to Aug. 22, was released the morning of President Joe Biden’s final address to the United Nations General Assembly. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon Voters in six swing states trust former president Donald Trump more than Vice President Kamala Harris on key global policy concerns including the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, according to new polling from the Institute for Global Affairs. When asked who would more strongly defend U.S. interests abroad, respondents favored Trump over Harris 56 percent to 44 percent in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, according to the poll. Trump holds an even bigger lead—58 percent to 42 percent—in the same states on more specific foreign policy questions, such as who is more likely to end the wars in Gaza and Ukraine as well as who is more likely to respond effectively if China takes action against Taiwan. The poll, conducted from Aug. 15 to Aug. 22, was released the morning of President Joe Biden’s final address to the United Nations General Assembly. From its botched 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal to the ongoing war in Ukraine to rapidly escalating tensions in the Middle East, the Biden-Harris administration has led 'the worst decline in world order and the largest decline in U.S. influence, since the 1930s,' the Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote on Monday. 'It is a far more dangerous world than Mr. Biden inherited, and far less congenial for U.S. interests, human freedom and democracy,' the Journal’s editorial board continued. 'Authoritarians have advanced on his watch in every part of the world—Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, and even the Americas.' The conflicts could spell trouble for Harris, who has struggled to distance herself from her boss's weak record and define her own foreign policy platform. Trump, however, has been bombarding swing state voters with foreign policy messaging for months, which could be responsible for his advantage, Mark Hannah, a senior fellow at the Institute for Global Affairs, told Axios. 'We've seen that independents in battleground states tend to prefer a less interventionist foreign policy. So the fact that voters see Trump as more likely to end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza might strengthen his popularity,' Hannah added.

Ballistic missile attack on Tel Aviv	Lebanese terror group attacked Mossad headquarters in central Israel with Qader 1 ballistic missile. By World Israel News Staff A ballistic missile was launched from Lebanon towards the Tel Aviv metropolitan area in central Israel Wednesday morning, the Israeli military announced. Early Wednesday morning, a surface-to-surface ballistic missile launch was detected in the southern Lebanese town of Nafakhiyeh, an IDF spokesperson said. At 6:30 a.m., warning sirens sounded across the coastal plain of central Israel, from Tel Aviv to Ramat Gan and Netanya, marking the first time since the outbreak of fighting with Hezbollah last October that a projectile has been launched from Lebanon towards the central coast. The IDF said Wednesday that the incoming ballistic missile was successfully intercepted and destroyed by the David's Sling air defense system. No injuries or damage were reported in the attack. Hezbollah later claimed responsibility for the attack, identifying the missile used as a version of the Ghadr-1, an Iranian-made medium-range missile originally designed for naval warfare. The Iranian-backed Shi'ite terror group said it had targeted Mossad headquarters near Tel Aviv, as a reprisal for last week's pager and radio attacks which targeted Hezbollah operatives. Dozens were killed and thousands injured last Tuesday and Wednesday when pagers and hand-held radios distributed by Hezbollah to its members simultaneously detonated in three separate attacks. Wednesday morning's missile attack came several hours after the Israeli Air Force bombed a Hezbollah weapons cache south of Beirut. Shortly after the missile launch, the IDF said, Israeli warplanes struck the launching pad used in the attack.

‘Leave now ‘ – 700 UK troops to aid Lebanon evacuation	It's important we be clear - now is the time to leave,' says UK Prime Minister, addressing Britons in Lebanon. By World Israel News Staff The UK government announced that 700 British army soldiers will be deployed to Cyprus to assist in the immediate evacuation of British citizens from Lebanon. Cyprus, an island nation in the Mediterranean, is a 30-minute flight from Lebanon, and can also be reached by boat in some 12 hours. There are some 10,000 British nationals thought to currently be present in Lebanon. Military personnel will be supported by Border Force and Foreign Office officials, the government added in a statement. The Royal Air Force is also dispatching aircraft and helicopters to the region. 'It is important that we be really, really clear: now is the time for [UK citizens] to leave' Lebanon, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. Starmer added that the government is 'ramping up the contingency plans' for repatriating British citizens from Lebanon 'in light of the escalation' between Hezbollah and Israel, he added. 'Events in the past hours and days have demonstrated how volatile this situation is, which is why our message is clear, British nationals should leave now,' said Defense Secretary John Healey. 'We continue to urge all sides to step back from conflict to prevent further tragic loss of life. Our government is ensuring all preparations are in place to support British nationals should the situation deteriorate. I want to thank the British personnel who are deploying in the region for their commitment and professionalism.' Following the Hezbollah beeper explosions last week, Foreign Secretary David Lammy urged UK citizens to depart the country.

‘Maybe later’ – Iran ignores Hezbollah plea to attack Israel: Rep...	Iran claims 'timing isn't right' for attack on Israel, as IDF pummels Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff Iran recently rebuffed a request from its proxy group Hezbollah to attack Israel, as fighting intensified between the terror group and the Israeli military. In recent days, Israel has struck thousands of weapons warehouses and other military assets, killing more than 500 people - most of them believed to be affiliated with Hezbollah. The Israeli air force has repeatedly bombed Dahiyeh, a Beirut suburb and Hezbollah stronghold, assassinating high-profile Hezbollah figures and humiliating the terror group. According to an Axios report, a battered Hezbollah recently turned to its patron and asked Iran to directly attack Israel. Israeli intelligence officials told Axios that Iran had refused the request. Iranian officials reportedly told their Hezbollah contacts that 'the timing isn't right' for an attack on Israel, because Iranian President Mahmoud Pezeshkian is currently in New York for the UN General Assembly. Publicly, Pezeshkian pledged that Iran would continue to support Hezbolah in its war against Israel. 'Hezbollah cannot stand alone against a country that is being defended and supported and supplied by Western countries, by European countries and the United States,' he told CNN. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Pezeshkian claimed that Israel is the source of instability in the Middle East and that Iran is not interested in war. 'We don’t want to fight,' Pezeshkian claimed. 'It’s Israel that wants to drag everyone into war and destabilize the region. … They are dragging us to a point where we do not wish to go.' Israel’s intensification of its military campaign against the Hezbollah terror group, in which Iran has invested untold funds, training, and arms, appears to sparked panic among Iran’s leadership. However, Tehran likely wishes to avoid directly attacking Israel, because doing so would give the IDF legitimacy to bomb Iran's nuclear sites.

Iran plotting to assassinate Trump	Top Trump campaign official says the former president was briefed by Biden administration about 'real and specific threats' of an assassination plot by Iran, part of larger campaign to 'sow chaos.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Former President Donald Trump is the target of an assassination plot directed by the Iranian government, a senior Trump 2024 campaign official said late Tuesday night. In a statement to the press, Trump Campaign Communications Director Steven Cheung said the former president and 2024 Republican presidential nominee had been briefed earlier on Tuesday by the Biden administration about what Cheung described as 'real and specific threats' by the regime in Tehran to assassinate Trump. 'President Trump was briefed earlier today by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence regarding real and specific threats from Iran to assassinate him in an effort to destabilize and sow chaos in the United States,' Cheung said. 'Intelligence officials have identified that these continued and coordinated attacks have heightened in the past few months, and law enforcement officials across all agencies are working to ensure President Trump is protected and the election is free from interference.' 'Make no mistake, the terror regime in Iran loves the weakness of Kamala Harris, and is terrified of the strength and resolve of President Trump. He will let nothing stop him or get in his way to fight for the American people and to Make America Great Again.'

Netanyahu says Israel’s military will blow up Lebanese homes that...	Netanyahu to Lebanese civilians; 'Free yourselves from Hezbollah's grip; free yourselves from Nasrallah's grip, for your own benefit.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Monday, when Israel made 1,600 strikes in Lebanon against terror targets, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Lebanese civilians to evacuate sensitive areas and declared, 'We will continue to strike Hezbollah.' Netanyahu's remarks came Tuesday after a security briefing with the head of Military Intelligence, Major General Shlomi Binder, and from the commander of the SIGINT force Unit 8200, Brigadier General Yossi Sari'el. Netanyahu began by praising the military's operations against Hezbollah and said, 'I must say that I am deeply impressed by the work that has been done, and I am no less impressed by the work that will be done. We will continue to strike Hezbollah.' Emphasizing a statement, Netanyahu made on Monday to Lebanese civilians; the premier said, 'Our war is not with you; our war is with Hezbollah. Nasrallah is leading you to the brink of the abyss.' He once again warned civilians to evacuate crucial areas and to leave their homes if they are hiding weapons because Israel's military will not hesitate to strike if ammunition, military supplies, or terrorists are embedded in civilian homes. 'I told you yesterday to evacuate the homes where he has placed a missile in your living room and a rocket in your garage. Whoever has a missile in their living room and a rocket in their garage will not have a home,' he said. He urged Lebanese civilians to break free from Hezbollah; ''Free yourselves from Hezbollah's grip; free yourselves from Nasrallah's grip, for your own benefit.' Although some world leaders are calling for 'restraint' as Israel defends itself against Hezbollah's escalation of the conflict on Sunday and firing hundreds of rockets deep into Israel, Netanyahu defended Israel's right to make preemptive strikes against clear terror targets. 'For those who still do not understand, I want to clarify Israel's policy - we do not wait for the threat; we preempt it. Anywhere, in any arena, at any time. We eliminate senior officials, eliminate terrorists, eliminate missiles - and we are far from finished.'

Israeli fighter jets hit 1,600 Hezbollah terror targets in Lebano...	The IDF instructed civilians to move away from homes where Hezbollah has stored munitions. By Joshua Marks, JNS The Israeli Air Force struck over 1,600 Hezbollah targets in Southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley over the past 24 hours as part of 'Operation Northern Arrows,' according to the Israeli military. Among the targets hit was a terror cell that launched 20 rockets in three barrages at the Afula and HaAmakim areas in northern Israel overnight Monday. The launchers used in those attacks were also destroyed. Also overnight, Israel Defense Forces artillery and tanks struck additional Hezbollah targets in the area of Ayta ash Shab and Ramyeh in Southern Lebanon. The overnight strikes came after Monday’s massive Israeli aerial offensive, during which fighter jets hit rocket launchers, command posts and structures, including civilian residences, used by Hezbollah to store munitions. According to the Lebanese Health Ministry, 558 people were killed and 1,835 were wounded in the Israeli attacks. The ministry’s figures did not distinguish between combatants and noncombatants. Thousands of Lebanese have evacuated from the south as Israel’s offensive against Hezbollah terror targets intensifies after the IDF instructed civilians to move away from homes where Hezbollah has stored munitions. In addition to Southern Lebanon, the IAF continued striking Hezbollah terror targets in the Bekaa Valley deep inside Lebanese territory on Tuesday morning. Hezbollah continued to launch rocket attacks on Tuesday, firing more than 100 rockets at northern Israel and causing multiple injuries, including a 25-year-old man moderately wounded by shrapnel during a barrage towards the Mount Carmel area. Sirens sounded in the northern Israeli coastal city of Nahariya and surrounding areas. Two rockets from Lebanon fell into the sea, according to the IDF. There were no injuries or damage. Rocket alerts were also heard in communities in the Galilee region and near the large port city of Haifa. Rocket fire was reported in Afula and Nazareth. A 58-year-old woman was lightly injured by shrapnel in the Druze village of Yarka in the Western Galilee, according to the Magen David Adom emergency service. She was transported to the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya along with a 61-year-old man suffering from anxiety. They were both sitting in a car. MDA teams were also treating several people injured on their way to shelters and additional anxiety cases. Also, a supermarket was reportedly damaged by shrapnel in the Arab town of Tamra in the Lower Galilee and several fires were reported following a heavy barrage in the area of Kiryat Shmona, including blazes at municipal warehouses. The evacuated border town has been continuously targeted over the past year. Sirens were also activated in Tel Hai, Kfar Giladi, Metula, and other towns in the region. Since Friday, Hezbollah has launched hundreds of rockets at Israel, forcing over a million people to run to bomb shelters. On Monday, Iran’s Lebanese terror proxy fired deeper into Israeli territory than it had since joining the war in support of Hamas on Oct. 8, including at Haifa and northern Samaria. Hezbollah has fired more than 8,800 rockets, missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) toward Israel since Oct. 8. The strikes have forced over 60,000 Israelis to evacuate from northern communities, severely impacting daily life in the region. Jerusalem has ramped up its rhetoric and escalated attacks on Hezbollah since recently adding the return of residents to the north as an official war goal. The government on Monday evening approved the declaration of a 'special emergency situation' countrywide, granting authorities more powers to ensure the safety of the civilian population. The declaration will expire after 48 hours unless extended by Cabinet ministers. There were no specific changes to the Home Front Command instructions for areas of Israel outside of the northern region. However, there were changes to some border area communities, with no in-person educational activities in the Megido area, Yokneam Illit, Daliyat al-Karmel and Isfiya. The IDF Home Front Command had already cancelled school for communities from Haifa northwards. Meanwhile, foreign airlines continue to suspend flights to and from Ben Gurion Airport. Wizz Air, British Airways and Azerbaijan Airlines canceled flights on Tuesday. The Lufthansa Group, which includes Lufthansa Airlines, SWISS, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines and Eurowings, announced on Monday that it was extending its suspension of flights to Ben Gurion Airport until Oct. 14. On Monday night, the IDF provided video and photographic documentation of how Hezbollah stores munitions inside the homes of civilians in Southern Lebanon, including images of a long-range missile on a hydraulic system in the attic of a home in the village of Houmine al-Tahta. 'It is ready to launch from an opening in the roof. Under the attic, on the first floor, a Lebanese family lives, serving as a human shield,' IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a press conference. 'This is an immediate and real threat to Israeli civilians, and we have an obligation to remove it,' he added. Also, the IDF released video footage of an airstrike against a Lebanese home where Hezbollah had stored munitions. The video shows a rocket flying out of the building after the strike and hitting an adjacent house.

‘I know Matan is alive with 10 others underground,’ hostage’s mot...	Einav Zangauker: 'In my opinion, there are no more than 30 to 35 hostages still alive.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Einav Zangauker, the mother of hostage Matan Zangauker, said in an interview with Reshet Bet on Tuesday morning that she believes her son is alive and is being held underground with ten other hostages. Zangauker said she receives regular updates, and according to the most recent one, she concludes her son is still alive and is confined underground, most likely in Gaza's extensive tunnels. 'I know that Matan is held with less than 10 other hostages that are also alive, and the fear is great,' she said in the interview. She continued, 'Therefore, it is an urgent task to save those still alive.' Zangauker also said it is imperative to bring the bodies of the fallen soldiers and slain hostages back to Israel so their families can have closure. She expressed concern that with the conflict escalating in the north, the hostages and their families will be forgotten. Acknowledging there are no easy answers, she said, 'We as hostage families would like to see a diplomatic solution to the conflict on the northern front so we can focus on returning the hostages.' Then again, she added that Israelis in the north can't be expected to tolerate constant attacks without a strong military response. Zangauker expressed skepticism concerning Israeli Prime Minister's comments earlier in the week that 50 of the 97 hostage held in Gaza are still alive. She told Army radio Monday, 'The prime minister is lying. We know, the families, that the number is far smaller than the number cited by the prime minister.' She added that the families of hostages receive intelligence and updates from the military and this information, she concludes that 'in my opinion, there are no more than 30 to 35 hostage still alive.' 'There are no [significant] contacts between the Israeli team and the mediators,' she said, and 'Hamas is not involved.' The Americans, preoccupied with the upcoming elections, basically 'given up' their efforts, at least for the time being.

Beirut strike: IDF kills head of Hezbollah’s missile array	The top terrorist also planned the October 2000 kidnapping of IDF Staff Sgts. Benny Avraham, Adi Avitan and Omar Souad from the Mount Dov border area. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS The Israel Defense Forces on Tuesday afternoon carried out a second precision strike in Beirut’s Dahiyeh district in as many days, killing Ibrahim Qubaisi, who heads Hezbollah’s missile and rocket array. The strike came less than 24 hours after the attempted assassination of Hezbollah’s No. 3 terrorist commander, Ali Karaki, in the same area. Qubaisi joined Hezbollah in the 1980s and held a series of key positions in the terror organization, according to the IDF. As part of his role, he 'was responsible for the planning and execution of many terrorist actions against the IDF forces and Israeli citizens,' the army said. 'Qubaisi commanded Hezbollah’s various missile units, including the precision missile units. Over the years and during the [current] war, he was responsible for launches towards the Israeli home front. Qubaisi was a central source of knowledge in the field of missiles and was close to the senior military leadership of Hezbollah,' the IDF continued. The top terrorist also planned the October 2000 kidnapping of IDF Staff Sgts. Benny Avraham, Adi Avitan and Omar Souad from the Mount Dov border area. The soldiers were killed by their captors either during or shortly after their abduction, and their remains were only returned to Israel four years later as part of a terrorist release deal with Hezbollah. According to the Israeli military, Qubaisi was surrounded by 'other key commanders in Hezbollah’s missile and rocket array' when the attack was launched. At least five other people were killed and several more were injured in the airstrike, according to initial Lebanese reports. ברייקינג: צה'ל תקף באופן ממוקד ברובע הדחייה בביירות pic.twitter.com/jke51sMFfx &mdash; איתי בלומנטל Itay Blumental (@ItayBlumental) September 24, 2024 Aftermath of strike in BEIRUT pic.twitter.com/NRArOU6oZJ &mdash; Open Source Intel (@Osint613) September 24, 2024 Following the strike in Beirut, Hezbollah launched a massive rocket barrage at Israel’s north, triggering air-raid sirens, including in the Upper Galilee city of Safed. No injuries were reported in the attacks. Israel’s Channel 12 said that more than 100 projectiles were launched at the Jewish state within one hour, with the Golan Regional Council telling residents to stay near bomb shelters and avoid public gatherings.

On Monday night, Israeli Air Force jets targeted Karaki, Hezbollah’s highest-ranking remaining commander following Friday’s targeted killing of Ibrahim Aqil. Karaki commands Hezbollah’s southern front, which is responsible for the terror army’s cross-border attacks on Israel. In an official statement issued three hours after the strike, Hezbollah claimed that the top terrorist was still alive and 'moved to a safe place.' Unnamed Israeli officials told Israel Hayom on Tuesday that Karaki survived the strike, saying that the use of smaller bombs with the goal of minimizing civilian casualties contributed to the operation’s failure. On Friday, the IDF took credit for a targeted airstrike in the Dahiyeh neighborhood that killed more than a dozen senior Hezbollah terrorist officials, including Aqil, who was also wanted by the United States over his involvement in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Beirut. On July 30, Israeli Air Force fighter jets carried out a targeted killing in south Beirut of Hezbollah’s No. 2 'military' commander, Fuad Shukr. Hezbollah has attacked Israel nearly daily since Oct. 8, 2023, firing thousands of rockets, missiles and drones. The attacks have killed more than 40 people and caused widespread damage. Tens of thousands of Israeli civilians remain internally displaced due to the violence. Throughout the day on Tuesday, the Israeli Air Force struck over 1,600 Hezbollah terror targets in Southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley as part of 'Operation Northern Arrows,' according to the Israeli military. Jerusalem has escalated attacks on Hezbollah since adding the return of evacuated Israeli civilians to the north as an official war goal on Sept. 17.

Biden not giving up on Gaza ceasefire, hostages, White House says	Biden will huddle with world leaders gathered in New York to work on a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza. By The Algemeiner and Reuters US President Joe Biden is determined to bring about a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas while also seeking to de-escalate tensions on Israel’s border with Lebanon, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday. 'He absolutely hasn’t given up,' Sullivan said in an interview with MSNBC hours before Biden addresses the UN General Assembly for the last time as president. Biden will huddle with world leaders gathered in New York to work on a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza and avert an all-out war in the Middle East, Sullivan said. He acknowledged challenges in getting both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar across the line and said Hamas and Sinwar in particular 'don’t want to do a deal.' 'But we’re determined to keep at it,' Sullivan said. The United States has worked to contain tensions in the region since Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre across southern Israel in which the Palestinian terror group murdered 1,200 people and kidnapped 251 hostages. Israel responded with an ongoing military campaign in neighboring Hamas-ruled Gaza aimed at freeing the hostages and dismantling Hamas’s military and governing capabilities. The simmering conflict with Hezbollah at Israel’s northern border has spiked on and off since Oct. 7 and it is spiking now, he said. 'But we have averted it in those previous spikes, and I believe that we can still find a path forward to get de-escalation between Israel and across that northern border between Israel and Lebanon and bring about a diplomatic solution that allows people to return to their home,' Sullivan said.

Voters agree: Calling Trump a ‘threat to democracy’ prompts polit...	The poll found that even over a third of 'liberal' respondents agreed that calling Trump a 'threat to democracy' led to the attempts on his life. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon The majority of voters agree that 'irresponsible rhetoric,' such as calling a political adversary a 'threat to democracy,' has led to the recent assassination attempts on former president Donald Trump. The poll, conducted by the Senate Opportunity Fund, found that 57 percent of voters somewhat or strongly agree that 'labeling a political opponent a threat to democracy is irresponsible rhetoric which leads to political violence, like assassination attempts.' The poll comes just a week after authorities arrested the suspect in the second attempt on Trump's life in less than two months. Republicans, including Trump, have blamed the multiple assassination attempts against the former president on Democrats' claims that Trump is a 'threat to democracy.' Most voters align with Republicans' views on the issue, the poll found. The poll found that even over a third of 'liberal' respondents agreed that calling Trump a 'threat to democracy' led to the attempts on his life. Half of 'moderate' voters and 79 percent of 'conservative' respondents agreed this kind of language leads to political violence. The most recent would-be assassin, Ryan Wesley Routh, often reiterated Democrats' claim that Trump is an 'existential threat' to American 'democracy.' 'Democracy is on the ballot' this year, and 'we cannot lose,' Routh posted on social media, echoing the anti-Trump rhetoric used by Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden. On Sept. 15, Routh pushed the muzzle of an AK-47 through the perimeter of Trump's West Palm Beach golf course in Florida, hoping to take the former president's life. Before he got a shot off, a Secret Service agent saw Routh's barrel and fired multiple shots, forcing Routh to flee the course. He was soon arrested. Democrats and the mainstream media, however, have not only downplayed Routh's assassination attempt but also blamed Trump for inciting violence against himself. Former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile, for example, authored a piece in The Hill titled 'Trump's Rhetoric Has Caused Violence, Not Democrats Calling Him a Threat to Democracy,' while ABC News published the headline 'Trump Blames Democrats for Heated Environment Despite His Own Inflammatory Rhetoric.' Even after two assassination attempts on Trump, Democrats have continued to call their chief political opponent a 'threat to democracy.' Just one day after the second assassination attempt, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton told MSNBC that Trump is a 'danger to our country and the world.' Similarly, on Monday morning, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough said that Trump was absolutely a 'threat to democracy.' The first attempt on Trump's life was on July 13 at a Pennsylvania rally. The gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, killed one attendee and wounded three others, including Trump, before being killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper.

Police break up Hamas money-laundering ring in Jerusalem	During the raid, law enforcement confiscated over 200,000 shekels in cash, checks worth one million shekels, and various electronics. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli authorities arrested five suspected Hamas operatives on the outskirts of Jerusalem in an operation targeting individuals involved in financing and laundering funds for the terror group, the Israeli Police said on Tuesday. The primary suspect, believed to be a key figure in Hamas, was arrested in the Shuafat refugee camp in eastern Jerusalem. Authorities allege that the suspect and others have been using a chain of supermarkets in the Shuafat and Anata refugee camps to funnel money into Hamas’s activities. During the raid, law enforcement confiscated over 200,000 shekels ($53,000) in cash, checks worth one million shekels ($265,000), numerous cell phones, documents, DVRs, construction plans, tablets, and computer drives, along with several bags of business receipts linked to the laundering of terrorist funds. All five suspects, along with the seized materials, have been handed over to the Jerusalem Police and the Tax Authority for further investigation. Since October 7, Israel has arrested around 5,261 Palestinian terror suspects in Judea and Samaria, of whom 2,070 of whom are associated with Hamas.

In General Assembly speech, UN head takes shots at Israel	The U.N. head also questioned how the world could 'accept a one-state future that includes such a large number of Palestinians without any freedom, rights or dignity?' By Mike Wagenheim, JNS António Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations, opened the U.N. General Assembly’s high-level debate week by repeatedly criticizing the Jewish state. Complaining of a 'world of impunity,' Guterres assessed that 'a growing number of governments and others feel entitled to a ‘get out of jail free’ card.' 'They can trample international law. They can violate the United Nations charter,' he said on Tuesday. 'They can turn a blind eye to international human rights conventions or the decisions of international courts.' 'We see this age of impunity everywhere,' including in the Middle East, Guterres added. The secretary-general, who is largely persona non grata to Israeli diplomats due to what pro-Israel critics largely view as his justification of the Hamas’s terrorist attacks, murder and atrocities in southern Israel on Oct. 7 and his repeated critiques of Israeli military operations in response to attacks from Hamas, Hezbollah and others. He has said that Hamas’s attack didn’t occur 'in a vacuum.' Guterres said that Gaza 'is a nonstop nightmare that threatens to take the entire region with it,' adding, 'look no further than Lebanon. We must do everything in our power to prevent Lebanon from becoming another Gaza.' 'Nothing can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people. The speed and scale of the killing and destruction in Gaza are unlike anything in my years as secretary-general,' he added. 'More than 200 of our own staff have been killed, many with their families.' The U.N. head did not mention that internationally-designated terror groups control both Lebanon and Gaza, and that those groups attacked Israel, launching the nearly year-long conflict in the region. 'Nothing can justify the abhorrent acts of terror committed by Hamas on Oct. 7 or the taking of hostages—both of which I have repeatedly condemned,' Guterres said. Guterres called on the international community to 'mobilize for an immediate ceasefire, the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and the beginning of an irreversible process towards a two-state solution.' 'For those who go on undermining that goal with more settlements, more land grabs, more incitement—I ask: What is the alternative?' he said on Tuesday. The U.N. head also questioned how the world could 'accept a one-state future that includes such a large number of Palestinians without any freedom, rights or dignity?' In his speech, Guterres did not mention Israeli security concerns.

‘What a Joke!’ – Netanyahu rips ICC prosecutor for meeting Erdoga...	Only at the UN' - International Criminal Court chief prosecutor meets with Turkey's president and chief of the Palestinian Authority, drawing sharp criticism from Israeli premier facing arrest warrants from the ICC. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Monday. While Khan has already formally issued a request for international arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, accusing both of war crimes in the ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza, Erdogan called on Khan to take additional steps against Israel, accusing the Jewish state of plotting to 'add new massacres to their list.' 'It is extremely important for the genocide case filed against Israel at the International Criminal Court to be concluded and for the perpetrators of genocide to receive the punishment they deserve,' Erdogan told Khan, according to a statement issued by Erdogan's office. In a separate meeting, Abbas called on Khan to 'expedite investigations into Israeli war crimes,' and urged steps be taken to prevent future 'crimes against the Palestinian people.' On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to Abbas and Erdogan, while taking aim at Khan for meeting with the two leaders. 'Under the category of 'This can only happen at the UN',' Netanyahu said, highlighting Abbas' past comments questioning the scope and nature of the Holocaust, and Turkish policies vis-a-vis the Kurdish minority. 'ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan met yesterday with two great champions of human rights – Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, renowned for slaughtering Kurdish civilians and jailing journalists, and with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who denies the Holocaust and pays terrorists who murder Jews.' 'Rather than issuing arrest warrants for war crimes against Erdogan and Abbas, Khan remains obsessed with casting as war criminals Israel's democratically elected leaders, who are pursuing a just war with just means against genocidal terrorists.

‘Israel is a climate justice issue’ – Greta Thunberg dons keffiye...	Swedish climate activist calls for boycott of Chevron over its ties to Israel, while accusing Israel of 'genocide' in the Gaza Strip. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg took aim at Israel at a recent protest in Stockholm, while advocating in favor of the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, calling for the boycott of an energy company over its ties to the Jewish state. On Saturday, Thunberg took part in an anti-Israel rally in the Swedish capital, joining some 5,000 protesters who gathered to condemn Israel's ongoing war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. 'Israel’s genocide in Palestine is outrageous,' Thunberg told the Anadolu Agency. 'It is sad to see how people do not understand and realise what is happening in Palestine and go on with their lives without caring.' Two days later, Thunberg tweeted photos from the event, including one of her addressing the rally while wearing a keffiyeh. 'We stand united across our struggles to fight together for a common goal; a world that puts people and planet before profit,' Thunberg tweeted. 'One group’s fight is everyone’s fight, because no one is free until everyone is free. As climate justice activists we also fight for justice and liberation for all oppressed and colonised peoples.' Early Tuesday morning, Thunberg took to Instagram to promote an anti-Israel boycott of the Chevron corporation, over the oil giant's financial ties to the Jewish state. 'The oil giant is also fueling Israel's genocide in Palestine. As Israel bombs hospitals, homes, and schools in Gaza, Chevron supplies them with energy,' Thunberg said in a video statement. 'Ending Israel's genocide in Gaza and Israeli apartheid is a climate justice issue. Israel is destroying Palestinian lives, but also destroying Palestinian lands and resources.' Thunberg also posted a statement condemning the U.S. and the Biden administration over Israel's pager bombings against Hezbollah terrorists, and recent air campaign against Hezbollah missile depots in southern Lebanon and the Beqaa Valley. 'Instead of ending genocide after 12 months, we have the beginning of war in Lebanon,' the statement reads. 'All enabled by the Biden Administration, which emboldened state-sponsored Israeli terror and warmongering without pause.' 'Has Harris condemned the pager terror attack, or today's murder of 500 civilians? Let me be clear, the US and ISrael see Palestinians and Lebanese as one in the same: Arabs worth of mass slaughter.'

Israeli man injured in Megiddo rocket attack	Hezbollah unleashes massive rocket barrage on Galilee, sparking fires across northern Israel which torched homes and warehouses. By World Israel News Staff Hezbollah terrorists operating in southern Lebanon fired roughly 100 rockets at the Galilee in northern Israel Tuesday morning and early afternoon, sparking multiple blazes and leaving at least one person injured. Beginning before dawn Tuesday and continuing into the afternoon, volleys of rockets were fired towards Israel, with the IDF confirming at least 100 launches. At approximately 1:10 p.m., shrapnel from a Hezbollah rocket injured a 19-year-old man in the northern town of Megiddo. Emergency first responders from Magen David Adom (MDA) and United Hatzalah were dispatched to the scene to treat the victim before evacuating him to Haifa's Rambam Medical Center. 'We provided initial medical assistance at the scene to a young man, approximately 25 years old, who was moderately injured by shrapnel,' Itzhak Miro and Avraham Vazana, United Hatzalah EMTs, reported from the scene. 'He was then evacuated to Rambam Hospital in Haifa.' Rocket attacks earlier in the day on the northeastern Israeli city of Kiryat Shemona sparked fires which damaged a number of buildings. Six firefighting teams have been deployed to the city, according to the Israel Fire and Rescue Authority. Some 50 rockets were launched towards Kiryat Shemona Tuesday, with one projectile striking the local cemetery, causing heavy damage, Kan reported. Multiple fires have also been reported elsewhere across northern Israel, with some damage reported to private homes. Rockets also struck the western Galilee Tuesday morning, including one direct hit on Route 70, near the Arab-Israeli town of Tamra. The rocket strike did not cause injuries, but nearly struck passing vehicles, dashboard camera footage from the incident revealed. IDF forces responded with airstrikes against Hezbollah positions in the northern Beqaa Valley Tuesday, with airstrikes reported in Beirut Tuesday afternoon. According to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, a total of 558 people were killed and 1,835 injured in Israeli airstrikes on Hezbollah positions since Monday morning.

IDF airstrikes ‘set Hezbollah back 20 years,’ says US official	We are the closest we've been to a regional war,' warns American official, as conflict between Israel and Hezbollah continues to escalate, with IDF airstrikes sending the terrorist group 'back 20 years.' By World Israel News Staff A massive wave of Israeli airstrikes on Hezbollah missile and rocket depots across southern and eastern Lebanon Monday caused massive damage to the Iranian-backed Lebanese terror group, an American official said, setting its operations back decades. Speaking with CNN in a report published Tuesday, a U.S. official said that a string of recent Israeli actions against Hezbollah have seriously degraded the terror group's operational capabilities. Last Tuesday and Wednesday, thousands of hand-held radios and pagers issued by Hezbollah to its operatives detonated simultaneously, killing dozens and injuring thousands. On Friday, an Israeli airstrike on a Hezbollah position in Beirut killed 16 members of the terror group's elite Radwan Force, including two of the unit's senior commanders. Yesterday, following a string of massive rocket attacks on northern Israel, Israel Air Force jets bombed hundreds of Hezbollah missile and rocket depots - many of them concealed in private homes - along the Israeli frontier in southern Lebanon and in eastern Lebanon's Beqaa Valley. Lebanon's health ministry claimed that at least 492 died in the airstrikes, with 1,645 reported injured. 'They’ve probably been taken 20 years backwards,' a second U.S. official said after Monday's aerial campaign. Since its 2006 war with Israel, Hezbollah amassed a significant arsenal of rockets and missiles, ranging from shoulder-fired anti-tank missiles to cruise missiles. Prior to the outbreak of fighting on the Israel-Lebanon frontier on October 8th, Hamas is estimated to possess some 150,000 rockets and missiles in its stockpiles. Hezbollah rocket, missile, and mortar attacks on Israeli border towns have forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents of northern Israel, with some 70,000 Israeli citizens still internally displaced.

Arab-Israeli pharmacist outed as ISIS terrorist	A young customer had noticed the man wearing a ring bearing the Muslim terror group’s symbol. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A Petah Tikva pharmacist was arrested Monday on suspicion of supporting the Islamic State in Syria (ISIS) terror organization after a vigilant customer saw him wearing a ring with the group’s symbol. The young man had come in the evening to the pharmacy, located in one of the city’s malls, to get some medicine, and saw the ring as he handed the man the prescription. He managed to take a picture of the man’s hand with the ring and as soon as he left the pharmacy he called the police hotline and reported the incident. Upon receiving the report, the police told Maariv, officers 'arrived at the scene and detained the suspect.' The paper quoted 'officials exposed to the details' of the case as saying that 'Either this is a very serious case in which a supporter of the terrorist organization was walking around under the noses of the residents, or it is an insensitive pharmacist who these days allows himself to come [to work] with a ring with the terrorist organization's symbol prominently displayed.' 'We have hostages whose families are from Petah Tikva and [even] from the neighborhood in question,' they continued. 'We have soldiers who were murdered and those who fell in battle, and wearing such a ring is an event that requires an investigation.' The authorities are asking the court Tuesday to extend the suspect’s remand in custody so that their investigation can proceed effectively. The man is a resident of eastern Jerusalem, where police last month arrested a 16-year-old on suspicion of trying to recruit students in his high school to become members of ISIS in order to carry out terror attacks. The police investigation found that the teen had spread the extremist Muslims’ ideology and often glorified the group’s terrorist acts on social media. His classmates told the authorities that he had expressed a desire to carry out a car bomb attack himself, and threatened them that if they did not join ISIS, its men would kill them one day. Among the ISIS-related contents on the physics and electronics major’s phone, the police discovered a video on how to make bombs and commit sabotage, formulas for preparing explosives, and Islamic religious rulings favoring suicide attacks and the murder of innocents. After he was questioned, a prosecutor's statement was filed against him in preparation for an indictment.

Biden officials describe president’s ‘shouting matches’ with Neta...	Biden is taking aim at Netanyahu as administration officials express 'exasperation' over the Israeli government. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Joe Biden has acknowledged that he is unlikely to secure a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip between Israel and the Hamas terrorist organization, and administration officials are increasingly open about the president venting his frustrations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, The New York Times reported Monday. According to the report, which cited aides to the president, Biden is 'beginning to acknowledge' that with less than four months left in office, time is running out on a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. With few prospects for a breakthrough in the near future and amid growing fears of a second full-scale war in the region - this time between Israel and the Lebanese Hezbollah terror group - Biden is said to be coming to grips with the fact that a deal is unlikely to be reached while he remains in office. Biden is taking aim at Netanyahu as administration officials express 'exasperation' over the Israeli government. According to the report, members of Biden's national security team do little to hide their frustrations regarding the Israeli premier, and openly discuss the president's 'shouting matches' with Netanyahu during telephone calls. U.S. envoy to the Middle East Dennis Ross, who was responsible for brokering interim agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Authority during the 1990s, told the Times that Netanyahu and Biden have fundamentally opposing views of Israel's goals in the war, with Netanyahu pursuing the removal of existential threats to the Jewish state, while Biden is seeking a path towards a comprehensive peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The two leaders, Ross continued, never agreed on the purpose or extent of the war against Hamas - much less the current conflict with Hezbollah - thus making the current friction inevitable.

Civilian effort to equip Israeli soldiers for war with Hezbollah ...	Hezbollah has its own drones, which fly into Israeli territory to drop bombs on Israeli positions, so soldiers are asking for special protective netting. By Asaf Elia-Shalev, JTA As tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have shot up to new highs, Israeli soldiers anticipating being deployed to the north are increasingly turning for help to the civilian donation efforts that have kept them stocked in Gaza. Adi Vaxman, who heads the U.S.-based donation effort called Operation Israel, fields requests from individual soldiers and says demand has spiked in tandem with security developments involving Hezbollah. 'With the situation up north, the demand has tripled in the last few days,' Vaxman told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency last week. She said the total requests by soldiers in September are on pace to reach double the roughly 15,000 requests from August. Civilian volunteers have been working for weeks to better understand the unique needs posed by the intensifying conflict in the north, which is taking place across a different terrain than Gaza and against Hezbollah, a group with more advanced capabilities than Hamas. After conversations with senior officers involved in military logistics, another civilian effort called the Discretionary Fund for Israel, which is led by Shalem College administrator Daniel Polisar, launched a $8 million fundraising drive earlier this month. The dollar figure comes from a calculation of what gear is needed — and which kind of items the military has recently procured. Drones, for example, were one of the most requested items from donors for many months, but the military is now distributing them in large numbers, according to Polisar. In a fundraising email, Polisar warned his donor pool that an escalation in the war was imminent and soldiers were not sufficiently supplied for what’s expected. 'I’m writing at one of the most difficult times Israel has faced since Hamas’s atrocities of October 7 precipitated a multi-front war,' Polisar wrote. 'The evolving situation has created grave new risks for the brave men and women defending our country.' Since the appeal went out, Polisar’s prediction has come much closer to reality. The Israeli cabinet has declared as a war aim the return of 60,000 Israelis displaced from their homes by Hezbollah’s rockets. Hundreds of pagers have exploded across Lebanon in attacks targeting Hezbollah operatives. Israel assassinated a top Hezbollah commander in an airstrike. Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah declared Israel has 'crossed a red line.' And the Israeli military has redeployed a large fighting division from Gaza to the northern border. Over the weekend, tensions escalated sharply. Israel battered Hezbollah positions inside Lebanon, including in Beirut far from the border and of a meeting of Hezbollah commanders who Israel said were planning an Oct. 7-style invasion of the north. Meanwhile, Hezbollah sent dozens of rockets deep into Israeli territory, injuring several and sparking fires in populated areas. Whether the conflict evolves to include ground fighting remains to be seen. But Israeli soldiers worrying that any effort to secure the north would necessarily include an invasion have continued to request basic combat items like helmets and ceramic plates for body armor as they have done in Gaza — and donors have begun adding other kinds of equipment as well. The size of the battlefield in the north is larger than Gaza, which has been characterized by close-quarter urban combat. Drones must fly over longer ranges, which calls for different types of batteries and special antennas, according to Vaxman. Hezbollah has its own drones, which fly into Israeli territory to drop bombs on Israeli positions, so soldiers are asking for special protective netting. Weather is also a factor as winter months approach and temperatures drop, especially at high elevations. The uneven topography of northern Israel and southern Lebanon also makes it more difficult for the Israeli army to detect threats, which is why soldiers ask for special surveillance cameras. Jews in the Diaspora who have been asked repeatedly since Hamas’s attack last October to help buy soldiers combat gear have largely responded with an open checkbook, but they have also expressed alarm about the implication that the military cannot supply itself. Polisar received a wave of questions reflecting such concerns after his fundraising email and then addressed them in a follow-up message. His email noted the immense scale of hostilities Israel is facing and praised military leaders for ramping up their purchasing to meet billions of dollars in equipment needs. 'Even so, there are certain critical areas in which the IDF has not fully succeeded in rendering our soldiers as safe and effective as possible in the short time horizons dictated by war-time conditions,' Polisar wrote. 'In a perfect world, the Israeli army would take care of everything, my team and I would not need to raise funds and purchase gear, and I would not be asking you to consider once again stretching your limited resources.' In another possible sign of how serious the need for more equipment is, earlier efforts by the military to stop the flow of donations to individual units appear to have receded. In July, the commander of Israel’s ground forces, Tamir Yadai, warned his troops about rules against accepting donations and threatened heightened enforcement. He also called for officers to inventory all donated supplies and confiscate equipment that doesn’t match IDF standards. Yadai’s order had a chilling effect on donors, who feared that their contributions would go to waste, according to multiple fundraising groups. Since then, however, Yadai has resigned from the military. And officers are not taking action to stop donations, according to the civilian aid groups.

‘Israel must defeat Hezbollah, or face disaster’ – Ex-IDF col.	IDF has 'once-in-a-generation' opportunity to permanently defeat Hezbollah, says former colonel. By World Israel News Staff An ex-senior Israeli military official urged the IDF to leverage the 'rare opportunity' to permanently defeat the Hezbollah terror group, calling on the political echelon to make 'brave decisions' during the ongoing campaign. Israel must take decisive action to clear the threat on its northern border once and for all, retired Colonel Kobi Marom told Radio 103FM on Tuesday morning. Marom poured cold water on the possibility of increasing military pressure forcing Hezbollah to negotiate an end to the conflict. Hezbollah will 'not sit down for negotiations,' he said, pointing to nearly a year of talks that failed to produce a diplomatic solution. Instead, Marom said, Israel should focus on finally achieving a decisive victory over Hezbollah. 'There is a rare, once-in-a-generation opportunity here; it’s time for brave decisions,' Marom stressed. If Israel does not 'take advantage' of the current momentum, it would be a 'disaster for generations to come,' he continued. He warned that if the defense and political establishment does not choose the route of strengthening the intensity of the campaign against Hezbollah, 'the escalation cycles will continue, and we will enter a war of attrition - which is what the Iranians want.' According to Marom, an IDF ground invasion of southern Lebanon is necessary to drive Hezbollah north of the Litani River and ensure that displaced residents of Israel's north can safely return home. Conquering Lebanon south of the Litani 'is a mission the IDF can accomplish within two weeks,' he said. 'This is an opportunity we cannot miss.' Marom's message to the IDF, urging the military to deal a crushing blow to Hezbollah, comes hours after a Biden administration official said that Washington is floating various ceasefire proposals aimed at ending the conflict. The official would not elaborate on the details of the proposals, nor would eh explain how the differed from the agreement pushed by the U.S. for nearly a year, to no avail.

US sends additional forces to Middle East as Israel-Hezbollah ten...	Those US capabilities include the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group, fighter aircraft and air defenses. By The Algemiener and Reuters The United States is sending a small number of additional troops to the Middle East given escalating tensions between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, the Pentagon said on Monday, declining to specify the precise number or mission of the deployed forces. 'Out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional US military personnel forward to augment our forces that are already in the region,' Air Force Major General Patrick Ryder, a Pentagon spokesperson, told reporters. After almost a year of war against Hamas in Gaza, Israel is shifting its focus to its northern frontier, where Hezbollah, a powerful Iran-backed terrorist organization, has been firing rockets into Israel in support of its ally Hamas. Israel‘s military on Monday struck Hezbollah in Lebanon’s south, eastern Bekaa valley, and northern region near Syria in its most widespread strikes. An Israeli strike on Monday evening on the southern suburbs of Lebanon’s capital targeted senior Hezbollah leader Ali Karaki, the head of the southern front, a security source told Reuters. US President Joe Biden’s administration has been seeking to contain the conflict to Gaza and has repeatedly called for the Israel-Lebanon border crisis to be resolved through diplomacy. That call for diplomacy has been underscored by US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in daily calls with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Experts question whether Iran would stay on the sidelines if Lebanon’s Hezbollah’s existence were threatened and say US troops could also find themselves targeted throughout the Middle East, if a regional war breaks out. In their call on Sunday, Austin suggested that no outside actors should intervene in the conflict. 'The secretary made clear that the United States remains postured to protect US forces and personnel and determined to deter any regional actors from exploiting the situation or expanding the conflict,' the Pentagon said in a statement. Those US capabilities include the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group, fighter aircraft and air defenses. 'We have more capability in the region today than we did on April 14th when Iran conducted its drone and missile attack against Israel,' Ryder said. 'So all of those forces combined provide us with the options to be able to protect our forces should they be attacked.' Ryder referred to Iran’s attack by more than 300 missiles and drones, which caused only modest damage inside Israel thanks to air defense interceptions from the United States, Britain, and other allies in the region. The April 14 strikes were Iran’s first-ever direct attack on Israel.

Prosecutors: Would-be killer plotted Trump assassination for mont...	Routh, who has a lengthy criminal record and exclusively donated to Democrats, regularly expressed anti-Trump sentiments, which were on full display in his letters. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon The man charged with the most recent assassination attempt on Donald Trump started plotting the attempt months before he pointed a rifle at the former president, according to federal prosecutors' Monday filing, which includes a chilling letter written by the suspect. Prosecutors said the suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, left a box—which contained ammunition, four phones, and letters—with an anonymous witness 'several months' before his September assassination attempt. After learning of the assassination attempt, the witness opened the box, according to the filing. 'Dear World, this was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I am so sorry I failed you,' one letter reads. 'I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster.' The new filing revealed that Routh traveled from the Greensboro, N.C., area to West Palm Beach, Fla., on Aug. 14. Routh also staked out Trump's golf course and Mar-a-Lago estate for nearly a month in the lead-up to the incident, his phone record showed. On Sept. 15, Routh pushed the muzzle of an AK-47 through the perimeter of Trump's West Palm Beach golf course in Florida, hoping to take the former president's life. Before he got a shot off, a Secret Service agent saw Routh's barrel and fired multiple shots, forcing Routh to flee the course. He was soon arrested on Interstate 95. Expecting his assassination attempt to be unsuccessful, Routh in the letter offers a $150,000 reward to 'whomever can complete the job.' Routh's attempt came just two months after Thomas Matthew Crooks attempted to assassinate Trump at a Pennsylvania rally. Crooks killed one attendee and wounded three others, including Trump, before being killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper. Routh, who has a lengthy criminal record and exclusively donated to Democrats, regularly expressed anti-Trump sentiments, which were on full display in his letters. 'Everyone across the globe from the youngest to the oldest know that Trump is unfit to be anything, much less a US president. U.S. presidents must at bare minimum embody the moral fabric that is America and be kind, caring and selfless and always stand for humanity,' one letter reads. Routh allegedly camped at the golf course for around 12 hours before the Secret Service spotted him, prompting Martin County sheriff William Snyder to question whether Routh was part of a 'conspiracy' to kill the former president. 'I think that's the question the FBI, the Secret Service are laser-focused on today. Is this guy part of a conspiracy? Is he a lone gunman?' Snyder said. 'If he's part of a conspiracy, then this whole thing really takes on a very ominous tone.' Routh was charged last week with the possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and the possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.

By World Israel News Staff Iran's president claimed that Israel's military campaign against Hezbollah is forcing Tehran into the conflict, failing to acknowledge how the regime's proxies in the region have systematically attacked Israel for months. Speaking on Monday to reporters ahead of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, President Mahmoud Pezeshkian claimed that Iran is a peace-loving nation that seeks to stabilize the Middle East - despite the fact that Tehran has repeatedly threatened to destroy Israel. Blaming Israel for the ongoing fighting, Pezeshkian charged that Israel's attacks on Hezbollah were a 'trap' designed to draw Iran into the war. 'We don’t want to fight,' Pezeshkian said. 'It’s Israel that wants to drag everyone into war and destabilize the region. … They are dragging us to a point where we do not wish to go.' Pezeshkian's comments are directly contradicted by many public statements by other high-level Iranian officials in recent months, who have threatened on numerous occasions to annihilate Israel. Since October 7th, many of Iran's regional proxies have launched unprovoked attacks on Israel. Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran and based in Lebanon, has been firing near-daily missile, rocket, and explosive drone salvos at Israel for more than 11 months. The Yemen-based Houthis, also an Iranian proxy group, fired several explosive drones and ballistic missiles at Israel. Various Shia militia groups controlled by Iran, based in Syria and Iraq, have also launched drones towards Israel. Israel's intensification of its military campaign against the Hezbollah terror group, in which Iran has invested untold funds, training, and arms, appears to sparked panic among Iran's leadership. 'Israel’s crimes, enabled by the U.S., are crystal clear for the world to witness. Do not look away,' Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote on social media platform X on Monday. 'This brutal and criminal disregard for human life cannot be permitted to continue. Iran will NOT remain indifferent. We stand with the people of Lebanon and Palestine,' he added.

Top Palestinian official says Israel to experience a ‘New Oct. 7’...	Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, which provides the Islamist terror groups with weapons, funding, and training. By Algemeiner Staff A senior Palestinian official has boasted that Israel will soon suffer another large-scale massacre similar to the Palestinian terror group Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel — except this time the onslaught will come from southern Lebanon rather than Gaza. The warning from Hassan Khraisheh — deputy speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, the legislature of the Palestinian Authority (PA) — came as tensions continued to skyrocket between Israel and Hezbollah, the powerful terrorist organization based in Lebanon. 'We are living a new Oct. 7, but this time it is not in Gaza, but rather in the north of occupied Palestine, starting from southern Lebanon,' Khraisheh told Quds Press, according to a translation of his comments. The Islamic Republic News Agency, the official news agency of Iran, also reported on Khraisheh’s comments and translated them a bit differently: 'On Oct. 7, we will experience a new one, but this time, not in Gaza, but in the north of occupied Palestine and south of Lebanon.' Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, which provides the Islamist terror groups with weapons, funding, and training. It is unclear whether Khraisheh was claiming that another major attack would occur on Oct. 7 or more generally that another onslaught against the Jewish state was coming. Thousands of Hamas-led Palestinian terrorists invaded southern Israel from neighboring Gaza on Oct. 7 of last year, murdering 1,200 people, injuring thousands more, and kidnapping over 250 hostages. The terrorists perpetrated rampant sexual violence, including torture and gang-rape, against the Israeli people during the attack, the largest single-day massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. Israel responded with an ongoing military campaign in Hamas-ruled Gaza aimed at freeing the hostages and dismantling Hamas’s military and governing capabilities. Hamas leaders have vowed to carry out attacks against Israel similar to the Oct. 7 invasion 'again and again.' In recent months, however, as Israel has imposed devastating losses on Hamas in Gaza to the south, it has increasingly turned more of its attention northward to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Hezbollah has fired barrages of rockets, missiles, and drones at northern Israel almost daily following the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas. Since then, both sides have been exchanging fire constantly while avoiding a major escalation as war rages in Gaza. More than 60,000 Israelis have been forced to evacuate their homes in northern Israel and flee to other parts of the country amid the unrelenting attacks from Hezbollah, which wields significant political and military influence across Lebanon. Israeli leaders have said they seek a diplomatic resolution to the conflict with Hezbollah along the border with Lebanon but are prepared to use large-scale military force if needed to ensure all citizens can safely return to their homes. Last week, Israel’s security cabinet expanded its war goals to include returning the displaced Israelis from the north. On Monday morning, Israeli fighter jets conducted massive airstrikes on Hezbollah targets across Lebanon to prevent the Iranian-backed terror army from firing rockets across the border. The strikes came after Hezbollah launched more than 100 rockets and drones at northern Israel in waves of attacks overnight on Saturday and Sunday morning. The Hezbollah barrage was in response to the thousands of pagers and walke-talkies used by Hezbollah terrorists that exploded in Lebanon last week. While Israel neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the sophisticated operation, Iran and Hezbollah blamed the Jewish state and vowed revenge. Several experts and media reports said Israeli intelligence was behind the blasts. According to Khraisheh, the Hezbollah strikes were a sign that Iran’s so-called 'axis of resistance' of terrorist proxies across the Middle East was in a winning position. '[It was] a response that confirms beyond any doubt that the axis of resistance is still strong,' he said. 'Those fighting with Palestine are our brothers in Yemen, Iraq, and Lebanon, and this expresses the unity of the arenas that confuse the occupation [Israel].' Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Yemen’s Houthi terrorist group, which is also supported by Tehran, have all expressed support for Hamas and Hezbollah and in some cases launched attacks against Israel. Khraisheh also claimed that Israel was 'deepening its occupation' of the West Bank, urging all Palestinians to be united in opposing the Jewish state. The PA, which exercises limited self-governance over the West Bank, is a rival of Hamas. Still, PA officials have been regularly rationalizing Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre across southern Israel and in some cases even denying it took place or falsely claiming Israeli forces carried out the onslaught.

Mayor of Muslim-majority US city officially endorses Trump for Pr...	On Facebook, Ghalib posted a photo of himself standing alongside Trump, claiming that the pair met in person just days before. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner The mayor of the only Muslim-majority city in the United States endorsed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump over the weekend, potentially boosting the former US president’s chances of winning the critical swing state of Michigan this November. Amer Ghalib, mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan, released a statement on Facebook on Sunday, praising Trump’s character and urging his residents to vote for the former president on Election Day. Ghalib also posted a photo of himself standing alongside Trump, claiming that the pair met in person just days before. 'I believe he is the right choice for this critical time,' Ghalib said of Trump, praising him as a 'man of principles.' 'I’ll not regret my decision no matter what the outcome would be, and I’m ready to face the consequences,' Ghalib added. The mayor told The Detroit News that Trump was already familiar with him prior to the sit-down. 'He knew a lot about me before the meeting,' Ghalib told the outlet. 'We talked about various topics including the debates, the polls updates, the statistics of votes in Michigan and Wayne County, the Arab American concerns and the Yemeni Americans in particular. We also talked about the situation in Yemen,' the mayor continued. The mayor added that during their private 20-minute meeting, Trump asked for an endorsement from him as he seeks to win the presidency and defeat Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. 'He asked me if I can endorse him and ask people to vote for him? I told him: ‘I’m here to talk about that and how we can make it happen,'' the mayor said. 'I then handed him an official letter with some details about our concerns and to invite him to come to Hamtramck if possible.' Ghalib did not specify whether he and Trump discussed the ongoing war in Gaza or placing an arms embargo on Israel, a demand that anti-Israel activists have made of Harris. Ghalib has a history of making racist and antisemitic statements online. He liked comments on social media that referred to African Americans as 'animalistic' and 'subhuman.' He also condemned Arab leaders as being covert 'Jews.' In a 2021 Facebook post defending Trump’s role in the Jan. 6 Capitol riots, Ghalib told his Arab American followers to compare Trump with 'the leaders of your countries, who are willing to become Jewish if the president is Jewish and to abandon all national and religious reproach if ordered by the directorial dictator!' Nonetheless, the mayor’s endorsement could prove to be an asset for Trump as he continues to spar with Harris for votes in the hotly-contested swing state of Michigan. Moreover, many Arab American activists have expressed disillusionment and anger with Harris over her refusal to adopt hardline anti-Israel stances. The 'Uncommitted movement' — a coalition of Democratic delegates opposed to the Jewish state’s defensive military operations in Gaza — issued a statement last week announcing that the group would not endorse a candidate for the 2024 presidential election. The group criticized Harris for not agreeing to withhold weapons from Israel and slammed the Democratic National Convention (DNC) for not allowing a Palestinian-American speaker on the main-stage of the event. On the polling front, Harris has also struggled to coalesce the Arab American vote, an issue that could potentially puncture her chances of winning November’s election. Recent polls suggest that Jill Stein, the presidential nominee for the Green Party, holds a staggering lead over Harris among Arab American voters in Michigan. Stein, a Jewish woman, has repeatedly accused Israel of committing a 'genocide' in Gaza and has defended Hamas’s slaughter of roughly 1,200 people on Oct. 7 as an act of 'self-defense.'

US deploying ‘small number’ of new troops to Middle East, as Isra...	The United States currently has some 40,000 troops in the region, according to the Pentagon. By Andrew Bernard, JNS The United States is deploying additional troops to the Middle East amid heightened tensions in the region, the Pentagon announced on Monday. Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, would not provide any details to the Associated Press about how many additional forces Washington would send or what their mission would be, the wire reported. 'In light of increased tension in the Middle East and out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional U.S. military personnel forward to augment our forces that are already in the region,' Ryder told the AP. 'For operational security reasons, I’m not going to comment on or provide specifics.' The United States currently has some 40,000 troops in the region, according to the Pentagon. On Monday, the aircraft carrier USS Truman, two destroyers and a cruiser departed from Norfolk, Va., towards the Mediterranean for a scheduled deployment. The new troop increase is the latest indication that the United States is concerned about a military escalation in the Middle East, with a particular focus on Israel and Lebanon. On Monday, the Israel Defense Forces struck more than 1,000 targets across Lebanon to prevent Hezbollah from firing rockets across the border. The U.S. State Department updated its travel advice for Lebanon on Saturday to urge U.S. citizens to depart the country while commercial flights remain available. The United States has advised Americans to not travel to Lebanon since July. In 2022, the State Department estimated that some 86,000 Americans live in Lebanon.

Senior Hezbollah official Ali Karaki killed in Beirut airstrike –...	Karaki was slated to replace Ibrahim Aqil as head of Hezbollah operations after the latter was killed on Friday. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Monday, senior Hezbollah official Ali Karaki was targeted and killed by an airstrike in Beirut, Sky Arabia reports. Karaki, head of the terror group's Southern command, is the most senior Hezbollah official and was slated to replace Ibrahim Aqil as head of operations after the latter was killed on Friday along with other terrorist commanders. According to the report, Karaki was killed when six missiles struck the building he was occupying. Karaki was also a member of Hezbollah’s top 'military' organization, the Jihad Council, which is subordinate to the Shura Council and under the direct control of Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah. Monday night’s strike was the fourth time that IAF jets struck the Lebanese capital since the conflict with Hezbollah began immediately after October 7th, when the Lebanese terror group expressed solidarity with Hamas by attacking Israel. On Friday, the IDF eliminated 16 top Hezbollah Radwan force commanders, including the leader Ibrahim Aqil. Israel’s military operation targeted the Radwan Force commanders meeting in the basement of a building in the Dahieh neighborhood of Beirut. Aqil was the top commander of the Radwan force and was planning an invasion of Galilee. Ahmed Wahbi, head of the Radwan training unit, was also eliminated. Wahbi was also heavily involved in planning the Galilee invasion and, according to the IDF, was 'advancing Hezbollah’s entrenchment in southern Lebanon while attempting to improve the organization’s ground combat capabilities.' Concerning the operation, the IDF said, 'These Radwan terror commanders were plotting an attack and invasion into Israel’s territory for years and were ready to carry out the plans at a moment’s notice when given the order.' 'Aqil and the other commanders eliminated in the strike were responsible for planning and executing hundreds of terror attacks against Israelis, including the planned invasion of the Galilee,' the IDF announced. Hezbollah, which doesn’t always acknowledge the elimination of their leaders, confirmed that Aqil and others had been killed and said his body had been recovered from under the rubble.

Hezbollah rocket directly hits home in lower Galilee, no injuries	These rooms save lives. Thirty centimeters saved three lives today—it’s surreal.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Monday, one of the many missiles Hezbollah fired into Israel directly hit a home in Givat Avni with the residents hiding in a shelter close by. There were no reported injuries among the residents of the house. David Yitzhak, who lived in the home, described to Ynet how the missile hit the house just moments after the family fled to the safe room. 'We gathered in the safe room, and after I locked the door, there was this crazy explosion.' 'I immediately knew the missile hit the house. It was obvious.' Yitzhak expressed relief at the narrow escape from the missile and emphasized the importance of safe rooms. 'These rooms save lives. Thirty centimeters saved three lives today—it’s surreal,' he said. He also urged citizens to obey safety instructions during this conflict. 'It's important for everyone to follow instructions. You need to run when told to; that’s the message everyone needs to hear,' Yitzhak said. On Monday, Hezbollah fired 180 rockets into Israel, and bomb disposal experts were deployed in Lower Galilee and other areas. Magen Dovid Adom (MDA) reported several injuries from Hezbollah's missile attack, including a 59-year-old man who was wounded by shrapnel near the Golani Junction, a 25-year-old who sustained injuries while fleeing to a shelter, and several people who were treated for shock. In the afternoon, 10 rockets targeted Lower Galilee, and 25 reached the area of Safed and the Sea of Galilee. Most of these missiles were intercepted, but others landed in open fields near Ammiad and Nahal Amud. Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant assessed the security situation and gave a message to the Israeli public. 'The resilience of the civilian front is key to enabling the IDF to fight and strike the enemy,' Gallant said. 'In the coming days, the public will need to show composure, discipline and full compliance with Home Front Command guidelines. This saves lives.'

Israel’s high-tech sector defies war with $9 billion in investmen...	The high-tech industry makes up over 50% of Israel’s exports, accounts for one-fifth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and generates one-quarter of all state revenues from employment taxes. By Pesach Benson, TPS Despite a year of war, Israel’s high-tech industry has been surprisingly stable, according to a report released by the Israel Innovation Authority on Monday. Total investments in technology companies have remained robust, with nearly $9 billion raised from the onset of the war until mid-August 2024. This figure positions Israel as the third-largest recipient of global tech investments during this period, trailing only Silicon Valley and New York City, while surpassing other major cities such as London and Paris. The high-tech industry makes up over 50% of Israel’s exports, accounts for one-fifth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and generates one-quarter of all state revenues from employment taxes. However, the report found that following a decade of exponential growth, key performance indicators in high-tech have stagnated for over two years. The total number of high-tech employees has plateaued at approximately 400,000, maintaining a steady share of about 11% of the overall workforce. 'Since the high-tech workers contribute a significant portion of the income tax, this stagnation may affect the state’s revenues in the coming years at a time when it is facing a deepening deficit and is required for growth-encouraging measures,' the report said. In stark contrast, global employment trends present a different picture, the report added. In 2023, high-tech employment in Europe grew by about 5%, while the U.S. saw an increase of approximately 2.8%. Israel, however, managed a modest growth rate of 2.6%, closely aligning with its population growth. A deeper dive into employment statistics reveals a bifurcation in job creation: while research and development (R&D) positions have seen a steady increase, roles in product and business operations have faced declines. Looking ahead, the mood within the high-tech services sector appears to be improving. As of July 2024, nearly 23% of companies expressed optimism about hiring more workers in the coming year — a notable increase from just 10% last year. This shift signals a growing confidence among firms that the worst may be behind them, suggesting that the appetite for growth is beginning to return, the report said. A continued influx of foreign investment into Israel’s high-tech sector reinforces this notion. The stability of venture capital funds remains intact, with no significant drop in the number of active funds, particularly foreign ones, which constitute about two-thirds of all venture capital in Israel.

Iran’s Revolutionary Guards ban communications devices after stri...	IRGC officials have reached out to Hezbollah for technical assessments, and several examples of exploded devices have been sent to Tehran for examination by Iranian experts. By The Algemeiner and Reuters Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), an internationally designated terrorist organization, has ordered all members to stop using any type of communication devices after thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by its Hezbollah allies in Lebanon blew up in deadly attacks last week, two senior Iranian security officials told Reuters. One of the security officials said a large-scale operation is underway by the IRGC to inspect all devices, not just communication equipment. He said most of these devices were either homemade or imported from China and Russia. Iran was concerned about infiltration by Israeli agents, including Iranians on Israel’s payroll and a thorough investigation of personnel has already begun, targeting mid and high-ranking members of the IRGC, added the official, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. 'This includes scrutiny of their bank accounts both in Iran and abroad, as well as their travel history and that of their families,' the security official said. Iran’s Foreign, Defense, and Interior Ministries were not immediately available to respond to the comments made by the security officials to Reuters. In a coordinated attack, the pager devices detonated on Tuesday across Hezbollah‘s strongholds. On Wednesday, hundreds of Hezbollah walkie-talkies exploded. The attacks killed 39 people and injured more than 3,000 people. Lebanon and Hezbollah say Israel was behind the attacks. Israel has neither denied nor confirmed involvement. The security official declined to give details on how the IRGC force, comprising 190,000 personnel, are communicating. 'For now, we are using end-to-end encryption in messaging systems,' he said. According to the same official, there is widespread concern among Iran’s ruling establishment. IRGC officials have reached out to Hezbollah for technical assessments, and several examples of exploded devices have been sent to Tehran for examination by Iranian experts. MISSILE, NUCLEAR FACILITIES Another Iranian official said the Islamic Republic’s main concern was the protection of the country’s nuclear and missile facilities, particularly those underground. 'But since last year, security measures at those sites have increased significantly,' he said in reference to stepped up measures after what Iranian authorities said was Israel’s attempt to sabotage Iran’s missile program in 2023. Israel has never commented on this. 'There has never, ever been such tight security and extreme measures in place as there are now,' he added, suggesting that security has been significantly increased beyond previous levels after the pager explosions in Lebanon. The IRGC is a powerful political, military, and economic force in Iran with close ties to the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Set up after the 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the clerical ruling system, it has its own ground force, navy, and air force that oversee Iran’s strategic weapons. It exerts influence in the Middle East through its overseas operations arm, the Al Quds Force, by providing money, weapons, technology, and training to allied terrorist groups: Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, Yemen’s Houthis, and militias in Iraq. Iran’s military uses a range of encrypted communication devices, including walkie-talkies, for secure communication, said the first Iranian source. While specific models and brands might vary, Iranian military communications equipment was often developed domestically or sourced from a combination of local and foreign suppliers, he said. He said Iran’s armed forces have stopped using pagers for over two decades. Tehran has developed its own military-grade radio transmissions through its defense industry to avoid reliance on foreign imports, especially due to Western sanctions imposed on Tehran over its nuclear program, he added. However, in the past, Iran has imported communication devices from countries such as China and Russia and even Japan. Iran and Israel have been locked in a shadow war for decades, with mutual allegations of sabotage and assassination plots. The conflict, including between Israel and Hezbollah, has intensified in the past year in parallel with the Gaza war, which erupted after the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7. Iran and Hezbollah have blamed Israel for assassinating Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah‘s most senior military commander, Fuad Shukr, in Beirut a few hours earlier in July. Israel said it killed Shukr but it has not confirmed it was behind Haniyeh’s death. Iran does not recognize Israel’s right to exist. Khamenei has previously called Israel a 'cancerous tumor' that 'will undoubtedly be uprooted and destroyed.' Israel believes that Iran poses an existential threat. It also accuses Iran of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons, though Iran denies seeking to build a nuclear bomb.

Hezbollah rockets reach northern cities, Samaria	By early Monday evening, Hezbollah had fired 180 total rockets into Israel, reaching Samaria for the first time since October 7. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Monday, Hezbollah fired a barrage of over 180 long-range missiles into Israel, setting off sirens in towns close to Haifa, Tiberias and the Galilee and reaching Samaria for the first time since the beginning of the war. In the afternoon, sirens sounded in the Haifa and Mount Carmel area and there were alerts in Nesher, as well as in Isfiya, Kiryat Atta, Daliyat al-Karmel, and Shefa-Amr. According to the IDF, 25 rockets reached the Golan Heights and 15 targeted the Haifa Bay area. An additional 10 missiles reached Samaria setting off alarms in Ariel and in the settlements of Yakir, Nofim, Kiryat Netafim, Revava, the Ariel Industrial Zone, Barkan, Havot Yair, the Barkan Industrial Zone and Ofarim. Hezbollah fired an additional barrage of 15 rockets at the Jezreel Valley and Haifa Bay area early in the evening. As of 7:00 pm on Monday, Hezbollah had fired 180 total rockets into Israel, reaching a number of areas for the first time. In retaliation, Israel carried out a targeted strike in Beirut for the fourth time since the beginning of the conflict with Lebanon. Channel 12 quotes a senior Israeli official who declares, 'What Hezbollah hasn’t understood through force, it will understand through more force.' The IDF has ordered Lebanese civilians to evacuated sensitive areas ahead of a military strike. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared in a video message to Lebanese civilians urging them to follow evacuation orders. Israel’s war is not with you,' he says in a video statement. 'It’s with Hezbollah.' 'For too long, Hezbollah has been using you as human shields,' says Netanyahu. 'It placed rockets in your living rooms and missiles in your garage. Those rockets and missiles are aimed directly at our cities, directly at our citizens,' he added To defend our people against Hezbollah strikes, we must take out these weapons,' he says. 'Starting this morning, the IDF has warned you to get out of harm’s way,' Netanyahu explained. 'I urge you – take this warning seriously. Don’t let Hezbollah endanger your lives and the lives of your loved ones. Don’t let Hezbollah endanger Lebanon.'

Hagari on Monday morning warned Lebanese civilians living along the border that Hezbollah was using their homes to store weapons and that for their safety they should evacuate immediately. By Joshua Marks, JNS Israeli Air Force fighter jets conducted massive airstrikes on Hezbollah targets across Lebanon throughout the day on Monday to prevent the Iranian-backed terror army from firing rockets across the border. As of Monday afternoon, the IAF had attacked more than 800 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. Alongside the update, the army published a video of Chief of Staff Lt. Gen.

Daniel Hagari warned that the IAF strikes would continue in the immediate time frame and criticized Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, accusing the terror leader of 'dragging Lebanon and the entire region into escalation.' Addressing the possibility of ground maneuvers in Lebanon, he said that 'we will do whatever is necessary to return residents [of northern Israel] to their homes. We have detailed plans, which we have presented to the political leadership.' Hagari on Monday morning warned Lebanese civilians living along the border that Hezbollah was using their homes to store weapons and that for their safety they should evacuate immediately. He also revealed during the press briefing that terrorists had recently attempted to launch a cruise missile from a civilian residence, which was thwarted, providing documentation of the preventive strike. The cruise missile was a DR-3 model with a flight range of 124 miles (200 km.) carrying a warhead of up to 661 pounds (300 kg.), according to the IDF.

Hagari on Monday morning warned Lebanese civilians living along the border that Hezbollah was using their homes to store weapons and that for their safety they should evacuate immediately. By Joshua Marks, JNS Israeli Air Force fighter jets conducted massive airstrikes on Hezbollah targets across Lebanon throughout the day on Monday to prevent the Iranian-backed terror army from firing rockets across the border. As of Monday afternoon, the IAF had attacked more than 800 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. Alongside the update, the army published a video of Chief of Staff Lt. Gen.

Addressing the possibility of ground maneuvers in Lebanon, he said that 'we will do whatever is necessary to return residents [of northern Israel] to their homes. We have detailed plans, which we have presented to the political leadership.' Hagari on Monday morning warned Lebanese civilians living along the border that Hezbollah was using their homes to store weapons and that for their safety they should evacuate immediately. He also revealed during the press briefing that terrorists had recently attempted to launch a cruise missile from a civilian residence, which was thwarted, providing documentation of the preventive strike. The cruise missile was a DR-3 model with a flight range of 124 miles (200 km.) carrying a warhead of up to 661 pounds (300 kg.), according to the IDF.

Israel rebuffs Irish president’s accusation Israel stole letter t...	Irish president accuses Israeli embassy of intercepting his letter to his Iranian counterpart and circulating to the media, sparking latest diplomatic row between Jerusalem and Dublin. By World Israel News Staff Ireland's president has accused the Israeli embassy in Dublin of intercepting a congratulatory letter he penned to his newly-elected Iranian counterpart, using the document to embarrass him. Irish President Michael Higgins penned several months ago what he dubbed a 'courtesy letter' to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, congratulating him on his July electoral victory. Last month, the letter began circulating online, revealing the details of Higgins' missive to Pezeshkian. During a speech this week at the United Nations Future Summit, Higgins blasted the Israeli Embassy in Ireland, accusing the Israeli mission to Dublin of intercepting the letter and circulating it publicly to embarrass Higgins. Higgins noted that at the time of the letter's first appearance online, it was criticized by the Israeli embassy, which said that it sent 'the wrong message to the Iranian people who live in fear under this brutal regime,' though he acknowledged that he did not know how the Israeli mission might have obtained the letter. The Irish president also pointed to the absence of Israeli Ambassador to Ireland Dana Erlich from the country as being suggestive of Israel's role, saying it prevented his government from summoning her in response to Israel's alleged role in the leak. On Monday, however, the Israeli Embassy in Ireland pushed back on Higgins' claims, calling them 'baseless' and 'highly inflammatory.' 'Unfortunately, in Ireland, since the October 7 invasion by Hamas and massacre in Israel, which triggered this awful war, Israel has been subjected to a high level of malicious statements and accusations that have often manifested as incitement to hatred.' 'This baseless accusation is highly inflammatory and potentially slanderous and the embassy rejects it completely.'

Only 30-35 hostages still alive, says captive’s mother	Einav Zangauker rejects the prime minister's claim that some 50 hostages are still among the living. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A mother of one of the 97 hostages still being held by Hamas rejected Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claim that about 50 of the captives are still alive, in an interview on Army Radio Monday. 'The prime minister is lying,' Einav Zangauker said. 'We know, the families, that the number is far smaller than the number cited by the prime minister.' The relatives of the hostages receive intelligence updates from the army whenever they have new information on their loved ones' status, she told the station, and therefore, 'in my opinion, there are no more than 30 to 35 hostage still alive.' In his report to the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Sunday, Netanyahu had also cited intelligence as his source, saying, 'According to the information we have, half of the hostages in Gaza are alive.' Zangauker also expressed pessimism about any forthcoming deal. 'There are no [significant] contacts between the Israeli team and the mediators,' she said, and 'Hamas is not involved.' The Americans, being busy with the upcoming elections, ahve basically 'given up' their efforts for the time being as well, she added. Zangauker has repeatedly blamed the prime minister over the last several months for not consummating a ceasefire-for-hostages agreement, even though the Americans have backed Netanyahu's claim that it is Hamas that has walked away from any deal. In a Sunday statement, she accused Netanyahu and his government of 'deliberately stalling the deal,' because the Israeli leader prefers 'regional escalation' over the lives of the hostages. She went as far as charging him with helping Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and wanting war so as to preserve his rule, 'sacrific[ing] the abductees on that 'altar.' 'Just as Netanyahu nurtured Hamas for years, so is Netanyahu now cooperating with Sinwar, and giving him what he wants: a multi-regional war. The hostages and all citizens of Israel are paying and will pay the price,' she added. Zangauker has publicly stated that if her son is murdered in Gaza, 'I won't blame Hamas, just the prime minister.' Her son, Matan, was kidnapped from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7 along with his partner, Ilana Gritzewsky, and 249 other Israelis and foreign nationals during Hamas' surprise invasion in which they and other terrorists also brutally massacred 1,200 people. Gritzewsky was released in the only hostage deal to date, in late November, along with 85 other Israeli women and children, in exchange for a week-long ceasefire, the release of Palestinian female and underage security prisoners from Israeli jails, and a huge increase in humanitarian aid.

IDF warns of new strikes on Hezbollah in Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley	Israel gives Lebanese civilians two hours to evacuate areas used by Hezbollah to store weapons, after IDF strikes over 300 targets in southern Lebanon. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Israeli military announced Monday afternoon it plans to carry out an extensive aerial campaign against Hezbollah positions in eastern Lebanon, warning residents in targeted areas to evacuate. Senior IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that the Israeli Air Force was poised to expand its air campaign against Hezbollah missile depots to the Beqaa Valley of eastern Lebanon, after striking hundreds of positions in southern Lebanon, near the Israeli border. The IDF has given residents of the effected areas two hours to evacuate before the airstrikes begin. Hagari said that residents of the Beqaa Valley living in or near homes used to store Hezbollah rockets must evacuate. 'This warning is focused on the villages in the Beqaa valley,' Hagari said. 'I urge the Lebanese residents of the villages in the Beqaa Valley who are inside or near houses where rockets and weapons are stored, to move away immediately! For your safety and protection.' 'You can see the operations we are currently conducting in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah intends to launch these weapons toward Israel, and we will not allow it! Stay away for your own protection. Hassan Nasrallah is lying to you and putting you in danger,' Hagari continued, referencing the leader of the Hezbollah organization. Earlier on Monday, Hagari revealed evidence collected by the IDF, showing Hezbollah's use of private homes to store rockets and missiles, with some buildings modified to allow for missiles to be launched. During Monday morning and afternoon, Israeli warplanes bombed over 300 Hezbollah rocket and missile storage sites across southern Lebanon. According to Lebanon’s health ministry, at least 100 people were killed and 500 more injured in the strikes. Lebanon's Beqaa Valley, adjacent to the Syrian border, is considered a Hezbollah stronghold and serves as an important transportation hub for personnel and arms from Syria to the Lebanese terror group.

Hezbollah storing missiles in private homes, says IDF	Iranian-backed terrorists storing missiles inside civilian homes, IDF reveals, pointing to evidence Hezbollah even using homes as makeshift launch sites. By World Israel News Staff The Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah has been using civilian homes in Lebanon to store missiles and even as launching sites, a senior Israeli military spokesman said Monday. During a press briefing Monday morning, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari provided evidence collected by the IDF, revealing how Hezbollah terrorists use residential buildings to conceal rockets and missiles. In some instances, Hagari said, the homes are even transformed into makeshift launch sites. 'Here we are exposing Hezbollah’s method of hiding a cruise missile inside a home,' Hagari said. 'The terrorists create a designated opening for the missile launch. Here you can see how we identified the terrorists making an opening in the building that exposed the missile.' Hagari alluded to IDF airstrikes on hundreds of positions in Lebanon Monday, saying the attacks would target missile depots hidden in villages, just as a recent airstrike had done. 'In a precise strike, the IDF eliminated the terrorists and this missile launching infrastructure, shortly before the launch. Shortly, the IDF will engage in extensive, precise strikes, against terror targets which have been embedded widely throughout Lebanon.' On Monday, the IDF issued a warning in Arabic to residents of the targeted villages, urging them to immediately evacuate. Afterwards, the Israel Air Force carried out over 300 airstrikes Monday on Hezbollah missile storage depots across Lebanon. Lebanon's health ministry claimed at least 100 people were killed an hundreds more injured in the strikes. Israeli president Isaac Herzog took to X to defend the strikes, saying Israel could not tolerate Hezbollah's massive build up of missiles and rockets near the Israeli border. 'I repeat and reiterate: Israel does not seek war,' Herzog tweeted. 'But we have the right and the duty to defend our people.' 'Here’s just an example of the threat we face. This IDF video shows how Hezbollah stores and launches missiles in civilian areas and homes.' 'Thousands and thousands of long range rockets are kept in houses, living rooms, bedrooms, and kitchens, and then launched with the sole intention of killing our people.' 'Would you accept this in your or your neighbor’s home? What nation would accept its citizens living under such a threat from its neighbors?'

Biden ‘pushing hard’ to prevent war between Israel and Hezbollah	President Biden says his administration is doing 'everything we can' to prevent full-scale war on Israel - Lebanon frontier from breaking out, as tensions rise between Israel and Hezbollah. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Joe Biden said Sunday his administration is making every effort to prevent the escalation of tensions between Israel and the Hezbollah terrorist group into a full-scale war, following a massive wave of Hezbollah rocket attacks on northern Israel and IDF reprisals on Hezbollah positions. Speaking with reporters on the White House South Lawn Sunday, Biden said that following last week's targeted bombings of Hezbollah members and the barrages of rocket fire by the Iranian-backed group over the weekend, the U.S. is 'pushing hard' to prevent the outbreak of a broader war. 'We’re going to do everything we can to keep a wider war from breaking out. And we’re still pushing hard,' Biden said. On Sunday, U.S. officials expressed concern to Axios' Barak Ravid regarding Israel's attempt at 'de-escalation through escalation' with Hezbollah, saying it would require 'extremely difficult calibration' that could end up sparking an all-out war. Last Tuesday and Wednesday, thousands of pagers and hand-held radios issued by Hezbollah to its operatives detonated simultaneously, killing dozens and injuring thousands. While Israel has yet to confirm its role in the attacks, the bombings are thought to have been carried out by the Mossad. On Friday, IDF warplanes bombed a Hezbollah position in Beirut, killing 16 members of the terror group's elite Radwan Force, including two of its commanders, Ibrahim Aqil and Ahmed Wehbe. Over the weekend Israeli officials, including President Isaac Herzog, said the strike was carried out after intelligence was obtained pointing to an impending October-7th style invasion of northern Israel by the Radwan Force. Tensions continued to mount Saturday, with Hezbollah unleashing a massive barrage of hundreds of rockets and missiles, with attacks beginning Saturday night and running through Sunday morning. The IDF responded to the attacks, with artillery fire and targeted airstrikes. On Monday, Israeli forces bombed multiple Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon, after warning locals to seek shelter.

Trump meets Qatari leaders in Florida	As president, Trump had at times both criticized Qatar for supporting terrorism and praised it for taking 'action to counter terrorism and extremism in all forms.' By JNS Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump met on Sunday with Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani at the former president’s Florida resort. He also met with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. 'The Amir has proven to be a great and powerful leader of his country, advancing on all levels at record speed,' Trump posted to his social media platform Truth Social. 'He is someone also who strongly wants peace in the Middle East, and all over the world. We had a great relationship during my years in the White House, and it will be even stronger this time around!' As president, Trump had at times both criticized Qatar for supporting terrorism and praised it for taking 'action to counter terrorism and extremism in all forms.' The Biden administration has looked to Qatar as a mediator in ceasefire-for-hostages talks between Israel and Hamas. However, the Qatari government hosts Hamas leaders and has been implicated in illicit funding of U.S. universities. In July 2019, the Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy (ISGAP) revealed that 'foreign donations from Qatar, especially, have had a substantial impact on fomenting growing levels of antisemitic discourse and campus politics at U.S. universities.' Qatar also funds the Al Jazeera Media Network, which is based in its capital of Doha. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the network a 'mouthpiece for Hamas.' On Sunday, Israel’s military raided the network’s office in Ramallah and ordered its closure for 45 days. Earlier this month, Israel revoked the press passes of Al Jazeera reporters working in the Jewish state. The move was in keeping with a law passed by the Knesset in April that gave the Communications Minister the ability to act against a foreign channel that harms the state’s security, with the consent of the prime minister and approval of the Cabinet. The measures enable authorities to order television providers to stop broadcasting the outlet; close its offices in Israel; seize its equipment; shut down its website; and revoke press credentials for staff.

70 dead as Israel’s West Nile virus cases soar	While the outbreak’s epicenter remains in central Israel, health officials have noted an increase of cases in Haifa and Be’er Sheva. By Jewish Breaking News What began as a minor occurrence of West Nile virus in Israel last month has quickly escalated into a widespread outbreak. According to Israel’s Health Ministry, 913 patients have now been diagnosed with West Nile virus compared to 8 cases in early June. The outbreak has taken a grim toll, with 70 fatalities reported so far. The mosquito-borne illness has been a growing concern for Israelis. While most carriers of the virus never develop symptoms, approximately 20% of those infected experiences varying degrees of illness. Symptoms can range from fever and general fatigue to head and body aches. In severe cases, the virumosquitos can cause life-threatening neurological illnesses such as encephalitis or meningitis. Israeli health officials have been quick to emphasize that severe neurological complications are rare, occurring in less than 1% of infected individuals. However, this has done little to quell public concern as the number of cases continues to climb rapidly. While the outbreak’s epicenter remains in central Israel, health officials have noted an increase of cases in Haifa and Be’er Sheva. Israel’s Ministry of Environmental Protection is calling on both the government and the public to prevent a full-blown epidemic. In concentrated areas like Tel Aviv, citizens are being urged to use insect repellent, wear long-sleeved clothing, and avoid standing water where mosquitoes can breed.

Israel mulling reconquering northern Gaza	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the government may adopt the 'Generals’ Plan' that outlines how to defeat Hamas. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee (FADC) Sunday that he is seriously considering a proposal to take over all of northern Gaza to pressure Hamas to restart negotiations for a hostages-for-ceasefire deal. The 'Generals’ Plan' was presented to the government by the Commanders and Reserve Soldiers Forum early this month as a way to defeat Hamas altogether. Besides turning the stretch from Gaza City north into a closed military zone after allowing all residents to leave via secured humanitarian corridors, it also envisions the IDF taking charge of all humanitarian aid deliveries. No aid would be allowed into the besieged zone, forcing any Hamas forces left there after the evacuation of civilians to either surrender, starve or come out to fight the overwhelming IDF force that would greet them. Israeli control over the aid would take away a huge source of revenue for Hamas, which has reportedly made hundreds of millions of dollars by stealing and selling the internationally-donated supplies. It can thus provide for and pay its men as well, and tempt others to join its forces, needing the manpower desperately after 11 months of battle has left it denuded of most of its military might. Perhaps more importantly, being the source of food and medicine is the way the terrorists group controls the population. Losing permanent control over the aid and at least temporary control over the land is the only pressure tactic that will work to bring Hamas to its knees, according to Maj. Gen. (res.) Giora Eiland, one of the key authors of the Forum’s plan. The Generals’ Plan 'makes a lot of sense,' Kan News reported Netanyahu as telling the FADC members, although he said there are 'several' other plans being considered as well. 'We are committed to dismantling the civilian control of Hamas,' he said. Still, he added, he was against annexing civilian areas wholesale. He also said that he did not feel that Israeli military rule over Gaza was the preferred solution, although maintaining an IDF presence inside Gaza at least along the border was a must. Handing the reins to the Palestinian Authority, run by the nationalist Fatah group, Hamas’ arch enemy, was no solution either, he contended, as the PA is just as anti-Israel as its foes. On the other hand, attempts to encourage Gazan clans to assert control at least over their own localities had proven fruitless, he noted. A few attempts made months ago by certain powerful families in the Strip had ended quickly after Hamas killed several members of the clans. The Prime Minister’s Office said Sunday that the army has been asked to present the government with a plan of how it would take charge of aid distribution in the Gaza Strip.

Israel strikes central Gaza school taken over by Hamas	The IDF added that it stepped up aerial surveillance and used precision munitions to mitigate danger to civilians. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli aircraft struck a Hamas command and control center in a building formerly used as a school in central Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces said on Monday. According to the IDF, the building, which served as the Khaled ibn al-Walid School, was being used by terror groups to plan and carry out attacks. 'This is a further example of the Hamas terrorist organization’s systematic abuse of civilian infrastructure in violation of international law,' the army said. The IDF added that it stepped up aerial surveillance and used precision munitions to mitigate danger to civilians. The announcement comes two days after Israel released footage of Hamas terrorists robbing humanitarian aid from a truck in the southern Gaza area of Rafah. Soldiers who were securing the humanitarian corridor directed drones to kill the terrorists as they fled the scene in vehicles. The Press Service of Israel recently reported that Hamas is continuing to pay salaries to its gunmen and civil servants partly through taxing and diverting humanitarian aid and distributing food vouchers — with the help of clans, criminal groups and so-called 'People’s Committees.' At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

If you are in a building containing Hezbollah weapons, move away immediately until further notice,' read a text message sent to residents of Lebanon's south. By World Israel News Staff The IDF's spokesman released an unusual warning to Lebanese civilians in the south of the country on Monday morning, calling on those unaffiliated with the Hezbollah terror group to flee the region. In a video posted on social media, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari announced that Israel would carry out targeted strikes on Hezbollah military assets located within civilian communities in southern Lebanon. 'Hezbollah is endangering you and your families. Hezbollah is planning to launch weapons against Israel, and you should distance yourselves immediately for your safety,' Hagari said. The video included an illustration depicting how Hezbollah terrorists had modified a home to become a launch site for a cruise missile, further blurring the lines between civilian and terror targets. Additionally, the Israeli military sent Arabic-language text messages to residents of southern Lebanon. 'If you are in a building containing Hezbollah weapons, move away immediately until further notice,' the text message read. In response to the IDF announcement, the Hezbollah terror group released its own Hebrew-language message to Israeli civilians. The text appeared to have been written using an automatic translation, and was riddled with spelling and grammatical errors. 'Urgent warning to settlers living in the Palestinian territories,' read the message. 'If you are present in, or live near, a military base, your army is storing weapons and military capabilities there. Anyone who is a member of or physically close to the Israeli terrorist army exposes himself to danger.' IDF Chief of Staff Herzi HaLevi said in a separate statement that Israel would continue intensifying its military campaign against the terror group. 'The price that Hezbollah is paying has increased, our attacks will increase,' he said. 'We will safely return the residents to their homes, and if Hezbollah has not understood this yet, it will get another blow and another blow — until the organization understands.'

'Urgent warning to settlers living in the Palestinian territories,' read the message. 'If you are present in, or live near, a military base, your army is storing weapons and military capabilities there. Anyone who is a member of or physically close to the Israeli terrorist army exposes himself to danger.' IDF Chief of Staff Herzi HaLevi said in a separate statement that Israel would continue intensifying its military campaign against the terror group. 'The price that Hezbollah is paying has increased, our attacks will increase,' he said. 'We will safely return the residents to their homes, and if Hezbollah has not understood this yet, it will get another blow and another blow — until the organization understands.'

‘This will not break our spirit’: Northern Israeli communities pu...	Among the homes hit was that of a Kiryat Shmona evacuee, Itai Abekasis, who relocated to his parents’ house in Moreshet. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Despite the damage caused by Sunday morning’s Hezbollah rocket barrage, Israeli residents of Kiryat Bialik and Moreshet said they refused to be broken by the attacks. 'Despite the situation, people were incredibly composed,' Moreshet resident Ephraim Winkler told The Press Service of Israel. Winkler also heads the Karmiel-Misgav branch of United Hatzalah, a volunteer-based emergency medical response service. 'I was on my way driving to work when the rockets hit. I stopped on the road and looked back to see smoke coming up from the direction of Moreshet, so I went back calling up my team to join me. We quickly split forces to respond—some went to the lower street, and I headed to the upper street where homes were hit,' he said. His team evacuated families, including an elderly widower and a couple whose house was directly impacted. 'There was a huge fire—three cars and two houses caught fire. We worked to contain it to prevent further damage,' Winkler recalled to TPS-IL. Winkler, who also serves as part of the Hatzalah’s mental health resilience team, stressed how calm the residents remained. 'Neighbors quickly opened their bomb shelters and made sure everyone was safe. You could see their strength; there were no signs of panic, just solidarity and cooperation. Imagine that this happened early in the morning, most people woke up to the chaos,' he said. Among the homes hit was that of a Kiryat Shmona evacuee, Itai Abekasis, who relocated to his parents’ house in Moreshet. Itai, who is on reserve duty at the northern border, was home for Shabbat. 'My family was miraculously saved by following safety protocols. They rushed to the shelter just seconds before the rocket hit, shattering windows and causing extensive damage to the house,' Abecassis told TPS-IL. A video clip Abekasis shared on social media showed a room in disarray, a baby crib near a bed, with shattered windows, pieces of glass covering the floor. 'Look at that, that’s where we were sleeping. Look at all the glass!' he said in the clip. Together with other northern communities’ evacuees, who spent the year away from their own homes, he stresses again the necessity of winning this war against Hezbollah. 'The government of Israel and the [army] must continue to ensure the security of all residents of the north and do everything necessary to dismantle Hezbollah’s capabilities,' the 'Fighting for the North' headquarters said to TPS-IL. In Kiryat Bialik, the morning has also started with violent noise of explosions, with interceptors taking down incoming rockets, but falling debris still caused damage to several homes. Mayor Eli Dukorsky told TPS-IL, 'We woke up to a difficult morning in Kiryat Bialik. The interceptors did their job, but shrapnel from the missiles damaged residential buildings. Fortunately, only three people sustained minor injuries. Our municipal and security forces handled the situation effectively, restoring calm to the city.' Dukorsky shared an image of one of the damaged homes draped in Israeli flags, posting on social media. 'They will not break our spirit. The house has been covered with the flags of Israel and our city,' Dukorsky wrote on social media. Hundreds of residents responded with comments of resilience and pride. This spirit of determination was echoed by the Moreshet community, where volunteers and emergency teams worked hand in hand in the attack’s aftermath. 'Everyone here is strong,' Winkler insisted. 'We’ve had to deal with tragedy before. Three of the sons of our community have fallen in the war, one of them just last week, very recently. But it doesn’t break us, we stay prepared and we stay united.' Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have soared in recent days. On Monday, the Security Cabinet updated its official war goals to include the secure return of 60,000 evacuated northern residents to their homes. On Tuesday, pagers belonging to Hezbollah operatives exploded across Lebanon and in Syria, injuring thousands. More Hezbollah figures were injured in a second wave of explosions on Wednesday. The Iran-backed terror group said 32 of its people were killed, a number that has not been independently verified. Israeli officials believe the death toll is higher than Hezbollah has indicated. The blasts are widely attributed to Israel, but Jerusalem has not commented. On Thursday, two Israeli soldiers were killed along the northern border in Hezbollah missile and drone attacks. An Israeli airstrike in Beirut on Friday killed 16 senior terrorists, eliminating most of the elite Radwan Force’s chain of command. Northern residents were forced to evacuate their homes when Hezbollah began launching rockets and drones in October. The terror group has launched more than 6,700 rockets and drones, killing 26 civilians and 22 soldiers on the Israeli side. Hezbollah leaders have said they will continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes, which Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah reiterated in a speech on Thursday night. Israeli officials have been calling for Hezbollah to be disarmed and removed from southern Lebanon in compliance with UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War.

Herzog unveils Oct. 7 war memorial in Jerusalem	In the inner section, a mini auditorium with unique lighting was created for families to privately reflect with their loved ones. By JNS Israeli President Isaac Herzog and Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion on Sunday unveiled the Swords of Iron memorial monument on the capital’s Ruppin Street, opposite the National Library. The monument is the first of its kind in the city to commemorate both the victims of Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre and Israel Defense Forces soldiers who fell in the ensuing war. 'These are difficult, painful and bloody days, in which our enemies are doing everything they can to prevent Israeli citizens from living normal lives, to harm the citizens of Israel and the State of Israel,' said Herzog at the start of the event. 'We have never sought war, and we do not want war, but let it be clear: We will not rest and we will not stop until all Israeli citizens return to their homes and are safe and secure. It is Israel’s right, and duty, to defend its citizens. Israel’s defensive and offensive capabilities are proving themselves, and we will continue until full security is achieved,' he added. The ceremony was attended by senior government officials, Jerusalem City Council members, dozens of ambassadors and bereaved families. The inauguration ceremony for the new monument in memory of Jerusalem residents who were murdered in October 7 massacre and in recent war, in Jerusalem, September 22, 2024. (By Oren Ben Hakoon/Flash90) 'This monument highlights the magnitude of the loss Jerusalem has experienced, while also conveying hope for better days, days that we all pray for and long to see. This shared commemoration sends a message of hope and unity, which are so vital for all of us,' said Lion. 'Anyone who gazes upon this monument realizes the unbearable price that Jerusalem and the State of Israel have paid since Oct. 7—the profound pain entailed in this cost. This memorial honors the words, the tears, the stories and the pain of the families,' he continued. A chapter of Psalms was recited by Rabbi Shmuel Slotki, who lost both his sons, Noam and Yishai, to the war against Hamas. The prayer for the return of the hostages was delivered by Jon Polin, father of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, one of six captives recently executed by Palestinian terrorists in Gaza. The memorial is made of iron, with a diameter of 14 meters and a height of approximately 5.5 meters. The names of the fallen are engraved on the monument—the soldiers, security forces, rescue personnel and civilians from Jerusalem who lost their lives since Oct. 7. Inside the core of the structure, a verse from the 'Nachem' prayer, which is recited once a year on Tisha B’Av, is engraved: 'Therefore Zion will weep bitterly, and Jerusalem will give forth its voice. My heart, my heart grieves for their fallen; my bowels, my bowels grieve for their fallen.' In the inner section, a mini auditorium with unique lighting was created for families to privately reflect with their loved ones. document.createElement('video'); The post Herzog unveils Oct. 7 war memorial in Jerusalem appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/herzog-unveils-oct-7-war-memorial-in-jerusalem/	2024-09-23T01:44:42-07:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/F240922OBH12-scaled.jpg
Hostage families: ‘Protests are killing our loved ones’	Israelis are 'following Sinwar's instructions' by protesting, fumes brother of kidnapped man. By World Israel News Staff Families of civilians and soldiers held captive by Hamas terrorists for almost one year are slamming the ongoing hostage release protests, which have joined forces with the anti-government Kaplan Movement, stating that the demonstrations are actually decreasing the chances that their loved ones will be freed. The Forum for Hostage Families has claimed to be a non-partisan organization advocating on behalf of all those whose loved ones were kidnapped, but some families have said that the group promotes a political agenda. Those who are in favor of military pressure as the most effective tactic for freeing the hostages established the Tikva Forum. Its members do not support the weekly Tel Aviv rallies calling for a ceasefire, where speakers often include anti-Netanyahu rhetoric in their speeches. Nadav Miran, whose brother Omri was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nahal Oz on October 7th, said that many of the hostage families had unwittingly become pawns of Hamas due to their vocal criticism of the Israeli government and participation in protests calling for a hostage deal at any cost. 'The content of the [hostage deal rallies] is now focused on toppling the government,' Miran, a member of the Tikva Forum, told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. 'We hear [Hamas leader] Yahya Sinwar forcing the hostages to demand street protests calling for their release' in psychological warfare videos, Miran said. 'And what do Israeli citizens do? They follow Sinwar's instructions' by protesting, he added. Miran stressed that growing public pressure for a deal only makes Hamas sharpen its demands, putting the terror group in a stronger position at the negotiating table. 'Those who go to the protests are preventing a deal and killing the captives,' he said. 'Because of the demonstrations, the price [Hamas is demanding] for the hostages is increasing.' He added that it bothers him to see photos of his brother being held by the protesters. 'My brother is being used to protect their agenda. They are standing against the truth. The only one blocking a deal is Hamas, and even the Americans are saying that.' Miran's views were backed by Shimon Or, whose nephew, Avinatan, was kidnapped from the Nova Music Festival alongside his girlfriend, Noa Argamani. Demonstrators using Avinatan's photo at protests 'don't actually care about him or the other captives,' Or told Ynet. 'They have their own goals - primarily overthrowing the prime minister.'

Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar may have been killed – report	IDF intelligence reportedly probing possibility that Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas chief and mastermind of the October 7th invasion, may be dead. By World Israel News Staff Israel's military is currently investigating whether Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar has died, according to multiple reports carried by Hebrew media outlets late Sunday night and early Monday morning. Sinwar, the mastermind of the October 7th invasion of Israel and massacre of some 1,200 people in southwestern Israel, has not been heard from recently, leading some in the Israeli intelligence community to speculate that the leader of the terrorist group's forces in Gaza and, since August, head of the organization's politburo, may have died in an IDF airstrike several months ago. The IDF's Military Intelligence Directorate is taking seriously the possibility that Sinwar was in fact killed when Israeli warplanes bombed a tunnel where the terrorist leader was suspected to be hiding, Kan, Ma'ariv, Walla, and Ha'aretz all reported. No details were provided, however, regarding the strike in question. No clear evidence has yet been found indicating Sinwar has died, army sources cited by the reports emphasized, and the Hamas chief's possible death remains entirely speculative at this point. According to a report by The Jerusalem Post, there is no consensus within Israel's intelligence community as to the likelihood of Sinwar having been killed or the significance of his recent months-long silence. This is not the first time security officials have speculated regarding Sinwar's possible death. Multiple rumors were floated and leaked to the press last December after a lull in communications by the Hamas leader. In contrast to Israel's military intelligence establishment, the Shin Bet - the Jewish state's internal security agency and the country's primary counter-terror security service - is largely skeptical of the possibility Sinwar was killed in the airstrike in question, with the agency presuming Sinwar is still alive.

Netanyahu says half of the hostages held in Gaza are still alive ...	Netanyahu said it was Hamas, not Israel's government, that was to blame for the impasse in hostage release negotiation. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News During a closed meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly told MKs that just half of the 97 hostages remaining in Gaza are still alive. Of the hostages taken on October 7th, 33 have died after being taken as captives in Gaza. 'According to the information we have, half of the hostages in Gaza are alive,' he is quoted as saying by Army Radio. Netanyahu said it was Hamas, not Israel's government, that was to blame for the impasse in hostage release negotiation. In addition, the Prime Minister said he is mulling his generals' plans to seize northern Gaza. Last week, retired Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland presented a plan to 'change the reality on the ground' in Gaza. 'We have to tell the residents of north Gaza that they have one week to evacuate the territory, which then becomes a military zone, [a zone] in which every figure is a target and, most importantly, no supplies enter this territory,' General Eiland said. In June, American and Israeli intelligence predicted that there may be as few as 50 hostages still left alive in Gaza, the Wall Street Journal reported. The daily cited 'mediators in the hostage talks and a U.S. official familiar with the latest U.S. intelligence' as sources. Officially, on the Israeli side the IDF and Prime Minister's Office declined to comment, and on the American end the Office of the Director of National Intelligence kept mum as well when asked for a response. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari revealed that the IDF eliminated two terrorists who held the six murdered Israeli hostages whose bodies were recovered in late August. The IDF retrieved the bodies of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, Eden Yerushalmi, 24, Ori Danino, 25, Almog Sarusi, 25, Alexander Lobanov, 32, and Carmel Gat, 40, in Rafah. They were shot in the head execution-style just two days before security forces discovered their bodies. Hagari reported that 'troops from the 162nd Division identified two terrorists emerging from an underground tunnel shaft in the Tel al-Sultan area and eliminated them during an encounter.'

Did an explosive beeper cause crash that killed previous Iranian ...	Gholamhossein Esmaili, the late Iranian president’s chief of staff reported that weather was not a factor in the death of President Ebrahim Raisi. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An explosive beeper similar to those that injured and killed Hezbollah terrorists last week might have played a role in the helicopter crash that killed Iranian President Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi in May. European-based Iranian journalist posted on X that Ahmad Bakhshayesh Ardestani, a member of the Iranian parliament’s National Security and Foreign Policy Committee said Raisi may have had one of the explosive-laden beepers when he was in a helicopter shortly before his death. Iranian media claimed that the crash that killed Raisi was caused by foul weather when the helicopter collided with a fog-covered mountain. However, Gholamhossein Esmaili, the late Iranian president’s chief of staff, told state television that weather was not a factor in the death of President Ebrahim Raisi. Esmaili was traveling in one of the two other helicopters in the air entourage that was making its way back from a ceremony inaugurating a dam on the border with Azerbaijan. 'The weather was clear, and completely bright and fine' when the flight began, he said. About half an hour into their trip, Raisi’s pilot ordered the three to rise above clouds that were on their level, but after about '30 seconds, [my] pilot noticed that the main helicopter was not with us,' he said. An offensive last week involved spontaneous explosion of thousands of beepers used by Hezbollah terrorists, wounding thousands and killing at least 37. Additional injuries and deaths occurred on Wednesday in Lebanon and in Syria, where 19 IRGC terrorists were killed and 150 were injured. A former commander of British military forces in Afghanistan, Colonel Richard Kemp, praised the beeper offensive against Hezbollah as 'precise and discriminatory' and effective at weakening the morale and capacity of the Lebanese terror group. Israel’s outsmarting them with this terror attack has led to Hezbollah’s 'demoralization.' Kemp also praised the mission because it effectively targeted only terrorists and limited civilian casualties.

DeSantis: Two-state solution ‘stepping stone’ to end of Israel	In his address, DeSantis, who has cracked down on violent university demonstrations and fought against the boycott of Israel, said that chants of 'From the River to the Sea' common at the protests were calls for genocide. By JNS The two-state solution long backed by successive U.S. administrations and the international community to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a 'canard' that Palestinians view as a 'stepping stone to the destruction of Israel,' Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said on Friday. 'It’s important for us in the United States to be very clear-eyed about what it means to be a strong ally of the State of Israel, and that means we should not embrace the canard of a two-state solution,' the Republican told the Israeli American Council summit in Washington. 'That is not seeking to have peace. They are seeking that as a stepping stone to the destruction of the Jewish state, and that is not acceptable!' In his address, the staunchly pro-Israel governor, who has cracked down on violent university demonstrations against Israel in the Sunshine State and fought against the boycott of Israel, said that chants of 'From the River to the Sea' common at the protests were calls for genocide. 'What you’re seeing on these college campuses, no question, is a lot of virulent antisemitism, a lot of hate. When you say, ‘From the River to the Sea’, you are chanting in favor of a second Holocaust. That’s what that means. 'I do think some of these students are just ignorant. I don’t think they even understand what they’re talking about. You hear some of them talking about ‘End the occupation of Palestine’. And I just think they need a little history lesson: There has never been a Palestinian Arab state!' DeSantis continued. He then offered a crash course in Israel 101. 'Prior to the First World War, you had hundreds of years of occupation under the Ottoman Empire. It was not a Palestinian Arab state. Then you had the British Mandate for Palestine. Then you had a Partition Plan from the U.N.—Jewish state and Arab state,' DeSantis said. 'The Jews accepted the state and founded Israel. The Arabs rejected the state and they went to war to try to eradicate Israel, and they lost. And they went to war again and they lost in 1967 and 1973 and throughout the intifadas, and so on! That land historically has no stronger connection to any group of people except the Jewish people. It goes about thousands of years. Read your Bible!' Earlier this year, DeSantis signed into laws bill on antisemitism and on Jewish school security, including one which codifies the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism, and another allocating state security funding for full-time Jewish day schools and preschools. He has also spoken out against the often violent campus demonstrations against Jewish students this past year, saying that he would not allow that to happen in Florida, which has become a go-to state for Jews fleeing New York.

Iran’s ‘Torture Master’ dies after brain surgery	He was involved in suppressing student protests in 2009 and was accused of personally escalating sentences for political prisoners. By Jewish Breaking News A notorious Iranian interrogator has reportedly died following brain surgery on Saturday. Reza Seraj’s career in Iran’s security apparatus spanned decades and was marked by controversy. Beginning in the 1990s, he rose through the ranks as a senior interrogator within IRGC Intelligence. Operating under the alias 'Alavi,' Seraj became notorious for extracting forced confessions through pressure and torture. Throughout his career, Seraj held various high-ranking positions, including head of the Student Basij, political deputy of Sarallah Headquarters in Tehran, and head of the Special IRGC Intelligence Directorate. He was involved in suppressing student protests in 2009 and was accused of personally escalating sentences for political prisoners, according to Iran International. In 2023, the US Treasury Department sanctioned Seraj for his role in overseas assassination plots and human rights abuses in Iran. He was also implicated in violent incidents against inmates, including the 'Black Thursday' attack in Evin Prison in 2014. Despite accusations from former political prisoners and activists about his involvement in torture and forced confessions, IRGC Commander-in-Chief Hossein Salami praised Seraj for his role in confronting anti-government protests. 'Seraj played a significant role in confronting sedition and raising awareness in dealing with various deviations that threatened the Islamic Revolution,' Salami said in a statement.

On Thursday, France voted in favor of a United Nations General Assembly resolution proposed by the Palestinian Authority to impose sanctions and an arms embargo on Israel. By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and French President Emmanuel Macron held a difficult conversation last week over the escalating situation in Lebanon, Israel’s Channel 12 reported on Friday. According to the report, Macron, who initiated the call, hurled harsh accusations at the Israeli premier for leading Israel and Lebanon to the brink of a full-scale war. 'The responsibility to prevent escalation is yours. You can opt for a diplomatic solution. This is the moment to show leadership and responsibility. Your activity in the north is pushing the region to war,' Macron was quoted in the report as saying. Netanyahu replied: 'Instead of putting the pressure on us, it’s about time you pressured Hezbollah. We will bring our residents back home [in the north]. This is the decision we made this week and we will act on it.' On Thursday, France voted in favor of a United Nations General Assembly resolution proposed by the Palestinian Authority to impose sanctions and an arms embargo on Israel. Israeli officials expressed their disappointment over Paris’s stance, including its inability to put diplomatic pressure on Hezbollah to end its hostilities, Channel 12 reported. 'You, the French, do what you still think you must diplomatically do and we will do what we must do,' senior officials in Jerusalem said in the report. A French source noted that 'a diplomatic agreement in the north is still possible, on condition that all sides take responsibility. The latest security developments are worrying because they fuel a new dynamic of escalation.' Macron expressed his sympathies with the Lebanese people in footage uploaded to X, saying that 'escalation is in no one’s interest.' In the wake of the two-day attack across Lebanon in which pagers and walkie-talkie communication devices held by Hezbollah operatives exploded, killing dozens and injuring thousands more, Macron noted that Lebanon should not 'live in fear of an imminent war.' He said that 'nothing—no regional adventure, no private interests, no faithfulness to any cause whatsoever—is worth launching a conflict in Lebanon over. Lebanon’s integrity, security and sovereignty must be preserved,' he added. This was not the first time Macron has been critical of Israel and Netanyahu. In March, he said that the forcible transfer of Gazans from Rafah ahead of a prospective Israeli military operation in the city would constitute a 'war crime.' The French president further stated that Paris was planning to circulate a draft resolution at the U.N. Security Council calling for 'an immediate and lasting ceasefire.'

Family reveals Hamas tortured Israeli hostage before execution	The 23-year-old’s last words were: 'They’ve caught me.' By Jewish Breaking News In a chilling interview with CNN, the sisters of slain hostage Eden Yerushalmi revealed the abuse she had endured while in captivity under Hamas. Eden was working as a bartender at the Nova music festival on October 7 when Hamas launched its unprovoked attack on Israel. As sirens sounded, Eden sent a video of rocket fire to her family group chat, informing them she was leaving the festival. For four hours, she spoke with her sisters May and Shani, who heard her desperate attempts to escape. The 23-year-old’s last words were: 'They’ve caught me.' Over the following months, the family received proof of life on three occasions, with the last coming just three weeks before Eden’s death. 'We feel like we’re in a nightmare,' Shani Yerushalmi told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. 'Sometimes it feels like it isn’t real, like it’s not happening to us, because the whole time we truly believed that Eden would come back home alive.' Based on information from the Israel Defense Forces, the family learned that she was kept Hamas’ vast network of underground terror tunnels in Gaza. 'They barely could stand fully … they couldn’t sleep next to each other, only in a line. There were no windows, no air, no light. Barely any food, and if they needed to go to the bathroom, they were forced to do it in a bucket,' Shani said. Tragically, Eden’s body was among six recovered by the IDF in late August from a tunnel beneath Rafah. The military informed the family that Eden had been shot in the head from close range and had defensive wounds on her hands. An autopsy revealed Eden weighed just 79 pounds at the time of her death. 'We gave her a last hug to say goodbye to her. She was so thin, we could feel her bones sticking out,' recounted May Yerushalmi. 'The most important thing is that she was a hero, and she survived 11 months in those tunnels.' 'They starved her before they murdered her.' The sisters of murdered hostage Eden Yerushalmi speak with Anderson Cooper: 'It feels like it’s not real. Like it’s not happening to us. The whole time we truly believed Eden would come back home alive.' pic.twitter.com/H8PKh5BzBV — The Persian Jewess (@persianjewess) September 21, 2024 The post Family reveals Hamas tortured Israeli hostage before execution appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/family-reveals-hamas-tortured-israeli-hostage-before-execution/	2024-09-22T09:25:53-07:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/F240901TN18.jpg
Report: Biden admin backs UN bid to shield Oct. 7th perpetrators ...	The Biden Justice Department is reportedly backing a bid by the United Nations to provide legal immunity to UNRWA employees involved in the atrocities of October 7th. By World Israel News Staff The United Nations has filed paperwork in an American court in a bid to secure legal immunity for suspected participants in the October 7th atrocities in southwestern Israel who were employed by a UN agency at the time of the massacres, Channel 12 News reported Saturday night. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA, has been under fire following revelations that a number of its employees have ties to Gaza terrorist groups including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Furthermore, a number of UNRWA employees are suspected of having taking part in the invasion of Israel on October 7th and the subsequent massacres and other atrocities. While Israel provided the UN with information on over 100 UNRWA employees suspected of being active members in Hamas, the agency performed an internal investigation on only 19 of the employees, finding that 9 of them 'may have been involved' in the October 7th atrocities, the UN's Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) ruled. Now, according to Saturday's report, the UN is working to shield the suspects from prosecution, relying on the functional immunity provided to the organization's employees. In its filing with an American court, the UN invoked its functional immunity, arguing that pending legal action against UNRWA should be dismissed. 'Since the UN has not waived immunity in this instance, its subsidiary, UNRWA, continues to enjoy absolute immunity from prosecution, and the lawsuit should be dismissed,' the UN is quoted as writing in the filing. The Justice Department has reportedly given its endorsement of the UN's invocation of immunity. 'The plaintiff's complaint does not present a legal basis for claiming that the United Nations waived its immunity. Therefore, because the UN has not waived immunity in this case, its subsidiary, UNRWA, retains full immunity, and the lawsuit against UNRWA should be dismissed due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction.' While the functional immunity does not bar the victims harmed on October 7th or relatives of those murdered from seeking damages from the United Nations for the actions of their employees, it does raise legal challenges to such law suits, requiring that the plaintiffs prove the need to strip the UNRWA employees of their immunity.

Far-left Democrats fume over cartoon linking Rashida Tlaib to Hez...	Members of progressive 'Squad' accuse conservative magazine of 'racism' after it publishes cartoon portraying anti-Israel congresswoman with exploding Hezbollah pager. By World Israel News Staff Far-left Democratic lawmakers, collectively dubbed the 'Squad,' castigated a cartoon published by a conservative magazine and a right-leaning newspaper last week, accusing the outlets of promoting 'racism' and 'Islamophobia.' Last Tuesday and Wednesday, in a series of bombings attributed to Israel, thousands of pagers and hand-held radios exploded simultaneously in three separate attacks across Syria and Lebanon. The devices had been issued by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah terror group to its operatives, and were apparently triggered after being packed with miniature bombs. Dozens were killed and thousands injured in the attacks. On Thursday, The National Review, a center-right magazine published a cartoon by Henry Payne, featuring Michigan Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian-American and member of the far-left 'Squad,' with the remains of a detonated pager on her desk, saying 'Odd. My pager just exploded,' implicitly linking the Israel-critic to Hezbollah. The cartoon, drawn by Henry Payne and published in the National Review and Detroit News. (X) The cartoon was also picked up by The Detroit News, a paper with a right-leaning editorial board. New York Congresswoman and fellow Squad member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned the cartoon, calling it an expression of 'anti-Arab hatred' and 'Islamophobia.' 'The way Islamophobia and anti-Arab hatred is so deeply normalized and accepted in our politics is horrifying,' tweeted Ocasio-Cortez. 'It rarely receives the equal condemnation it deserves. It is inexcusable and a massive double standard. This is disgusting. And so is the silence around it. We see it.' Missouri Congresswoman Cori Bush took aim at both The National Review and the Detroit News for publishing what she called 'Islamophobic trash.' 'NRO, DetroitNews, you should be ashamed for spewing this filth, betraying any shred of journalistic integrity, and putting communities in danger. You chose hate over truth. You’ve failed your readers and your community.' Tlaib herself weighed in on the cartoon, calling it 'disgraceful.' 'Our community is already in so much pain right now,' Tlaib tweeted. 'This racism will incite more hate + violence against our Arab & Muslim communities, and it makes everyone less safe. It’s disgraceful that the media continues to normalize this racism.'

Inside Israel’s pager and walkie talkie attacks	The operation took years of work, and was individually directed at the Hezbollah men who were wounded or killed. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News New details about the years-long effort Israel put into its alleged pager-walkie talkie attacks on Hezbollah members on Tuesday and Wednesday last week, emerged in a Saturday night report by Channel 12. Israel knew that Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah had ordered his men to stop using cellular devices years ago and move to more primitive devices out of fear that Israel could compromise the terror organization’s communications. According to Ronen Bergman, an investigative reporter for The New York Times and Yedioth Ahronoth cited in the report, instead of trying to intercept deliveries of beepers and walkie talkies to tamper with them, Israel decided to create a factory that produced them, with all the special changes included, and attract Hezbollah operatives to make a large purchase. Creating the devices was a hugely challenging technical task, a senior foreign security official told the news channel. 'The operation handled tens of thousands of pagers,' the official said. 'This is a worldwide operation that included a lot of technologies that were supposed to undergo acceptance tests at the customer, to hide explosive and spying mechanisms - without the devices being overweight [or] having a different shape - and that they could be used in the normal way.' According to another foreign official, the report said, the attacks were also very carefully calibrated in order to strike only terrorists. 'Each pager has its own serial number,' the official said. 'That way it was possible to control who would be hit and wouldn’t be.' Although videos showed how people standing next to victims were unhurt when their devices exploded, Lebanese media reported that at least two youngsters were killed in the Tuesday attack. It is possible that they were bringing the beeping pagers to their owners when they detonated. Possibly in line with the idea that individuals were deliberately targeted, Qatar Airways is reportedly now not allowing anyone boarding their planes from Lebanon's international airport to have either beepers or walkie talkies, in their carry-ons or checked luggage. It had also been widely reported that the IDF pushed the button that caused the thousands of communication devices to explode, killing at least 30 and wounding over 3,000, because Israel was afraid that its tampering was about to be discovered. Citing a senior foreign official who spoke with one of the operation’s commanders, the report said that this was not true. 'I spoke with several senior officials who strongly maintain that the operation was under threat of exposure every few months, this was nothing new,' the official said. 'There was indeed concern, but it was on the table at the highest levels even beforehand, because the army is not managing to defeat Hezbollah. There was a need to shift gears and this was one of the options on the table.' The point, said Maj. Gen. (res.) Amos Yadlin, a former head of Military Intelligence, was to cause Nasrallah to 'understand that continuing to fire on the north costs him much more than what he gains' by continuing to fire rockets and UAVs at Israel. The Iranian terror proxy has launched well over 8,000 airborne threats of various types from Lebanon in the 11+ months since the war began, driving 60,000 Israelis out of their homes on the border to limbo in hotels and other temporary places of safety further south. One major cost Israel is hoping for, said the report, is the erosion of support of the Lebanese people. 'There is no Shia house in Lebanon that does not contain at least one injured person. Some families are coming to Nasrallah and saying, 'What the hell?'' said Bergman. The attack also overloaded the country’s health system, with the thousands of injured rushed to hospitals in the immediate aftermath. The considerable number who will need long-term care or rehabilitation services will also strain the system, perhaps contributing to the population’s further disenchantment with Hezbollah. Israel isn’t done yet, either, as IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said on Wednesday. The Jewish state has 'many more capabilities' that it has yet to use against Hezbollah, and the army stands ready 'to do whatever is required' to enable the evacuated residents in the north to finally return home 'with a high level of security,' he said.

Northern Israeli hospitals moving underground	The safety measures were ordered as heavy Hezbollah rocket barrages have been fired as far south as Haifa. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News All hospitals in Israel’s north are moving their patients to protected spaces and even underground as a result of the heavy rocket barrages Hezbollah has launched since very early Sunday morning. Rambam Hospital in Haifa is shifting to its reinforced underground parking lot, which was prepared long ago with the infrastructure needed to care for patients in this alternative space. 'Due to the current escalation in the north,' said Rambam Director Prof. Michael Halbertal, 'according to the orders of the Homefront Command, the hospital is preparing to deal with &#8230; Alert Level 3.' 'This means that for the first time, the whole hospital is going down' to the vast protected space,' he added, and would stay there until further notice. The process of transferring patients, and moving all the medical equipment to the parking lot, will take 12 hours, he noted. Halbertal made a point of saying that anyone who needs emergency care should 'not hesitate' to come to the hospital, as 'the emergency rooms are working as usual.' Six other hospitals, including those in Tiberius and Nazareth, will now also operate from protective spaces until further notice. A seventh, the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya, had already had most of its functions based in its underground shelter for nearly a full year, since the start of the war. The Emek Medical Center in Afula announced that its delivery rooms, which were already in reinforced areas, are operating regularly as the staff prepares to evacuate the upper floors to its underground complex. In all the hospitals, elective and non-emergency surgeries have been canceled for now and outpatient clinics closed. They are also releasing all patients who can possibly go home. The hospitals have trained their staff for such a situation, and all swung into action immediately upon receiving the official notice. The Health Ministry has also been working with the northern hospitals for months to prepare them for a worst-case scenario in which each medical facility is on its own. The ministry’s director-general, Moshe Bar Siman Tov, spoke about this just last week at a health conference. 'We know that war is the so-called kingdom of chaos, and unexpected things will happen and we’ll have to deal with things in the end that we probably haven’t faced before,' he said. 'It’s possible that the hospitals will be what we call ‘a desert island,’ disconnected, and they will be the ones who will have to make the decisions,' he continued. 'We’ll help them with manpower, we’ll help them with equipment, but there will be many things here that we will really experience for the first time.' Part of the preparations for such a situation included the stockpiling of medications and blood supplies at each medical center. The hundreds of Hezbollah missile launches are its attempt to retaliate for the IDF assassinations over the weekend of over a dozen of the terror group's top commanders, as well as the pager and walkie talkie explosions last week that killed more than 30 Hezbollah operatives and wounded some 3,000.

‘We killed terrorists plotting a new October 7th’ – Herzog defend...	Israel's president defends strike on Hezbollah leaders and wave of pager bombings in Lebanon, telling UK media outlet Lebanon has been 'hijacked' by the pro-Iranian terror group. By World Israel News Staff Israeli President Isaac Herzog defended recent targeted Israeli attacks on members of the pro-Iranian Lebanon-based terrorist group Hezbollah in an appearance on the British media outlet Sky News on Sunday. Four Israelis were injured in a massive wave of Hezbollah rocket and missile attacks on northern Israel Saturday night and Sunday morning. On Friday, the Israeli Air Force eliminated 16 senior members of Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force in an airstrike on a Hezbollah position in the Dahieh neighborhood of Beirut. The airstrike came just days after a at least three waves of bombing attacks targeted pagers and hand-held radios issued by Hezbollah to its operatives across Lebanon and Syria, leaving dozens dead and thousands injured. In his interview with Sky News' Trevor Phillips, President Herzog said that the sixteen Radwan Force members eliminated in Friday's strike were plotting an invasion of northern Israel similar to the Hamas atrocities in southwestern Israel on October 7th. 'The simple message of Israel: we do not want war. We absolutely did not seek this war,' said Herzog. 'We do not want to get into a war with Lebanon, but Lebanon has been hijacked by a terror organization which is also a political party in Lebanon called Hezbollah.' 'It's been armed to its teeth by the Iranian empire of evil, and all of these leaders who were eradicated on Friday by the Israeli attack, all of these leaders were meeting together in order to launch the same horrific, horrendous attack that we had on October 7th by Hamas, by burning Israelis, butchering them, raping their women, abducting and taking hostage old people and young, and little babies – so this is exactly the same plan that they've been planning for years under the empire of evil of Iran.' Herzog emphasized that Israel has 'restrained' itself in its response to Hezbollah attacks since last October, but added that the country must fulfill its 'natural obligation' to protect its citizens in the north, noting that tens of thousands remain evacuated due to Hezbollah attacks. 'Hezbollah started this war. It started following the horrendous attack of Hamas on October 7, Hezbollah since then has been bombarding us endlessly. Almost 100,000 Israelis have been evacuated from their homes. The entire North has been shattered. We kept on being restrained and restrained and restrained, but something has to end. We have to bring our citizens back to their homes. That's the most natural obligation of any nation to its citizens.'

Washington ‘worried’ by slaying of terrorist who killed US soldie...	Israeli strike that killed terrorist responsible for bombings is 'very concerning,' says Biden administration official. By World Israel News Staff Biden administration officials praised a recent Israeli airstrike that killed a senior Hezbollah leader, but expressed their concerns that the assassination would lead to an all-out war between Israel and the terror group. On Friday, Israeli jets carried out a targeted airstrike on a building in Dahiyeh, a Beirut suburb and Hezbollah stronghold. Senior Radwan Force commander Ibrahim Aqil was killed in the bombing. Before his slaying, the U.S. had offered a $7 million reward for information leading to Aqil's arrest, due to his inovlvement in a 1983 bombing that killed 241 American soldiers in Beirut. 'Any time a terrorist who has murdered Americans is brought to justice, we believe that that is a good outcome,' National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said at a press conference shortly after the srike. 'That individual has American blood on his hands and has a Reward for Justice price on his head,' Sullivan added. 'He is somebody who the United States promised long ago we would do everything we could to see brought to justice.' Sullivan said that he believe Aqil's assassination had brought relief to those whose loved ones were murdered in the bombing, some 40 years ago. 'You know 1983 seems like a long time ago,' he said. 'But for a lot of families and a lot of people, they’re still living with it every day.' However, Sullivan said he was worried that Israel's strike would Speaking at the Israeli-American Council Confernece on Friday, White House Mideast czar Brett McGurk also praised the strike. However, McGurk quikcly segued into deanding that Israel step back from taking military action against Hezbollah, despite some eleven months of non-stop rocket fire from the terror group on Israel's north. 'Nobody sheds a tear' for Aqil, McGurk said. 'That said, we have disagreements with the Israelis on tactics and how you kind of measure escalation risk. It is a very concerning situation. I’m very confident that through diplomacy, through deterrence and other means, we’ll work our way out of it,' he added. 'We do not think a war in Lebanon is the way to achieve the objective, to return people to their homes. We also fully stand with Israel in their defense of their people and their territory against Hezbollah,' McGurk continued. 'We want a diplomatic settlement to the north. That is the objective, and that’s what we’re working towards.'

Hezbollah ‘didn’t imagine’ how hard Israel would strike, says Net...	After wave of pager and radio bombings, Israeli prime minister vows IDF will continue to hit Hezbollah until the Lebanese terror group 'gets the message'. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hinted at a major escalation in the simmering conflict between Israel and the Iranian-backed terror group Hezbollah, saying Sunday that Israel would continue to ramp up attacks on the Lebanese organization until it 'gets the message.' In a pair of video statements, recorded in Hebrew and English, Netanyahu vowed to secure Israel's northern border and restore security to towns across the Galilee and Golan Heights, as tens of thousands of residents remain evacuated nearly a year after the latest round of fighting began between Israel and Hezbollah on October 8th of last year. 'On October 7th, the Hamas terrorist monsters burst into Israel, murdered our people, raped and beheaded our women, burnt babies alive, and took 255 innocent people hostage, including many Americans,' Netanyahu said. 'A day later, on October 8th, another Iranian terrorist proxy, Hezbollah, attacked Israel completely unprovoked. They fired missiles and rockets into our cities. They made 60,000 Israelis leave their homes along the Lebanon border, becoming refugees in their own land.' 'In the subsequent months, they haven't stopped for a single day attacking us. No country can accept the wanton rocketing of its cities. We can't accept it either.' 'We will take whatever action is necessary to restore security and to bring our people safe back to their homes.' In the Hebrew video statement, Netanyahu alluded to a series of explosions across Lebanon and Syria last week, in which thousands of pagers and hand-held radios issued by Hezbollah to its operatives exploded simultaneously. 'Over the past few days we hit Hezbollah with a string of strikes that it didn’t imagine,' Netanyahu said, hinting at greater measures should the terror group fail to 'get the message.'

‘Canard’ – Florida governor warns two-state solution would mean e...	Florida Governor Ron DeSantis blasts international calls for Palestinian statehood, saying two-state solution is just a 'stepping stone' to annihilation of the Jewish state. By World Israel News Staff Florida Governor and former contender for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination Ron DeSantis condemned the two-state solution to the Israel-Arab conflict, calling it a 'stepping stone' to the destruction of the the State of Israel. Speaking at the annual Israel American Council summit in Washington D.C. over the weekend, DeSantis accused the Democratic party of catering to radical 'pro-Hamas' elements in the party's far-left base, while turning a blind eye to the rising specter of antisemitism on college campuses. 'It is pathetic that our nation’s oldest and largest political party feels the need to cater to its very own pro-Hamas pockets. If they were in my party, I’d want them to be kicked out of our Republican Party,' DeSantis said. 'What you're seeing on these college campuses, no question, is a lot of virulent antisemitism, a lot of hate. When you say ‘from the river to the sea’, you are chanting in favor of a second Holocaust. That's what that means.' 'I do think some of these students are just ignorant. I don't think they understand even what they're talking about. You hear some of them talking about ‘end the occupation of Palestine’. And I just think they need a little history lesson: There has never been a Palestinian Arab state!' DeSantis also criticized advocates for Palestinian statehood, warning that Israel's enemies are pursuing a two-state solution not as an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict, but as a means to annihilate the State of Israel. 'It's important for us in the United States to be very clear-eyed about what it means to be a strong ally of the State of Israel, and that means we should not embrace the canard of a two-state solution. That is not seeking to have peace. They are seeking that as a stepping stone to the destruction of the Jewish state and that is not acceptable!' 'You had a Partition Plan from the UN - Jewish state and Arab state,' DeSantis continued, referencing the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181, a non-binding measure passed by the international body in November, 1947. 'The Jews accepted the state and founded Israel. The Arabs rejected the state and they went to war to try to eradicate Israel, and they lost. And they went to war again and they lost in 1967 and 1973 and throughout the intifadas, and so no! That land historically has no stronger connection than any group of people except the Jewish people. It goes about thousands of years. Read your Bible!'

It is time for all countries with the mission of protecting world peace to come up with solutions that will stop Israel,' Erdoğan said. By The Algemeiner and Reuters Attacks on Lebanon this week 'It is time for all countries with the mission of protecting world peace to come up with solutions that will stop Israel,' Erdoğan said.showed that the Israeli government planned to spread the war to the region, Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdoğan said on Saturday, calling on Western countries to take 'deterrent steps' against Israel’s actions. Erdoğan told a press conference that Israel’s war in Gaza will top the agenda of his speech at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. 'In order for our region not to be dragged into a great disaster, the pressure on Israel must be increased even more,' Erdoğan told a press conference in Istanbul. He was commenting on attacks in Lebanon this week, including the explosion of Hezbollah members’ pagers and walkie-talkies that killed 39 people. The attacks on communications devices were widely believed to have been carried out by Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. 'It is time for all countries with the mission of protecting world peace to come up with solutions that will stop Israel,' Erdoğan said. 'In order to end this oppression that has been going on for almost a year, to establish a permanent ceasefire and to ensure the unhindered flow of humanitarian aid, all of us, the whole world and especially the UN, have important duties,' he said. Turkey has denounced Israel’s actions in Gaza, which came in retaliation to Hamas’s attack on Israel on Oct.7. Ankara has also halted all trade with Israel and submitted a request to join South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide. Israel has repeatedly dismissed the case’s accusations of genocide as baseless.

Gov’t okays five-year plan to transform Beersheva into metropolis	High-speed rail lines, a light-rail system, and long-term rental housing solutions are among the key projects slated for implementation. By JNS Israel’s Prime Minister’s Office and Finance Ministry have agreed on a five-year budget plan aimed at establishing Beersheva as a thriving metropolis, the PMO announced on Thursday. According to the PMO, the initiative comes as part of a broader strategy to revitalize the Negev. The cornerstone of the development plan is the relocation of key Israel Defense Forces units to the Negev, scheduled to commence in late 2025. The move is expected to serve as a catalyst for significant economic and demographic growth in the area, the PMO stated. The comprehensive plan, set to be submitted for government approval by year’s end, addresses critical infrastructure needs, including transportation, housing, employment and economic development. High-speed rail lines, a light-rail system and long-term rental housing solutions are among the key projects slated for implementation. 'This is a significant step that will enable us to face the challenges ahead, including the IDF’s relocation to the south,' said Beersheva Mayor Rubik Danilovich. 'We all understand that the Negev is the solution for the State of Israel. Now is the time to make dramatic decisions that will shape the country’s future and establish Beersheva as Israel’s leading metropolis. This is a national mission and a national interest!' Beersheva’s city engineer, Tamar Poria Adar, warned that the Negev would lose its Jewish majority within about 20 years unless decisive action is taken. This demographic shift, according to local leaders, is a direct consequence of years of neglect and insufficient investment in the region. Many residents of the south, while cautiously optimistic, remain wary. Yehuda Benano, chairman of the 'Residents for the Negev' organization, responded, 'The plans are ready in the drawer, and now is the time to act to ensure a Jewish majority that will live securely, prosperously and healthily, just like the residents of central Israel.' One concrete move in this direction, according to Health Minister Uriel Boss, is the recent approval for a second hospital in Beersheva, set to open by 2028 with approximately 600 beds. 'We are advancing another step in realizing the vision to reduce the gaps between the periphery and the center, and to provide equal rights to advanced health services for every citizen in the State of Israel,regardless of their place of residence, community affiliation, or economic situation,' Bosso said in a statement.

By JNS Israel filed an official petition to the International Criminal Court that it drop the prosecutor’s request to issue arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, the Foreign Ministry announced on Friday. 'Israel initiated two separate legal proceedings,' the Foreign Ministry statement read. The first legal case challenges the legal authority of the ICC to file such arrest warrants, the statement said. The second proceeding argues that chief prosecutor Karim Khan violated the court’s constitution and the principle of complementarity by not granting Israel the right to investigate itself the claims made by the ICC. 'Various leading countries (including member states of the ICC), organizations, and legal experts from around the world share the positions presented by Israel on these issues,' the Foreign Ministry stated. 'No other democracy with an independent and respected judicial system—as exists in the State of Israel—has received such discriminatory treatment from the prosecutor,' the statement went on to say. 'Despite this, Israel remains steadfast in its commitment to the rule of law and justice, and will continue to protect its citizens from the ongoing attacks and atrocities of Hamas and Iran’s other terrorist affiliates, in accordance with international law.' Earlier in the month, Khan pressed ICC’s Pre-Trial Chamber to file the arrest warrants, urging action ahead of Netanyahu’s scheduled address to the United Nations General Assembly on Sep. 27, Israel’s Ynet outlet reported. 'The prosecution respectfully requests that the Chamber issue its decision on the applications for the warrants of arrest against Yahya Sinwar, [Mohammed] Deif, Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant with utmost urgency,' Khan wrote in a six-page letter to the ICC justices. Netanyahu excoriated the chief prosecutor, stating that the comparison between Israelis and Hamas terrorists is 'pure antisemitism.' 'Unfortunately, we have seen from the beginning that the proceedings in The Hague are politically biased and have no professional legal basis whatsoever,' the premier added in a statement published by his office. The ICC has no jurisdiction as Jerusalem is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which established the court. But in a legalistic sleight of hand, the court claimed jurisdiction by accepting 'Palestine' as a signatory in 2015, even though no such state exists under international law. The 123 countries that are signatories to the Rome Statute are obligated to act on any arrest warrant it issues, raising the possibility that the two Israeli leaders could be placed under arrest while visiting these places.

4 wounded in non-stop Hezbollah barrages	3 people were lightly wounded, while one was reported to be in moderate condition after Hezbollah struck Haifa-area neighborhood. By World Israel News Staff Three Israelis were wounded after Hezbollah fired hundreds of rockets and missiles at northern Israel, in virtually non-stop barrages that began overnight Saturday. A rocket was said to have directly struck a residential neighborhood in Kiryat Bialik, a suburb of Haifa, with four people wounded by the blast. Hezbollah’s terrorism targets civilians.

All of the victims were transported to a local hospital for medical treatments. Footage circulating on social media from the impact site showed at least two cars on fire, along with extensive damage to homes, including partial structural collapses. A Hezbollah rocket directly struck a home in Moreshet, a moshav in northern Israel. No injuries were reported in that incident.

A 17-year-old was killed in a car accident near the Bedouin town of Zarzir, in an incident which was linked to the Hezbollah barrages. According to Magen David Adom paramedics, the teen had been driving when air raid sirens suddenly began wailing. He panicked, lost control of his vehicle, and tragically died in the ensuing accident. The Hezbollah barrages marked a major escalation by the terror group, which had mostly targeted communities in northern Israel directly adjacent to the border with Lebanon. But the barrages early Sunday morning targeted all areas of Israel's north, including its largest city, Haifa, and its environs, along with the Upper and Lower Galilee, Tiberias area, and the Jezreel Valley. Some of the Hezbollah rockets reached Israeli airspace some 105 kilometers (65 miles) south of the Israel-Lebanon border.

IDF shutters Al Jazeera offices in Ramallah: Report	IDF soldiers raid Al Jazeera offices, present bureau chief with 45-day closure order. By World Israel News Staff Israeli security forces raided the offices of the Al Jazeera news agency in Ramallah on Sunday morning, ordering the network's closure for the next 45 days. According to the Qatar-controlled Arabic-language outlet, Israeli soldiers entered the Palestinian Authority-administered enclave to present Al Jazeera's local bureau chief, Walid al-Omari, with an official closure order. Al-Omar bemoaned the decision, accusing Israel of media suppression. 'Targeting journalists this way always aims to erase the truth and prevent people from hearing the truth,' he said. Al Jazeera reporter Nida Ibrahim said the move 'was not a surprise,' after an Israeli court authorized the country's communications minister to shut down the network in Israeli territory. The 45-day closures, which began in May 2024, has been renewed multiple times, preventing Al Jazeera from broadcasting in the country. However, up until today, Al Jazeera's operations in Ramallah were unaffected by the Israel ban. 'We’ve heard Israeli officials threatening to close down the bureau. We’ve heard the government discussing this, asking&#8230;to close down and shut down the channel. But we [had] not been expecting it to happen today,' Ibrahim said. The Hamas-controlled media ministry in the Gaza Strip condemned the move, calling it a 'heinous crime&#8230;that is a blatant violation of press and media freedom.' Hamas' concerns over freedom of speech are notable, as the terror group regularly tortures and murders Gazans who criticize them on social media. Numerous Al Jazeera journalists have been revealed to be members of Hamas and other terror groups. Recently, an Al Jazeera employee confessed that he participated in the October 7th terror onslaught, along with Islamic Jihad terrorists. During the ongoing war, several Al Jazeera journalists have been killed by Israeli airstrikes. While the network has tried to falsely spin that Israel is intentionally targeting its journalists, nearly all of those killed were traveling in vehicles alongside armed terrorists, or were armed themselves.

IDF kills terrorists who murdered six Israeli hostages in tunnel	The IDF retrieved the bodies of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, Eden Yerushalmi, 24, Ori Danino, 25, Almog Sarusi, 25, Alexander Lobanov, 32, and Carmel Gat, 40, in Rafah last month. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari revealed that the IDF eliminated two terrorists who held the six murdered Israeli hostages whose bodies were recovered in late August. The IDF retrieved the bodies of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, Eden Yerushalmi, 24, Ori Danino, 25, Almog Sarusi, 25, Alexander Lobanov, 32, and Carmel Gat, 40, in Rafah. They were shot in the head execution-style just two days before their bodies were discovered by security forces. Hagari reported that 'troops from the 162nd Division identified two terrorists emerging from an underground tunnel shaft in the Tel al-Sultan area and eliminated them during an encounter.' He explained that the IDF was able to determine that the two neutralized terrorists were the ones who held the six murdered hostages by taking DNA samples from the equipment recovered after they fled and matching them with DNA collected in the tunnels where the hostages were held. 'Based on the findings and the information available to us, these terrorists that were killed were the same terrorists who were in the tunnel where the bodies of the six hostages were discovered,' said Hagari. 'The findings show they were there when they were murdered, and we are investigating their involvement in the murder. Should we obtain further information, we will first update the families and then the public,' Hagari added. Hagari concluded by saying the IDF will 'pursue and reach everyone responsible for this heinous murder, and we will not stop until we reach them all.' In addition to establishing the time of death and the cause of death, the forensic examinations showed that the hostages had suffered from neglect, that they had not bathed for a lengthy time, and that they had sustained severe injuries, which were later treated. The remains of the six captives were found without the benefit of intelligence information when a unit of IDF soldiers were traversing a tunnel under Rafah.

IDF announces new security restrictions for northern Israel	The restrictions apply to civilians from Haifa northward. By i24 and Algemeiner Staff Israel’s Home Front Command is issuing new security restrictions on civilians applying from the Haifa area and northward, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Spokesperson Daniel Hagari announced on Saturday. Hagari said educational institutions and workplaces are permitted to operate if an adequate shelter is nearby and can be reached in time. The official also announced restrictions on gatherings: Up to 30 people outdoors and 300 people indoors. The changes are unfolded as the IDF scales up its airstrikes against Hezbollah sites and rocket launchers in Lebanon.

Israel considers scrapping 200 shekel bill	Israel’s move is largely driven by its desire to combat black money transactions within the Arab sector. By Jewish Breaking News Israel may be on the verge of eliminating its largest banknote as part of an ambitious plan to combat crime. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated this massive economic reform during a Thursday meeting of the Subcommittee on Advancing the Fight Against Crime in the Arab Sector. At the meeting, he reportedly directed the Finance Minister and the Governor of the Bank of Israel to evaluate the feasibility of cancelling the 200 shekel note. According to Arutz Sheva, a plan is being drafted by a team of nine economists that proposes gradually phasing out the note. It would begin with the next printing cycle, followed by a brief transition period allowing citizens to exchange their existing 200 shekels. Within a few years the bill will be eliminated entirely. Israel’s move is largely driven by its desire to combat black money transactions within the Arab sector. Like most money laundering schemes, these illicit financial dealings frequently rely on high-value banknotes for their convenience and anonymity. However, some financial experts are warning of massive blowback from phasing out the 200 shekel note. They argue that sophisticated criminal networks will simply adapt by shifting to foreign currencies or more opaque digital alternatives. Meanwhile, small businesses, street vendors, and elderly individuals who rely on cash transactions will face financial exclusion. Furthermore, the costs of transitioning to a more cashless society, including investments in new payment infrastructure and public education, could be substantial.

IDF eliminates 16 Hezbollah Radwan commanders	Ibrahim Aqil was the top commander of the Radwan force and was planning an invasion of Galilee. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Friday, the IDF eliminated 16 top Hezbollah Radwan force commanders, including the leader Ibrahim Aqil. Israel's military operation targeted the Radwan Force commanders meeting in the basement of a building in the Dahieh neighborhood of Beirut. Aqil was the top commander of the Radwan force and was planning an invasion of Galilee. Ahmed Wahbi, head of the Radwan training unit, was also eliminated. Wahbi was also heavily involved in planning the Galilee invasion and, according to the IDF, was 'advancing Hezbollah’s entrenchment in southern Lebanon while attempting to improve the organization’s ground combat capabilities.' Other terror Radwan commanders killed in the operation included Hassan Hussein, commander of special forces in the Aziz regional division; Samer Halawi, commander of the coastal region; Abbas Muslimani, commander of the Qana region; Abdullah Hijazi, commander of the Ramim Ridge region; Muhammad Reda, commander of the Khiam region; Hassan Madi, commander of the Mount Dov region; Hassan Abd al-Satar, head of operations; Hussein Hadraj, chief of staff; Mohammad al-Attar, commander of the training department; and Mahmoud Hamad, a senior operations officer. Concerning the operation, the IDF said, 'These Radwan terror commanders were plotting an attack and invasion into Israel's territory for years and were ready to carry out the plans at a moment's notice when given the order.' 'Aqil and the other commanders eliminated in the strike were responsible for planning and executing hundreds of terror attacks against Israelis, including the planned invasion of the Galilee,' the IDF announced. Hezbollah, which doesn't always acknowledge the elimination of their leaders, confirmed that Aqil and others had been killed and said his body had been recovered from under the rubble. The attack on Friday further damaged Hezbollah's leadership and capabilities after massive explosions of walkie-talkies used by terrorists. The beeper explosions wounded thousands of terrorists and killed 37.

By TPS A short while ago, an Israeli airstrike targeted a building in Beirut, according to initial reports killing senior Hezbollah official Ibrahim Aqil. According to Alma Research and Education center, Aqil, also known by his aliases Al Haj Abdul Khader and Haj Tahsin, was a prominent figure in Hezbollah’s military structure. He served on the group’s Jihad Council and was responsible for overseeing Hezbollah’s air and ground units, including the elite Radwan forces. Aqil’s significance in the organization traces back to his involvement in attacks against American targets in Lebanon in 1983, alongside notorious operative Imad Mughniyeh.

Aqil reportedly had faced internal criticism recently over his handling of military operations during the ongoing war. According to the Department of State website, the U.S. government offers a reward up to 7 million dollars for information leading to his capture, citing his involvement in past terrorist activities. While Israeli officials await Hezbollah’s formal acknowledgment of Aqil’s death, Hezbollah-affiliated media have issued instructions not to spread rumors to avoid 'playing into the enemy’s hands.'

IDF and security forces eliminate terrorist leader in Judea and S...	Shadi Zakarneh was killed alongside other terrorists by an IAF strike on his vehicle after Shin Bet saw him traveling in Qabatiya. By World Israel News Staff On Thursday, the IDF and Israel's security forces (Shin Bet) eliminated a terror leader who planned numerous attacks in Northern Samaria. Shadi Zakarneh was killed alongside other terrorists by an IAF strike on his vehicle after Shin Bet saw him traveling in Qabatiya. The strike that killed Zkarneh also eliminated two other terrorists in the vehicle and a strike on an additional vehicle killed three others. The second vehicle was laden with explosives, and the strike caused multiple blasts. As part of the operation, four wanted security forces arrested terrorists. Troops from the elite Dudevan unit killed four terrorists during the battle and confiscated weapons belonging to the terrorists. The United Nations General Assembly is slated to vote on a new draft resolution that would, if passed, demand Israel ethnically cleanse Judea and Samaria of its Jewish population. The text of the draft calls explicitly for the end of Israel’s presence in Judea and Samaria and a full withdrawal of military forces and Israeli civilian populations,' Channel 12 reported Monday. The draft resolution will be placed on the General Assembly’s docket during its upcoming 79th session, slated to open on Tuesday. According to Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon, the General Assembly will vote on the resolution sometime next week. In addition to demanding Israel terminate its military and civilian presence in Judea and Samaria, the resolution calls on U.N. member states to impose sanctions on Israeli leaders and to adopt arms embargos on the Jewish state. In a statement late Sunday night, Danon excoriated the Palestinian Authority mission for submitting the draft, and called on the General Assembly to reject the proposal. 'The resolution calls, among other things, for the end of an Israeli presence in ‘the Palestinian territories’ within six months, the IDF’s withdrawal from ‘the territories,’ a halt to ‘settlements,’ and the return of [Palestinians] ‘to their land’. 'If this resolution passes in the General Assembly, especially on the one-year anniversary of the October 7th massacre — the deadliest attack against Jews since the Holocaust — it will be a reward for terrorism and a message to the world that the barbaric slaughter of children, the rape of women and the kidnapping of innocent civilians is a worthwhile tactic.' 'I call on the General Assembly to reject this disgraceful resolution outright, and instead adopt a resolution condemning Hamas and calling for the immediate release of all hostages. Let it be clear: nothing will stop Israel or deter it from its mission to bring home the hostages and eliminate Hamas.'

The deadly pager operation in Lebanon is no laughing matter. Or i...	A man dressed as an Orthodox Jew sits behind a table reading Honest Shlomo’s discount pagers. By Andrew Silow-Carroll, JTA First came the explosions. Then came the jokes. Within minutes of news that several members of Hezbollah were killed and hundreds wounded by pagers that had been doctored to explode en masse, allegedly by Israel, Jews on social media shared memes celebrating the operation and mocking its targets. Examples: A man dressed as an Orthodox Jew sits behind a table reading 'Honest Shlomo’s discount pagers.' A pager’s message reads '72 Virgins,' a reference to the concept that Muslim martyrs will be rewarded with 72 maidens in heaven. Some attributed the message to 'Moti Rola,' a spurious Hebrew name riffing on the Motorola brand. Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah, takes a call from a follower boasting that he found a good deal on the electronic devices. And because the pagers were presumably in the pockets of Hezbollah operatives, castration was a popular theme. One cartoon shows a dead Hezbollah man arriving in heaven to greet his virgins, who gasp at his missing genitals. The jokes continued on Wednesday, with news that walkie-talkies wired to explode had killed at least 25 in Lebanon. 'No more walkie. No more talkie,' wrote David Hazony, director and fellow at the Z3 Institute for Jewish Priorities, on X. The taunting memes and jokes came as a war on another front, in Gaza, grinds on; as negotiations over a ceasefire and efforts to free the Israeli hostages are at a standstill; and as Israel is still reeling from the murder of six hostages earlier last month who were seemingly on the verge of their rescue. For some, the humor is a release valve, celebrating what feels like a rare, clear Israeli 'win' in its second-front battle against an enemy that has fired rockets into the country’s evacuated north on a near-daily basis. For others, however, the mockery crosses a line, and violates a traditional Jewish ethic that discourages undue rejoicing over the deaths of one’s enemy. Laughing also became harder for some as it became clear that while the attacks were a long-planned operation designed to target Hezbollah operatives, others had been harmed, including children who were killed. Sometimes, both sentiments are being felt simultaneously. For Rabbi Ariel Rackovsky, of Congregation Shaare Tefilla, an Orthodox synagogue in Dallas, the memes were both humorous and troubling. 'Candidly, I thought they were hilarious,' he said in an interview. 'From the perspective of Jewish tradition, certainly for Israelis to be engaging in dark humor is absolutely a legitimate way to deal with stress.' Dear Hezbollah,There’s no other way. A little humor. The memes coming out are crazy. pic.twitter.com/yVhjk5alUi &mdash; Nancy Mako (@NancyMako) September 18, 2024 He quoted rabbis, including the 19th-century Modern Orthodox pioneer Raphael Samson Hirsch and Daniel Z. Feldman, a leading rabbi at Yeshiva University’s rabbinic seminary, who said humor is an appropriate response to stress. 'But at the same time, after that perhaps initial reaction, I think that is worth being a little more circumspect,' continued Rackovsky, who posted on Facebook about his ambivalence. 'After all, our tradition does teach us that we should not celebrate excessively over the downfall of our enemies.' The emotion he endorsed in his Facebook post was 'gratitude' to God for the success of the operation. 'We should absolutely be thankful to God, but maybe not hand out candies, and not just because the optics of that are not great,' he said. Rackovsky may have been referring to another widely shared video, of Israelis handing out candy in Jerusalem following the operation in Lebanon — a gesture often reported in Arab communities after terror attacks in Israel. In response to that video, Ori Riddleman, an X user with 8,500 followers, asked in Hebrew, 'When did the phenomenon begin that we began to imitate the behavior of terrorist organizations?' On this and other issues, Judaism has multiple perspectives, as was pointed out on X by Rabbi Josh Yuter, an Orthodox rabbi based in Israel. He weighed in on the debate over the memes by re-upping a four-year-old Twitter thread referring to a number of contradictory sources, from an admonition in Proverbs ('If your enemy falls, do not exult…') to a seeming endorsement in Psalms (​​'The righteous man will rejoice when he sees revenge…'). 'I remind everyone that conflicting perspectives regarding rejoicing over the downfall of one’s enemies are attested in rabbinic literature, with some sources being deliberately misinterpreted,' Yuter added on Wednesday. Sara Yael Hirschhorn, a historian who writes widely about Israel, put the operation and the reactions in the context of pro-Palestinian activists and human rights bodies that justify the attacks by Hamas and Hezbollah on Israeli civilians as 'resistance.' 'I don’t take glee in death, but if Western ‘morality’ has now decided that terrorists can kill Jews/Israelis as ‘resistance’ but not BE killed by state actors as internationally recognized terror organizations,' she tweeted, 'where are we as both an ethical universe and international system?!' #Hezbollah #pager memes please. pic.twitter.com/rdC9z9l1kA &mdash; Jacob Faturechi (@Jacobionite) September 17, 2024 The debate over rejoicing seemed to have cost at least one X user his job. Howard Feldman, who wrote about local politics for News24, a news service in South Africa, posted on the social media site Tuesday calling the attacks 'genius' and 'very cool' for their precision. He also joked, 'From the liver to the knee …' — a reference to the Palestinian nationalist slogan 'From the river to the sea.' A few hours later he posted a letter from News24’s editor in chief terminating his column and explaining, 'News 24 can in no way be associated with writers who glorify violence, which you did in my opinion.' Feldman responded: 'And just like that @News24 have shown me who they are…' Gallows humor is a core aspect of Israeli society and 'sick' jokes cropped up on Israeli social media even in the weeks after Oct. 7. On television, YouTube and social media, Israelis shared jokes about their own fears, what they saw as a propaganda war against Israel and Jews and the failures of their own government. And yet little of this humor was directly about the war in Gaza or the grim conditions on the ground there, noted Benji Lovitt, a Jerusalem-based comedian who has co-written a book about Zionism and Israeli culture. 'I didn’t see much humor about Gaza because it’s war, many people in Gaza have died and many, many are suffering,' he said. 'It doesn’t matter who you want to blame, but you don’t want to punch down and make fun of people in Gaza.' By contrast, he said, Hezbollah has been launching missile strikes on Israel for 11 months, and the electronics attacks are seen as surgically targeting its operatives and rebuking criticism that Israel’s bombing in Gaza has been indiscriminate. 'We are laughing because we believe it’s a clear example of punching up,' said Lovitt. 'And it’s an amazing story. I think people are laughing because they’re celebrating Israeli innovation. 'And it’s been a crappy year. People need to laugh.' The post The deadly pager operation in Lebanon is no laughing matter.

Trump calls Hezbollah beeper explosion operation ‘Amazing and sad...	Trump: 'That was a real operation; there's no doubt about it.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In an interview with NewsMax, former President and Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump praised the beeper detonation operation against Hezbollah and IRGC terrorists as 'amazing' while at the same time characterizing the attack as 'sad.' Like many others commenting on the event, Trump stressed the uniqueness of the operation and said, 'No one has ever seen anything like it. It is amazing. It's so sad in so many ways but amazing.' Trump added, 'Look, they're fighting to win. They're both fighting to win. No one has ever heard of or seen such a thing. That was a real operation; there's no doubt about it.' document.createElement('video'); During the Presidential debate with Democratic Candidate Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump grilled Harris on the sincerity of her expressed support for Israel. He noted that she had skipped Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyhau’s July address to Congress – an event she was meant to preside over as vice-president. 'She hates Israel. She wouldn’t even meet with Netanyahu when he went to Congress to make a very important speech. She refused to be there because she was at a sorority party of hers,' Trump said of Harris. 'If she’s president, I believe that Israel will not exist within two years from now, and I’ve been pretty good at predictions,' he said. Trump noted that less than a month before October 7th, the Biden administration chose to unfreeze billions of dollars in Iranian assets as part of a prisoner exchange deal. 'Iran has $300 billion because they took off all the sanctions that I had,' Trump said. 'Iran had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah or any of the 28 different spheres of terror, and they are spheres of terror, horrible terror.' Iran was 'broke,' he continued.

Hostage families call on UNICEF to protect Israeli children capti...	We need international organizations, including UNICEF, to reach them there, in Gaza, to check on them, to take care of them,' said Tomer Keshet, a cousin of Yarden Bibas. By Sveta Listratov, TPS The families of Israeli hostages re'We need international organizations, including UNICEF, to reach them there, in Gaza, to check on them, to take care of them,' said Tomer Keshet, a cousin of Yarden Bibas.ached out to UNICEF in a bid to gain the release of two children still being held in Gaza. In a letter to Ted Chaiban, Deputy Executive Director of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Professor Aron Troen, a public health expert and member of Israeli Association of Public Health Physicians, urged the agency to uphold its mandate of protecting children by advocating for the immediate release of child hostages. Among the 101 hostages being held by Hamas are five-year-old Ariel Bibas and one-year-old brother, Kfir, who were taken captive with their parents, Yarden and Shiri from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7. 'UNICEF’s raison d’être is to protect the welfare of children everywhere… Yet, they have been largely ineffectual and passive in protecting the human rights of Israeli children,' Troen told The Press Service of Israel. He stressed that three million Israeli children are suffering from the effects of the ongoing conflict, many of whom are displaced, living under the constant threat of rocket attacks, or dealing with trauma. Tomer Keshet, a cousin of Yarden Bibas, recounted to TPS-IL a meeting with UNICEF representatives, including Director Catherine Russell, in Jerusalem on April 15. 'We told her in detail about the day they were kidnapped, about the family, the kids. We want them not to be just numbers on a list, but real people,' Keshet recalled. 'Ariel looks shy but has the energy of a red-haired kid. And Kfir was so tiny when we last saw him, and by now he has spent more time in captivity than living as a free man.' Russell tweeted of that meeting that the families 'shared devastating accounts of captivity, loss & heartbreak,' adding 'All the hostages must be released immediately.' The tweet, Keshet told TPS-IL, was 'a step in the right direction, but it’s not enough.' 'We need international organizations, including UNICEF, to reach them there, in Gaza, to check on them, to take care of them. The kids cannot spend almost a year in a tunnel. They cannot.' The Bibas children were last seen in a video filmed by Hamas showing Shiri Bibas holding Ariel and Kfir in her arms covered by a blanket and surrounded by armed terrorists. In late November, 110 Israelis and foreign nationals were released as part of a week-long truce between Israel and Hamas, including 37 Israelis who were 18 or younger. While most of the women and children were freed, Shiri, Ariel and Kfir were not among those returned. Hamas claimed the Bibas children and their mother were dead but never provided evidence. After the hostages were freed, Israel denounced Hamas for branding brothers Yigal and Or Yaakov, ages 12 and 16 respectively, with a motorcycle exhaust pipe to prevent their escape, and drugging the children when moving hostages from one location to another. Troen’s letter criticized The International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations for not visiting Israeli child hostages even once to ascertain their conditions, noting, 'This appalling failure to address their fundamental human rights and health needs has had disastrous consequences.' The letter also raised the situation of other Israeli children who lost their parents. For example, Troen’s nephew, 16-year-old Rotem Mathias, was shot during Hamas’s attack on Kibbutz Holit on October 7. While Rotem survived, his parents did not. Troen also denounced UNICEF’s imbalanced criticism of Israel. 'We frequently see statements and reports regarding the suffering of civilians and children in Gaza, but we don’t see the same urgency for the hostages or the three million children in Israel enduring this protracted war,' he told TPS-IL. This imbalance, Troen said, has created 'a profound sense of neglect and frustration in Israel.' At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

US officials admit that Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal unlikely ...	No deal is imminent,' one of the U.S. officials said. 'I’m not sure it ever gets done.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Despite making hopeful remarks about an imminent hostage deal and ceasefire in Gaza for weeks, US officials are finally admitting privately that such an agreement is unlikely before US President Joe Biden leaves office, the Wall Street Journal reports. At the same time, US officials said they would continue to pursue a peace agreement to avoid an escalation of tensions that could spread beyond the region. Although US officials acknowledge that they could encourage the warring parties on '90 percent' of the agreement, several sticking points between Hamas and Israel prevent a deal from proceeding. 'No deal is imminent,' one of the U.S. officials said. 'I’m not sure it ever gets done.' Top-level officials in the White House, State Department, and Pentagon cited the number of type of Palestinian prisoners Hamas wants to be released in exchange for hostages and Israel's desire to maintain control of the Philadelphi corridor on the border between Gaza and Egypt as two main reasons for the impasse. Many officials are frustrated with Hamas's intransigence and habit of making more demands without then saying 'yes' even when the demands are fulfilled. These officials have wondered if Hamas wants a deal or is pretending to negotiate to bolster its image. Other officials are impatient with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's insistence that Israel maintain control of the Philadelphi corridor. 'There’s no chance now of it happening,' an official from an Arab country said.'Everyone is in a wait-and-see mode until after the election. The outcome will determine what can happen in the next administration.' John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman, told reporters Wednesday that chances of a deal were 'daunting.' Although there were times an agreement seemed imminent, 'we aren’t any closer to that now than we were even a week ago.' Biden administration officials are dismayed that the absence of a hostage release deal and ceasefire agreement by the time the President leaves office could leave a stain on his legacy.

‘Uncommitted’ group won’t endorse Kamala Harris, Muslim voters al...	Recent polling suggests that Muslim American voters are increasingly flirting with the possibility of casting a ballot for Green Party candidate Jill Stein over Harris. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner A prominent anti-Israel political group announced that it will not endorse Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 US election despite Harris’s extensive outreach to the Arab American community. In a statement released on Thursday, the 'Uncommitted National Movement' criticized the Harris campaign for not agreeing to meet with Palestinian American families to discuss the possibility of implementing an arms blockade on Israel and a permanent ceasefire in Gaza if elected to office in November. The group claimed that its decision not to issue an endorsement of Harris came after months of pleading with the Democratic nominee and current US vice president to adopt anti-Israel positions on her policy platform. 'For months, we have urged Vice President Harris to shift her Gaza policy so we could mobilize voters in key states to save lives and our democracy,' the group wrote. The group also griped about the Democratic National Convention’s (DNC) refusal in August to allow a Palestinian American to speak from the event main stage. 'The DNC and the vice president’s campaign fumbled even a small gesture to unite our party ahead of November by rejecting the simple request for a Palestinian American speaker. Now, the vice president’s campaign is courting Dick Cheney while sidelining disillusioned anti-war voices,' Uncommitted wrote. Despite refusing to throw its support behind the Democratic nominee, the group also warned about the dangers of electing former US President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican nominee, back into the White House, suggesting that he will intensify the so-called 'genocide' against Palestinians in Gaza. The organization also asserted that Trump will persecute 'pro-Palestinian activism in the US.' The movement also urged its supporters to refrain from voting for a third party candidate, arguing that it would assist Trump in his quest to regain the Oval Office. 'We must block Donald Trump, which is why we urge Uncommitted voters to vote against him and avoid third-party candidates that could inadvertently boost his chances, as Trump openly boasts that third parties will help his candidacy,' the group wrote. The Uncommitted movement’s decision to formally withhold support from Harris came on the heels of US Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), the only Palestinian American woman in Congress, publicly refusing to endorse the Democratic nominee while speaking to a crowd at the Congressional Black Caucus annual convention last week. During the event, Tlaib claimed that her constituents 'don’t want blood on my hands' and believe Harris will continue the policies that have allowed the war in Gaza to persist. Recent polling suggests that Muslim American voters are increasingly flirting with the possibility of casting a ballot for Green Party candidate Jill Stein over Harris, in part due to frustration over US policy toward Israel and Gaza. A new poll from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) revealed that 40 percent of Muslim voters in Michigan plan on voting for Stein. Harris trailed Trump with Muslim voters in Michigan, 18 percent to 12 percent, the poll found. Stein, a far-left political figure, has aggressively courted the Arab American vote since launching her campaign. During public appearances, she frequently dons the keffiyeh — a traditional Arab headdress that, since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October, has become a sign of support for the Palestinian cause — and refers to the conflict as a 'genocide.' Stein has also claimed that Hamas’s Oct. 7 slaughter of 1,200 people throughout southern Israel was justified as an act of so-called 'self defense.' In lieu of supporting a candidate for the upcoming presidential election, the Uncommitted movement encouraged the public to engage in 'anti-war organizing.' The refusal of the prominent pro-Palestinian group to endorse Harris was the latest blow to the Democratic nominee’s efforts to court Arab American voters. On Tuesday, the Harris campaign unveiled a set of new digital ads targeting the heavily Arab American city of Dearborn, Michigan. The ads included clips of Harris expressing sympathy for civilians in Gaza and vowing to 'not be silent.' The DNC, where Harris officially became the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee, hosted a panel on 'Palestinian Human Rights' for the first time in history, in which activists accused Israel of committing a 'genocide' in Hamas-ruled Gaza. Though Harris has voiced support for the Jewish state’s right to existence and self defense, she has also expressed sympathy for far-left narratives that brand Israel as 'genocidal.' The vice president has additionally often criticized Israel’s war effort against the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas in Gaza.

US warplanes, ships and troops ready in the Middle East if the co...	Here’s a look at the U.S. military presence in the Middle East. By The Associated Press The U.S. has kept an increased military presence in the Middle East throughout much of the past year, with about 40,000 forces, at least a dozen warships, and four Air Force fighter jet squadrons spread across the region both to protect allies and to serve as a deterrent against attacks, several U.S. officials said. As attacks between Israel and Hezbollah sharply spiked this week, worries are growing that the conflict could escalate into an all-out war, even as Jerusalem keeps up its nearly yearlong fight against Hamas terrorists in Gaza. Hezbollah says Israel crossed a 'red line' with explosive attacks on its communications devices and vowed to keep up the missile strikes it’s launched since fellow Iranian-backed terrorist group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, setting off the war in Gaza. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant — who has spoken repeatedly this week to U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin — has declared the start of a 'new phase' of the war, shifting its focus to the northern front against Hezbollah in Lebanon. So far, the U.S. hasn’t signaled a troop increase or change as a result of the latest attacks, and there is already a beefed-up force in the region. 'We’re confident in the ability that we have there right now to protect our forces and should we need to come to the defense of Israel as well,' Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Thursday. A military official said the additional resources have helped as the U.S. patrols various conflict areas, including operations targeting the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, defending Israel and countering threats from Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have targeted commercial ships in the Red Sea and launched ballistic missiles at Israel. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to describe U.S. troop movements and locations. Here’s a look at the U.S. military presence in the Middle East: Troops Normally, about 34,000 U.S. forces are deployed to U.S. Central Command, which covers the entire Middle East. That troop level grew in the early months of the Israel-Hamas war to about 40,000 as additional ships and aircraft were sent in. Several weeks ago, the total spiked to nearly 50,000 when Austin ordered two aircraft carriers and their accompanying warships to stay in the region as tensions roiled between Israel and Lebanon. One carrier strike group has since left and moved into the Asia-Pacific. The beefed-up presence is designed both to help defend Israel and protect U.S. and allied personnel and assets. Navy warships are scattered across the region, from the eastern Mediterranean Sea to the Gulf of Oman, and both Air Force and Navy fighter jets are strategically based at several locations to be better prepared to respond to any attacks. Warships The U.S. is back to one aircraft carrier in the region. Austin has extended the deployment of carriers several times in the past year so that on a few occasions, there has been the rare presence of two at once. American military commanders have long argued that the presence of a formidable aircraft carrier — with its array of fighter jets and surveillance aircraft and sophisticated missiles — is a strong deterrent against Iran. The USS Abraham Lincoln and its three destroyers are in the Gulf of Oman, while two U.S. Navy destroyers are in the Red Sea. The USS Georgia guided missile submarine, which Austin ordered to the region last month, had been in the Red Sea and remains in U.S. Central Command, but officials declined to say where. There are six U.S. warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, including the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship with the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard. And three Navy destroyers are in that area. About a half dozen of the F/A-18 fighter jets from the USS Abraham Lincoln have been moved to a land base in the region. Officials declined to say where. Aircraft The Air Force sent in an additional squadron of advanced F-22 fighter jets last month, bringing the total number of land-based fighter squadrons in the Middle East to four. That force also includes a squadron of A-10 Thunderbolt II ground attack aircraft, F-15E Strike Eagles and F-16 fighter jets. The Air Force is not identifying what countries the planes are operating from. The addition of the F-22 fighter jets gives U.S. forces a hard-to-detect aircraft that has a sophisticated suite of sensors to suppress enemy air defenses and carry out electronic attacks. The F-22 also can act as a 'quarterback,' organizing other warplanes in an operation. But the U.S. also showed in February that it doesn’t have to have planes based in the Middle East to attack targets. In February, a pair of B-1 bombers took off from Dyess Air Force Base in Texas and flew more than 30 hours in a roundtrip mission in which they struck 85 Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force targets in Iraq and Syria in response to an attack by IRGC-backed militias that killed three U.S. service members.

Trump holds 10-point lead over Harris with New York Jews, poll fi...	The poll indicates that some Jewish voters could be fleeing the Democratic Party over frustrations stemming from Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war and surging antisemitism. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump holds a commanding lead over her Democratic opponent Kamala Harris among New York Jewish voters in the 2024 election, according to the latest Siena College poll. The poll found that Jewish New Yorkers prefer Trump, who previously served as the 45th US president, over Harris, the current vice president, by a margin of 54 percent to 44 percent when including third-party candidates. If the US presidential election were held today and it was just a two-person race, the figures would only change slightly, with Trump beating Harris among Jewish voters in the Empire State by a margin of 54 percent to 46 percent. Conducted from Sept. 11-16, the findings suggest that Trump has made significant inroads with the Jewish community. Additional polling data from Siena indicates that Jewish voters are rapidly warming up to Trump as Election Day in the US inches closer. Trump led Harris 50 percent to 49 percent among Jewish New York voters in August, according to Siena College. In June, Jewish voters preferred then-presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden over Trump 52 percent to 46 percent. Trump’s favorability among Jewish voters has also significantly increased in recent months, according to the polling data. In July, 44 percent of Jewish voters indicated a 'favorable' view of Trump and 52 percent indicated an 'unfavorable' view of the former president. That number has surged since then, with 52 percent of Jewish voters revealing a 'favorable' view of Trump and 48 percent revealing an 'unfavorable' view of the Republican nominee in the latest poll. The poll represents the latest indication that at least some Jewish voters could be fleeing the Democratic Party, potentially over frustrations stemming from the Biden administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war and surging antisemitism within traditionally-liberal institutions. The data also indicates that Harris possesses notably weaker support among New York Jews than Biden, potentially suggesting dissatisfaction over the vice president’s positions on Israel or a lack of trust that she will forcefully defend the Jewish state’s interests. Trump has made numerous overtures to the Jewish community in recent months, attempting to win over a significant share of the traditionally-liberal voting bloc. He has delivered speeches at various events catered toward the Jewish community, including the Republican Jewish Coalition. The former president also co-hosted an event focusing on antisemitism at his Trump National Golf Club Bedminster alongside prominent Jewish donor Miriam Adelson. The former president has touted his former administration’s support for Israel as a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign. During his single term in office, Trump recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a strategic region on Israel’s northern border previously controlled by Syria. He also moved the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, recognizing the city as the Jewish state’s capital. The Trump administration also helped to broker the Abraham Accords, which normalized Israel’s relations with four Arab countries in 2020. Evidence of Trump’s success in wooing Jewish voters has been replicated by other polls. A July survey conducted by pollster Richard Baris showed that Jewish voters nationally prefer Harris over Trump by a margin of 52.7 percent to 45.9 percent. However, a poll commissioned by the Jewish Democratic Council of America released earlier this month found that 72 percent of Jewish Americans plan on casting a ballot for Harris and 25 percent are poised to do the same for Trump.

Austin: US support for Israel ‘unwavering’ amid Iran threats	Gallant said that he discussed with Austin the 'strategic, regional picture,' and briefed the Pentagon chief 'on IDF operations in the southern and northern arenas, focusing on Israel’s defense against Hezbollah threats. By JNS U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke overnight Wednesday with his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant to review regional security developments. Austin 'reiterated unwavering U.S. support for Israel in the face of threats from Iran, Lebanese Hezbollah, and Iran’s other regional partners,' and 'emphasized the U.S. commitment to deterring regional adversaries and efforts to de-escalate tensions across the region,' according to a readout provided by Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder. The secretary also 'reaffirmed the priority of achieving a Gaza ceasefire deal that will bring home hostages held by Hamas, and an enduring diplomatic resolution to the conflict on the Israel-Lebanon border that will allow civilians on both sides to return to their homes.' Gallant said that he discussed with Austin the 'strategic, regional picture,' and briefed the Pentagon chief 'on IDF operations in the southern and northern arenas, focusing on Israel’s defense against Hezbollah threats. 'I expressed my appreciation to the Secretary for his unwavering commitment to Israel’s security and contribution to the U.S.-Israel alliance,' the minister said. During a telephone conversation on Monday, Gallant told Austin that time was running out for an agreed-upon de-escalation with Hezbollah. 'The possibility of a settlement in the north is passing. Hezbollah continues to tie itself to Hamas. The direction is clear,' said Gallant. On Thursday morning, eight people were wounded when two anti-tank missiles fired from Lebanon struck the Ramim Ridge area of Israel’s Upper Galilee. On Wednesday, in the second wave of such incidents, communications devices used by Hezbollah terrorists exploded across the group’s stronghold in Beirut and in Southern Lebanon. According to Lebanon’s Health Ministry, at least 20 Hezbollah operatives were killed and some 450 were wounded. On Tuesday, more than 2,700 Hezbollah members were wounded and at least 12 were killed across Lebanon when their pagers exploded, with the terrorist organization saying it held Israel 'fully responsible.' Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attacks.

Defense Minister Gallant says he is ‘unfamiliar’ with ‘one-shot’ ...	IDF official Nitzan Alon said Gal Hirsch, who presented the deal to US officials, 'was never a part of the negotiating team.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Maj.-Gen. (res.) Nitzan Alon, the IDF official overseeing the issue of captives said they were not familiar with the 'one-shot' deal that negotiator Gal Hirsch reportedly submitted to US officials. Although Hirsch has been described as a negotiator on behalf of the hostages, Alon said he was 'never a part of the negotiating team.' Alon told N12, 'The proposal that Gal Hirsch submitted to the US is not known to the negotiating team; Hirsch was never part of the negotiating team.' Gallant said he was also unfamiliar with the plan. KAN News reported earlier Thursday that Israeli officials had met with their US counterparts and had agreed to a framework that would see the release of all the hostages at once, an immediate cessation of hostilities in Gaza, and a safe exit for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and his deputies. The proposal also includes the release of dangerous Palestinian prisoners from Israeli custody, the demilitarization of Gaza, and the establishment of a new governance system for the region. However, the specifics of these components remain undisclosed. An Israeli official told KAN, 'Due to difficulties in negotiations and the ticking clock regarding the abductees' lives, we wish to propose a 'secondary plan' that would shorten the stages and allow for a faster agreement. This will happen if Sinwar leaves and ends the war. It will also help us achieve the goals of the war while enabling the Hamas leadership in Gaza to leave safely.' However, the new information that Alon and Gallant were unfamiliar with and not connected with the plan was met with disappointment and outrage from the Hostage and Missing Persons Families Forum, and they called out Gal Hirsch for falsely raising expectations that the plan was approved and going forward. 'Gal Hirsch has once again chosen to carry out a cynical, cheap, and disgraceful manipulation at the expense of the hostages, their families, and the people of Israel. This is a deception aimed at thwarting the new American initiative for the release of the hostages and ending the war in Gaza.' The Hostage and Missing Persons Families Forum also blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government for the lack of a deal and accused him of 'abandoning the hostages.'

Hezbollah leader admits Israel dealt ‘a heavy blow’ with beeper e...	Nasrallah: 'We undoubtedly suffered a major security and humanitarian blow, unprecedented in the conflict and maybe in the history of mankind.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Thursday, Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah admitted that the explosion of beepers that killed dozens and wounded thousands of terrorists was a 'major blow.' He said, 'We undoubtedly suffered a major security and humanitarian blow, unprecedented in the conflict and maybe in the history of mankind.' Nasrallah added, 'We were hit hard, but that's the situation in war. We understand that the enemy has technological supremacy. Especially since it is supported by the US and the West.' Israel has not taken responsibility for the pager explosions, and the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden Administration had no involvement in the attacks. He continued, 'When we are in conflict, we bet on Jihad, on attrition. We had many victories until now.' Nasrallah added that he is determined that Hezbollah 'won't be knocked down' by the the beeper explosions. 'We will be ready to overcome all of the threats and attempts in the future,' he said. The terror leader said that the pager explosions, 'crossed a red line' and was tantamount to a 'declaration of war.' 'Israel crossed all the red lines by detonating thousands of pagers. This could be called a declaration of war,' he said. Although the pagers were in the hands of terrorists, Nasrallah claimed that the explosions caused substantial civilian casualties, including women and children, claims which have not been substantiated. 'The devices exploded in unison in the hospitals as well. As a result of the aggression, dozens were killed, including women and children, and thousands were injured. The true numbers will come with time,' he said. 'This is an act of terror, massacre, genocide,' Nasrallah said. However, in his next sentence, Nasrallah admitted the pagers belonged to terrorists and not civilians and explained, 'More than 4,000 pagers were distributed to the organization's operatives.' Nasrallah threatened Israel that residents of the north would not be able to return to their homes and that Hezbollah would continue their attacks in the region. 'We tell Netanyahu, Gallant (the Defense Minister), and the Israeli military - you won't succeed in returning the residents of the north to the north, do what you want, you won't succeed.' Since October 8th, 2023, Hezbollah has fired missiles almost daily into the north, and 60,000 residents have been evacuated. Nasrallah said the only thing that will stop the terror group from attacking northern Israel is a ceasefire in Gaza. 'The only way is to stop the aggression and the war against the people of Gaza and the West Bank, without that there's nothing. Not an escalation, not eliminations, and not a full war,' he said.

Security expert reveals how Iran recruits Israeli agents	Maman knew that the discussions’ goal was to 'advance assassination attacks' on Israeli officials, the Shin Bet said. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Following the arrest on Thursday of 73-year-old Israeli Moti Maman from Ashkelon on charges of spying against Israel for Iran, security officials reveal how terror states like Iran recruit Israelis, sometimes unwittingly, sometimes with full awareness of the crime. Maman was detained in a joint operation between the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) and the Israel Police's Lahav 433 National Crime Unit. The businessman, who spent a significant amount of time in Turkey, became acquainted with Iranian agents who recruited him to carry out surveillance activities, such as photographing public places in Israel. Maman knew that the discussions’ goal was to 'advance assassination attacks' on Israeli officials, the Shin Bet said. Iranian officials also asked the Israeli if he could help recruit assassins to kill Iranian dissidents living in exile in the West. Maman demanded an advance payment of one million dollars before carrying out any missions on behalf of Iran. That request was denied, but the Iranians compensated Maman for participating in the meetings with 5,000 euros. Maariv spoke to Lior Ackerman, Head of National Resilience at the Institute for Policy and Strategy at Reichman University and Chairman of the New People's Council, about how Iran and terrorist organizations recruit Israelis. 'Iran's efforts at recruiting Israeli agents and instructing them to operate within Israel are not new. For years, Shin Bet has foiled numerous plots, thwarted incidents, and made arrests. Shin Bet succeeded on many occasions in stopping the incidents before they caused damage.' In many cases, the Israelis targeted are unaware of the motives of the people they meet online, and Iran often tries to contact vulnerable people through fake profiles on social media. 'The Iranians frequently operate through social media and use fake profiles. They have often recruited Israelis who were naive to gather information for them.' However, Maman's current case doesn't appear to be an example of Iran recruiting an unwitting agent through social media. 'This case is unusual because it involves locating a specific Israeli and recruiting him to assist in carrying out actual attacks within Israel in exchange for money. ' 'He was even taken to meetings in Iran. Clearly, this is not a case of an innocent citizen who didn't know what he was doing.'

‘We need to bring another blow’: Northern Israeli residents react...	Northern residents were forced to evacuate their homes when Hezbollah began launching rockets and drones in October. By Anna Epshtein, TPS In the lobby of the Jerusalem Royal Hotel, despair mixed with hope for evacuated residents of the northern community of Shlomi as they watched news reports of Hezbollah’s exploding communication devices on Wednesday. They hope that the 'pager attack,' as they referred to it, is the beginning of a new phase of war with Hezbollah they have been calling for so they can safely return to their homes, they told The Press Service of Israel. Thousands of Hezbollah operatives were injured when their pagers and walkie-talkies blew up on Tuesday and Wednesday. Hezbollah said 32 of its people were killed, a number that has not been independently verified. 'It was good to hear,' Inbar Ben Arush, a manicurist and a mother of two, tells TPS-IL. 'And don’t get me wrong, I am not happy about the war. I was a leftist before October 7, but my conceptions have changed. We don’t have a partner for peace there. We tried for almost a year to find some diplomatic solution. And we know too well that without a serious army operation in Lebanon, we won’t be able to get back home,' she adds while setting up a table for a manicure. Sitting nearby with her knitting, Mazal Hakim asks, 'How long can you live in a hotel? It’s good for three days, maybe a week. We have been here for almost a year. We broke here, became sick. Almost all of the grown-ups.' At another table, Braina Wasserman plays a card game with her teenage granddaughter. The game is called 'touch' and it’s not clear who is winning. Braina tells TPS-IL she has been playing this for hours with the kids from Shlomi because 'It helps the time pass.' As a boy aimlessly walks his bicycle back and forth near the table, Braina tells TPS-IL, 'It’s not nice to be happy about somebody’s death, but I was happy. For what they did to us, they do not deserve mercy.' Braina does not believe the 'pager attack' will get her home any time soon. 'I know I’ll be here for the holidays, and maybe for another year, too,' she says. Rosh HaShanah, the Jewish new year, begins on October 2 at sundown. Meir Navon, a retired naval officer, is on the phone trying to obtain a shofar, a ram’s horn traditionally blown during the High Holidays. Evacuees pray in an improvised synagogue in the lobby. 'After this attack, the enemy is on the floor, and we can’t let him stand up again. We need to bring another blow, and then another one, until he is destroyed,' Navon told TPS-IL. 'I was disappointed that after the attack Israel did not start a ground operation in Lebanon immediately. We are too merciful,' he adds. Meir’s friend, Mahluf Tubul nods in agreement. One of the founders of Shlomi in the 1950s, Tubul remarks, 'If Israel does not enter the war in the north, we will lose it.' On Monday, the Security Cabinet updated its official war goals to include the secure return of 60,000 evacuated northern residents to their homes. Northern residents were forced to evacuate their homes when Hezbollah began launching rockets and drones in October. Hezbollah leaders have said they will continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. The attacks have so far killed 26 civilians and 20 soldiers on the Israeli side. According to figures released by the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) Hezbollah fired 1,307 rockets at northern Israel in August, an average of 40 rockets daily. Since October 8, Hezbollah has launched more than 6,700 rockets and drones. Israeli officials have been calling for Hezbollah to be disarmed and removed from southern Lebanon in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War. Israel’s three other official war goals are the eradication of Hamas’s military and governing capabilities, the return of all hostages, and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

‘No blood money’ – Norwegian soccer player snubs Israeli team, ci...	Norwegian striker for Rosenborg soccer club rebuffs nearly one million dollars offered by Maccabi Haifa, rejecting 'blood money' to play for Israeli team. By World Israel News Staff A Norwegian soccer player turned down an offer by an Israeli soccer club, citing the ongoing war between Israel and the Hamas terror organization, accusing the soccer team of offering him 'blood money.' Maccabi Haifa, based in northern Israel, had sought to sign 28-year-old Trondheim-native Ole Christian Hammerfjell Sæter, currently a player with the Rosenborg Ballklub soccer team. Hoping to secure Sæter on their roster prior to the end of the Israeli Premier League's transfer window, Maccabi Haifa offered 850,000 Euros ($950,000) to Rosenborg to sign the forward. On Wednesday, however, Sæter publicly ruled out the possibility of joining Maccabi Haifa - or any other Israeli team - saying that playing with an Israeli soccer club violated his 'values,' referencing the ongoing war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas and castigating the IDF's policies in the coastal enclave. 'I will not represent a country that perpetuates insecurity and evil with the killing of innocent people,' Sæter said. 'No amount of money can buy my values. I choose humanity over blood money. Even if I were offered billions, I wouldn’t move there.' 'I am confident in my values and happy to stand by what I believe is right. I don’t want such money in my account. There are people there who can’t live safely in their own homes. It’s quite insane. There’s no way I will represent a country that acts like that.' In 2023, Sæter, who is one quarter Pakistani by heritage, hinted that he might consider playing on Pakistan's national soccer team, uploading an image of himself wearing a Pakistani jersey to X.

Mossad established fake electronics company to plant bombs in Hez...	Hungarian electronics company which licensed out Taiwanese brand was reportedly established by Israeli operatives for the Mossad operation against Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff The company responsible for manufacturing the pagers involved in the wave of explosions targeting Hezbollah terrorists in Syria and Lebanon was established by Israeli operatives as part of the Mossad operation to target the Iranian-backed Lebanese terror group, The New York Times reported Wednesday. Thousands of Hezbollah members were wounded and at least 32 killed in a pair of bombing attacks Tuesday and Wednesday, in which thousands of pagers and hand-held radios simultaneously detonated across Lebanon and Syria, apparently the result of Israeli sabotage. Hezbollah had ordered the devices as part of its plan to evade Israeli tracking through modern cellular devices. It appears, however, that the pagers ordered by Hezbollah and distributed to its members were in fact supplied by a shell company which had been established by Israel's Mossad, according to the Times report. The pagers in question, AR-924 model devices bearing the Gold Apollo brand, were manufactured by an outside party which had licensed the Taiwan-based company's brand. On Wednesday, Gold Apollo founder and president Hsu Ching-Kuang told reporters that the Hungarian company BAC was responsible for the pagers' manufacture. 'The product was not ours. It was only that it had our brand on it,' Hsu said. 'We may not be a large company, but we are a responsible one,' the Gold Apollo president said, expressing surprise that the pagers could be rigged with explosives and detonated. 'This is very embarrassing.' Hsu added that BAC’s payments to Gold Apollo for use of its license were 'very strange,' saying the payments originated in the Middle East. According to the Times report, as Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah became increasingly concerned by Israel's ability to track the movement Hezbollah terrorists and sought alternative communications methods, Israeli security intelligence officers began making preparations for the operation which culminated in the attacks Tuesday and Wednesday. At least three separate shell companies were established for the purposes of the operation, three intelligence officials said, adding that BAC served a number of customers in order to establish and maintain its cover, manufacturing 'a range of ordinary pagers.' While the first pagers were delivered to Hezbollah in the summer of 2022, production was accelerated dramatically in February, which thousands of devices delivered this summer.

United Arab Emirates strategic analyst blasts Iranian-backed terror groups, mocks Hezbollah after it suffered two waves of bombing attacks. By World Israel News Staff A journalist and strategic analyst focusing on Middle Eastern affairs from the United Arab Emirates took aim at Iranian-backed anti-Israel terrorist groups Wednesday, castigating them for the attacks on Israel on October 7th, and mocking Hezbollah after a pair of apparent Israeli attacks left thousands of terrorists injured. Amjad Taha, author of The Deception of the Arab Spring, excoriated Hamas and Hezbollah in a tweet Wednesday night, while cheering a pair of attacks - widely attributed to Israel - targeting Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon and Syria. 'You dared to strike at a smart and courageous nation on October 7th—committing genocide, kidnapping their children, and violating their women,' Taha wrote. 'You thought they would fall, but they rose again, returning after 11 months to correct what had only momentarily slipped—their intelligence. Now, they will send you back 1,000 years, to a time without technology, where a ringtone feels like a death knell and a beep is a nightmare.' Taha praised Israel for accomplishing what he dubbed a 'victory' for 'all who stand against terror.' 'You will be haunted by your own shadow, too afraid to use any technology, cut off from the advanced world. And they will defeat you—not with bullets or tanks, but through the unbreakable will of brave, intelligent people.' 'Over a simple cup of coffee, with one decisive click, they will seal your fate, and the fate of anyone who dares harm their children. This is a nation the world respects. Lebanon—Hezbollah's pager attacks and today's V82 strike are not merely military victories; they represent a triumph for the Middle East over radicalism—a victory not only for Israel but for all who stand against terror.' In another tweet Wednesday, Taha castigated Hezbollah for its involvement during the Syrian civil war, celebrating Israel's targeted attacks on Hezbollah operatives - detonating pagers and hand-held radios on Tuesday and Wednesday. 'Once again, Israel's remarkable fireworks light up Lebanon, as Hezbollah members gather to bury their 'pagers 1' victims—only for 'Pager 2' to begin, burying the burriers.' 'Today, new communication systems, vehicles, and locations tied to Hezbollah—the same group responsible for slaughtering innocent babies, raping women, and committing genocide in Syria—are targeted.' 'This terrorist organization, which has displaced millions of Muslims, Arabs, Jews, and Christians from northern Israel by attacking hospitals and schools, is being systematically dismantled. Many admire Israel's effective methods in eliminating these savage terrorist animals in Lebanon.' A long-time critic of Hezbollah, in June, Taha compared the terrorist group to Nazi Germany. Hezbollah, Taha said, is 'not different than the Nazis.'

Israel proposes alternative hostage deal with Hamas	Details include all hostages to be released at once in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, Hamas leaders to be exiled, and a multinational force to oversee the ‘day after.’ By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel has sent the United States a new deal it is willing to conclude with Hamas that would free the hostages and end the war all in a single phase, Israel's Hebrew-language press reported Thursday. The main sticking points in the current proposal revolve around its three stages. Israel fears that Hamas would backtrack after releasing only the first group of hostages, and has refused the terrorist group's demand for the IDF to leave the Philadelphi Corridor, a critical security zone. In the new deal, all the hostages would be released at once and an as-yet unknown number of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails would be freed. In addition, safe passage to a third country will be guaranteed for Hamas head Yahya Sinwar, which he had recently insisted be part of a deal, and for all terrorists who want to leave Gaza, which could number in the thousands. The process of demilitarization, meaning the destruction of Hamas huge arsenal of weapons, would commence immediately upon their departure and the concomitant withdrawal of Israeli military forces from the Strip. A multinational force would oversee Gaza’s disarmament and, eventually, its reconstruction. The supervising countries were not identified by name. There are reportedly several options, such as a combination of American and Sunni Arab states. If the deal is not executed within the listed time frame, the proposal states that the IDF will be allowed to return and recommence the war. The government’s coordinator on the hostage issue, Gen. (res.) Gal Hirsch, has already presented the plan to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which reacted positively to the idea. 'We welcome [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu's new outline: a one-shot deal and the end of the fighting,' the Forum said in a statement. 'A one-shot deal that includes all 101 abductees is the wish of all Israeli citizens in general and the families of the abductees in particular&#8230;. The prime minister must lead with courage, determination and speed the proposal he formulated.' Several families of male civilian and soldier hostages, who were to be released only in the second stage of the current plan, had opposed it because they feared that Hamas would renege after the first stage and murder those who were still left in their hands. According to Kan News, hostage families are demanding that the prime minister give voice to his new proposal at the opening of the UN General Assembly next week, which he is scheduled to address on September 26.
