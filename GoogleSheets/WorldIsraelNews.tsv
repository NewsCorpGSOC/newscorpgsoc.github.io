Gaza rockets fired at Jerusalem, IDF calls for urgent evacuation	The attack triggered air-raid sirens in the capital, the Western Negev and the the Judean Foothills. By JNS The Israeli Air Force on Saturday downed two rockets fired by Palestinian terrorists in the northern Gaza Strip towards Jerusalem. The attack triggered air-raid sirens in the capital, the Western Negev and the the Judean Foothills. Following the rocket fire, the military again called on Palestinians to evacuate parts of the northern Strip. 'Urgent warning to all those who have not yet evacuated the area specified in the map, and the Beit Hanun area [in the Strip’s northeast] in particular,' Col. Avichay Adraee, the IDF’s Arabic-language spokesman, posted to X. 'This area has been warned many times in the past. The IDF is operating in this area with force. You must evacuate the area immediately and move south towards Salah El Din Road. Moving via another road exposes you to danger,' he added. On Dec. 11, Palestinian terrorists in Gaza fired four rockets at southern Israel, setting off sirens in several towns and villages along the border. The Israel Defense Forces intercepted two of the rockets, with the others impacting in open areas, causing no damage. On Dec. 3, the IAF intercepted one rocket fired from northern Gaza. The IDF’s year-plus-long offensive against Hamas in the enclave has greatly curbed rocket fire from the Strip, although Palestinian terrorists still intermittently target the Jewish state.

Jonathan Pollard Explores Knesset Run	Pollard is reaching out to voters who are disillusioned with Netanyahu and Naftali Bennett. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Jonathan Pollard, the outspoken former spy who spent 30 years in a US prison, is considering a Knesset run. In the past few weeks, Pollard has met with current ministers, candidates and other public figures such as Brig. Gen. (Res.) Ofer Winter and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. Pollard is reaching out to voters who are disillusioned with current Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the former premier Naftali Bennett. Pollard's focus is right-leaning voters, both religious and secular. Pollard characterized his platform: 'My goal is to unite those in the ideological right who love Israel and want to contribute to the state.' 'National service, whether in the IDF or another framework, is a critical issue for me. Everyone, without exception, must serve the state in some way,' he continued. Pollard's staunch stand on National Service includes a proposal to suspend voting rights of those who refuse to serve. He said, 'You can pray and study Torah, but you cannot refuse to contribute to the state.' Although Pollard stated that one of his goals is to unite the political right, he expressed an unwillingness to work with Naftali Bennett. Pollard said,'I don’t see any possibility of cooperating with Bennett. I don’t believe him after he promised his voters he wouldn’t align with the left, and then formed a government with them.' He added, 'Politics is politics, but honesty and loyalty to your promises are fundamental, and that’s what Bennett lacks.' Last year, speaking to students who combine Torah study with army service Pollard said, Last month, speaking in Haifa to students who combine Torah study with army service, he had said, 'The army must undergo a reform and a fundamental change from within. The change must be carried out in two ways: from the top down, and from the bottom up…. replacing the Chief of Staff and changing the face of the entire General Staff so that the new spirit will change first at the top of the system and will trickle down to the last of the soldiers as well.'

IDF arrests 240 Hamas terrorists at Gaza hospital	The IDF evacuated 350 patients and medical professionals from the facility prior to the raid. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The IDF and Israel's security forces confirmed they arrested over 240 terrorists at the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya, northern Gaza on Friday. The military activity followed an intelligence report that the hospital was embedded with terrorists. Working in coordination with COGAT, the IDF completed an evacuation of 350 patients and medical professionals from the facility prior to the raid. Israel's military also ensured the delivery of food, fuel and medical supplies to keep the treatment areas functioning. In addition, 95 patients and staff were transferred to the Indonesian hospital in Gaza along with two generators and thousands of liters of essential supplies. The 401st brigade, located around the perimeter of the hospital,arrested terrorists and eliminated those who attacked troops or resisted arrest. Israeli special forces found in the hospital an arsenal of weapons, including grenades, firearms, and other military equipment. Terrorists attempted anti-tank missile and RPG attacks but were neutralized by IDF soldiers The IAF launched airstrikes against terrorists attempting to flee the hospital. On Tuesday,The IDF eliminated five terrorists and arrested dozens more at the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza. According to the military and Israel’s security agency (Shin Bet), at least one of the eliminated terrorists had taken part in the October 7 massacre. The mission was carried out by the Givati ​​Brigade under the command of Division 162, based on military intelligence. This was the first time since last December that the IDF eliminated terrorists at the hospital. For the past month, terrorists have been attacking IDF troops from the facility using anti-tank missiles and planting booby traps surrounding the hospital. To prevent civilian casualties, the IDF warned and oversaw the evacuation of staff and patients from the hospital. The evacuation was organized by the IDF’s Gaza District Coordination and Liaison Administration in coordination with local health officials through clearly defined evacuation routes, using emergency vehicles to facilitate the removal of civilians from harm’s way.

The top 10 Jewish sports moments of 2024	Here are the top Jewish sports moments of 2024, presented chronologically — including two on the same day! By Jacob Gurvis, JTA From the baseball diamond to the soccer pitch, from Vancouver to Paris, 2024 was a historic year for Jews in sports. Jewish athletes distinguished themselves across events, venues and tiers of competition — from the Olympics to the major leagues to college ball. This year also saw notable sports moments off the field, be they in the front office or during the commercial breaks. Some of the year’s top moments featured familiar stars in the Jewish sports world, like ace pitcher Max Fried, Olympian Jessica Fox and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Fans also met some up-and-coming Jewish athletes, like college football player Sam Salz, or watched familiar faces like BYU quarterback Jake Retzlaff and USC basketball coach Lindsay Gottlieb reach new heights. Here are our top Jewish sports moments of 2024, presented chronologically — including two on the same day! The fight against antisemitism gets the spotlight in a Super Bowl ad As more than 100 million people tuned in to watch Super Bowl LVIII on Feb. 11, they saw what is believed to be the first-ever Super Bowl ad focused on antisemitism. The New England Patriots weren’t in the big game, but their owner, Robert Kraft, paid an estimated $7 million for the 30-second spot by his charity, the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism. The ad featured Clarence B. Jones, the former lawyer and advisor to Martin Luther King Jr. who drafted King’s famous 1963 'I Have A Dream' speech. It drew mixed reviews. The ad was one of a series by FCAS, which is known for its '#StandUpToJewishHate' campaign, that sought to promote the fight against antisemitism by connecting it to other forms of discrimination. The group placed a number of TV ads during popular televised events this year, including one spot depicting a real-life synagogue bomb threat, which aired during the Oscars. Another, about antisemitism at campus protests, aired during the NBA playoffs. And a recent ad calling for a 'timeout against hate' featured sports icons including Shaquille O’Neal and Billie Jean King. Jessica Fox, with two more golds, steals the show in Paris Jewish and Israeli athletes won a slew of medals in Paris this summer — 18 at the Olympics and 13 more at the Paralympics. Jews took home medals in rugby, fencing, track, swimming and numerous other competitions, while Israel returned to Olympic soccer for the first time since 1976. One of the brightest Jewish stars of the Games was Australian paddling legend Jessica Fox, who won two gold medals in three days, bringing her career total to six, half of them golds. She won gold in both the canoe single and the kayak slalom. Fox is the most decorated Olympic canoe slalom competitor ever, and the only Australian Olympian in history with six individual medals. She had served as one of Australia’s flag bearers at the Paris opening ceremony. And the magic didn’t stop there. Fox’s younger sister, Noemie Fox, earned a gold medal of her own in the inaugural kayak cross event. The win put the Fox sisters in rare company among Jewish siblings to medal at the same Olympics. Amit Elor wrestles her way to Olympic history A Jewish Olympian dominated on the wrestling mat as well as the water: Amit Elor, a California native with Israeli parents, entered Paris as the youngest U.S. Olympic wrestler in history, and left as its youngest medalist in the sport. Elor, an eight-time world champion, made quick work of her opponents, extending her undefeated streak of five years with a gold medal win. Elor, the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors who moved to Israel, experienced both online antisemitism and the sudden deaths of both her father and a brother during the years when she broke into the elite ranks of U.S. women’s wrestling. She wrestles at the 68-kilogram weight class and in October 2023 became the youngest American wrestler — male or female — ever to win a senior world title. After her win, Elor spoke out against antisemitism — something she had largely avoided in the lead-up to Paris. 'Eighty years ago my grandparents survived the Holocaust, but antisemitism is still all around us,' Elor said in a video posted on social media. The clip showed a comment directed against her saying 'you belong in the gas chamber.' 3 Jewish players appear in one MLB at-bat Pitcher Max Lazar’s first career strikeout on Aug. 10 was special for more than one reason. Lazar, a Jewish Philadelphia Phillies rookie, was pitching to Jewish catcher Garrett Stubbs and struck out Diamondbacks designated hitter Joc Pederson, who is also Jewish. The moment marked a rare trifecta — in which the pitcher, catcher and batter were all Jewish. (Stubbs and Pederson both played for Team Israel at the 2023 World Baseball Classic.) According to the Jewish Baseball Museum, it was only the third instance of a Jewish pitcher-catcher-batter combination in MLB’s more than 100-year history. And Stubbs and Lazar made up only the eighth-ever Jewish pitcher-catcher pairing, known as a battery. It wasn’t Stubbs’ first historic moment of the season. In July, with the Phillies trailing the Oakland Athletics, Stubbs took the mound, faced fellow Team Israel alum Zack Gelof — and gave up a grand slam. It was the first-ever grand slam hit by a Jewish batter off a Jewish pitcher. USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb notches her 300th career basketball win University of Southern California women’s basketball coach Lindsay Gottlieb has established herself as one of the sport’s best. Gottlieb, who in 2019 became the first women’s collegiate head coach to join an NBA staff, led USC to the No. 1 seed in the NCAA March Madness tournament this year after winning the Pac-12 Conference’s last-ever women’s championship (the conference since dissolved). USC made it to the Elite Eight in the Big Dance before losing to the University of Connecticut. In April, Gottlieb signed a contract extension with USC that will keep her at the helm through the 2029-2030 season. And this season, USC is off to another strong start, now in the Big Ten. On Nov. 12, Gottlieb reached another milestone: her 300th career coaching win, a 124-39 rout over Cal State Northridge. The victory set USC records for points scored in a single game and widest margin of victory. Gottlieb is a member of the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame of Northern California. Following WNBA legend Sue Bird’s retirement in 2022, some fans turned to Gottlieb as the new face of Jewish basketball. 'I wondered if there would be someone to assume [Bird’s] place as basketball’s Jewish role model,' Sophie Bravo wrote for JTA’s partner site Hey Alma in April. 'Lindsay seems to have stepped into the role seamlessly, balancing success, humility and determination, using her actions to guide and inspire.' Sam Salz blazes a trail for Orthodox Division I athletes Speaking of Jewish firsts, Texas A&M’s Sam Salz became likely the first-ever Orthodox Jew to appear in a Division I college football game when he took the field Nov. 16 with the Aggies. Salz’s debut marked the culmination of a years-long journey, one that took him from Kohelet Yeshiva High School — a Modern Orthodox school in Philadelphia with roughly 100 students and no football team — to a legendary college football program that peaked at No. 15 in the national rankings this season and plays in the vaunted Southeastern Conference. Salz, who had never played a snap of organized football in his life, let alone DI college ball, had walked onto the team in 2022 but had yet to appear in a game — in part because most college football games take place on Shabbat, when Salz doesn’t play. But on the school’s senior night, with 42 seconds left in the game, he heard his name called and ran out on the gridiron. 'There’s probably a Jewish kid, and maybe even especially an Orthodox kid, who wants to play football, or wants to play sports, and is sitting somewhere confused about what he should do, or who’s told that he’ll never be able to do it,' Salz said in an interview. 'Even getting to see me run down on that field, successful play or not, could have given him all the hope that he wanted.' Jake Retzlaff enjoys a breakout season — and celebrates with some matzah It sounds almost like the opening of a comedy routine: A proudly Jewish player at the flagship university of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints becomes a household name for college football fans. But it’s no joke. For Brigham Young University quarterback Jake Retzlaff, this was a breakout season. Retzlaff goes by 'BY-Jew' and made national headlines both for his on-field play and for how he publicly embraced his Jewish identity. Retzlaff, who grew up attending a Reform synagogue in Pomona, California, is BYU’s first Jewish starting quarterback and one of only three Jewish students at the Utah school. He threw 20 touchdowns this season as he led BYU to a 10-2 record in the Big-12 Conference and a top-25 national ranking — peaking at No. 9 on Nov. 5, a program record. And earlier this month, Retzlaff inked a sponsorship deal with Manischewitz, the Jewish food company’s first-ever sports deal. The package is set to include special-edition boxes of Manischewitz matzah emblazoned with Retzlaff’s likeness. Max Fried signs the largest contract in Jewish baseball history Retzlaff isn’t the only Jewish athlete with a landmark deal. Pitcher Max Fried entered the MLB offseason as one of the most coveted free agents on the market. And on Dec. 10, he got his payday. Fried signed an eight-year, $218 million contract with the New York Yankees, the largest contract ever for a Jewish player as well as for a left-handed pitcher (topping David Price’s 2015 deal by $1 million in raw terms). Fried, who turns 31 in January, has a 3.07 ERA in 151 career starts, all with the Atlanta Braves, and is a two-time All-Star, a three-time Gold Glove winner, a Silver Slugger winner and a 2021 World Series champion. In 2024, Fried posted an 11-10 record with a 3.25 ERA and 166 strikeouts in 174.1 innings. Now, the Los Angeles native, who grew up worshipping Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax, will likely spend the rest of his career playing in the city with the most Jews in the world. Fried joins fellow Jewish pitcher Scott Effross, who was traded to the Yankees in 2022 but missed all of 2023 and most of 2024 with multiple injuries. Jewish Yankees pitching prospect Eric Reyzelman is working his way through the minor leagues. Brad Ausmus, the team’s bench coach, is also Jewish. Aerin Frankel and Quinn Hughes headline a banner year for Jewish hockey On the same day Fried signed his massive deal with the Yankees, the Vancouver Canucks became the first team in NHL history to feature three Jewish players in the same game. Defensemen Quinn Hughes and Mark Friedman and forward Max Sasson all played for the Canucks as they lost to the St. Louis Blues 4-3 in overtime. The Jewish hat trick capped a banner year for Jews in hockey. Jews featured prominently in the inaugural season of the Professional Women’s Hockey League, which dropped the puck on New Year’s Day, led by Boston Fleet goalie Aerin Frankel, who is arguably the best Jewish player in the league. Frankel posted a .929 save percentage in 18 games last season, but her breakout came in the playoffs, when the Northeastern alum saved over 95% of shots and earned the moniker 'Green Monster' — an homage to another formidable Boston sports presence — for her clutch performances. Boston lost to Minnesota in the finals in May despite Frankel’s brick wall. In the NHL, Edmonton Oilers star Zach Hyman put on a career performance last season, tallying 54 goals, the third-most in the NHL, plus 16 more in the playoffs. And Hughes finished with 75 assists, the third-most in the league, and won the James Norris Memorial Trophy, which is awarded to the NHL’s best defender. During the offseason this summer, Ryan Warsofsky became the first Jewish NHL head coach in three decades, University of Denver star Zeev Buium was selected 12th overall in the NHL Entry Draft and Jack, Luke and Quinn Hughes became the first brothers to grace the cover of the flagship NHL video game. Israeli Yaniv Bazini leads UVM to its first-ever NCAA soccer championship Before this month, the University of Vermont had won six national championships in the school’s history — all in skiing. On Dec. 16, the Catamounts captured the NCAA Division I soccer championship, thanks in large part to Israeli star Yaniv Bazini. Bazini, a senior from Ness Ziona in central Israel, joined UVM in 2022 and became an anchor of Vermont’s offense. This season, Bazini led the team with 14 goals — including six scored in postseason games — which is the second-most in a single season in program history. His 30 points were third-best in the UVM record books. Beyond his offensive prowess, Bazini was also known for his proud embrace of his Israeli and Jewish identity. Last October, Bazini draped himself in an Israeli flag after scoring his first goal following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. He brought the flag back out to celebrate the national title. Bazini told JTA he cherishes the opportunity to represent Jews on the pitch — which he hopes to do professionally, either in the MLS or abroad. 'It means everything,' he said. 'I got so many messages in the past couple days of kids that are impacted, and not only my soccer, but how I show that I’m Jewish and not afraid of it. By doing ‘Shema Yisrael’ at every beginning of the game or halftime, or every time I score, every time to thank God.' Honorable mentions Here are a few other Jewish sports stories from the past year that are worth noting: Assaf Lowengart made history as the first Israeli-born position player to sign a professional baseball contract in the U.S. when he joined the Frontier League’s New York Boulders in February. Hapoel Jerusalem honored slain hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, whom they called 'our friend in the stands.' Orthodox MLB prospect Jacob Steinmetz continued his ascent through the minor leagues, joining the Hillsboro Hops, the Arizona Diamondbacks’ High-A affiliate. MLB veteran Kevin Pillar enjoyed a late-career resurgence with the Los Angeles Angels — and embraced his role as a Jewish ballplayer. Team Israel launched an American organization to strengthen its national team pipeline and support baseball’s growth in Israel. Náutico Hacoaj became the first Jewish soccer club to compete in Argentina’s Amateur Promotional Tournament since 1967. Israeli fencer Yuval Freilich won a gold medal at the 2024 Qatar Grand Prix on Jan. 31, while wearing a uniform with an Israeli flag and the message 'Am Israel Chai,' Hebrew for 'the people of Israel lives,' written on his shoulder. Qatar, which does not have diplomatic ties with Israel, has played home to Hamas’ leadership. And last but not least, Jewish wrestling promoter Paul Heyman and boxing publicist Fred Sternburg were each inducted into their sport’s respective halls of fame. And the Jewish world mourned the deaths of Ken Holtzman, the winningest Jewish pitcher in MLB history, and Hall-of-Fame jockey Walter Blum, who rode to victory in the Belmont Stakes.

United Nations ‘condemns’ Israel for responding to Houthi attacks...	Officials associated with the Houthis claim that it will continue to attack Israel until the so-called 'genocide' in Gaza ceases. By The Algemeiner In its latest salvo against the Jewish state, the United Nations (UN) condemned Israel for executing retaliatory strikes against the Houthi terror group in Yemen. 'The Secretary-General condemns escalation between Yemen and Israel,' Stéphanie Tremblay, a UN spokesperson, said in Thursday statements on behalf of UN Secretary General António Guterres. 'The Secretary-General is gravely concerned about intensified escalation in Yemen and Israel. Israeli airstrikes today on Sana’a International Airport, the Red Sea ports and power stations in Yemen are especially alarming. The airstrikes reportedly resulted in numerous casualties including at least three killed and dozens more injured' Tremblay added. On Thursday, Israel launched a barrage of missile attacks on Houthi bases in Yemen, provoking international outrage. Israel targeted a major airport in Sanaa and ports in Hodeida, Al-Salif and Ras Qantib, and power stations, locations the Jewish state claims were used by the terror group to sneak in both Iranian weapons and high-ranking Iranian officials. On Friday, the Houthis claimed responsibility for an airstrike aimed at Ben Gurion Airport, claiming that the attacks were carried out in retaliation against Israel’s targeting of Sana’a International airport. The Israeli strikes followed days of Houthi missile and drone launches towards the Jewish state’s airspace. The Houthis have repeatedly attacked the Jewish state in the year following the Oct. 7 slaughters in Israel. Officials associated with the terrorist organization claim that it will continue to attack Israel until the so-called 'genocide' in Gaza ceases. In reference to the strikes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said 'The Houthis, too, will learn what Hamas and Hezbollah and Assad’s regime and others learned.' Israeli officials have long accused the UN of having a bias against the Jewish state. Last year, the UN General Assembly condemned Israel twice as often as it did all other countries. Meanwhile, of all the country-specific resolutions passed by the UNHRC, nearly half have condemned Israel, a seemingly disproportionate focus on the lone democracy in the Middle East. Weeks following the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel, the UN adopted a resolution calling for a 'ceasefire' between Israel and the terrorist group. The UN failed to pass a measure condemning the Hamas atrocities of Oct. 7. In June, the UN put Israel on its so-called 'list of shame' of countries that kill children in armed conflict. Israel is considered to be the only democracy on the list.

Soldier KIA in Gaza, bringing IDF wartime toll to 823	The death toll among Israeli troops on all fronts since the Hamas-led massacre on Oct. 7, 2023, stands at 823. By JNS An Israel Defense Forces soldier was killed on Friday while battling Palestinian terrorists in the northern Gaza Strip, the military announced. The slain man was named as Maj. Hod Shriebman, 27, of the elite Multidomain Unit, from Moshav Tzofit, near Kfar Saba. On Wednesday, an IDF reservist was killed in combat in the central Gaza Strip. He was identified as Capt. (res.) Amit Levi, 35, from Shomria, a religious kibbutz in the northern Negev. Two days earlier, three Israeli soldiers were killed in action fighting Hamas terrorists in northern Gaza. The soldiers were named as Capt. Ilay Gavriel Atedgi, 22, from Kiryat Motzkin; Staff Sgt. Netanel Pessach, 21, from Elazar; and Sgt. 1st Class (res.) Hillel Diener, 21, from Talmon. All three men served in the Kfir Brigade’s 92nd 'Shimshon' Infantry Battalion. The death toll among Israeli troops since the start of the Gaza ground incursion on Oct. 27, 2023, stands at 391, and at 823 on all fronts since the Hamas-led massacre on Oct. 7, 2023. Additionally, Ch. Insp. Arnon Zamora, a member of the Israel Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit, was fatally wounded during a hostage-rescue mission in Gaza in June, and civilian defense contractor Liron Yitzhak was mortally wounded there in May.

Israeli FM calls new Syrian government a ‘gang of terrorists’	Sa'ar described the new Syrian government as 'an Islamist regime aiming to establish unified control over all of Syria.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Despite some conciliatory remarks about Israel made by the new Syrian government, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar said the new regime is comprised of 'a gang of terrorists.' 'Globally, people talk about 'organized regime change in Syria,' but it's not as if a new government was democratically elected to rule all of Syria,' he said. 'Instead, it's a group of terrorists who initially controlled Idlib, and then took over Damascus and other regions,' Sa'ar said. Sa'ar's statements are in contrast to statements by new leaders in Syria that they do not seek conflict with Israel He continued,'The world is eager to view them as a new and stable regime because many countries want to send the evacuees they are hosting back to Syria.' However, Sa'ar added,'That's not the reality. There are ongoing battles with the Alawites along the coastline, explicit threats from [Turkish President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan to dismantle Kurdish autonomy, and harassment of Syria's Christian community.' He also emphasized that Syria's new government 'is an Islamist regime aiming to establish unified control over all of Syria.' Maher Marwan, appointed as the new governor of Damascus, has declared that he seeks peace with Israel, ynet reports. Marwan, who was appointed by Syria’s de facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani), said in an interview in the US he intended no harm to Israel. 'There exists a people who want coexistence. They want peace. They don’t want disputes. We want peace, and we cannot be an opponent to Israel or an opponent to anyone,' he said in an interview with U.S. public radio network NPR. At the same time, he acknowledged that, given the tense history between Israel and Syria, Israelis may be a bit hesitant to fully accept this. 'It’s natural for Israel to be worried about certain factions.' He added, ' Israel may have felt fear, so it advanced a little, bombed a little, etc. We have no fear towards Israel, and our problem is not with Israel. And we don’t want to meddle in anything that will threaten Israel’s security or any other country’s security.'

IDF downs Houthi missile from Yemen, as sirens blare in Jerusalem	It was the first time air-raid sirens sounded in Jerusalem since the Iranian attack on Oct. 1. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces overnight Friday intercepted a missile fired by Houthi terrorists in Yemen that triggered air-raid sirens across the Jerusalem, Judea and Dead Sea areas. The missile was downed outside of Israeli airspace, according to the military, and there were no immediate reports of injuries. Sirens sounded in dozens of Israeli communities. It was the first time air-raid sirens sounded in Jerusalem since the Iranian attack on Oct. 1.

A U.S.-made THAAD anti-missile battery assisted in the interception, in the first such instance since the system was deployed to Israel in October. On Thursday, the Israeli Air Force conducted strikes on the western coast of and deep inside Yemen, including at Sanaa International Airport in the Houthi-controlled capital. The targets included the Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib power stations, in addition to terror infrastructure in the Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Kanatib ports. 'These military targets were used by the Houthi terrorist regime to smuggle Iranian weapons into the region and for the entry of senior Iranian officials. This is a further example of the Houthis’ exploitation of civilian infrastructure for military purposes,' the IDF said. 'The Houthi terrorist regime is a central part of the Iranian axis of terror, and their attacks on international shipping vessels and routes continue to destabilize the region and the wider world. … The IDF will not hesitate to operate at any distance against any threat to the State of Israel and its citizens,' added the statement. Speaking from IAF headquarters after the strike on the second night of Chanukah, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel is engaged in a modern-day Maccabean struggle. 'We are determined to cut off this terrorist arm of Iran’s axis of evil,' the prime minister said. 'We will persist in this until we complete the task.' Sitting beside Netanyahu, Defense Minister Israel Katz said that anyone responsible for attacking Israel is a potential target. 'We will hunt down all the Houthi leaders—we will strike them as we have done in other places,' Katz said. 'No one will be able to evade Israel’s long reach.' The damage caused by a ballistic missile fired from Yemen to a school in Ramat Gan, Israel, Dec. 19, 2024. Photo by Avshalom Sassoni/Flash90. Houthi terrorists have launched over 200 missiles and 170 drones at Israel in support of Hamas since the terrorist attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The terrorist group has escalated its attacks in the past 10 days, scoring hits on Israel’s densely populated central region. Overnight Monday, a woman in her 60s was critically injured when she struck her head while rushing to a shelter in Tel Aviv during sirens triggered by another Houthi missile. Before dawn on Dec. 19, the warhead from an intercepted missile hit an elementary school in Ramat Gan, collapsing the school’s main building but causing no injuries. The following night, a missile hit a playground in a residential area of Jaffa, lightly wounding 16 people. The United Nations Security Council will hold an emergency session on Monday to discuss the escalating Houthi attacks, at Israel’s request.

Dutch king asks Jews to ‘stay,’ tells Muslims: ‘It’s your country...	To Jewish Dutch people who tell me they doubt their future here, I say: Stay! We belong together,' said the king. By Canaan Lindor, JNS King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands juxtaposed in a Christmas address Wednesday the malaise of Dutch Jews and Palestinians, urging the former not to emigrate and reminding the latter that 'this is your country, too.' The unusual appeal, which many praised and many others said was misguided and inappropriate, came in the wake of a wave of antisemitic assaults in Amsterdam on Nov. 7-8 by Muslim men against Israeli soccer fans. The assaults, which many Dutch Jews have called a pogrom, prompted a heated national debate about antisemitism, Muslim radicalism and allegations that Israel is perpetrating genocide in Gaza. Earlier this week, five of the perpetrators were given what were widely seen as lenient sentences. Jewish students in Amsterdam told the Dutch monarch about 'how they prefer to keep quiet on the street and in the tram,' he said. Whereas Palestinians in Vlaardingen spoke 'about their fear for the fate of family members in their country of origin' and 'about their helplessness and despair,' he added. 'To Jewish Dutch people who tell me they doubt their future here, I say: Stay! We belong together. 'To Dutch Muslims, I say: This is your country too; this is your country too,' added the king. He did not name the assaults against the Maccabi Tel Aviv fans but may have referenced them when he said: 'We do not resort to violence, even when we feel hurt or misunderstood.' Juliaan van Acker, an emeritus professor from Radboud University in Nijmegen and an expert in rehabilitating juvenile delinquents, slammed the address on X, calling it a promotional speech for 'looking the other way.' With many millions of Muslims in Europe, 'heavily guarded synagogues and Jewish schools, a Jew with foresight would do better to emigrate to Israel as soon as possible,' wrote van Acker, who is not Jewish. He wondered whether radical Muslims 'really belong' in the Netherlands. Geert Wilders, leader of the anti-Islam and pro-Israel Party for Freedom, tweeted immediately after the address: 'The Netherlands is ours, proud of our culture, our customs, our traditions, it is our country.' ‘Not safe for Jews’ Jan Dijkgraaf, a prominent Dutch journalist, wrote in a column about the king’s speech that the only important part of it was the juxtaposition between Jews and Muslims. 'Without directly mentioning it, you make it clear in two paragraphs what Jews have known for a long time, but what non-Jews who have taken off their blinders discovered since the Hamas pogrom on October 7, 2023: That the Netherlands is not a safe country for Jews. Not then. Not now. Never,' Dijkgraaf wrote. The address also received praise, including from Dutch Jews who found it 'beautiful and unifying,' as Itai Cohn, a Jewish resident of The Hague who promotes dialogue between Jews and Muslims, wrote on X. Much of the criticism about the speech on social media in the Netherlands was about the absence of a Christmas tree, which previous monarchs tended to have in the background of their filmed holiday addresses, but which Willem-Alexander dispensed with soon after becoming king in 2013. On Tuesday, a court in Amsterdam handed sentences that ranged from 100 hours of community service to six months in jail to five perpetrators of the Nov. 7-8 assaults. The sentences, four of which fell considerably short of what the prosecution had sought, were widely seen by Dutch Jews as lenient in light of the magnitude and violence of the events. 'As someone who witnessed these trials firsthand, I am deeply disheartened by the leniency of these sentences' said Ziporah Reich, director of litigation at The Lawfare Project, which provides pro bono legal services to protect the civil and human rights of the Jewish people worldwide.

How the international community funds the Hamas war machine	Hamas exploits its power to plunder the international resources delivered into Gaza, which it uses to sustain its dictatorship. By Natan Galula, JNS On Nov. 29, 2024, three Palestinians, a woman and two children, were crushed to death while waiting in line outside a bakery in central Gaza. The images of thousands of Palestinians huddled against each other, pressing inwards for a bag of pita bread, with young girls on camera desperately gasping for air, made headline news all over the world. Humanitarian organizations said that people in Gaza were on the 'brink of famine.' Ajith Sunghay, the head of the U.N. Human Rights Office in the Palestinian territories, said, 'The breakdown of public order and safety is exacerbating the situation with rampant looting and fighting over scarce resources.' He added that 'prices of the meager commodities that are available have skyrocketed.' The agency running the United Nations’ World Food Programme warned in early December that the 'humanitarian response in Gaza is nearing collapse. For over 50 days almost no food has reached North Gaza.' Similar warnings were proclaimed in the past. In March, the Food Security Analysis Unit, which works under the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization, released a report that stated, 'Famine is now projected and imminent in the North Gaza and Gaza Governorates and is expected to become manifest during the projection period from mid-March 2024 to May 2024.' But the projected famine never came to pass. According to Eyal Ofer—a former government adviser, frequent guest commentator on Israeli media outlets and an expert on 'Hamas economics'—shortages of food in Gaza are not due to a lack of foreign aid. Ever since the November 2023 hostage agreement between Jerusalem and Hamas, Israel has opened at least five crossings into the Gaza Strip, enabling the entry of thousands of aid trucks per month into the Palestinian enclave, Ofer told JNS over the phone on Thursday. The bakery scenes 'were completely orchestrated by Hamas,' he said. 'Every bakery in the Gaza Strip produces tens of thousands of bags of pita bread per day, and yet the bakery distributes only 300 bags per hour.' The rest, he said, is 'smuggled' to Hamas-controlled markets. Instead of selling a bag of pita bread for three shekels ($0.82)—the typical price at the bakeries—it sells for 50 or 60 shekels (~$16) due to artificially induced scarcity. 'Hamas intentionally created a situation of scarcity,' Ofer stressed. 'The wheat is sent into Gaza for free in the form of international aid. Even the cooking gas used by the bakeries, I believe, is supplied by the World Food Programme. This is how the typical bag of pita bread sells in the Gaza Strip for [the cheap price of] three shekels [82 cents], even before the war.' When the war broke out, he explained, 'Hamas took over the bags of wheat and hoarded them in its own warehouses or in UNRWA warehouses, which are de facto run by Hamas.' If a 55-pound bag cost $14 before the war, during the war prices rose typically to $70 or $80, in rare cases even reaching $400, he said. Today, Ofer added, they sell for about $30, depending on the location within Gaza. Extorting the bakeries After Israel took measures to stop Hamas from getting the wheat, the terrorist group readjusted its method of operation and took over the bakeries, said Ofer. There are a dozen large industrial bakeries that operate throughout the Strip—four in the north and eight in the center and south—with several smaller 'tabuns' (outdoor stoves for baking) used in poorer communities, he explained. 'A bakery that produces 30,000 bags a day that are ready in the morning has no problem distributing them to 30,000 people [throughout the day],' he noted. However, because Hamas is so embedded in the population and controls it by force, the terrorist organization can compel the bakeries to sell only a small portion of their production at the regular price and smuggle the rest to the markets. 'You have to think about this in purely economic terms. The monopolies [in the markets] hoard the supply, even let some of the food rot, so they can create artificially high demand and thus cut higher profits than if they sold everything for lower prices,' he told JNS. 'This is how you got photos on CNN of large groups of people pushing each other all the way to the small hatch in the bakery’s front or back doors for one bag of pita bread for three shekels.' Ofer emphasized that those who argue Hamas is able to ensure its rule thanks to the humanitarian aid are wrong. Hamas already rules Gaza, he noted, which is why it controls pricing there. 'You will not find anywhere Hamas members who are distributing food to civilians. Hamas establishes its rule not by controlling the food, but by the fact that it is the most powerful organization in Gaza, that controls all of the economic activity under its rule. People are reversing cause and effect,' he said. Plundering aid The bakery incident is a prime example of the 'circular nature' of Hamas’s rule, said Ofer: It exploits its power to plunder the international resources delivered into Gaza, which it uses to sustain its dictatorship. 'In 2017, the World Bank formulated a report that stated that the only way to help Gaza’s civilians is to topple Hamas, which takes most of the money transferred into Gaza,' said Haim Ramon, a long-time Knesset member (1983-2009) and former vice prime minister, speaking to JNS on Friday. 'I always said that I am not responsible for the Palestinians, but the only way to increase their welfare is to topple Hamas,' said Ramon. 'According to the Shin Bet [Israel Security Agency], about one third of all dollars that enter the Gaza Strip, be it in the form of money or goods, goes to Hamas,' he added. Ramon was one of the chief advocates of Israel’s 2005 unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, which involved the evacuation of some 8,000 Jewish residents and a full withdrawal of the military. He noted that the Jewish state has indeed mostly disengaged from the Gaza Strip, but is still its main supplier of electricity, and handles the entry of foreign aid. 'But this is largely unimportant. If [Gaza] did not have a terrorist government and would cooperate with us to improve the lives of its citizens, we could have turned Gaza into, if not exactly Singapore, a much more humane place,' he said. UNRWA and Hamas Einat Wilf, a former Israeli parliamentarian from the Independence and Labor parties, political scientist and the author of several books on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, spoke to JNS on Friday about the role in Gaza of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. In no other conflict or place in the world, she said, 'can you find a situation where an external body assumes the responsibility to finance all the daily needs of the [local people] in a way that absolves them of any responsibility for themselves.' While UNRWA takes care of the welfare of Palestinians, Hamas can keep arming itself and bolster its military capabilities, concentrating all of its efforts on the next massacre of Jews, she added. 'They face no [economic] consequences if in every round of fighting they can go back to square one,' she stressed, referring to the funds that keep flowing into Gaza regardless of whether Hamas decides to resort to violence or pursue peace. UNRWA is a U.N. agency formed in 1949 in the aftermath of Israel’s War of Independence. Unlike any other group of displaced persons supported by the United Nations, all the descendants of Palestinians displaced as a result of the war are registered by UNRWA as refugees. As stated on its website, UNRWA’s purpose is to 'carry out direct relief and works programs for Palestine refugees.' Its mandate is 'to respond to the needs of more than 5.6 million' Palestinians in 'areas of education, health, protection, relief and social services, microfinance and camp improvement.' The agency’s funding amounted to total pledges of $1.46 billion in 2023, with the United States, Germany, the European Union and France as its top contributors. Its headquarters are located in Gaza and Amman, Jordan. Two weeks after Hamas launched the deadliest single-day attack in Israel’s history on Oct. 7, 2023, senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk was asked why his organization had not built bomb shelters for civilians if it could construct 300 miles of underground tunnels for its fighters. Marzouk replied that the tunnels were built to protect Hamas fighters, while protecting the 75% of Gaza residents who are listed as refugees is 'the responsibility of the United Nations.' What he was saying, Wilf elaborated, 'was that ‘we’ [Hamas] concentrate on massacring Jews while ‘you’ [the world] fund the things that should have been under our care, had we been expected to take care of them.' The former Knesset member pointed to a poster found in a refugee camp near Bethlehem that read: 'UNRWA services are our right until the Return.' The so-called Palestinian 'right of return' calls for the resettling of millions of descendants of Arabs who lived in the British Mandate of Palestine before 1948 in current-day Israel. 'You could not sum up the Palestinian relation to UNRWA better than this one sentence,' Wilf stated. 'Essentially it means that the British, German or Australian taxpayer will fund the livelihood of Palestinians until the day the Jewish state ceases to exist.' Fueling the warmongers 'Gaza has no economic problem,' Wilf continued. 'It sits on beautiful, white sand beaches … and is situated on attractive trading routes. Its land is also effective for agriculture. The problem [in Gaza] is political. Politics have turned Gaza into a war machine. Gaza doesn’t really need outside help. Its people need to decide if they prefer investing in themselves, rather than destroying what the Jews have built.' She went on to say that the world needs to stop financing the Palestinians. If UNRWA ceases to exist, Wilf stressed, nothing significant will change on the ground. UNRWA workers are Palestinian, 'not European employees as most people imagine,' she said, noting that Gaza will have the same workers with the same set of skills; the only thing that will change is that they will have to start paying their own bills. 'This may be a radical idea,' Wilf continued sarcastically, 'but if they run their own economy, collect taxes like any other country, pay their own salaries [and deal with real-life challenges], they will not have the time to build hundreds of kilometers of tunnels and plot Oct. 7s.' Foreign supplies that regularly enter Gaza serve as the basis of its current economy, from which Hamas collects its salaries and continues its terrorist activities, she said. 'The one thing that Israel should not have compromised on [in the Iron Swords war] was the issue of foreign aid,' she added. 'Even if America threatened to withhold weapons from us, we should have remained resolute. As far as I’m concerned, we didn’t have to strike one house in Gaza, but declare instead: nothing goes in, until the hostages come out.' The former lawmaker noted that the world’s message to the Gazans after the war concludes will have profound consequences. If Palestinians understand that the 'destruction in Gaza is what happens when you insist on holding onto your stupid ideology of destroying Israel,' she noted, then things can change for the better. But if the message is that 'the destruction is horrible, Jews are bad, let’s hurry up and reconstruct everything,' then things will continue as they were. 'The war is the result of [Gaza’s outside funding]. The message is: You concentrate on ‘from the river to the sea’ and we will take care of everything else.' The mafia in Gaza Eyal Ofer has been following the funding methods of Hamas and other terrorist organizations for years, collecting data and writing about his findings. He told JNS that Hamas’s financial conduct has not changed in a significant way over the years. If before the war it extorted 25% from luxury car dealers, today in the midst of war it extorts money from wheat merchants. 'Hamas is present everywhere in the Gaza Strip: the police, humanitarian associations, actors in the private and public sectors, the contractors’ union—Hamas is networked within and across Gaza. You can’t just vacuum Hamas out, it is everywhere,' he said. In a tweet that went viral on Sunday, he wrote that 'Hamas operates like a mafia and a clan-based enterprise: one brother is in the military wing, another in the police force, they ensure the sister works for UNRWA, a noncombat-profile cousin becomes a driver for an aid organization, an uncle gets a government position, another cousin is a ‘journalist’ for Al Jazeera, and the grandmother is added to the list of welfare recipients.' The claim that Iran provides 70% of Hamas’s funding is 'nonsense,' he wrote. 'In extreme cases, Iran provides 5-10% of Hamas’s funding. The vast majority of Hamas’s funding comes from its ability to funnel money that the world sends to the Palestinian Authority (and other Gaza charitable causes) and Gaza for its own purposes.' As an example, he attached a document from the P.A.’s Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF), a semi-governmental urban development fund, highlighting the receipt of some $3 million from the government of Belgium in 2023 for a project named, 'Promotion of Green Services and Climate Action in Local Governance—Green Gaza.' 'What are the chances that Hamas’s regime in Gaza will manage to place its members or their relatives among the beneficiaries of this Belgian grant? In my opinion: 100%. … Multiply this story by 200, and you’ll see how Hamas is funded,' Ofer said. The money-laundering scheme Ofer further explained that Hamas’s chief financial problem is not raising money inside Gaza, but transferring its accumulated cash out of the region. The primary currency in the Gaza Strip is the Israeli shekel. During the war, Hamas acquired a monopoly on cash in Gaza, with local banks largely unserviceable. Ofer told JNS that it is impossible to assess how much cash Hamas currently holds. 'Hundreds of millions, maybe even one to two billion shekels. It extracts money from the population by force, which is how it continues to pay salaries to its operatives [and recruit new fighters], but also how it established itself as the monopoly on the supply of money,' he said. 'Many Gazans today receive direct donations from abroad, transferred via Western Union, the banks, cryptocurrencies like USD Coin, Vodafone Cash Wallet [a mobile app], GoFundMe, monthly stipends from the P.A., U.N. humanitarian agencies such as UNICEF. All these transfers are deposited in bank accounts, and their holders need to convert them into cash—whether the deposit is in dollars or shekels. Who do they go to for cash? Hamas.' The Islamist organization developed an entire industry of non-banking ATMs, Ofer explained. The Gazans transfer to Hamas their dollars or shekels and Hamas provides them with cash, though with 'unbelievably' high fees, he said. 'The fees started at 15% and have reached more than 30% in areas with greater scarcity,' he added. 'This is how Hamas manages to launder money to unknown accounts.' Ofer could not say with certainty that all money changers in Gaza are Hamas operatives, but noted that it is hard to imagine a regular person moving about in the Gaza Strip with hundreds of thousands of shekels in cash without fear. The broken Gaza fallacy In 1850, French economist Frédéric Bastiat published an essay titled 'That Which Is Seen, and That Which Is Not Seen.' In it, he described what became known in the field of economics as the 'broken window fallacy.' The conceptual framework notes that while it is seen that a child breaking a shopkeeper’s window, for example, will provide the glazier with work to repair the window, what is not seen is the aggregate growth of the economy through alternative work had the window not been broken (such as the shopkeeper purchasing a new pair of shoes). The Palestinian case may demonstrate a similar fallacy. That which is seen is the reconstruction of Gaza after every war, believing that this helps the Palestinians. That which is unseen is letting the Palestinians deal with the consequences of war alone, having to choose whether to abandon their ideological battle against Israel or continue on their path to destruction. 'The Palestinians know that after every round of fighting, the round of reconstruction begins,' Ofer said, adding that this causes perverse economic incentives. 'If the Qataris come in and propose rebuilding a city that was destroyed in the previous war and was now destroyed again, a private contractor has two jobs, not one. The Hamas government cuts its share from the contractor, the residents who received contributions and everyone else in the chain of rehabilitation,' he noted. According to Ofer, many of the regular economic metrics that economists use, such as GDP, are irrelevant in the case of Gaza, because a huge section of its economy is nonproductive. 'There is no question that Gaza, in great percentages, is a charity-based economy. A private sector emerges out of these donations, but the nucleus of the economy, maybe 40% to 50%, is based on external donations that fund Gaza’s welfare [programs] and the public sector,' he told JNS. Ofer added that Israel lacks 'political wisdom. Instead of disengaging from Gaza, we keep opening more and more crossings into the Strip in the hope that the world will see us as enlightened rulers. At the start of the war, all aid came through the Rafah Crossing border with Egypt. Israel should have stated: That’s it Gaza, from now on, you work with Egypt. You are not our problem anymore.'

Menorah from remains of drone that hit Jewish school lights up Ki...	This is a menorah that tells the story of the victory of light over darkness in our time,' said the Chief Rabbi of Kyiv and Chabad emissary, Rabbi Yonatan Markovich. By Jewish Breaking News About 500 members of the Jewish community in Kiev gathered last night to light the first candle of Hanukkah together with the head of the Ukrainian Military Intelligence and special advisor to President Zelensky, Kyrylo Budanov. The menorah, designed by a local artist, incorporates metal parts from the drone that attacked the school. Its base is decorated with interlocking human figures symbolizing unity, and the candles are placed in defused shell casings of the Ukrainian army. Last October, just hours before the start of the school day, a Russian drone struck the Jewish school. The impact caused significant damage to the building, but miraculously there were no injuries among the school’s students and staff. Following the incident, the community expanded its humanitarian activities and added psychological support to its members. 'This is a menorah that tells the story of the victory of light over darkness in our time,' said the Chief Rabbi of Kyiv and Chabad emissary, Rabbi Yonatan Markovich. 'From those fragments of destruction, we created a source of light that will illuminate our schoolyard. This menorah is living proof that the light of Jewish education in Kiev will not go out, and that out of the darkness a greater light will always shine.'

Israel reveals links between killed Gaza ‘journalists’ and Islami...	Gaza journalists being on the payroll of or collaborating with Hamas and Islamic Jihad have been a repeated controversy. By Pesach Benson, TPS Rebutting Palestinian claims that five journalists were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces released information on Thursday showing that the five were members of Palestinian Islamic Jihad. 'Intelligence from multiple sources confirmed that these individuals were Islamic Jihad operatives posing as journalists,' the IDF said. 'One source was a list of Islamic Jihad operatives discovered by the IDF during operations in the Gaza Strip. This list explicitly identified four of the eliminated individuals as members of the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization.' The five people killed in Thursday morning’s airstrike in the central Gaza town of Nuseirat were identified as Ibrahim Jamal Ibrahim Al-Sheikh Ali, Islamic Jihad operations and combat propaganda operative; Faisal Abdallah Muhammad Abu Qamsan, Head of Security for the Islamic Jihad in Nuseirat; Mohammed Ayad Khamis al-Lada’a, Islamic Jihad combat propagandist; Ayman Nihad Abd Alrahman Jadi, Islamic Jihad combat propagandist and former Islamic Jihad naval operative; and Fadi Ihab Muhammad Ramadan Hassouna, Islamic Jihad combat propagandist in Nuseirat. Islamic Jihad’s TV channel, Al Quds Today, said the five worked for it. Gaza journalists being on the payroll of or collaborating with Hamas and Islamic Jihad have been a repeated controversy. Hamas documents seized in Gaza and released by the Israel in October showed how Al Jazeera received directions for covering specific incidents and even the establishment of a special hotline. Jeremy Loffredo, a US journalist with ties to an Iranian-funded website, was deported in October over a video he posted detailing where Iranian missiles landed in Israel Files found by soldiers in Gaza revealed that Al Jazeera reporter Ismail al-Ghoul was an engineer in Hamas’s Gaza City Brigade who also participated in the October 7 attacks as a member of the Nukhba force. Israel shut down Al-Jazeera’s operations in September, revoking the network’s press credentials, confiscating transmitters and blocking its websites. The move to proscribe the Qatari network gained momentum in February after reporter Mohamed Washah was exposed as a Hamas commander when soldiers recovered his laptop in northern Gaza. The shutdown is not permanent but is subject to renewal every 45 days. The Knesset is currently advancing legislation that would extend the ban to renewable 90-day intervals. In June, sources in Gaza confirmed to The Press Service of Israel that Israeli hostages Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov and Shlomi Ziv were rescued from the home of Palestinian journalist Abdallah Aljama in the Nuseirat refugee camp. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Gwyneth Paltrow talks Hanukkah family traditions, Jewish heritage...	In 2011, Paltrow discovered that she comes from a long line of rabbis on her father’s side of the family and that her great-great-great grandfather was Rabbi Tsvi Paltrowitch, a Kabbalah master and the Gaon of Nitzy-Novgorod in southwest Russia. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Jewish American Oscar-winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow joined author and activist Noa Tishby in celebrating the first night of Hanukkah on Wednesday, as part of the latter’s new Hanukkah-themed video series on YouTube called '#BringOnTheLight.' Paltrow — whose late father Bruce Paltrow was Jewish while her mother, actress Blythe Danner, is Christian — also talked with Tishby about her Jewish faith and holiday tradition. When Tishby asked the 'Iron Man' star and Goop founder and CEO about a childhood memory from Hanukkah that she holds dear, Paltrow recalled being at her grandparents’ house in Long Island, New York, and getting Hanukkah gelt. 'I have such a strong memory of the gold, round coins, and my brother and I just tearing into them,' she reminisced, talking about the coin-shaped chocolates that are typically given to children during Hanukkah. The 'Contagion' star also told Tishby that in her home now, she makes latkes for Hanukkah and lights the menorah with her family. 'We always light the menorah, we always gather together after we light the candles; it’s very sweet actually. We all hug and we bring in the light,' she said. 'And ever since [my kids] were little, they would sit on the floor, close their eyes, and then I would give them their present. We do eight presents. I’m a spoiler.' Paltrow has two children — Apple, 20, and Moses, 18 – with her ex-husband, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin. She is now married to American television writer, producer, and director Brad Falchuk, both of whose parents are Jewish. His mother was previously the national president of the Hadassah Women’s Zionist Organization of America. In 2011, Paltrow discovered that she comes from a long line of rabbis on her father’s side of the family and that her great-great-great grandfather was Rabbi Tsvi Paltrowitch, a Kabbalah master and the Gaon of Nitzy-Novgorod in southwest Russia. She told Tishby she comes from 17 generations of rabbis. Paltrow also discussed what it was like growing up with a Jewish father and Christian mother. 'I grew up in a time in the 70’s where I think interfaith marriage was a big deal, so it was really hard for both of my parents’ parents that they were marrying each other. So it was a bit scandalous. Nobody was happy about it,' she said. 'They definitely grew to accept it later in life,' the actress added, talking about her grandparents. 'They kind of let go of all that. But I felt so fortunate because I got to grow up with these two very different worlds and very different faiths. I always felt an incredible pull to my Jewish family and I still do. And the traditions, and the warmth, the unconditional love, the food, the yelling, the family … I’m so close to everybody on that side of my family. We are all kind of interwoven and important to each other and just show up for each other again and again and again.' Tishby’s eight-part video series '#BringOnTheLight,' which coincides with the eight days of Hanukkah, launched on YouTube on Wednesday and promotes Jewish pride and unity. A new video will be released each day of Hanukkah at 11 am ET.

Elderly Herzliya woman murdered in terror stabbing	Security guards neutralized the terrorist at the scene by shooting him in the leg. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Friday morning, a woman in Herzliya aged around 80 was stabbed to death by a terrorist. The stabbing, which took place on Kdoshei Hashoah Street, was initially reported by Magen Dovid Adom as resulting in 'very serious' injuries. However, the woman succumbed to multiple stab wounds, and she was declared dead shortly after arriving at Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv. The hospital reported, 'She was brought to the hospital with multiple stab wounds and, despite efforts at resuscitation, the hospital was forced to declare her dead upon arrival.' Security guards neutralized the terrorist at the scene by shooting him in the leg. He was identified as an Arab man from Tulkarm who had previously spent time in Israeli prisons but who gave no prior warning of an attack. Tel Aviv District police commander Haim Sergoff told Arutz Sheva, 'Security guards from Brinks heard shouts of, 'Allahu akhbar,' identified the stabbings, fired shots, and hit the terrorist, who is a resident of the [Palestinian Authority-controlled] territories.'

Barnea raised the suggestion to attack Iran after three strikes against Yemen failed to stop the Houthis from firing missiles into Israel. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Mossad chief David Barnea reportedly has suggested striking directly at Iran to deal with attacks from Houthis. Still, according to Haaretz, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz responded that they preferred to keep hitting the Houthis directly. Barnea raised the suggestion to attack Iran after three strikes against Yemen failed to stop the Houthis from firing missiles into Israel. The Mossad reportedly believes it is more effective to hit Iran directly since it funds the Yemenite terror group. Mossad chief David Barnea has been pushing Israel's leadership to concentrate on attacking Iran as a way to stem attacks from the Houthi rebels, according to reports Wednesday, as senior officials hinted that strikes against the Iran-backed Yemeni group were set to escalate in the near future. The stance reportedly adopted by Barnea stands in contrast to the opinion of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz, who prefer to keep carrying out strikes against the Houthis themselves rather than against Iran. According to the Haaretz newspaper, Barnea raised the option during a series of discussions on the lack of results from three earlier rounds of strikes in Yemen. The report stated that the Mossad chief believes it would be more effective to go after Iran, which funds and arms the Shiite rebel group. 'We need to go head-on against Iran,' Barnea told security officials, according to Channel 13. 'If we only attack the Houthis, it's not certain that we'll be able to stop them.' There was no independent confirmation of whether these conversations took place, and the reports were based on statements from anonymous sources. According to Channel 13, Netanyahu responded to Barnea that Iran was 'a different issue, which will be dealt with at the appropriate time.'' Members of the security establishment reportedly shared Netanyahu's assessment. In the past ten days, the Houthis have fired five ballistic missiles and five drones at Israel, damaging property and causing injuries.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In response to Hamas blaming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the stalling of the hostage deal, the premier says the terror group is lying once again, i24 reports. Although Hamas leaked to the BBC last week that the hostage deal was '90%' completed, the two sides have reached yet another impasse as Hamas has once again refused to release a list of living hostages to be released in the first phase of the agreement. However, the terror group responsible for the October 7th massacre says it is the Prime Minister who is responsible for the breakdown in talks and alleges that he has made additional demands. Hamas claimed, 'The negotiation for a ceasefire and exchanging prisoners was carried out secretly, through Qatari and Egyptian mediation, in a serious manner.' They continued, 'Hamas showed responsibility and flexibility, but Israel imposed new demands related to a troop withdrawal from the [Gaza] Strip, the implementation of the ceasefire, the prisoner exchange and return of the refugees – this led to a delay in reaching an agreement, which was possible.' In response, the Prime Minister's office responded, 'The terrorist organization Hamas is once again lying, going back on agreements that have already been reached, and it continues to impose roadblocks in the negotiation process. Despite this, Israel will continue with unstinting efforts to bring back all of our captives.' On Tuesday, Israeli officials expressed frustration that Mohammed Sinwar, brother of slain October 7th mastermind Yahya Sinwar, had refused to submit a list of hostages to be released in phase one of the agreement. However, the Israeli delegation has remained in Qatar to proceed with negotiations, which nonetheless seem stalled. Denying claims that Mohammed Sinwar, the commander of Hamas's military wing, has refused to provide details regarding the condition of Israeli captives, the official said that it was simply 'impossible' to gather all of the information requested by Israel as long as the 'situation' continues in the Gaza Strip.

Two record-breaking menorahs light path of hope	Now, from the White House lawn to the foot of the Eiffel Tower, some 15,000 public menorahs carry on a vision of bringing Hanukkah’s message of redemption and hope to every corner of the earth. By Jewish Breaking News The world’s two largest menorahs are illuminating Hanukkah celebrations on opposite sides of the globe this year. It took 100 volunteers and an all-night effort to pull it off, but Schneider Children’s Medical Center has done it again. Their massive menorah, crafted from 25,000 recyclable balloons, now towers above the Petah Tikva skyline for the tenth straight year. In a touching tribute to the hostages in Gaza, a yellow ribbon winds through the soaring menorah. Six thousand miles west, its New York rival climbs 36 feet above Fifth Avenue. A Guinness-certified landmark designed by Yaacov Agam, the bronze behemoth has been stopping traffic near Central Park for decades. Public officials and dignitaries frequently visit this historic New York menorah during Hanukkah, including notables such as New York City Mayor Eric Adams and Israeli Consul General Asaf Zamir. However, this year’s lighting is bittersweet as it’s the first without Chabad Rabbi Shmuel Butman, whose booming voice and boundless energy made him a Hanukkah fixture until his death in August. This year marks a half-century since the first public menorah was lit at Philadelphia’s Liberty Bell in 1974. Sparked by the Lubavitcher Rebbe’s appeal to bring Hanukkah celebrations into public spaces worldwide, that pioneering ceremony set off a movement that would eventually place menorahs in city centers and landmarks across the globe. Now, from the White House lawn to the foot of the Eiffel Tower, some 15,000 public menorahs carry on a vision of bringing Hanukkah’s message of redemption and hope to every corner of the earth. document.createElement('video'); The post Two record-breaking menorahs light path of hope appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/two-record-breaking-menorahs-light-path-of-hope/	2024-12-26T09:16:18-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GfuRmfAXIAAuYCv.jpeg

By Pesach Benson, TPS Microtech, a subsidiary of Tel Aviv-based Medinol Inc., announced on Thursday the launch of human clinical trials for its microsensor platform aimed at improving heart failure treatment. The first successful implantation of the device was recently performed by Prof. Erez Sharoni at Beilinson Medical Center in Petah-Tikva. Utilizing external ultrasound communication, the microsensor enables current implants to function as smart devices, capable of gathering real-time data and performing multiple functions simultaneously. 'This amazing technology may change the standard of care for patients suffering from heart failure and in particular, in this current study, those who are receiving LVADs or heart transplants,' said Sharoni. The data collected by the microsensors will be used to assist heart failure specialists in making clinical decisions. 'Heart failure is characterized by periods of quiescence, followed by periods of deterioration, which require repeat hospitalizations. This ground-breaking technology will allow us to track patients’ parameters in real time, to intervene earlier if needed and to reduce these patients’ morbidity and mortality' explained Dr. Tuvia Ben-Gal, Head of Heart Failure at Rabin Medical Center. Medinol CEO Dr. Yoram Richter, CEO of Medinol said the technology could be applied clinical scenarios such as heart failure, glaucoma, hydrocephalous, portal hypertension, and more. 'Incorporating sensors into existing medical devices gives physicians the ability to treat patients based on quantifiable physiological parameters instead of symptoms and is a critical step to growing access to equitable healthcare across the global community,' Richter explained. 'Using a compact home unit, a patient with a Microtech-enabled implant can deliver immediate and highly accurate pressure readings directly to their physician turning geographical distance or mobility challenges into a non-issue.'

Arab leaders urging Trump to replace Mahmoud Abbas	The Arab leaders revealed that not only is Abbas preventing an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, but he is also obstructing efforts to resolve the situation in Gaza due to his political weakness and low popularity. By Baruch Yedid, TPS Arab leaders are urging President-elect Donald Trump to take measures to replace Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas amid the PA’s floundering effort to crack down on Jenin-area terror groups. An Arab diplomat, who took part in a series of meetings recently held by Steve Witkoff, Trump’s new Middle East advisor, told The Press Service of Israel that a series of Arab leaders said they see no reason to have any diplomatic contact with Abbas. TPS-IL was told that these demanded that new US administration act as soon as possible to bring about the establishment of a new Palestinian leadership, if the administration intends to bring about a permanent solution in the Gaza Strip. The Arab leaders told Witkoff that not only is Abbas preventing a comprehensive agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, but he is also obstructing efforts to resolve the situation in Gaza due to his political weakness and low popularity. 'The plan to restore Palestinian governance in Gaza, the one that Abu Mazen sent to the White House several months ago, was rejected outright and the Americans are not willing to discuss it due to the understanding that Abu Mazen [Abbas] cannot constitute a governing force in the Gaza Strip,' the source told TPS-IL. He explained that Abbas launched a crackdown on terror groups in Jenin 'to demonstrate his governing capabilities, but for now there is no change in the position of the moderate Arab countries on this matter.' Palestinian sources told TPS-IL that Abbas’s plan to restore PA governance to Gaza was not discussed at any Cabinet meetings and is not familiar to members of the Fatah Central Committee. The sources said Abbas’s plan was apparently only shared with three close associates: intelligence chief Majed Faraj, Prime Minister Muhammad Mustafa, and senior Palestine Liberation Organization figure Hussein al-Sheikh. 'The Palestinian Authority now has no possibility of influencing the emerging situation in the Gaza Strip, and apart from the plan that was sent to the White House after being hastily prepared, there is no real Palestinian strategy,' one Palestinian source told TPS-IL. Meanwhile, Palestinian Authority security operations against terror groups in Jenin have shown no successes after 19 days. A senior PA official told TPS-IL during the initial raids that the crackdown was part of a broader strategy to demonstrate PA authority’s ability to maintain governance as Ramallah eyes eventually administering the Gaza Strip. The Arab diplomat told TPS-IL that Arab leaders see the PA’s action as insufficient. Palestinians have not held national elections since 2005 and Abbas is now in the 19th year of what was supposed to be a four-year term. Since then, Abbas has cancelled several attempted elections amid Fatah-Hamas disagreements, most recently in 2021. The most recent public opinion survey, released by the Ramallah-based Arab World for Research and Development in mid-December, found 71% of Palestinians were dissatisfied with the leadership of PA President Mahmoud Abbas. Reasons included not providing a vision for the postcrisis period (76%), limited communication with the public (77%) and dissatisfaction with his approach to governance (73%) The post Arab leaders urging Trump to replace Mahmoud Abbas appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/arab-leaders-urging-trump-to-replace-mahmoud-abbas/	2024-12-26T08:31:20-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/AP22266547201810.jpg
IAF hits Houthi terror sites across Yemen, including airport in S...	The strikes came during a televised address by Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi. By JNS The Israeli Air Force conducted strikes on the western coast of and deep inside Yemen on Thursday evening, including Sanaa International Airport in the Houthi-controlled capital, the IDF said. The targets included the Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib power stations, in addition to terror infrastructure in the Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Kanatib ports. 'These military targets were used by the Houthi terrorist regime to smuggle Iranian weapons into the region and for the entry of senior Iranian officials. This is a further example of the Houthis’ exploitation of civilian infrastructure for military purposes,' the IDF said. 'The Houthi terrorist regime is a central part of the Iranian axis of terror, and their attacks on international shipping vessels and routes continue to destabilize the region and the wider world. … The IDF will not hesitate to operate at any distance against any threat to the State of Israel and its citizens,' added the statement. The strikes came during a televised address by Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi. 'Israel’s deterrence has failed against our country,' al-Houthi reportedly said. 'The Israeli enemy knows that our operations continue, they are effective and influential. Our missiles, which the [Israeli] defense systems did not succeed in intercepting, have caused great frustration in Israel and the U.S.,' he added. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday threatened Yemen’s Houthis, speaking at his office in Jerusalem before lighting the menorah on the first night of Chanukah. 'Like then, we are striking at our enemies. … The Houthis will also learn what Hamas, Hezbollah, the Assad regime and others have learned, and this will also take time. This lesson will be learned across the Middle East,' he said. On Tuesday, Defense Minister Israel Katz threatened to target the Houthi leadership. 'I warned and said that just as we dealt with [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar in Gaza, [Hamas leader Ismail] Haniyeh in Tehran and [Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah in Beirut, we will also deal with the heads of the Houthis in Sanaa and everywhere in Yemen,' said Katz. Hours later, Israel’s Arrow 3 air-defense system intercepted a Houthi ballistic missile. The projectile was downed before crossing into Israeli airspace, but air-raid sirens were triggered across much of central Israel due to the threat of falling shrapnel. Seven people were injured attempting to reach protected areas in the greater Tel Aviv and Judean Foothills (Shfela) regions, while two people were treated for anxiety, according to the Magen David Adom emergency medical service. Houthi terrorists have launched over 200 missiles and 170 drones at Israel in support of Hamas since the terrorist attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The terrorist group has escalated its attacks in recent days, scoring hits on Israel’s densely populated central region. Overnight Monday, a woman in her 60s was critically injured when she struck her head while rushing to a shelter in Tel Aviv during sirens triggered by another Houthi missile. MDA paramedics treated 25 people who were lightly hurt running to shelters or who suffered anxiety attacks. Earlier on Monday, the IDF shot down a Houthi attack drone before it crossed into Israeli airspace. Shortly before dawn last Thursday, the warhead from an intercepted missile hit an elementary school in Ramat Gan, collapsing the school’s main building but causing no injuries. Following a failed interception overnight Friday, a missile hit a playground in a residential area of Jaffa, lightly wounding 16 people. The United Nations Security Council will hold an emergency session on Monday to discuss the escalating Houthi attacks, at Israel’s request. Muhammad Ali al-Houthi, a member of the Houthi Supreme Political Council that governs parts of Yemen, said on Tuesday that he 'does not fear the Jews.' In 1900, there were about 50,000 Jews in Yemen. Following centuries of discrimination and persecution, Israel’s 'Operation Magic Carpet' from 1949 to 1950 brought nearly all remaining Yemenite Jews home. The last one remaining, Levi Marhabi, has been imprisoned by the Houthis since 2016 for allegedly helping a Jewish family flee with a Torah scroll. Muhammad Ali al-Houthi continued, 'The Yemeni people will continue to support the Gaza Strip, no matter the sacrifices.' The people of Yemen 'do not fear the Jews and do not care about any threats, but rather consider them hollow statements,' he said.

Knesset clears path for dismissal of attorney general	Israel's budget crisis was resolved after coalition leadership in an unprecedented step authorized the justice minister to initiate the process of dismissing the attorney general. By JNS Israel’s coalition leaders reached a decisive agreement on Monday night authorizing Justice Minister Yariv Levin to begin formal proceedings toward the dismissal of Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara. The agreement was reached during a critical coalition meeting that Levin left early, according to senior government sources. Following the authorization, the Knesset successfully passed an amendment to the 2024 budget early on Tuesday morning. The next phase requires Levin to initiate formal dismissal procedures, including conducting mandatory hearings, before presenting final recommendations to the government, Justice Ministry sources told Channel 12 News. The process establishes the legal groundwork to divide the attorney general’s current responsibilities into separate positions. The development follows sustained pressure from Otzma Yehudit Party leader Itamar Ben-Gvir, though coalition representatives maintain that the decision stems from broader governance considerations rather than specific political demands. Otzma Yehudit, which had previously blocked budget proceedings and threatened to stop voting with the coalition unless proceedings to fire the attorney general were initiated, supported Tuesday’s budget vote. Sources in the party said according to Ma’ariv that while they voted with the coalition on the budget amendment, this does not constitute a 'blank check.' the sources confirmed that they would continue to monitor Levin’s implementation of the dismissal process. The authorization coincides with separate discussions regarding proposed changes to the Judicial Selection Committee, which sources close to Levin cite as his primary focus during the coalition meeting. However, other coalition members disputed this characterization and suggested that the minister’s early departure was due to strategic considerations regarding the dismissal proceedings. Legal experts note that this marks the first case in Israeli history of formal proceedings initiated against a sitting attorney general. The Justice Ministry has not released an official timeline for the completion of required hearings and subsequent government deliberations. The budget, passed in second and third readings early on Tuesday, incorporates additional provisions for wartime expenditures. Finance Ministry officials confirm the amended budget maintains original defense allocations while adding emergency funding measures. Government sources indicate the coalition leadership will proceed with the dismissal process through established legal channels, emphasizing adherence to procedural requirements to prevent intervention by the Supreme Court.

Hamas says list of hostages will be provided only after truce beg...	Spokesman for Gaza terror group claims Hamas has provided partial lists of hostages to Israel, but has been unable to get information on all captives due to ongoing war. By World Israel News Staff Hamas will only provide a full list of hostages held in the Gaza Strip after a ceasefire is agreed upon and implemented in the coastal enclave, a spokesman for the terror group said Wednesday night. Speaking with the London-based Qatari-owned Al-Araby Al-Jadeed outlet, an unnamed senior Hamas official pushed back on claims by Israel that the group has consistently refused to provide a detailed list of the remaining captives and their condition. The official told the news agency that Hamas has already handed over whatever information it has on hostages held by its operatives, but emphasized that information regarding captives held by other terror groups, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad, remains scant, due to the war. Denying claims that Mohammed Sinwar, commander of Hamas' military wing, has refused to provide details regarding the condition of Israeli captives, the official said that it was simply 'impossible' to gather all of the information requested by Israel so long as the 'situation' continues in the Gaza Strip. Hamas has held talks, he claimed, with other Gaza-based terror groups, but added that a complete hostage list could not be drawn up until a ceasefire deal is reached and put into effect. Israel's negotiating team left Doha, Qatar this week, after failing to reach a breakthrough in talks with Hamas. According to the Hamas official cited in Wednesday's report, one of the main remaining stumbling blocks in the talks is issue of 'high-profile' jailed terrorists. As part of a deal to release Israeli hostages, Israel would free hundreds of jailed Palestinian terrorists. However, Hamas has demanded that Israel release some prominent terrorist figures, including those convicted of murder, as part of such a deal. Israel has thus far refused to agree to free Marwan Barghouti, terrorist mastermind from the Second Intifada, along with Hassan Salameh, Ahmad Sa'adat, Abbas al-Sayed, and others whose release Hamas has sought.

How IDF intelligence led to Hezbollah’s defeat	Israel’s success included decapitation of its senior echelon, destruction and capture of vast numbers of weapons, and killing thousands of terrorists. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel’s success in defeating Hezbollah was due to meticulous IDF intelligence work that spanned years, the IDF said Wednesday. Using all kinds of intelligence sources, the army found out who was in charge of all of Hezbollah’s various branches, the location of their most dangerous weapons, such as short- and long-range missiles and rockets, and how all the units worked, including its elite invasion forces. They also discovered and kept constant track of where the senior echelon and the group’s lethal long-range weapons were located. Thus it was not luck when in the space of a few short weeks this fall, the top three echelons of Hezbollah’s military command were assassinated, including the organization’s head, Hassan Nasrallah. Nor was it coincidence that the air force managed to destroy tens of thousands of rockets, including most if not all of Hezbollah’s arsenal of long-range precision missiles. Through its 'unprecedented' intelligence penetration, Hezbollah plans that have come to light regarding air strikes on the IDF’s Kirya headquarters as well as other landmarks in Tel Aviv such as the tall, commercial Azrieli towers that could have potentially killed thousands, were never realized. Channel 12 also reported Wednesday on Hezbollah’s plans and IDF successes that completely changed the military arena in the north. According to the report, the Iranian proxy terror group had planned to fire 16,000 rockets at Israel over a period of two days after Hamas’ October 7 surprise invasion and massacre of 1,200 people near the Gazan border. It had also intended to send its 1,700-strong Radwan force within hours over the border to wreak havoc among Israel’s northern villages and towns, followed by 5,000 more fighters within two days. Then, over the next month, it had wanted to launch 2-3,000 aerial projectiles a day, mostly aimed at metropolitan Haifa, the report said. Municipal authorities have warned for years that the huge chemical storage sites in the city should be moved, as a successful missile attack could lead to the deaths of thousands of residents. IDF intelligence knew of these plans, however, and the army acted quickly on October 7, sending 67,000 reservists northward within 17 hours, which deterred a Hezbollah ground invasion. While according to the IDF the terrorists did initially fire dozens of short-range missiles and anti-tank shells, and carried out around 90 attacks on Israeli territory, the air force responded by striking Hezbollah launch sites in Lebanon to prevent any mass launch. It then continually kept up the pressure, bombing weapons facilities, command and control centers and other military sites throughout the months that the army’s main focus was on eliminating the Hamas threat in Gaza. Although Hezbollah did escalate their air attacks, also introducing UAVs into the equation and managing to cause a great deal of property damage in the north, loss of life was limited to a few dozen soldiers and civilians, including twelve Druze children in one attack, and the center of the country, where the majority of Israel’s population lived, was mostly safe. The way IDF intelligence managed to trick Hezbollah into buying thousands of pagers it had booby-trapped, a plan it worked on for two years, was perhaps the largest Intelligence coup of the war. After they were detonated on September 17, killing some 30 Hezbollah operatives and wounded 3,000 others, the terrorists were not only down in number but dispirited and earlier this month agreed to a ceasefire pushing their forces miles away from the border. All together to date, Israel has eliminated 3,850 terrorists and wounded about 9,000, with most of the elite fighters in the Radwan force either dead or injured. Some 80% of Hezbollah’s longer-range missiles have been destroyed, and over 85,000 military items have been found and confiscated. These include over 10,000 launchers and rockets, including RPGs, Kornet missiles and mortar shells as well as about 60 surface-to-air missiles, some 9,000 explosive devices, thousands of rifles, and over 60,000 items of electronic equipment, including computers and communication devices.

Tel Aviv Stock Exchange opens floodgates for crypto trading	Starting Dec. 31, regular Israeli investors can put their shekels directly into funds that track actual Bitcoin prices. By Jewish Breaking News The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange is finally joining the crypto revolution, and the timing couldn’t be better, with Bitcoin trading at $94,200 after skyrocketing 113% in just the past year. For Israeli investors who’ve been itching to get into crypto but wanted the safety of regulated investment products, the wait is almost over. The country’s biggest financial players are bringing Bitcoin to the masses, including IBI-Kessem, Meitav, More, and Migdal. All four have already filed paperwork to launch Bitcoin tracking funds next week. Not to be left behind, Ayalon is cooking up its own managed fund. There’s just one snag: Bitcoin funds won’t trade like regular stocks. Instead of buying and selling throughout the day, investors will have to place orders that only get filled once daily. But that’s likely to change after approval for Bitcoin tracking was finally granted last week by Israel’s Securities Authority (ISA). 'The investment houses have been pleading for more than a year for ETFs to be approved and started sending prospectuses for Bitcoin funds in the middle of the year. But the regulator marches to its own tune. It has to check the details,' a senior executive at an investment house tells Calcalist. The dominos started falling when U.S. regulators made their own historic move earlier this year, letting investment houses create ETFs that directly track Bitcoin. Israel’s regulators followed suit, first opening the door to crypto futures trading in April, then taking it a step further in August by letting non-bank stock exchange members handle crypto trading and custody services. Starting Dec. 31, regular Israeli investors can put their shekels directly into funds that track actual Bitcoin prices. No more dealing with futures contracts, foreign currencies, or crypto exchanges. Just straightforward investment through Israel’s biggest, most trusted financial firms.'

‘Environmental terrorism’: Illegal Palestinian dumping turns Jude...	The Palestinian Authority has failed to address these issues—both through negligence and intentional disregard—turning pollution and environmental hazards into immediate health and ecological threats for all Israelis and Palestinians,' said Environmental Protection Minister Idit Silman. By Sveta Listratov, TPS A comprehensive environmental hazards in Judea and Samaria report released on Wednesday paints a grim picture of severe air, water, and soil contamination. The report highlights the environmental, economic, and health consequences of ongoing neglect and abuse, primarily stemming from untreated waste and sewage in areas under Palestinian Authority jurisdiction. The report, prepared by the Green Now and Regavim non-governmental organizations estimates the annual economic damage to Judea and Samaria at 2.6 billion shekels ($710 million). Green Now is an environmental think-tank. Regavim monitors illegal Palestinian construction in Judea and Samaria. At the report’s release — in an abandoned quarry-garbage dump incineration site near Psagot north of Jerusalem — the air was thick with the acrid smell of burning and decomposing waste, making it difficult to breathe even with face masks provided for the attendees. The stench could be smelled from kilometers away. Surrounding the crater, piles of decomposing garbage were scattered across the area, including tires, cartons, plastic, construction materials, and unidentifiable debris. The dump is located in Area C of Judea and Samaria, where Israel has both administrative and security jurisdiction. Environmental Protection Minister Idit Silman told The Press Service of Israel that the dump was in stark contrast from the spirit of the UN’s recent COP29 conference on climate change in Azerbaijan. 'Around the world, nations are facing shared environmental challenges—water shortages, desertification, and pollution. Israel, though small, is a global leader in innovation, from desalination to sustainable waste management. These are tools we can share with the world, but we must first address the chaos in our backyard,' she told TPS-IL. Speaking at the gathering, Silman said she would shift responsibility for Judea and Samaria’s environmental governance to her ministry from the Israel Defense Force’s Civil Administration. 'Environmental threats do not recognize borders, nationalities, or political agreements,' Silman said. 'The Palestinian Authority has failed to address these issues—both through negligence and intentional disregard—turning pollution and environmental hazards into immediate health and ecological threats for all Israelis and Palestinians.' Said Silman, 'We face over 100 illegal dumping sites being burned across Judea and Samaria every day—from the northern regions to southern Mount Hebron. For too long, environmental management in the region has been neglected. ' Voicing the frustrations of local residents, Israel Gantz, head of the Binyamin Regional Council, called for decisive government action. 'Law is law, and quality of life is non-negotiable. Every Israeli citizen deserves it,' said Gantz. 'We cannot keep living with sewage from Al-Bireh running through our valleys or the smoke from fires polluting our air. Hostile foreign actors are weaponizing the environment as a form of terrorism.' From the A-Ram Quarry overlook in Tel Zion, a vast site where heavy machinery and tractors are visibly active, the scale of the environmental challenge became even more evident. The dumping generates hazardous clouds of dust that drift directly to the nearby community of Tel Zion, less than five kilometers away, home to around 1,000 families. Residents shared their frustrations, including Yair, a father from the nearby community of Tel Zion, who said the quarry is a focal point of pollution. 'For 20 years, we’ve endured the dust, but now, with the dumpster fires, it’s a nightmare. This is environmental terrorism. How can we raise children in such conditions?' Yair said. 'We need real action. It’s not just about dust anymore—there are people here with asthma, and the air quality makes life unbearable.' Said Regavim director Meir Deutsch, 'The Palestinian Authority is not part of the solution; it’s part of the problem. Environmental sovereignty must rest with Israel to ensure accountability and enforcement.' Green Now Director General Barak Werker praised the Environmental Protection Ministry for taking action. 'This is not just about reports; it’s about results,' Werker said. 'Without immediate intervention, these problems will only deepen.'

Actress Emmanuelle Chriqui talks about Jewish pride, growing up i...	She said in a previous interview that she includes a clause in her acting contracts, stating that she will not work on Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Jewish actress Emmanuelle Chriqui opened up in a podcast interview on Tuesday about being raised in a Modern Orthodox household in Canada, being proud to be Jewish and how pro-Israel activists in Hollywood inspire her. Chriqui, 49, was born to Moroccan Jewish immigrants in Montreal, Canada. Her late mother, Liliane, was born in Casablanca, while her late father, Albert, was born in Rabat and moved to Casablanca as a child. Growing up herself in Canada, Chriqui kept kosher at home and celebrated Shabbat every week with her family. 'I was raised in a small town outside of Toronto and we were two Jewish families but I lived in, I would consider, a Modern Orthodox home,' the former 'Entourage' star told Jewish comedian Elon Gold during a guest appearance on his podcast 'Stars of David with Elon Gold.' 'We did Shabbat dinner every Friday [and] Shabbat lunch Saturday. Dad went to temple,' she said. 'All our biggest fights were [about] going out on Friday night. And my mom was an extraordinary cook. In Canada in the winter time, I would race home from school [on Fridays] so I could plug in the water, light the candles, cuz I’d be the first one home, turn the oven on low, all the things. We had milk and meat separate at home.' The 'You Don’t Mess with the Zohan' star added that she still lights Shabbat candles every week in her home. She also noted that her favorite Jewish holiday is Rosh Hashanah. Explaining why, she said: 'I love new beginnings; renewal. I love the symbolism, the food, [and] as much as I dread that it means Yom Kippur is around the corner, I love this time and I love how I feel after Yom Kippur.' She said in a previous interview that she includes a clause in her acting contracts, stating that she will not work on Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur. Chriqui has been an avid supporter of Israel for many years. After the Oct. 7 Hamas-led terrorist attack in Israel last year, she expressed solidarity with Israel and its right to defend itself against Hamas. She signed an open letter condemning the US-designated terrorist organization, has advocated for the release of the hostages still held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and shared posts on social media about the need to bring the hostages home. She has also supported efforts to counteract boycotts of Israel, including efforts to have Israel banned from the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest. Since 2020, Chriqui has been in a relationship with American actor Sam Trammell, who in early 2024 condemned antisemitism. 'Obviously this past year has been incredibly confronting on so many levels and things have come up that I’ve never lived through before,' Chriqui said during her podcast interview this week, referring to the global experiencing a rise in antisemitism since the Oct. 7 attack. She also said she thinks the 'silver lining' of this past year has been seeing how Jews in Hollywood are embracing their Judaism in different ways than perhaps before the Oct. 7 massacre. 'Like in my 20-plus years of being in Los Angeles, it’s never been like this. Like I can’t keep up with the invitations,' she said. 'It’s never been that way. Jews, fellow Jews that were like Jew-ish, suddenly it means something different. And I think that’s the thing – being Jewish in this moment has taken on a different meaning.' She said 'very much so,' Jews are starting to express pride and unity in their Jewish heritage that she has not seen before. She also told Gold that Jewish friends and pro-Israel advocates in the Hollywood community inspire her, including Hen Mazzig, Noa Tishby, Mandana Dayani and Montana Tucker. 'I’m very inspired by all of them,' she explained. Chriqui was also asked about the backlash that some Jewish celebrities receive for not speaking out publicly either enough or at all in support of Israel. 'In the beginning, I think the sentiment was that we felt so alone so who are the Jews who have millions of followers that can affect change,' she said in response. 'But it’s also about releasing expectations; releasing judgments. What I might do works for me, might not work for you. And I think really we need to be more tolerate with each other, especially within the community. That’s something that breaks my heart a little bit.' 'I think that speaking out against antisemitism on my platform, for me, is about standing tall in who I am. So it’s much less about what happened but really embracing who we are,' she noted.

IDF soldier KIA in Gaza brings wartime death toll to 822	His funeral was scheduled for Thursday at 3 p.m. local time at the Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem. By JNS An Israel Defense Forces reservist was killed in combat in the central Gaza Strip on Wednesday, the military said on Thursday morning. He was identified as Capt. (res.) Amit Levi, 35, from Shomria, a religious kibbutz in southern Israel. His funeral was scheduled for Thursday at 3 p.m. local time at the Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem. His death brings the IDF’s total death toll since the start of the war on Oct. 7, 2023, to 822, and to 390 since the start of Gaza ground operations on Oct. 27, 2023. The IDF on Monday night announced that three IDF soldiers had been killed fighting Hamas terrorists in northern Gaza. They were identified as Capt. Ilay Gavriel Atedgi, 22, from Kiryat Motzkin; Staff Sgt. Netanel Pessach, 21, from Elazar; and Sgt. 1st Class (res.) Hillel Diener, 21, from Talmon. All three served in the Shimshon Battalion 92 of the military’s Kfir Brigade, the announcement noted.

As Israel negotiates possible withdrawal, defense chief vows IDF ...	Israel reportedly in talks with Hamas for a staggered withdrawal from large parts of the Gaza Strip - but Defense Minister Israel Katz insists IDF will retain security control of the enclave. By World Israel News Staff The IDF will retain security control over the Gaza Strip, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz pledged Wednesday, even as Israel's negotiating team has been in talks with Hamas for a ceasefire and hostage deal which would include a withdrawal from most of the coastal enclave. Prior to the departure of the Israeli delegation from Doha this week, negotiators discussed the current proposal on the table for a three-stage ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the release of hostages in exchange for the freeing of hundreds of jailed Palestinian terrorists. As part of the proposed ceasefire agreement, Israel would withdraw from large swaths of the Gaza Strip, though Jerusalem has insisted the IDF remain in control over several key strategic areas, including the Philadelphi Corridor on the Egypt-Gaza border, the Netzarim Corridor separating northern and southern Gaza, and a buffer zone running parallel to the Israeli border. During a visit to the Philadelphi Corridor Wednesday, Defense Minister Katz insisted that the IDF would retain 'security control' in Gaza, without specifying the nature of that control, and whether the Israeli military would cede large portions of the Gaza Strip to either Palestinian control or a foreign Arab peacekeeping force. 'I came to visit Gaza to meet the commanders and soldiers who are doing a great job, displaying bravery, resourcefulness, and determination, while the need to create conditions to free the hostages and ensure Israel's security is in their sights,' Katz said during his tour of the Philadelphi Corridor, accompanied by Southern Command Commanding Officer Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman and Gaza Division Commander Brig. Gen. Barak Hiram. 'Security will remain in the hands of the IDF which will be able to work in every way to remove threats, prevent tunnels, prevent terrorist infrastructure, and prevent terrorists from organizing and attempting to harm the State of Israel and IDF soldiers.' 'We will make sure that what we saw as far as infiltration tunnels, what we saw as far as threats, while we saw this heroic war that destroyed these capabilities - will not return. We will make sure that the security control will be in the hands of the IDF which will be allowed to work in every location to prevent threats.' Katz compared Israel's security measures in Gaza to steps taken in Lebanon and Syria, referencing 'security areas' and 'buffer zones.' Israel is in the midst of withdrawing from southern Lebanon, in keeping with a 60-day ceasefire deal which went into effect on November 27th. In Syria, Israel has moved troops into the 96-square-mile demilitarized zone on the Syrian-side of the Golan Heights. Jerusalem has insisted the move, taken after rebel forces ousted President Bashar Assad on December 8th, is temporary, though Hebrew news reports indicate the military as been instructed to prepare to remain in the DMZ through 2025.

Israel to send UN report on torture, enslavement, sex abuse of ho...	The report also focuses on their difficulties in returning to normal life after being freed. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel is sending a report to the United Nations soon detailing the torture and sex abuse the hostages underwent at the hands of their terrorist captors in Gaza as well as its ongoing consequences, Channel 12 reported Thursday. Doctors and psychologists from the Ministries of Health and Welfare and Social Affairs authored the report after collecting testimonies of both the children and adults who were brutally abducted last October 7 during the Hamas-led invasion and massacre, and were released some two months later in a hostage deal. There was both physical and psychological torture, and the age of the hostages made no difference. The report details how many children were purposely separated from their parents. They were forced to watch footage of the terrorists slaughtering people during their rampage through Gaza-border communities, and witnessed fellow hostages dying in front of their eyes. Some were branded on their legs with a hot iron so that they would be easily spotted if they managed to escape. They were constantly threatened with violence if they spoke aloud, and the threats were carried out. Both children and adults suffered repeated sexual abuse. Some female captives also became slaves to their captors, forced to cook and clean for their families. They were tied hand and foot for long periods of time and were deliberately starved, often only receiving one small meal a day. Among the adults, some underwent surgery or painful procedures for the wounds sustained during their capture – without anesthetic. Others were forced to defecate on themselves instead of being allowed to use the bathroom. The second part of the report deals with the difficult aftermath of their experiences. Some continue to suffer from acute trauma and panic attacks, and have difficulty leaving their homes or speaking in a regular tone of voice. They complain of having severe pains that have no medical explanation. Children can’t sleep by themselves, and exhibit great trauma related to food, hiding it, avoiding eating, or going to the other extreme and massively overeating. Many have yet to return to their normal lives, whether going to school or to work. All the doctors and psychologists that the media outlet contacted said that without exception, the hostages say that they cannot fully acclimate to their freedom knowing that there are still hostages left in the terror tunnels of Gaza, suffering still as they had, but over a year later. Out of the hundred still held captive, 34 are known dead but most expect that at best, perhaps 50 are still alive, with many saying that number is probably much lower.

Ancient oil lamp, decorated with Temple symbols, discovered in Je...	Rare find sheds light on Jewish community in Jerusalem under Roman occupation after the Bar Kochba revolt. By World Israel News Staff A rare ceramic oil lamp from the Late Roman period, decorated with depictions of the Temple menorah, incense shovel and lulav (date palm branch used in Jewish ritual), was recently uncovered during an Israel Antiquities Authority archaeological dig near the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. The find, which, judging by the soot marks on its nozzle, was used for lighting about 1,700 years ago, provides a glimpse into Jewish cultural and religious life during this period. 'The exquisite artistic workmanship of the lamp, which was found complete, makes it an outstanding and extremely rare ' says Michael Chernin, excavation director on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority. 'The menorah, incense shovel and lulav are symbols associated with the Jewish connection to the Temple. This finding is particularly surprising, since, we have very little evidence of the existence of a Jewish settlement in and around Jerusalem from this period.' 'After the Roman emperor Hadrian suppressed the Bar Kochba rebellion in 135 CE, Jews were expelled from the city. The Mount of Olives lamp is one of the few material traces of a Jewish presence around Jerusalem in the 3rd-5th centuries CE.' According to Benjamin Storchan, Israel Antiquities Authority research archaeologist, the lamp belongs to the 'Beit Nattif' type, named after its production workshop identified in the 1930's near Bet Shemesh. The nozzle and lamp shoulders were decorated with geometric designs and the center features a detailed deception of the seven branched menorah with a tripod base. Oil lamps with menorah decorations are exceedingly rare and only a few similar Beit Nattif type lamps can be found in the National Treasures archive. The choice of symbols on the lamp is not accidental. 'This is a fascinating testimony connecting everyday objects and faiths among ancient Jerusalem’s inhabitants,' said Storchan. 'It seems that the lamp belonged to a Jew, who purchased it because of its religious affiliation and memorial to the Temple.' 'It is evident that the lamp maker dedicated a great deal of time and effort to its decoration' adds Storchan. 'The lamp was made using delicately and intricately carved limestone molds using drills and chisels. The molds were made in two parts (upper and lower).' 'To create the lamp, the potter pressed the clay into the molds then pressed together. Finally, the vessel was fired, and it could be used. This method of producing lamps in molds allowed for refined designs, as well as the addition of delicate and intricate decorations.' 'The Temple menorah became a Jewish symbol in the Second Temple period. However, after the Temple’s destruction, the menorah image became an important icon in the Jewish collective memory both within Israel and the Diaspora.' 'The menorah occasionally appears on personal objects such as oil lamps, which – being an illumination vessel, perhaps evoked a feeling of lighting the Temple menorah.'

How will Israel deter future Houthi attacks?	Netanyahu pledges that Houthis will learn 'the same lessons' as Hezbollah and Hamas. By World Israel News Staff Israel is currently planning for more intensive strikes on the Yemen-based Houthis, including assassinations of the terror group's leaders. Previous Israeli strikes on Houthi-controlled infrastructure, including ports and oil assets, have failed to deter the Houthis from launching ballistic missiles and explosive drones at Israel. During a Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged that the Houthis would suffer the same fate as other Iranian proxies that attacked Israel. 'The Houthis will learn what Hamas and Hezbollah and the Assad regime and others learned, and even if it takes time, this lesson will be learned throughout the Middle East,' Netanyahu said. An anonymous security source told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet that Israel is gearing up for strikes on Houthi leadership and weapons depots, which may be carried out with the U.S. 'The Houthis will pay a heavy price, there will be a ratcheting up of Israeli attacks,' the official said. 'But it’s nothing compared to what will happen once Trump enters office. The Americans are planning to impose an embargo on them and sanctions.' The source added that Israel perceives the Houthis as a 'tough nut to crack.' In recent weeks, the Houthis have escalated their attacks against the Jewish State. Last Thursday, a Ramat Gan elementary school was destroyed by a Houthi missile, triggering retaliatory Israeli airstrikes on Houthi-controlled ports and oil facilities in Yemen. Undeterred by the strikes, the Houthis launched a missile in the early hours of Saturday morning, which struck a park in south Tel Aviv, wounding 16. On Tuesday, the Houthis launched another missile, which sent approximately 4 million Israelis scrambling to bomb shelters. One woman was seriously injured in a fall while running to safety. The missile was intercepted. Another launch on Wednesday was shot down, but shrapnel from the interception damaged a home in the central Israel town of Be'er Yaakov. A drone launched by the Houthis late Wednesday afternoon triggered sirens in the southern city of Ashkelon and surrounding areas. The drone was not intercepted, and crashed in an open area, according to the IDF.

‘Israel will be forced to attack Iran soon’ – Former DM	An Israeli strike on Iran will happen in the near future, says former defense minister Yoav Gallant. By World Israel News Staff Israel will need to directly attack Iran 'in the near future,' former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said at a Hannukah candle-lighting ceremony on Wednesday evening. Speaking at the holiday event in Ramat Gan, Gallant said that the losses suffered by Hezbollah and Hamas during the ongoing war had weakened Iran. Gallant said that Israel will partner with the U.S. on missions to eliminate the Yemen-based Houthi leadership and their weapons depots. These joint operations are 'preparation for future action we will need to take against Iran,' he said. He added that a strike on Iran would happen 'in the near future.' It is Israel's 'duty' to 'remove the threat' of Iran and its proxies, Gallant stressed. The former defense minister noted that the ongoing holiday of Hanukkah commemorates an unlikely military triumph. 'There is nothing like the holiday of Hanukkah that shows the victory of spirit over might, the victory of the few over the many, and the legacy of heroism - which began in those days and continues today,' Gallant said. According to Hebrew-language media reports, the Mossad intelligence agency is urging a decisive strike against Iran, rather than focusing military assets on fighting the Houthis. 'We need to go head-on against Iran,' Mossad head David Barnea was quoted as saying by Channel 13 News. 'If we only attack the Houthis, it’s not certain that we’ll be able to stop them.' Other reports quoted Barnea as emphasizing the importance of going after the 'head of the snake,' arguing that the Houthis are doing the Iranians' bidding. According to the report, Netanyahu said that an attack on Iran is a 'different issue,' which will be dealt with 'at the appropriate time.'

Gaza famine report withdrawn after ‘irresponsible’ exaggerations	It is irresponsible to issue a report like this,' says outgoing U.S. Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew. By World Israel News Staff A report claiming that the Gaza Strip is enduring an ongoing famine was withdrawn, following criticism by the U.S. Ambassador to Israel regarding the document's methodology and claims. The Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET) published a report on Tuesday which charged that civilians in the northern district of the Strip are suffering from 'acute malnutrition,' according to calculations made based on the number of people in the area and the amount of humanitarian aid entering the region. FEWS NET is an entity created in 1985 by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the U.S. Department of State, which aims to track global food insecurity. U.S. Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew noted that the FEWS NET report appeared to use outdated data, as well as dramatically exaggerated the number of civilians in the area, which appeared to have been inflated by five to ten times the actual number. 'The report issued today on Gaza by FEWS NET relies on data that is outdated and inaccurate,' Lew wrote on his official X account. 'It is now apparent that the civilian population in that part of Gaza is in the range of 7,000-15,000, not 65,000-75,000, which is the basis of this report,' he continued. 'At a time when inaccurate information is causing confusion and accusations, it is irresponsible to issue a report like this. We work day and night with the UN and our Israeli partners to meet humanitarian needs — which are great — and relying on inaccurate data is irresponsible.' Much of the humanitarian aid which enters the Strip is stolen by Hamas or armed looting gangs. The vast majority of the aid meant to be distributed to civilians is usurped by strongmen and sold to the population at exorbitant prices. On Wednesday, FEWS NET unpublished the report.

Netanyahu hints at major IDF campaign against Houthis	The Houthis will learn what Hamas and Hezbollah learned,' says Israeli prime minister on the first night of Hanukkah. By World Israel News Staff Following a string of missile attacks on Israel by pro-Iranian Houthi rebels in Yemen, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hinted that the IDF is poised to target the rebel group's leadership, warning that it will suffer the same fate as Hamas and Hezbollah. At an event in the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem Wednesday evening marking the first night of Hanukkah, Prime Minister Netanyahu list the Hanukkah candles together with PMO employees and senior officials, and their children. Also attending the lighting were Orna and Ronen Neutra, who met with the Prime Minister earlier today, the parents of Capt. Omer Neutra of blessed memory, an IDF Armored Corps officer who fell in the fighting in the Western Negev on October 7th and whose body was taken hostage by Hamas. 'Today we are lighting the first candle of Chanukah to mark the victory of the Maccabees then, and also the victory of 'the Maccabees of today,' Netanyahu said after the candle lighting . 'Like then, we are striking at our enemies, and those who thought they could cut the thread of our lives here then, this will apply to them all.' 'The Houthis will also learn what Hamas, Hezbollah, the Assad regime and others have learned, and this will also take time. This lesson will be learned across the Middle East, I tell you, in those days at this season.' Netanyahu's comments echoed similar warnings by Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud), who said this week that Houthi leaders would suffer the same fate as the late Hamas politburo chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in an Israeli operation in Iran. 'Just as we took care of Sinwar in Gaza, Haniyeh in Tehran and Nasrallah in Beirut, we will deal with the heads of the Houthis in Sana’a or anywhere in Yemen,' Katz said.

Hostage family chanukah gathering evacuated due to security threa...	Israel Police: 'In response to reports of a suspicious individual in the Tel Aviv area, we are conducting extensive searches and operational activities.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Wednesday night, police evacuated a candle-lighting ceremony held by hostage families because of a security threat. The event was held across from IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv. The Israel Police stated, 'In response to reports of a suspicious individual in the Tel Aviv area, we are conducting extensive searches and operational activities. The investigation is ongoing, and no further details about the incident are available at this time.' A senior source reported that a terror-suspect from Jenin entered the Tel Aviv area, and as a result, there was a perceived threat to the candle lighting ceremony. Last month, the IDF conducted an extensive raid on Jenin. Five Palestinian militants were killed as Israeli security forces dismantled four explosives laboratories in Jenin. The military reported seizing weapons components and five lathes used in weapon production. Additionally, a warehouse used by terrorist groups to store cameras and dozens of explosives were destroyed. Seven suspected militants were also arrested. Last week, Palestinian Authority security forces continued a rare crackdown on terror strongholds in Jenin. An Israeli military source described the raids to The Press Service of Israel as 'the most serious Palestinian operation in recent years.' The operation prompted a general strike across the area, with businesses, schools, and UNRWA offices closing in protest. Human rights organizations are urging the PA to end the campaign. Dubbed 'Operation Homeland Defense,' PA forces have taken control of four neighborhoods in the Jenin refugee camp, surrounded hospitals, and conducted thorough searches in alleyways. A Palestinian Authority source told TPS-IL that the raids were personally ordered by PA President Mahmoud Abbas, who instructed security forces, 'Do not return until you have full control of the camp, no matter the cost.' During the operation, PA forces killed Yazid Ja’isa, a commander in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group. Ja’isa had previously clashed with the PA, including an incident where he seized weapons from Palestinian police stationed at Joseph’s Tomb and threatened to exchange them for the release of imprisoned Islamic Jihad members in Jericho.

Marwan Barghouti tops Palestinian polls for PA leadership as fami...	The AWRAD survey also found 71% of Palestinians were dissatisfied with the leadership of PA President Mahmoud Abbas. By Pesach Benson, TPS As the family of imprisoned Palestinian terror commander Marwan Barghouti lobbies for his release in a widely anticipated ceasefire, a Palestinian survey released found overwhelming support for him to succeed Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. The survey, conducted by the Ramallah-based Arab World for Research and Development (AWRAD), is the first since Hamas’s Gaza strongman and mastermind of the October 7 attacks Yahya Sinwar was killed in a chance encounter with soldiers in Rafah in October. As recently reported by The Press of Service of Israel, Barghouti’s family and lawyers have been in Qatar engaging in negotiations over his potential release and deportation to Turkey, along with other senior terrorists. Senior Fatah officials told TPS-IL that Barghouti’s wife, Fadwa, and son Qassam have consented to the arrangement. AWRAD’s survey of 704 Palestinians in Judea, Samaria and Gaza found Barghouti was the most popular figure to succeed Abbas. In a three-way race between Barghouti, his cousin, independent Mustafa Barghouti, and former Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal, Marwan Barghouti garnered the highest support with 45%, followed by Mustafa Barghouti at 22%, and Mashaal at 10%. The remaining 23% of respondents indicated they would vote for other candidates or abstained from answering. TPS-IL has learned that Egypt and Qatar support Hamas’s demand to release Barghouti because they want to pave the way for him to succeed Mahmoud Abbas as leader of the Palestinian Authority. Both countries fear that without a clear plan of succession, the PA will collapse after Abbas, who is 89. Israel is not likely to agree to Barghouti returning to Judea and Samaria under any circumstances. Barghouti, 65, is the highest profile Palestinian imprisoned in Israel. During the Second Intifada, he led the Tanzim militia, which was made up of various Fatah-associated terror groups. Foremost among these groups was the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, which Barghouti directly commanded and which carried out numerous suicide bombings and shooting attacks. A civilian court in 2004 convicted Barghouti for his role in the murder of a Greek Orthodox monk, a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv that killed three, and a shooting attack that killed one. Barghouti was also convicted of attempted murder for an attack in which a suicide bomber’s explosive detonated prematurely at a Jerusalem mall. He is currently serving five life sentences in an Israeli prison for his role in three terror attacks that killed five Israelis during the Second Intifada. The AWRAD survey also found 71% of Palestinians were dissatisfied with the leadership of PA President Mahmoud Abbas. Reasons included not providing a vision for the postcrisis period (76%), limited communication with the public (77%) and dissatisfaction with his approach to governance (73%) Palestinians have not held national elections since 2005 and Abbas is now in the 19th year of what was supposed to be a four-year term. Since then, Abbas has cancelled several attempted elections amid Fatah-Hamas disagreements, most recently in 2021.

Stroke survivors’ cognitive skills could unlock better recovery p...	Tasks that require adaptability, self-monitoring, and responsiveness — skills integral to rehabilitation — become significantly harder for stroke survivors. By Pesach Benson, TPS Although it is known that cognitive impairments impact stroke survivors, an Israeli study released on Wednesday specifically identifies the ability to understand and follow instructions as a foundational element for motor recovery and rehabilitation success. The findings are expected to lead to more personalized treatment and integration of technology into rehabilitation. A stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted or significantly reduced, depriving brain cells of oxygen and nutrients, usually the result of a clot or bleeding. This can result in the death of brain cells within minutes, leading to potentially severe and lasting physical and cognitive damage. According to the World Stroke Organization, in 2019, there were approximately 12.2 million new stroke cases globally, while 101 million survivors were living with the aftermath of one. A team of researchers from the Joint Laboratory for Neurological Rehabilitation Research at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and the Negev Nahalat Eran Hospital uncovered new insights into the interplay between cognitive impairments and motor recovery after a stroke. The findings were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, Neuropsychology. Dr. Reut Binyamin-Netzer and Prof. Lior Shmuelof from Ben-Gurion University’s Department of Cognitive and Brain Sciences led the study, which sought to understand how stroke affects the ability to follow instructions and identify the cognitive skills that underpin this capability. They focused on the cognitive processes that enable patients to learn and execute therapeutic tasks. According to the study, cognitive impairments — such as memory deficits, attention problems, and reduced executive function — affect 72% of stroke survivors. These challenges not only impair daily functioning but also hinder participation in rehabilitation programs. One particularly troubling consequence of cognitive impairment is the difficulty in learning and following instructions. Tasks that require adaptability, self-monitoring, and responsiveness — skills integral to rehabilitation — become significantly harder for stroke survivors. Recognizing the importance of these abilities, the researchers focused their investigation on the link between cognitive deficits and motor recovery. The study involved 31 stroke survivors and 36 age-matched control participants aged 55-75. All participants completed a series of computerized tasks designed to evaluate their ability to respond to stimuli based on color and location, as well as their capacity for delayed response and symbol-based information processing. The results revealed a notable decline in accuracy and reaction times among stroke survivors compared to the control group. Additionally, the stroke group exhibited slower information processing and reduced ability to delay responses. Importantly, the researchers found a direct correlation between the ability to delay a response and the capacity to follow instructions. 'The ability to delay a response has a significant impact on patients’ participation in the rehabilitation process,' explained Binyamin-Netzer. 'Understanding instructions is fundamental to motor recovery because rehabilitation relies on following structured tasks.' The researchers advocate for early, intensive rehabilitation programs that leverage computerized technologies to enhance recovery. These interventions should focus on improving cognitive abilities, which are intricately linked to motor recovery. Said Shmuelof, 'In an era where video games and other technologies are central to rehabilitation, understanding the connection between cognitive functions and recovery is critical.'

Bracing for Israeli retaliation, Houthis raise combat readiness a...	The Houthis have ordered the evacuation of civilians from areas close to the major coastal city of Hodeidah and have called troops to the front lines. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Wednesday, the Houthis raised the combat readiness for Yemen to its highest level in anticipation of Israeli retaliation, Saudi media reports. They have ordered the evacuation of civilians from areas close to the major coastal city of Hodeidah and have called troops to the front lines. Ashraq Al-Aswat reports that after the Israeli Defense Minister threatened to execute their leadership in a similar way to the killings of Hamas and Hezbollah leadership, the Houthis called up many new recruits. Other soldiers were moved to Yemen's cities to prevent an uprising similar to what occurred in Syria with the fall of the Assad regime. Merchants who own warehouses in the 'Kilo 7' district in Hodeidah were told to empty their facilities and prepare for the destruction of their property. Yemeni government officials said the Houthis had reinforced trenches, minefields, and earthen berms along the frontlines. The terror group warned civilians to avoid discussing attacks over the phone or by text and to be content with simply checking on the well-being of their relatives. Israel's defense minister signaled on Tuesday that the IDF is preparing for a major retaliation against pro-Iranian forces in Yemen after a string of missile attacks on Israel. Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) visited a Hetz (Arrow) missile defense battery Tuesday morning, accompanied by air defense commander Brig. Gen. Gilad Biran. The visit came hours after the missile battery successfully shot down a missile fired by Yemenite Houthis toward central Israel overnight. Katz said that Israel 'will not tolerate' continued attacks from pro-Iranian forces in Yemen and intimated that the IDF is preparing to assassinate Houthi leaders. 'We will not tolerate the fact that the Houthis continue to fire at the State of Israel. I warned and said that just as we dealt with Sinwar in Gaza, Haniyeh in Tehran, and Nasrallah in Beirut, we will also deal with the Houthi leaders in Sana'a and everywhere in Yemen,' Katz said. Shrapnel from a Houthi missile shot down the IDF and damaged a home in central Israel early on Wednesday. Sirens sent millions to shelters, but there were no injuries.

Foreign investment in Israel surged in 2024, despite conflict	U.S. investors dominated the market, contributing $24 billion, representing 73% of total foreign investments. By JNS Preliminary numbers for the first half of 2024 show a 15% increase in foreign investment in Israel, according to the annual report of the Chief Economist’s Office of Israel’s Finance Ministry, published on Tuesday. With the exception of a major investment by Intel, 2023 saw a 24% decline in foreign investment in Israeli hi-tech compared to the previous year, the report states, according to Israel’s Globes business daily. Only 1,563 deals were concluded in 2023, compared to 2,502 in 2022—a drop of 62%. Key investments included Thales SA’s $3.6 billion Imperva merger and Adani Group’s $1.2 billion Haifa Port acquisition. Semiconductor investments led sectoral distribution at 48%, followed by IT at 31% and life sciences at 6%. U.S. investors dominated the market, contributing $24 billion, representing 73% of total foreign investments. hi-tech French investments reached $3.7 billion, taking the second-place position. By contrast, preliminary 2024 data shows first-half investment volumes of $11.8 billion across 910 deals. First-quarter investments totaled $4.4 billion with 460 deals, while second-quarter figures reached $7.4 billion with 450 deals. In October 2024 alone, the hi-tech sector brought in more than $1 billion in foreign investments. 'The global trend of a slowdown in foreign investment flows in 2023 also affected Israel. Investment volumes in Israel in 2023 were bolstered by Intel’s significant investment deal, while the country faced challenges, particularly in the fourth quarter, due to the ‘Iron Swords’ conflict,' said Finance Ministry Chief Economist Shmuel Abramzon, according to Globes. 'Data for 2024 indicates a growth trend in foreign investment deals in Israel, and improved security and political stability are expected to support this trend further,' he added. However, not all signs point to improvement. The year-long war with Lebanon’s Hezbollah terrorist organization devastated Israel’s north, which will cost the country more than 5 billion shekels ($1.4 billion) to repair. The damage from Iran’s missile attack on Israel on Oct. 1 alone will cost an estimated $40 million to repair. In addition, the Finance Ministry in October significantly reduced growth projections for the coming year due to the ongoing conflict, causing it to make more than $10 billion in budget cuts while aiming to limit the deficit to just 4% of GDP. An additional step the ministry has taken to right the ship and lower the deficit from its current 8.1% of GDP to its target goal of 4% was to raise VAT to 18% beginning on Jan. 1, 2025. This increase is expected to cost Israeli families between 1,000 to 2,000 shekels ($274 to $548) annually.

ADL applauds NY Governor Hochul for signing new social media tran...	The new law forces major social media companies to be more transparent about their current policies on topics such as hate speech, disinformation, extremism, and racism, and will hold the companies accountable for hate content on their platforms. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) expressed gratitude to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul for signing into law on Tuesday legislation that will help combat hate speech on major social media platforms and ensure a safer social media experience for all users. Legislation S895B/A6789B, also known as the 'Stop Hiding Hate Act,' requires social media companies to inform all users of its terms of service. It also requires social media companies to submit reports about their terms of service and content moderation policies to the New York State Attorney General for inspection, and provides solutions for violations. The new law forces major social media companies to be more transparent about their current policies on topics such as hate speech, disinformation, extremism, and racism, and will hold the companies accountable for hate content on their platforms. New York State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal (D, WFP-Manhattan) penned the 'Stop Hiding Act' in partnership with Assembly Member Grace Lee (D-Manhattan) and the ADL. Together they have been advocating for its passage for years, according to the anti-hate organization. 'Today represents the culmination of the hard work of Senator Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Lee and tireless advocacy from community organizations and constituents across New York who support this measure for greater internet transparency and safety,' Scott Richman, the regional director of ADL New York/New Jersey, said in a released statement. 'We know there is still work to be done to protect vulnerable communities from hate and extremism online, but we commend Governor Hochul for taking this important step in creating a safer internet for all New Yorkers.' Hoylman-Sigal said in a released statement that the new law 'will help boost accountability and transparency for social media companies who currently face far too little regulation, and create a safer social media environment for all.' 'With white supremacy, antisemitism, islamophobia, anti-LGBTQ hatred and anti-AAPI violence all on the rise, social media companies must ensure that their platforms don’t advance disinformation and hate-fueled violence,' he added. 'The current social media landscape makes it too easy for bad actors to promote false claims, hate and dangerous conspiracies, too often leading to violence like January 6 and the rise in antisemitism and islamophobia we have seen in the aftermath of the October 7th terrorist attacks in Israel.' Lee noted that New York is only the second state in the US, after California, to sign into law a social media transparency bill that holds such companies accountable for their moderation policies and hate speech on their platform. 'Social media companies have created an environment where hate and disinformation spread like wildfire,' Lee explained. 'Algorithms that prioritize the most attention-grabbing posts often amplify hateful language, giving it a massive platform. These companies have a responsibility to protect users from this hate, but have failed to do so. The ‘Stop Hiding Hate Act’ ensures greater accountability and transparency on social media, requiring companies to clearly outline the steps they are taking to eliminate hate on their platforms. It will provide critical protections for all users online and hold these platforms accountable to the public.' The 'Stop Hiding Act' was part of a legislative bill package that Governor Kathy Hochul signed on Tuesday. 'With this legislative package, we are taking bold action to hold companies accountable, strengthen protections, and give consumers the transparency and security they need and deserve,' the governor said in a released statement.

Hamas, Netanyahu trade blame as hostage deal hits roadblock	Hamas accuses Israel of issuing new demands in hostage deal talks; Netanyahu accuses the terror group of lying and 'reneging on understandings already reached.' By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Hamas terror organization traded blame Wednesday afternoon after hostage deal talks in Doha, Qatar appeared to stall, amid reports that Hamas continues to withhold information regarding the condition of the roughly 100 captives held in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli negotiating team returned home following days of talks in Doha, ending the latest round of brokered negotiations. A senior official cited by Israel Hayom said Hamas was to blame for the breakdown in talks, accusing the terror group of toughening its position, after having appeared to soften it earlier this month. 'Hamas is effectively backing down from the softening that led to the renewal of the talks, and is once again demanding an Israeli commitment to end the war at the end of the comprehensive deal as a condition for implementing its first phase.' On Wednesday, Hamas issued a statement claimed that the negotiations were 'proceeding seriously' and that the group was showing 'responsibility and flexibility.' Hamas accused Israel's delegation of issuing new demands 'and conditions related to the withdrawal' of Israeli forces during a three-phase ceasefire, as well as the freeing of 'prisoners and the return of the displaced,' referring to Hamas calls to expand access to the northern Gaza Strip. Israel's alleged new demands 'delayed reaching the agreement that was available,' Hamas continued. Shortly afterwards, Netanyahu's office responded with a statement rejected Hamas' claims, accusing the terror group of lying and 'reneging' on tentative agreements reached during talks, blaming the Gaza-based organization for the apparent deadlock in negotiations. 'The Hamas terrorist organization continues to lie, is reneging on understandings that have already been reached, and is continuing to create difficulties in the negotiations,' the statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office reads. 'However, Israel will continue its relentless efforts to return all of our hostages.'

UN Security Council calls emergency session on Houthi attacks on ...	After two consecutive nights of missile attacks by Yemenite Houthis, United Nations Security Council agrees to Israel's request for an emergency session. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The United Nations Security Council agreed Wednesday to hold an emergency session next week, following multiple missile attacks by Yemenite Houthis on Israel. Israel's mission to the United Nations, headed by Ambassador Danny Danon, requested the session after pre-dawn missile attacks by the Iranian-backed Houthis on central Israel two days in a row. 'The Houthis appear not to have grasped the consequences that await those who attempt to attack Israel,' Danon said Wednesday. 'The Security Council must stand with Israel and condemn these attacks. I urge the council to uphold international law and establish Iran's accountability in this matter.' The emergency Security Council session is slated to be held next Monday. Before dawn Wednesday morning, a missile launched from Yemen was intercepted by Israel's missile defense system, leading to warning sirens sounding across hundreds of towns across central Israel due to possible shrapnel damage. A day earlier, a similar attack took place, with the missile intercepted en route to central Israel. On Tuesday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz hinted that the IDF may soon target Houthi leaders in Yemen. 'We will not tolerate the fact that the Houthis continue to fire at the State of Israel,' Katz said while visiting the missile battery which shot down the missile launched towards Israel early Tuesday morning. 'I warned and said that just as we dealt with Sinwar in Gaza, Haniyeh in Tehran, and Nasrallah in Beirut, we will also deal with the Houthi leaders in Sana’a and everywhere in Yemen.' 'We will act both against their infrastructures and against them to remove the threat and eliminate the dangers to the State of Israel in order to achieve our goals. Whoever supports Houthi terrorism in Hudaydah or Sana’a will pay the full price,' he continued.

5 wounded in clashes between IDF and Syrians in Golan Heights buf...	Syrian monitor group says IDF demanding villages in Golan Heights buffer zone surrender their weapons to prevent their seizure by Islamist rebel group now leading provisional government. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News At least five people were wounded Wednesday morning during clashes between Syrian protesters and IDF forces deployed to the demilitarized zone in the Golan Heights. Arab media outlets, including Saudi Arabia's Al-Hadath, reported that a group of Syrians living in the demilitarized zone clashed with Israeli forces during a protest against the presence of IDF troops in the Quneitra district. During the clashes, according to the report, Israeli soldiers opened fire, wounding five rioters. The incident occurred less than a day after the IDF demanded that the village leaders of Jubata al-Khashab, a small Sunni town in the DMZ less than a mile from the Israeli border, surrender all weapons stored in the village. 'They [the Israelis] told us that they have information regarding light and heavy weapons in our village,' residents said in a video released Tuesday. 'They said we have 48 hour to hand over the weapons to them. So our response is this: We have a [provisional] government, and if we have any weapons that need to be handed over, we'll give it to them.' 'They [the Israelis] told us that they are here in order to prevent ISIS soldiers or the [Syrian rebel group Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham] from entering the area, and that the are the relevant authority in the area over any weapons here.' Following the collapse of the Assad regime on December 8th, Israeli forces occupied the 100-square-mile buffer zone that separates the Israeli Golan Heights from the Syrian frontier. Established in 1974 following the Yom Kippur War, the buffer zone was carved out of the roughly 200 square miles which fell under Syrian control under the disengagement of forces agreement. Israel retained the remaining 500 square miles of the Golan, which it annexed in 1981.

American hostages must be freed first in any deal, say ex-Biden, ...	Hamas and their backers must hear the message loud and clear,' Democrat Tom Nides and Republican Robert O’Brien wrote in an op-ed. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News All seven U.S. hostages must be freed in the first stage of any deal with Hamas, two former top American officials wrote in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal Monday. In a bipartisan move, Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, and President Joe Biden’s first ambassador to Israel, Tom Nides, demanded 'the immediate release' of both the dead and living Americans being held in the Gaza Strip. 'The US has many strategic interests in the Middle East,' they wrote. 'We, like the presidents we served, don’t always agree on how to serve them&#8230;. But we are united in our belief that the seven US hostages still in Gaza, along with the other 93 hostages, must come home now.' Of the dozen Americans Hamas and other terror groups kidnapped among 251 people, including some they murdered during the invasion and massacre of 1,200 in southern Israel last October 7, five were either released alive or their bodies were recovered by IDF forces. O'Brien and Nides listed the 'American Seven,' as they called them, who were left, asking that people 'remember them at your holiday celebrations this week,' without differentiating between the dead and living. Three Americans of the hundred remaining in captivity, civilians Keith Siegal, 65, and Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, and lone soldier Edan Alexander, 20, are assumed to still be alive. Wednesday is Christmas day and the eight-day, Jewish holiday of Hanukkah will begin Wednesday evening. First addressing 'all parties' to the negotiations, the two stated, 'They aren’t a bargaining chip. They are our fellow citizens with names and family members who await them with unbearable pain.' They then turned specifically to the abductors, blasting the terror organization for using the hostages as human shields and writing, 'Hamas and their backers must hear the message loud and clear: Release the Americans in the first phase of the deal. All of them.' 'President Biden and his team have been working hard to make this happen. President-elect Trump has made clear that the American Seven must be released before he returns to office or there will be ‘hell to pay,’' they added. Hamas should learn from this that all Americans are united on this demand and that 'for the US government, bringing home our citizens who have been unlawfully detained is a high priority rooted deep in our history,' they stated. Wednesday marked the 444th day of captivity for the one hundred remaining Hamas hostages, over a third of whom are dead, thereby surpassing the amount of time American embassy staffers were held in Iranian captivity after the Islamic Revolution toppled the Shah’s regime in 1979.

Hamas not handing over list of living hostages – report	The Gaza terror group is reportedly reversing course after appearing to soften its position in hostage deal talks with Israel, and is now refusing to disclose to Israel which hostages are still alive. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization has yet to disclose to Israel which of the roughly 100 remaining captives held in the Gaza Strip are still alive, according to reports in Hebrew media outlets Wednesday. The Islamist group had indicated earlier this month its willingness to compromise on key issues which had prevented previous efforts to secure a hostage deal and ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. As part of the renewed talks between Israel and Hamas, brokered by Egypt and Qatar, Hamas reportedly agreed to hand over a list of the remaining Israeli captives and details regarding their condition. Dozens of the nearly 100 remaining hostages have been confirmed by Israeli intelligence to be dead, with some information gathered by Israel indicating that as few as 50 captives are still alive. Now, according to reporting by Kan, Israel's public broadcaster, and the Israel Hayom newspaper claim that Hamas is refusing to inform Israel which hostages are still alive. 'Hamas is effectively backing down from the softening that led to the renewal of the talks, and is once again demanding an Israeli commitment to end the war at the end of the comprehensive deal as a condition for implementing its first phase,' a senior official told Israel Hayom. Israeli negotiators left Qatar after several days of talks, and have returned home for 'internal deliberations.' The deal currently under consideration would include a three-phase ceasefire and hostage release, with Israel gradually withdrawing from most of the Gaza Strip, while Hamas frees Israeli captives in exchange for the release of hundreds of jailed Palestinian terrorists. During the first stage, five female soldiers would be released, along with elderly captives, children, and seriously ill hostages.

Two-thirds of Palestinians want Hamas in new Gaza government, sur...	17% of the surveyed Palestinians told AWRAD they favor a return to the situation in which Gaza is ruled solely by Hamas terrorists. By JNS Close to two-thirds of Palestinians in Gaza, Judea and Samaria prefer for Hamas terrorists to be part of, or even lead, a Palestinian governing body that would control the Strip after the current war with Israel concludes, according to a new Arab opinion poll published over the weekend. The Ramallah-based Arab World for Research and Development (AWRAD) polling firm surveyed 704 Palestinian adults between Nov. 27 and Dec. 2. (The margin of error is plus or minus 3.7 percentage points, AWRAD said.) According to the poll, 47% of Palestinians say they would put their trust in a government of 'national unity' that would include Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas’s Fatah faction, which currently governs swaths of Judea and Samaria, as well as Hamas, the terror group that ruled Gaza until it was destroyed by the Israel Defense Forces in recent months. Meanwhile, 17% of the surveyed Palestinians told AWRAD they favor a return to the situation in which Gaza is ruled solely by Hamas terrorists. In Judea and Samaria, respondents showed significantly more support for Hamas than for the Western-backed P.A., with 25% expressing support for the Islamist terrorist organization, compared to just 10% for the P.A. Hamas led the bloody terror attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, during which 1,200 people were murdered, thousands more were wounded and over 250 innocents were taken as hostages to the Strip. Asked about possible P.A. presidential candidates if Ramallah would call its first vote in almost 19 years, Marwan Barghouti, a convicted terrorist murderer affiliated with Fatah serving multiple life sentences in Israel, received the most support of all possible candidates for P.A. chief. In June, the Palestinians’ satisfaction with Hamas’s performance in the war against Israel reached its highest point since the Oct. 7 massacre, while support for the Palestinian Authority and Fatah plummeted. When asked by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research to rate the performance of various actors during the war, Hamas took the lead with 75% satisfaction, up five percentage points since March. The June 12 opinion poll recorded a slight drop in support for the Hamas-led massacre. Two-thirds declared Hamas was 'correct' in launching the attack, down by four percentage points compared to three months prior. Fifty-one percent said they believed that Hamas is 'the most deserving' of leading the Palestinian people, up from 49% in March. Meanwhile, 16% of Palestinian Arabs believed Abbas’s Fatah was the most deserving. Almost 60% of Palestinians said they saw the 'return of Hamas' in Gaza as the preferred outcome for the conflict, followed by 25% that preferred a 'new P.A. under an elected president, parliament and government.' The Biden administration wants the P.A. to assume control of Gaza after the completion of Israel’s military operation against Hamas. Jerusalem vehemently rejects that due to Ramallah’s overt support for terrorism. The U.S. State Department in December 2023 refused to rule out the possibility of Hamas terrorists retaining power or joining a Palestinian Authority-led governing body for the Gaza Strip, Judea and Samaria. 'Palestinians’ voices and aspirations must be at the center of post-crisis governance in Gaza, unified with the West Bank under the P.A.,' a U.S. government spokesperson told JNS, adding, 'Ultimately, the future of Palestinian leadership is a question for the Palestinian people.'

AOC compares Israel-Hamas war to Vietnam, says conflict has been ...	AOC also labeled the Israel-Hamas war a 'genocide' and argued that the Democratic Party needs to undermine Israel’s defense efforts if it aims to energize young voters and 'reinstate an order around human rights.' By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner During an interview on left-wing internet talk show The Majority Report, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) agreed that the ongoing conflict in Gaza is comparable to the Vietnam War, arguing that America’s strident support of Israel has radicalized younger Americans. While interviewing AOC, The Majority Report host Sam Seder argued that the Israel-Hamas war is 'akin' to the Vietnam War. Seder suggested that 'alternative media' such as TikTok, YouTube, or podcasts, have presented a harshly critical view of Israel’s conduct in Gaza, resulting in a wide-scale radicalization of young people against the Jewish state. 'If you’re under the age of 40 what’s gone on in Israel is in Palestine and Gaza in particular obviously and the West Bank for that matter is very different from your perception if you’re over the age of 40 because of where you get your media,' Seder said. AOC agreed, saying that she has 'said this directly to Democratic leadership' and ' communicated this to the White House.' 'This is our Vietnam. This is our, not just like in terms of the party, but this is just our country’s Vietnam. And what I think a lot of people do not yet understand, is they think that some of these hemorrhages are maybe ideological. They think maybe it is like an ethnic thing. I don’t think there is appreciation yet about how generationally radicalizing yeah this moment is, and how shocked people are at how far just like the general inertia is willing to go, as if we’re not seeing what’s happening right before our very eyes.' AOC continued, labelling the Israel-Hamas war a 'genocide' and arguing that the Democratic party needs to undermine Israel’s defense efforts if it aims to energize young voters and 'reinstate an order around human rights.' Israel says it has gone to unprecedented lengths to try and avoid civilian casualties in Gaza, noting its efforts to evacuate areas before it targets them and to warn residents of impending military operations with leaflets, text messages, and other forms of communication. However, Hamas, which rules Gaza, has in many cases prevented people from leaving, according to the Israeli military. Another challenge for Israel has been Hamas’s widely recognized military strategy of embedding its terrorists within Gaza’s civilian population and commandeering civilian facilities like hospitals, schools, and mosques to run operations and direct attacks. Over the past year, AOC has repeatedly condemned the Jewish state’s response to the Hamas terrorist group’s brutal Oct. 7 slaughter of roughly 1200 people throughout southern Israel. AOC, a strident critic of Israel, has accused the Jewish state of committing a 'genocide' and 'ethnic cleansing' in Gaza. She has spearheaded calls for a 'ceasefire' between Israel and Hamas. The progressive firebrand has also urged the Biden administration to implement an 'arms embargo' against Israel.

US blasts claims of north Gaza famine as ‘inaccurate, irresponsib...	American Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew blasts US government agency's report warning of a likely famine in the northern Gaza Strip, deriding its reliance on outdated, inaccurate information. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Biden administration's top envoy to Israel rebutted claims by an American government agency alleging that a famine is likely taking place in the northern Gaza Strip. On Monday, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) published a report warning of a likely famine in the northern Gaza Strip, specifically impacting the cities of Jabaliya, Beit Lahiya, and Beit Hanoun. 'Israel’s near-total blockade of humanitarian and commercial food supplies to besieged areas of North Gaza Governorate&#8230; has been in place for nearly 80 days,' the report said. 'Based on the collapse of the food system&#8230; it is highly likely that the food consumption and acute malnutrition thresholds for Famine (IPC Phase 5) have now been surpassed in North Gaza Governorate.' 'In the absence of a change to Israeli policy on the entry of food and nutrition supplies to this area, FEWS NET expects non-trauma mortality levels will pass the Famine (IPC Phase 5) threshold between January and March 2025, with at least 2-15 people dying per day.' The report was based on an analysis of aid transfers to the northern Gaza Strip since November, compared with estimates of the number of Gazans currently residing in the area. The FEWS NET analysis relied on a mid-November estimate of a northern Gaza population of between 65,000 to 75,000 people for its calculations. The Famine Early Warning Systems Network is a U.S. government program operated by U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). On Tuesday, however, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew issued a statement rebutting and condemning the FEWS NET report, noting that it had relied on 'outdated and inaccurate' figures. 'The report issued today on Gaza by FEWS NET relies on data that is outdated and inaccurate,' Lew said. 'We have worked closely with the Government of Israel and the UN to provide greater access to the North Governorate, and it is now apparent that the civilian population in that part of Gaza is in the range of 7,000-15,000, not 65,000-75,000 which is the basis of this report.' The Israeli Defense Ministry, Lew noted, 'estimates the population in this area is between 5,000 and 9,000.' 'UNRWA estimates the population is between 10,000 and 15,000.' 'At a time when inaccurate information is causing confusion and accusations, it is irresponsible to issue a report like this. We work day and night with the UN and our Israeli partners to meet humanitarian needs — which are great — and relying on inaccurate data is irresponsible.'

What Israel has just accomplished in Syria	By Hugh Fitzgerald, Frontpage Magazine While launching nearly 500 airstrikes on Syrian military assets, including missile warehouses, three military airbases housing fighter aircraft and helicopters, storehouses of chemical weapons and chemical weapons production plants, air-defense systems, weapons stockpiles, and the entire Syrian navy, the IDF has also taken over the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, and the summit of Mount Hermon, which gives the Israelis an uninterrupted sightline to the capital Damascus. More on what Israel has done to make sure, in just three days, to ensure that jihadists in Syria cannot threaten the Jewish state, can be found here. Unsurprisingly, Israel was quick to destroy both Assad’s chemical weapons plants and his stores of chemical weapons, relieving the world of the worry that they might be used not only against Israel and against the Syrian people, but also against Western countries, should they fall into the hands of ISIS. Even before the Biden administration announced that it would work with 'partners in the area' to destroy 'chemical weapons,' the IDF was already completing that task. That was their first target, on Sunday, Dec. 8. A day later, the IDF destroyed the Assad regime’s storage sites housing long-range missiles, both surface-to-surface and air-to-surface, and its weapons research facilities, and hit Syria’s three main military airbases, destroying many dozens of fighter jets and helicopters. It also hit weapons production and research facilities. In sum, these were the results of IAF attacks from Saturday to early Monday: the destruction of all chemical weapons stores and production plants, weapons research offices, missile storehouses and manufacturing plants. By Tuesday, the IAF had hit a total of 310 targets, which included the military airbases at Homs, Qamishli and Damascus, as well as weapons depots and other strategic military sites. On Tuesday morning, the IAF destroyed Syria’s navy at Latakia. Now Syria is essentially without either an air force or a navy; both have been blown to smithereens. The IDF estimates that, as of early on Tuesday, some 70%-80% of the capabilities of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s military have been destroyed. The Israelis, of course, have made themselves, and everyone else threatened by Islamic jihadists, safer by destroying these weapons that could, at some future time, fall into the hands of ISIS and similar groups. The Israelis cannot bet their security on the possibility that Mohamed al-Jolani is in truth a moderate as he now claims to be, or other members of the Hayat Tahrir al-Shams jihad group are similarly moderate. And even if al-Jolani has had a change of heart on the road to Damascus, and is no longer the jihadist he has been all his adult life — which is most doubtful — what will happen in the future? Who in the end will hold power? Israel cannot assume that ISIS, which has a continuing presence in eastern Syria, would not succeed in seizing some of the weapons left behind by Assad’s disintegrating forces and use them against Israel. n the chaos and confusion, the IDF acted sensibly to remove as much of the potential threat from Syria as it possibly could. Israel cannot take chances with the jihadist threat from Syria, a country that has been at war with Israel ever since 1948. The IDF had to take advantage of this unparalleled and unrepeatable opportunity, with the Syrian military disbanded, and weapons lying unattended all over the country, to destroy as many of Syria’s military assets as it could. And so it has done, surpassing all expectations, by destroying 70-80% of those assets. One commentator summed up the three days of airstrikes thus: those 72 hours 'stood out even for people who thought they had already seen everything.' And the result was that the Israeli Air Force, according to defense journalist Yoav Limor, 'didn’t strip the Syrian military of specific capabilities only – it sent it back to the starting line, bereft of any significant strategic capabilities.' As a result, Israel, and the world, are much safer.

Iran: Ballistic missile attack was ‘self-defense’ after Haniyeh k...	Iran calls Israel's killing of Hamas head Ismail Haniyeh a 'heinous crime,' says it justifies October missile barrage. By World Israel News Staff The Iranian ambassador to the United Nations said that Tehran's October ballistic missile barrage targeting Israel was an act of 'legitimate self-defense,' following the assassination of Hamas politburo head Ismail Haniyeh. On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Israel Katz revealed that Israel was behind the July slaying of Haniyeh at a Tehran guesthouse, which marked the first time that Jerusalem formally accepted responsibility for the killing. Katz said that Israel would eliminate the senior leadership of the Houthis, just as it had killed Hezbollah head Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar and Haniyeh. Shortly after Katz's statement, the Iranian mission to the UN released a lengthy statement on X, referring to the assassination as a 'heinous crime.' In a shameless admission, the regime’s Minister of Warmongering confessed to the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader and former Prime Minister of Palestine, during his visit to Tehran. This brazen act underscores Israel’s role in terrorism, legitimizes Iran’s… pic.twitter.com/hBgPpYoMi7 &mdash; I.R.IRAN Mission to UN, NY (@Iran_UN) December 24, 2024 The letter, addressing UN Secretary-General António Guterres and Security Council President Linda Thomas-Greenfield, demanded that the international organization condemn Israel for the slaying of Haniyeh. Accepting responsibility for Haniyeh's slaying underscores 'Israel’s role in terrorism, legitimizes Iran’s response on 1 October 2024, and reaffirms the Zionist regime as a serious threat to global peace, which must be stopped,' the Iranian mission wrote. Israel is now 'desperately attempting to justify and legitimize its&#8230;acts of aggression against Yemen's sovereignty and territorial integrity,' the statement claimed. Notably, there was no mention of the Yemen-based Houthi's repeated ballistic missile attacks on Israel, nor the fact that the Houthis are funded and directed by Iran. Iran's launch of hundreds of ballistic missiles towards Israel, which sent virtually all of the Jewish State's nine million residents into bomb shelters, was a 'legitimate and legal, defensive response' to the assassination, they charged. No Israelis were hurt in the attack, though several air bases sustained serious damage. A Gazan man living in the Palestinian Authority-controlled city of Jericho was killed by a large piece of shrapnel, which fell directly on top of him as he walked on the street.

Houthi missile damages home, 9 injured running to shelters	If we hadn't entered the bomb shelter, it could have ended in disaster,' says woman whose family home was damaged by a ballistic missile fragment. By World Israel News Staff Shrapnel from a Houthi-launched ballistic missile shot down by the Israeli Air Force early Wednesday morning damaged a house in central Israel, with the overnight attack sending millions of Israelis into bomb shelters. Sirens wailed across multiple regions of Israel, including the Tel Aviv metropolitan area, the Jerusalem suburb of Beit Shemesh, and at Ben-Gurion Airport. Activity at the airport was suspended for approximately thirty minutes following the sirens, but has since returned to normal operations. Magen David Adom paramedics treated nine people who were injured while running to bomb shelters, following the sirens sounding at 4:20 a.m. Initially, the military claimed that the missile had been intercepted outside of Israeli airspace, but pieces of debris from the interception and the missile itself were reportedly found in at least three different areas within the Jewish state. Large pieces of shrapnel landed in the front yard of the Steinberg-Golan family, who live in Be'er Yaakov, a suburb of Israel's fourth largest city, Rishon LeZion. Speaking to Hebrew-language outlet Walla, Shira Steinberg-Golan said that she was shocked to discover 'a missile fragment as tall as me' in her backyard. An external air conditioning unit had been blown off the side of the house, with half of the tiling on the patio smashed from the impact. 'If we hadn't entered the bomb shelter, it could have ended in disaster,' she said. Meital Merhav, an American cousin visiting the family, told Walla that she had only arrived in Israel from New York five days ago. In that time, she has already heard three air raid sirens. 'It's a shock, the whole thing with sirens is new to me. Luckily I slept in the bomb shelter,' Merhav said. 'The family is okay, we couldn't believe it struck here in the yard. No one could imagine that anything like this could happen,' she added. 'We went outside, opened the door and saw that the missile fragment was here. Luckily it only ended with property damage. It's a traumatic experience, but [we're] glad everyone is okay.'

Investigation reveals IDF did not know 6 executed hostages were i...	One assessment concluded that the likelihood hostages were in the area was 'medium to low.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An internal IDF investigation into the recovery of the bodies of six executed hostages in August confirmed that the army was unaware of the proximity of the captives prior to their discovery. The bodies of Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi, and MSG Ori Danino were recovered by the army on August 31, 2024. The findings of the investigation were communicated by Chief of the General Staff, LTG Herzi Halevi, on Tuesday to the families of the hostages. According to the investigation's findings, the troops of the 162nd Division launched an operation to defeat Hamas's al-Tel Sultan Battalion following three months of fighting in Rafah. While they were fighting, they discovered additional tunnels. A dedicated command center was established, led by Shayetet 13 and the 162nd Division, to monitor the underground areas and to potentially locate hostages. The assessment concluded that the likelihood hostages were in the area was 'medium to low,' and yet they were instructed to operate with precaution. On August 27, hostage Qaid Farhan Alkadi was rescued without prior information or any indication that he was there. The IDF halted operations for 24 hours to assess the likelihood of additional hostages in the area and did not find any positive indication that there were. On August 31, 2024, the IDF found the bodies of the six executed hostages in an underground tunnel. According to a pathological report, the hostages were estimated to have died on August 29. It was only on the 30th that the IDF had discovered the shaft of the tunnel where the hostage's bodies were found after they had already been killed. The investigation also found that although the ground forces acted with the utmost care and caution, their operations could have been a motivating factor to the terrorists deciding to execute the hostages. 'The IDF shares the grief of the families over their grievous loss and will continue to accompany them. The IDF is continuing to operate with all means to fulfill the supreme national mission of bringing home all the hostages,' the military stated.

IDF raids terrorist-embedded hospital in northern Gaza	According to the military and Israel's security agency (Shin Bet), at least one of the eliminated terrorists had taken part in the October 7 massacre. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The IDF eliminated five and arrested dozens more terrorists at the Indonesian hospital in northern Gaza on Tuesday. According to the military and Israel's security force (Shin Bet), at least one of the eliminated terrorists had taken part in the October 7 massacre. The mission was carried out by the Givati ​​Brigade, under the command of Division 162, based on military intelligence. This is the first time since last December the IDF has eliminated terrorists at an Indonesian hospital. For the past month, terrorists had been attacking IDF troops from the facility using anti-tank missiles and had also planted booby traps surrounding the hospital. To prevent civilian casualties, the IDF warned and oversaw the evacuation of staff and patients from the hospital. The evacuation was coordinated by the IDF's Gaza District Coordination and Liaison Administration in coordination with local health officials through clearly defined evacuation routes using emergency vehicles to facilitate the removal of civilians from harm's way. The IDF said in a statement, 'The operation was carried out after several warnings were given to the Gaza Health Ministry about terrorist activities taking place within the hospital. The troops took steps to minimize harm to uninvolved civilians and made efforts to allow the hospital's operations to continue as much as possible.' The IDF said Hamas's continued use of hospitals to shield terrorists is 'a further example of how the Hamas terrorist organization systematically violates international law by exploiting civilian infrastructure and the Gazan population as human shields for its terrorist activities.' IDF Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said continued military operations will pressure Hamas to return the 100 hostages remaining in Gaza and create the optimal security situation to allow residents of border communities to return home. He made the situational assessment alongside senior commanders, including Southern Command chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman and Gaza Division Commander Brig. Gen. Barak Hiram. 'We are dismantling Hamas and targeting its infrastructure and forces to ensure that there will never be another October 7,' Halevi said. 'We are applying daily pressure on Hamas, driving it into greater distress, to secure the return of the 100 hostages—hopefully alive—and for those who are not, to give them a proper burial in Israel.' The IDF activities were also designed to ensure the safe return of Gaza border community residents. 'As residents return, our responsibility grows even greater—not smaller. It is our duty to establish a far stronger security framework, ensuring they can feel safe and secure here,' Halevy said.

Israelis flock to settle in Golan Heights community named after T...	Although the community now only has 50 to 100 residents, there is currently a waiting list of over 2,000. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israelis are signing up by the thousands to settle in a Golan Heights community named for former and President-elect Donald Trump, The New York Post reports. Although the community now only has 50 to 100 residents, there is currently a waiting list of over 2,000. 'Trump Heights is one of the biggest tourist sites in the region,' said Yaakov Selavan, deputy head of the regional council, to The Post. In June 2019, the Israeli cabinet under the Netanyahu government voted on a resolution to 'initiate the establishment of a new residential community on the Golan Heights to be named after U.S President Donald Trump.' The move was in recognition of the president's efforts on behalf of Israel, including recognizing Jerusalem as the country's capital as well as Israeli sovereignty on the Golan Heights. Five years later, the victory of Donald Trump in the 2024 election renewed interest in the community. Yarden Friman, Trump Heights' de facto mayor, said, 'Trump's recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights is something very dear to me and to all of us,' He added, 'And I'm optimistic about the future; we haven't had a single [air raid] alarm since the ceasefire with Hezbollah.' However, it isn't just the US President's popularity that has sparked interest among would-be residents; the drive to settle the Golan Heights has become a national security imperative for Israel, particularly after the fall of the Assad regime in Syria. Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated a goal of doubling the number of residents in the Golan Heights from the current 50,000. 'Strengthening the Golan Heights is strengthening the State of Israel, and it is especially important at this time,' Netanyahu said in a statement last week. 'We will continue to hold on to it, make it flourish, and settle it.' Yedidya Ostroff, 31, came to Trump Heights after evacuating from a community closer to the Lebanon border. Since then, Ostroff has been fixing up homes and constructing new houses in Trump Heights. Ostroff said, 'This is a really special community, really good people, and it's also a good mix of religious and non-religious people.'

The bases will include hypothermal rooms for independent medical treatment, kitchens, cooking gas, generators, dry, frozen, and dry foods, as well as special skiing equipment. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces is preparing for a prolonged stay on the Syrian Golan Heights, at least until the end of winter, Hebrew media reported on Monday. The IDF is working around the clock to finish a sophisticated logistics operation before the possible arrival of extreme weather conditions, including snow storms, according to Ynet. The Israeli military’s Technological and Logistics Directorate has reportedly opened new routes to the Syrian peak of Mount Hermon, and has been transporting tons of construction materials and equipment to the military outposts located at the top to further establish Israel’s control over the commanding terrain. The IDF is working in two main bases on the Syrian side, according to the report. The first, at an elevation of 7,874 feet, is planned to accommodate troops even if the snow piles 20 feet high. At the very top of Mount Hermon, which stands at 9,186 feet, the second base is undergoing a 'facelift' that involves cleaning, whitewashing, repairing, installing military communication and intelligence gathering equipment, and adding furniture, containers to store food and a water tank with a 20,000-liter capacity. In addition, the bases will include hypothermal rooms for independent medical treatment, kitchens and cooking gas, generators, dry, frozen and dry foods, as well as special provisions of ski masks, tactical boots, three sets of thermal uniforms, one-piece snowsuits, special gloves and more. Since the fall of Syria’s Assad regime on Oct. 8, Israeli troops have taken up positions inside and beyond the Syrian buffer zone, including the strategic Syrian side of Mount Hermon. The Israeli Air Force has also conducted hundreds of strikes on Assad military assets. On Sunday, Hebrew media reported that Jerusalem has warned Syria’s de facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa that it will not tolerate jihadist groups establishing a foothold in southern Syria. In the message, Israel stressed that it is prepared to keep troops positioned in the demilitarized Golan Heights buffer zone as long as is necessary to maintain border security, according to Ynet. However, Jerusalem indicated that it might consider transferring control of the buffer zone to a stable and accountable Syrian government should such an authority emerge. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Israel Katz and other senior security officials reviewed Israeli troop deployments on the Syrian border on Dec. 17. 'We are holding this assessment in order to decide on the deployment of the IDF in this important place until another arrangement is found that ensures Israel’s security,' the prime minister stated.

Israeli president renews call for independent Oct. 7 commission o...	Such commissions have broader authority to summon witnesses and collect evidence and are headed by a senior Supreme Court justice. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Tuesday renewed calls for a state commission of inquiry into the events surrounding Hamas’s October 7 attacks. Herzog’s remarks came after families of fallen soldiers complained that audio recordings of troops released on Monday by the Israel Defense Forces were incomplete. 'The cries of the families of the surveillance soldiers and many other bereaved families who have turned to me breaks my heart and sharpens the need to convene a state commission of inquiry according to the law,' Herzog said. 'Trust must return to the state and the defense system, including by probing and deeply studying the failures and the terrible catastrophe of October 7 in a reliable and independent manner.' There have been growing calls for the government to appoint an independent commission of inquiry to investigate political and military failures. Such commissions have broader authority to summon witnesses and collect evidence, and are headed by a senior Supreme Court justice. They may include personal recommendations about individuals under investigation, though the government is not bound to act on the recommendations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the governing coalition say an independent commission should only be appointed after the war. On Monday, opposition leader Yair Lapid vowed not to cooperate with any 'political commission of inquiry' after Likud MK Ariel Kallner suggested legislation to establish a probe made up of members appointed by both the government and opposition. 'They are afraid of the truth. They do not want the Israeli public to know the truth,' Lapid said. 'The only committee that can be established, the only committee that can be trusted, is a state commission of inquiry.' The last state commission of inquiry, which investigated Israel’s worst civilian disaster held Netanyahu personally responsible for the tragedy in a report released in April. Forty-five people were killed and 150 people were injured in a stampede at a holy site on Mount Meron in the Upper Galilee during the Jewish holiday of Lag B’Omer in 2021. The tragedy was triggered by a combination of overcrowded conditions and a faulty walkway in a narrow passage. On Thursday, Defense Minister Israel Katz ordered Chief of Staff Hertzi Halevi to complete the army’s internal investigation into October 7 by the end of January. Katz said he will not sign off on promotions of officers to the ranks of major general or give generals new roles until he reviews the army’s findings and 'learns and understands their meaning and possible effect on the candidates for promotion.' In a letter to senior commanders, Halevi disagreed with Katz, saying, 'The appointments of officers is not a privilege. It is a necessity and a duty.' At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Study reveals $10B theft from Syria’s vanished Jewish community	From a population of approximately 50,000 Jews at the century’s start, numbers fell to roughly 30,000 by Israel’s establishment. Within a decade, only 5,000 remained. By JNS The value of property confiscated from Syria’s Jewish community exceeds $10 billion in contemporary terms, according to a landmark study published on Monday in the United States and Israel. The research also documents that the once-thriving community has dwindled to just four known Jewish residents in Syria today. The comprehensive findings come from Justice for Jews from Arab Countries (JJAC), a Jewish-American organization, following an exhaustive six-year investigation. The study is part of a broader research initiative, with findings on 10 additional Arab countries scheduled for release in the coming months. According to the JJAC, Jewish communities had established deep roots across North Africa and the Middle East over thousands of years, with their presence predating Islam by a millennium. The organization notes that the mass exodus of these Jewish populations from 11 countries in the 20th century stands as one of the largest forced displacements of modern times. The study documents Syrian Jewry as one of the region’s most ancient communities, with a verified presence in Aleppo and Damascus extending back 2,500 years. The community developed extensive international commercial networks, establishing trading and banking relationships reaching as far as India. The post-World War II era marked the beginning of intensified persecution of Syria’s Jewish communities. They endured widespread property confiscation, severe restrictions on movement, systematic economic marginalization, violent attacks and sustained government harassment. These pressures precipitated a dramatic demographic decline. From a population of approximately 50,000 Jews at the century’s start, numbers fell to roughly 30,000 by Israel’s establishment. Within a decade, only 5,000 remained. By 1991, the community had virtually disappeared, with reports indicating only one hundred Jews still in Syria. The overwhelming majority sought refuge in Israel. The research methodology incorporated comprehensive evidence of Jewish economic status, combining written documentation, interviews with community leaders and experts and analysis of previous evaluations. A thorough assessment of all economic sectors revealed that Syrian Jewish assets valued at $200,167,458 in 1947 would equate to $10,692,545,656 in current dollars. JJAC emphasized that achieving genuine peace in the Middle East depends on confronting historical facts and ensuring justice prevails. They stress that any meaningful reconciliation in the region must incorporate the complete historical narrative, particularly the experiences of Jewish communities from Arab nations and Iran.

Israeli defense chief threatens to assassinate Houthi leaders	Whoever supports Houthi terrorism in Hudaydah or Sana'a will pay the full price,' warns Defense Minister Israel Katz, after latest Houthi missile attack on Israel. By World Israel News Staff Israel's Defense Minister signaled Tuesday that Israel is preparing for a major retaliation against pro-Iranian forces in Yemen, after a string of missile attacks on Israel. Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) visited a Hetz (Arrow) missile defense battery Tuesday morning, accompanied by air defense commander Brig. Gen. Gilad Biran. The visit came hours after the missile battery successfully shot down a missile fired by Yemenite Houthis towards central Israel overnight. 'I came here today to congratulate you on the very successful interception you carried out against the upgraded missile fired yesterday by the Houthi terrorist organization from Yemen,' Katz said. 'The State of Israel has the best air defense capability in the world, and we know we can rely on you. Millions count on you, waking up to the sound of alarms but knowing there is someone to handle the threat.' Katz said that Israel 'will not tolerate' continued attacks from pro-Iranian forces in Yemen, and intimated that the IDF is preparing to assassinate Houthi leaders. We will not tolerate the fact that the Houthis continue to fire at the State of Israel. I warned and said that just as we dealt with Sinwar in Gaza, Haniyeh in Tehran, and Nasrallah in Beirut, we will also deal with the Houthi leaders in Sana'a and everywhere in Yemen.' 'We will act both against their infrastructures and against them to remove the threat and eliminate the dangers to the State of Israel in order to achieve our goals. Whoever supports Houthi terrorism in Hudaydah or Sana'a will pay the full price.' 'We do not rely on anyone other than the IDF to protect the communities and residents. We will not allow threats to emerge and will act proactively against any threat. The threat today in the skies is the first missile war – you will continue to defend the state's skies, and we will act with great force offensively to eliminate the threats to the State of Israel.'

‘Should scare every American’: Top Trump adviser Mike Waltz expla...	Waltz also praised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for 'exposing Iran’s air defenses so that they literally are naked right now and on their back foot.' By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner US Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL), who was recently tapped to serve as the White House national security adviser for the incoming Trump administration, outlined in a new interview why Iran’s nuclear program could pose a major threat to the United States and must be stopped. During an interview with Daily Wire co-founder and conservative podcast host Ben Shapiro, Waltz said that his constituents often do not understand how Iran’s nuclear ambitions impact American interests. The lawmaker explained that Iran obtaining nuclear weapons could kick-start an arms race and geopolitical firestorm in the Middle East, potentially forcing the US to become more involved in the region militarily. 'No. 1, if Iran gets a nuke, the Saudis are going to want a nuke, the Turks are going to want a nuke, and the Middle East exploding, not literally but figuratively, in a nuclear arms race should scare every American,' Waltz said. Though Waltz conceded that nuclear proliferation in the Middle East would not necessarily result in 'World War III,' he asserted that it would be 'catastrophic for the world.' The lawmaker added that a nuclear-armed Iran would endanger Israel, which he described as America’s 'critical ally, morally and historically and geopolitically,' and that the US should take threats by Iranian leadership to eliminate Israel seriously. 'We should believe [Iran’s so-called ‘supreme leader,’ Ayatollah Ali Khamenei] who intends to wipe Israel off the face of the earth if they have nukes,' Waltz said. Waltz also praised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for 'exposing Iran’s air defenses so that they literally are naked right now and on their back foot.' He appeared to be referring to Israel’s precision airstrikes on Iranian military and air defense sites in October which devastated the regime’s air-defense system and ballistic missile program. The strikes were in response to Iran’s ballistic missile barrage against Israel weeks earlier. Waltz went on to say that the incoming Trump administration plans on 'hitting' Iran’s finances throughout the Middle East and stopping the flow of money 'out of Tehran into Beirut and into [Iran’s] proxies in Syria.' Iran has supported several terrorist proxies throughout the Middle East, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — both of which have been devastated by Israeli military operations in recent months. The Iranian regime also backed the recently ousted Assad regime in Syria, where Israel launched limited operations to ensure security at its northeastern amid uncertainty about Syria’s future. 'I hope that all of this has Hamas so isolated. They really thought the cavalry was coming from the north with Hezbollah. Now, that has been shown not to be true; Hamas has every exit blocked except one, and that is to release our hostages if you want to live,' Waltz said. Harsh US sanctions levied on Iran under the Trump administration from 2017-2021 crippled the Iranian economy and led its foreign exchange reserves to plummet. US President-elect Donald Trump and his Republican supporters in the US Congress have criticized the Biden administration for renewing billions of dollars in US sanctions waivers, which had the effect of unlocking frozen funds and allowing the country to access previously inaccessible hard currency. US intelligence agencies have for years labeled Iran as the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism, noting it devotes significant sums of money and weapons each year to supporting proxies across the Middle East such as Hamas and Hezbollah.

Israel to lobby EU, UK to designate Houthis as terrorists	The Houthis pose a threat not only to Israel but to the region and the entire world,' Sa’ar said in a statement. By Joshua Marks, JNS Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar has instructed Israeli diplomats to advocate for Yemen’s Houthi rebels to be designated as a terrorist organization in the European Union and United Kingdom. The move comes against the backdrop of an escalation in missile and drone attacks by the Iranian proxy, officially known as Ansar Allah, with Tel Aviv and the center of the country being targeted multiple times in recent days. On Monday, Israeli air defenses intercepted a Houthi ballistic missile before it entered Israeli airspace. The attack triggered sirens in central Israel, and a 60-year-woman was critically injured running to a bomb shelter. MDA paramedics treated 25 people who were lightly hurt running to shelters or who suffered anxiety attacks. Also on Monday, the Israel Defense Forces shot down a Houthi drone before it crossed into Israeli territory. Overnight Friday, 16 people were lightly hurt when a Houthi missile slammed into a playground in Jaffa following a failed interception. Before dawn on Thursday, the warhead of a partially intercepted missile collapsed the main building of an elementary school in Ramat Gan. Yemen’s Houthi rebels have launched over 200 missiles and 170 drones at Israel in support of Hamas since the terrorist invasion of southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The vast majority were intercepted outside of Israeli territory by Israel or the United States. The rebels have also disrupted commercial shipping in the Red Sea, attacking merchant and naval ships. 'The Houthis pose a threat not only to Israel but to the region and the entire world,' Sa’ar said in a statement. 'The direct threat to freedom of navigation in one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes is a challenge to the international community and the world order. The first and most basic thing is to define them as a terrorist organization,' the statement continued. In January, the Biden administration redesignated the Houthis as a terrorist group, having delisted the Iranian proxy shortly after Joe Biden took office, reversing a decision made by the Trump administration at the end of Trump’s first term. In addition to the United States, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Israel classify the Houthis as a terrorist group. Speaking before the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Monday, Sa’ar addressed Israel’s evolving relationship with the European Union. 'Following the conclusion of Josep Borrell’s term as the E.U.’s High Representative, there was a push to cancel the E.U.-Israel Association Agreement,' he said. 'Now, under the new high representative, Kaja Kallas, we have scheduled an Association Council meeting in Brussels in two months, which I will lead,' he said, adding, 'This signals the beginning of a constructive dialogue with the E.U.' The E.U. Foreign Affairs Council had decided to resume its Association Council meetings with Israel, Kallas said after meeting European foreign ministers on Dec. 16. The E.U.-Israel Association Council, which last convened in 2022 during the premiership of Yair Lapid after a 10-year pause, is a meeting meant to be held annually between Jerusalem and the foreign ministers of all 27 member states of the European Union to discuss matters of mutual concern.

Israel’s volunteers transform grief into national strength	Those with university degrees and above-average incomes showed the highest participation rates, around 50%. By Jewish Breaking News Israel is a special country where under the surface everyone cares for each other. This became powerfully evident in the wake of October 7, when citizens from every walk of life transformed their grief into action. While inevitably tapering over time to about 15% of the population today from 29% when war first broke out, the support from volunteers has evolved into something more sustainable. Tech workers put aside their laptops to pack emergency supplies while university professors deliver food packages to border communities. The most dedicated volunteers show up daily while others commit several days from their busy workweek to help those in need. What drives them? When surveyed by the Israeli Volunteering Council, the answer was strikingly simple. Over 90% stated that their strongest motivations were the desire to help others and concern for the well-being of fellow citizens. Rich, poor, Ashkenazi or Sefardi, it doesn’t matter. They all show up like one nation and one heart to help with supplies for displaced families, drive relatives to visit wounded soldiers, support reservists’ children, or defend Israel’s narrative on social media and in the press. 'Unlike what is typically seen in emergency situations worldwide, and even in Israel, these initiatives continued beyond the initial emergency phase, with many of them sustaining their activities throughout the year of the war,' says CEO of the Israeli Volunteering Council Ronit Bar. Those with university degrees and above-average incomes showed the highest participation rates, around 50%. Yet perhaps more telling was the surge among secular Israelis, who made up nearly 30% of first-time volunteers It’s visible even in the small gestures like the cafe owner who feeds soldiers for free, the teacher who tutors evacuated children after hours, and the neighbor who simply shows up to offer support. In times of peace, these bonds might lie dormant. But when tested, they prove unshakeable.

Hamas issues special Hanukkah message to Jerusalem Muslims	Defending the Al-Aqsa Mosque from 'Judaization' is a 'religious and national requirement,' the terror group said. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Invoking the claim that Israel wants to 'Judaize' the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount, a Hamas official has called on Jerusalem Arabs to commit violence in order to 'defend' their holy site on the eve of Hanukkah, Israel National News reported Tuesday. Saying that 'the occupation government and settler groups continue to harm' Muslim holy sites, and 'especially' Al-Aqsa, Hamas’ Jerusalem office head Haroun Nasser al-Din charged that they had 'abominable plans' to turn the mosque 'into a Jewish synagogue.' In his announcement, made through the Palestinian news agency Quds Fars, al-Din said that 'particularly the [Arab] residents of Jerusalem &#8230; will never allow the occupation to rob their mosque.' They are 'the tip of this spear and they are willing to sacrifice themselves' as they did in previous 'uprisings,' he added, referring specifically to violent Palestinian riots in the capital in 1996, 2017 and 2021. 'The fight and the enlistment for al-Aqsa are religious, national, and moral requirements at this dangerous point for the Palestinian issue and the conspiracies that the occupation has begun to put in action,' he stressed. Al-Din was defined as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the U.S. Department of the Treasury last December due to his activities in funding Hamas’ activities. Both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority regularly attempt to inflame the Arab population by saying that 'Al-Aqsa is in danger,' especially before Jewish holidays, when traffic to the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism, increases. These peaceful visits are often met with rioting by incited Arab youth, which is then turned into a narrative of 'settlers storming the mosque' when the police must intervene to protect the visitors. In September, before the Jewish High Holiday period, a senior member of Hamas threatened that 'The continuation of the Zionist aggression and their brutality against Jerusalem and the holy shrines will be the cause of a major battle.' Mahmoud al-Zahar’s warning came in response to Jewish groups calling for ever more Jews to visit the site where both Jewish Temples stood during the times of the ancient kingdoms of Israel and Judea. In February, ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Hamas’ since-assassinated leader Ismail Haniyeh called on Palestinian Arabs to 'barricade themselves' inside the Al-Aqsa Mosque in order to break an alleged Israeli 'siege' on the Temple Mount.

Palestinian Authority joins Israel in banning Al Jazeera	The Palestinian Authority's ruling Fatah party has banned Qatar-based media outlet from Judea and Samaria, accusing it of incitement - months after Israel did the same. By World Israel News Staff The Palestinian Authority has banned the Al Jazeera network from operating inside of the autonomous zones of Judea and Samaria, according to a report by the Israeli media outlet Walla. The report claimed that the ruling Palestinian faction Fatah imposed the ban in parts of Area A and Area B - the two portions of Judea and Samaria under Palestinian Authority civil control - over the Qatari outlet's coverage of the ongoing internecine violence between the Palestinian National Security Forces - the PA's paramilitary police force - and an alliance of terrorist factions operating in the northern Samaria city of Jenin. The report claimed that Fatah has accused Al Jazeera of 'spreading conflicts and incitement' vis-a-vis PA efforts to clamp down on popular unrest, including the clashes in Jenin. For months, the PNSF has attempted to rein in popular unrest across Judea and Samaria. Earlier this month, PNSF forces entered Jenin to challenge the Jenin Brigades, an alliance of terrorist groups including Hamas which has effectively ruled the city since 2022. Since December 5th, PA forces have clashed with the Jenin Brigades, while attepmting to reassert control over the city. Citing Palestinian media reports, Walla reported that the decision is aimed primarily at Al Jazeera's operations in Samaria, including the towns and cities of Shechem (Nablus), Jenin, Tubas, Tulkarem, Qalqilya, and Salfit. The Palestinian Authority has reportedly accused the Qatari outlet of biased reporting in favor of Hamas - echoing claims made by Israel during its war against the Gaza-based terror group. 'We have decided to ban the entry of Al Jazeera, and we urge the public to avoid engaging with this channel in any way,' the report cited the Fatah party as saying. 'Al Jazeera plays a dangerous role in Palestine. It spreads hatred and incites civil war. Al Jazeera sides with lawbreakers and tries to portray them as heroes fighting the occupation.' Israel's government voted this spring to bar Al Jazeera from operating in the country, accusing it of actively promoting terror groups including Hamas. In May, the ban went into effect, leading to the shuttering of the network's operations in Israel.

Israel Police sappers make Chanukah menorah from Hezbollah rocket...	The veteran sappers made the menorah from pieces of rockets that they had gathered over the year-long war, including from the attack on the Druze village of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights that killed 12 children. By Etgar Lefkovits, JNS Israeli police sappers have constructed a unique Chanukah menorah from pieces of rockets fired into Israel by Hezbollah over the last year. The menorah will be lit across northern Israel throughout the holiday week, including by bereaved family members in the cities and towns where fatal attacks occurred. The symbolic project, dubbed 'Lighting up the North,' was carried out by two police sappers who defused thousands of rockets, missiles and drones directed at Israel by the Lebanese terror organization. Hezbollah began the attacks one day after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas massacre, and continued firing on Israeli towns and cities until last month’s ceasefire took effect. Hezbollah launched more than 15,000 projectile attacks on Israel during the war. 'We are marking the holiday of light without forgetting the darkness that preceded it,' Police sapper Yossi Hod told JNS on Monday. A Chanukah menora created by two Israel Police sappers out of fragments of rockets launched into Israel by Hezbollah. Credit: Courtesy. Hod, together with a colleague, constructed the unique Chanukah menorah in just two days earlier this month. Chanukah begins on Wednesday night. Planned even before the Nov. 27 ceasefire took effect, the veteran sappers made the menorah from pieces of rockets that they had gathered over the year-long war, including from the attack on the Druze village of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights that killed 12 children, the attack on the northern Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona that killed a couple and their three dogs, and the one on the northern Israeli town of Shfaram that killed a teacher. The sappers decided not to varnish any of the original pieces used in the construction of the special nine-branched candelabrum, leaving it looking tarred and blackened in parts. Israel Police sapper Yossi Hod at work on a Chanukah menorah built out of the remains of rockets launched into Israel by Lebanon’s Hezbollah terrorist group. Credit: Courtesy. 'We decided not to touch up the items at all and so the result doesn’t seem symmetrical, but it is very authentic,' said Hod. The 48-year-old sapper, who spent the last quarter century on the force, said that this is the first time he has ever taken part in such a project. 'I looked at this project not just as a police sapper, but as a believing Jew who feels that this holiday could not have come at a better time for the nation of Israel,' he said, 'and it shows our strength and power as a nation for good.' 'Nothing embodies our nation’s resilience more powerfully than our ability to turn darkness into light even in the midst of a war declared upon us,' said Israel Police spokesman Dean Elsdunne. 'At this moment, we are literally transforming something evil into holiness.' document.createElement('video'); The post Israel Police sappers make Chanukah menorah from Hezbollah rockets appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/israel-police-sappers-make-chanukah-menorah-from-hezbollah-rockets/	2024-12-24T03:08:42-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/6b9fba57-51f0-4ba6-922c-c316914c940f-1320x880-1.jpg
Released hostage Hannah Katzir dies	Gazan terrorists had claimed the Nir Oz resident had been killed in an Israeli airstrike - before freeing her in the only hostage deal to date. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Hannah Katzir, a resident of Kibbutz Nir Oz who had been kidnapped by Gazan terrorists during their October 7 invasion and then released in a hostage deal last November, died Tuesday at age 76. 'With great sorrow, we announce the passing of Kibbutz member Hannah Katzir, of blessed memory, following a prolonged struggle with complex medical issues after her release from captivity,' the statement from the kibbutz said. She will be buried Tuesday afternoon in the community’s cemetery. Katzir had been brutally taken from her home and held captive in Gaza by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) terrorists working in tandem with Hamas, the ruling terror group in the Strip. Her husband, Rami, was murdered during the attack on their kibbutz. Her son Elad was taken captive as well and subsequently murdered in Gaza. IDF forces conducted a rescue operation in April in Khan Yunis in order to return his body for burial in Israel. She was freed seven weeks later along with 12 other women and children in the first batch of hostages released by Hamas in exchange for a temporary ceasefire, female and underage Palestinian security prisoners, and increased humanitarian aid. Several days before her release, the PIJ had cruelly announced that she had died, saying on Telegram that they had been 'willing' to free her for humanitarian reasons but 'the enemy’s procrastination led to the loss of her life.' A month after she was abducted along with 250 others, PIJ had released a propaganda video of Katzir and 12-year-old Yagil Yaakov, another Nir Oz resident, who was released in a subsequent batch of hostages. They appeared to read from prepared scripts in criticizing the Israeli government’s military operations in Gaza and praising the treatment they were receiving. 'I am in a place that is not mine. I miss home, my children, my husband Rami, and my whole, dear, beloved family,' Katzir also said in the clip, not knowing until she came back that Rami was dead and Elad kidnapped as well. Katzir had spoken out after her release about how she had been thrown onto a motorcycle and fallen off during her abduction, how the terrorists threw stones at her, and how she spent the first several days of her captivity alone, until joining other hostages, with little food to eat and held in subhuman conditions. Her daughter, Carmit, said a few days after her mother’s arrival that she was 'not in a good physical state because she didn’t receive the medication she needed. She lost 20 kilos and obviously overcame a major trauma.' Within two weeks, she was hospitalized in critical condition. Carmit subsequently wrote that her mother had come back from Gaza 'both heartbroken and with serious cardiological issues, including broken heart syndrome.' Described by her family and friends as a woman with 'a big heart,' who worked for many years as a devoted caretaker in the kibbutz, her heart finally gave out, Carmit said upon her mother’s death. 'Mom was a devoted wife, a loving mother, and a woman who embodied pure love. Her heart couldn’t withstand the unbearable pain since October 7,' she said. Katzir leaves behind two living children and six grandchildren.

In Christmas message, Netanyahu hails Christian support for Israe...	You've stood by our side resiliently,' says Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, vowing to defend the the Jewish state as the 'repository of our common heritage' in the ongoing war 'against barbarism.' By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu celebrated Christian support for Israel across the globe in a Christmas message released as a video statement Tuesday. Addressing Christians in Israel and abroad on Christmas Eve Tuesday morning, Netanyahu expressed his appreciation for Christian support of Israel during the ongoing wars against Hamas and other Iranian proxies, including Yemenite Houthis. 'My dear Christian friends, as you gather with your family and friends this Christmas, I wish the Christian community in Israel and around the world blessings for a Merry Christmas from the Holy Land,' Netanyahu said. 'At a time when Israel is fighting on seven fronts, we deeply appreciate the steadfast support of our Christian friends around the world.' Netanyahu called Israel's conflict with pro-Iranian Islamist groups - including Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and various militia groups in Iraq - a defense of 'civilization against barbarism.' 'You've stood by our side, you've stood by our side resiliently, consistently, forcefully as Israel defends our civilization against barbarism. The people of Israel are united in defending our nation against those bent on our destruction.' Israel, Netanyahu continued, is the 'repository and the source' of the 'common heritage' shared by Christianity and Judaism. 'We seek peace with all those who wish peace with us, but we will do whatever is necessary to defend the one and only Jewish state, the repository and the source of our common heritage.' 'Israel leads the world in fighting the forces of evil and tyranny, but our battle is not yet over. With your support, and with God's help, I assure you, we shall prevail.'

‘Historic mistake’ for Israel not to directly attack Iran: ex-DM	We need to go for the head [of the snake], for Iran,' Mossad head David Barnea reportedly said. By World Israel News Staff Former defense minister Benny Gantz urged the Israeli government to launch a direct attack on Iran, saying that targeting the country on its on soil is the only way to effectively end proxy attacks on Israel. 'Today, we have the opportunity to catalyze a ‘strategic flip’ against Iran and its proxies,' Gantz said on Monday evening, at a press conference ahead of a meeting of his National Unity party. 'We must capitalize on the opportunity. It would be a strategic mistake of historic proportion not to,' he added. Gantz stressed that Israel should build an international coalition aimed at stopping Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, citing recent reports that Iran should already be considered a nuclear state. 'The nations of the region together with the United States must work together with Israel to remove the threat of a nuclear Iranian regime,' Gantz said. Hebrew-language news outlet Channel 13 reported that Mossad chief David Barnea is pushing for a direct strike on Iran. 'We need to go for the head [of the snake], for Iran — if we only hit the Houthis, it’s not certain we’ll manage to stop them,' the network quoted Barnea as saying. Barnea refused to confirm or deny the accuracy of the report. According to Channel 12 News, Iran is gearing up for an Israeli attack on its soil in the near future. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal in a recent interview, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was reticent on any plans for a strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. 'I’m not going to talk about that,' Netanyahu said, after being asked whether the IAF will target Tehran's nuclear development sites. 'I’ve always said the jury’s out, still out on all of us, and I don’t exclude myself,' Netanyahu added.

Walmart under fire for selling shirts glorifying anti-Israel terr...	American retail giant Walmart removes two t-shirts bearing images of slain Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, while a third remains available for sale, and a shirt honoring slain Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah also still for sale. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The world's largest retailer is under fire this week, after it was discovered that the store has been selling t-shirts glorifying jihadist terrorists behind massive attacks on the State of Israel. Walmart, the Arkansas-based multinational giant, which operates thousands of brick-and-mortar stores along with a large online market, was recently found to be carrying at least four t-shirts printed in honor of slain terrorist leaders engaged in large-scale attacks on Israelis. At least three t-shirts have been identified on Walmart's online store featuring the image of the late Hamas chief and October 7th mastermind Yahya Sinwar, while a fourth shirt, sold under the name 'Nasrallah Safe Following Israeli Airstrikes T-shirt,' bears the image of the late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Early Tuesday morning, the StopAntisemitism watchdog group lobbied Walmart to remove the shirts, after shoppers notified the organization of the items. 'Walmart shoppers were horrified to find shirts glorifying Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar while online shopping,' StopAntisemitism tweeted Tuesday morning. 'Walmart, are you aware you're selling apparel celebrating terrorism and violence against Jews? This is a outrageous—remove them immediately.' The tweet was accompanied by images of two of the shirts, including one which featured an image of Sinwar, under the words 'SIN + WAR.' The second item featured an AI-rendering of Sinwar in body armor, carrying an assault rifle, sold under the name 'Yahya Sinwar We Will Win Or Die Shirt.' Both items have since been removed from Walmart's website and are no longer available for sale. The two other items, however, are still listed.

Israel intercepts Houthi missile, 25 hurt running to bomb shelter...	We will not stop until the aggression against our people in Gaza stops,' says Houthi official. By World Israel News Staff A ballistic missile launched by the Houthis in the early hours of Tuesday morning was successfully intercepted by Israel's air defenses, with no damage caused by falling shrapnel or degree. However, sirens sounded in large swathes of the country, including the cities of Tel Aviv, Lod, Ashdod, and Arad, and their surrounding suburbs. The alarms, which were triggered at 1:45 a.m., sent approximately four million Israelis into bomb shelters. In a statement, the Magen David Adom emergency response organization said it had treated at least 25 Israelis who were injured while running to protected spaces. One 60-year-old woman from the Tel Aviv area was seriously injured, paramedics said. She sustained a head wound and is currently hospitalized. Houthi official Hezam al-Asad pledged that the Houthis will continue their attacks on Israel, despite recent airstrikes by the IAF and U.S. coalition forces on their assets. 'We will not stop until the aggression against our people in Gaza stops,' al-Asad wrote on his X account shortly after the launch. '[Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu will learn that his dreams of a new Middle East are nothing but a punishment for him and his imported entity.' The launch on Tuesday morning marks the third time in five days that the Yemen-based terror group has attacked Israel. Last Thursday, a ballistic missile fired by the Houthis destroyed an elementary school in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan. The school was closed at the time of the attack and there were no casualties. Last Saturday, another ballistic missile struck a park in south Tel Aviv, wounding at least 16 people. While there was no one in the park at the time of the impact, the force of the explosion shattered windows and caused debris to fall in nearby apartment buildings. A three-year-old girl was wounded by shattered glass and transported to the hospital.

‘They stole everything’ – Looting gangs terrorize Gaza aid convoy...	I asked one of them for a sack of flour to feed my children, and he pointed a a pistol at me,' says Gazan. By World Israel News Staff Armed criminal gangs are regularly ambushing trucks carrying humanitarian aid and stealing food meant for civilians, according to a New York Times report published on Monday. Truck driver Hazem Isleem, who was part of a convoy of 100 trucks carrying aid, said that he had been attacked by looters, who forced him to drive to a nearby field. There, he said, he was made to help the looters unload thousands of pounds of flour from his truck, as well assist in ransacking the other vehicles in the convoy. 'It was terrifying,' Isleem said of his ordeal, telling the New York Times that he had been held at gunpoint for 13 hours while the looters stole the entirety of the aid. 'But the worst part was we weren’t able to deliver the food to the people.' Awad Abid, a Gazan who said he had attempted to buy flour from looters, said he was threatened by the gang. 'I asked one of them for a sack of flour to feed my children, and he pointed a a pistol at me,' Abid told the Times. He added that he had seen gunmen 'guarding warehouses containing stolen cartons of UN-marked aid,' according to the report. Numerous Gazan sources named Nasser Abu Shabab, 35, as the mastermind behind the most prolific armed looting gang. Speaking to the , Abu Shabab admitted that he sent armed men to raid aid convoys, but claimed he was obtaining the goods to help feed his family and neighbors. 'We are taking trucks so we can eat, not so we can sell,' Abu Shabab said. 'Every hungry person is taking aid.' Notably, Abu Shabab said that Hamas is stealing the majority of the humanitarian aid, rather than armed criminal gangs. Despite extensive evidence that Hamas is indeed hoarding humanitarian aid and reselling it for exorbitant prices, the terror group has denied that it holds goods meant for distribution to civilians.

One IDF officer, two soldiers killed in northern Gaza	The three men were members of the Shimshon Battalion in the Kfir Brigade and were carrying out operations in Beit Lahiya at the time of their deaths. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Three soldiers—Captain Ilay Gavriel Atedgi, Staff Sergeant Netanel Pessach, and Sergeant Major Hillel Diener—were killed overnight Sunday in the northern Gaza Strip, the military confirmed on Monday evening. The three men were members of the Shimshon Battalion in the Kfir Brigade and were carrying out operations in Beit Lahiya at the time of their deaths. Atedgi, 22, from Kiryat Motzkin, served as a deputy commander; Pessach, 21, was from Elazar; and Diener, 21, hailed from Talmon.

Israeli officials reportedly know where most of the hostages are	There is no indication that Hamas has yet provided a list of which captives are alive. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli officials are reportedly aware of the locations of most of the hostages in Gaza. However, there is no indication that Hamas has yet provided a list of which captives are alive, the Jewish Chronicle reports. As negotiations for a hostage release deal continue in Qatar, an Israeli official said, 'We know the whereabouts of most of the hostages.' Israel has not agreed to a complete cessation of the war, something Hamas has, until recently, has indicated as a non-starter. However, the terror group apparently is willing to agree to what the Israeli source calls 'a prolonged ceasefire' that would allow ongoing negotiations and the delivery of humanitarian aid while still not forcing Israel to relinquish its military goal. According to reports by Al-Ghad, an Egyptian news outlet, Israel has requested the release of 11 men in the first phase of the deal in addition to women, ill and elderly hostages. In exchange, Israel will free 250 Palestinian prisoners. The identity and the conditions of release for these prisoners have been the subject of ongoing negotiations between both sides. Although 96 hostages are believed to be still held in Gaza, the IDF has confirmed that as many as 34 have died. Although a BBC report on Sunday indicated that the hostage deal negotiations were '90% complete,' Israeli officials are recommending caution in expecting a quick outcome. Issues still being discussed are control of the Gaza-Egypt border, humanitarian corridors, and the creation of a buffer zone between the Israel and Gaza border. A Palestinian official said, 'Once these issues are resolved, a potential ceasefire could begin within days.' As part of the deal now under consideration, Israel would permit the large-scale return of Gazans to the northern Strip under the oversight of Egypt and Qatar, with some 500 trucks entering the Gaza Strip daily to deliver international aid. In the third stage of the ceasefire, the war between Israel and Hamas would be terminated, and the Gaza Strip would be handed over to a committee of non-partisan technocrats endorsed by various Palestinian factions, including Hamas and Fatah.

Images showing PA forces with RPG signal calls to step up securit...	Although the PA announced the photo was not taken in Jenin, Israeli security investigations concluded otherwise. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Images of Palestinian Authority forces with an RPG have caused alarm in Israel and calls to take action to increase security in Judea and Samaria, Ynet reports. The photo circulated on social media on Monday showed PA forces holding an RPG during a crackdown on terrorism in a Jenin refugee camp. Although the PA announced the photo was not taken in Jenin, Israeli security investigations concluded otherwise and determined that the PA more likely confiscated the RPG rather than something that was actively used. Investigations have shown that the RPG pictured most likely had low operational capability and was not used during the crackdown. The presence of the weapon is another sign of weapons smuggling into Judea and Samaria, most likely through Jordan from Iran. PA security forces typically use AK-47 rifles, machine guns, and sniper rifles. Although the PA requested more weapons from Israel last year, that request was denied. It is believed Israeli forces will confiscate the RPG. The PA insists the photo was not taken in Jenin and that it was circulated by Hamas and Islamic Jihad to reflect unfavorably on the PA. In response to the photos, Yossi Dagan, head of the Samaria Regional Council, said, 'I demand that the defense minister and prime minister immediately launch a ground operation in Jenin, similar to what was carried out in Gaza and the north, to prevent a repeat of the October 7 scenes in Judea and Samaria and central Israel.' He added, 'It is no coincidence that Jenin has become the capital of terror. If the terrorists feel confident enough to brandish RPGs and heavy weapons, it means they are testing us. We must respond with an iron fist to stop this threat to Samaria—and from Samaria to the cities of central Israel.'

Israelis much more open to Biden peace plan once Trump is preside...	Sixty-three percent of Israeli Jews see Trump as more pro-Israel than Biden compared with the 15 percent who hold the opposite view, according to the poll. By Andrew Tobin, The Washington Free Beacon Israelis overwhelmingly feel safer and are prepared to take risks for peace following Donald Trump’s election as president, according to a recent poll. Three-quarters of the Israeli public says Trump will 'strengthen Israel’s security,' pollsters at Agam Labs, a political consultancy affiliated with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, found last month. Even larger numbers of Israelis are ready to make major concessions as part of a peace deal led by Trump—a double-digit jump compared to when Biden was the one asking. 'Sometimes, the messenger is more important than the message,' Nimrod Nir, the CEO of Agam Labs, told the Washington Free Beacon. 'The public believes that Trump supports Israel and understands Israel’s enemies in ways that Biden does not. People are more willing to trust him to deal with these issues that they see as existential.' The findings, which have not previously been published, are the latest indication that Trump’s message of peace through strength is resonating in the Middle East 14 months after Iran and affiliated terrorist groups launched a war against Israel. Agam Labs began tracking wartime Israeli public sentiment within days of Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on the Jewish state. Over the course of the resulting war, Israelis have become increasingly willing to end the fighting, primarily due to growing concern for the 100 remaining hostages taken on Oct. 7. In a poll this October, Agam Las found that 75 percent of Israelis, including 72 percent of Jews, supported a ceasefire in exchange for the release of the hostages, up from 56 percent of Jews in March. Support for a broader peace plan pushed by Biden, meanwhile, grew more modestly, from 55 percent of Jews in March to 66 percent in October. In addition to a hostage-ceasefire deal, Biden’s proposal included the normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia and Israel’s agreement to the eventual creation of a Palestinian state. A large majority of Israelis do not consider Saudi normalization a wartime priority and oppose Palestinian statehood as an unacceptable security threat, polling has consistently found. But according to Agam Labs’s latest poll, conducted Nov. 12-18, if Trump were to propose a version of Biden’s peace plan, the cost-benefit calculation would change for many Israelis. Eighty-two percent of the public, including 81 percent of Jews, say such a deal 'must be agreed to,' surpassing the 74 percent of Jews who back a standalone hostage-ceasefire deal. Sixty-three percent of Israeli Jews see Trump as more pro-Israel than Biden compared with the 15 percent who hold the opposite view, according to the poll. Eighty-three percent expect Trump to advance Saudi normalization, and 60 percent think he will provide American backing for a strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Just 5 percent think Trump will interfere with U.S. security aid to Israel, and 8 percent think the president-elect will oppose an Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear program—two actions taken by the Biden administration. The poll, like Agam Labs’ other omnibus polling during the war, was based on a representative sample of about 2,000 Israeli adults. The margin of error was 3 percent. Iris Weinstein Haggai, 39, whose Israeli-American parents were both killed in the Oct. 7 attack and their bodies taken to Gaza, said she appreciates the regular briefings that the Biden administration provides her and the other hostages' families. But she noted that all the talking has not ended the war or brought home the remaining hostages. 'I think we need a change because we need strong leadership,' she told the Free Beacon. 'It’s not that I think Biden is this horrible, weak person. I just think that Middle East doesn't feel he is strong enough.' Weinstein Haggai said Trump’s willingness to target the bad guys has given her hope for a hostage-ceasefire deal. 'We tried one way, which was to pressure the Israeli government. It didn’t work. It’s time to put pressure on the terrorists, which why I'm so appreciative of what Trump is doing,' she said. 'It’s like waking up the world, like what’s going on? These are internationally recognized terrorist groups, along with the Islamic Republic of Iran, that are attacking a democratic ally, Israel. Why are we giving them the benefit of the doubt? Why are we letting them control these negotiations?' 'So I'm very appreciative of that,' she added. 'And, you know, I'm very careful saying this, but I'm hopeful.' In a press conference on Monday, Trump reiterated that if the hostages were not released before his inauguration on Jan. 20, 'all hell is going to break out' in the Middle East. He also declined to rule out a U.S. or U.S.-backed Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear weapons program, saying, 'You don't talk about that before something may or may not happen.' Last Wednesday, Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, reportedly met with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in Saudi Arabia and discussed the kingdom’s potential normalization with Israel. On Fox News the same day, Rep. Mike Waltz (R., Fla.), the incoming national security adviser, vowed a return to Trump’s first-term 'maximum pressure' sanctions campaign on Iran. In an interview with Time published last Thursday, Trump declined to recommit to Palestinian statehood as he eventually did in his first term . 'I want a long lasting peace. I'm not saying that's a very likely scenario,' Trump said. 'I want a peace where we don't have an Oct. 7 in another three years. You can do it two state, but there are numerous ways it can be done. I'd like to see everybody be happy.' In the run-up to the election, Trump said that as president, he would reverse Biden’s 'weakness' toward Iran and restore regional peace by supporting Israeli victory. 'With strength and the right leadership, the dawn of a new, more harmonious Middle East is finally within our reach,' Trump said in remarks on the first anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack. 'I will not allow a jihad to be waged on America or our allies, and I will support Israel’s right to win its war on terror, and it has to win it fast no matter what happens.' There have been signs that Israel's enemies have gotten the message . Three weeks after Trump won a second term on Nov. 5, Hezbollah, a Hamas ally and fellow Iran-backed Lebanese terrorist group, agreed to a U.S.-brokered ceasefire. In response, Iran backed off its threat earlier in the month to launch a third 'crushing' missile attack on Israel. In recent days, Israeli and U.S. officials have expressed optimism about a hostage-ceasefire deal, saying Hamas has shown new flexibility. Asa Shapiro, an analyst at Agam Labs and the head of advertising and marketing studies at Tel Aviv University, said that Israelis are ready for Trump to 'make America great again in the Middle East.' 'We see Trump as reestablishing the United States as a superpower that is not just willing to support its allies but also to impose its will. So there is definitely a sense of relief that he is back,' Shapiro told the Free Beacon. 'At the same time, we don’t want to get on Trump’s bad side. So if he wants peace, we’d better give him peace.'

Iran said to be fearing Israeli attack in near-term	Benny Gantz, leader of the opposition National Unity Party, stressed the importance for the entire Middle East to rally against Tehran’s malign influence as it is both a regional and global challenge. By Amelie Botbol and David Isaac, JNS Iran is worried about a direct attack by Israel against its strategic sites in the near future, Israel’s Channel 12 News reported on Sunday. The Iranians have reached this conclusion due to a series of events, including Israel’s agreement to a ceasefire with the Tehran-backed Hezbollah terror group in Lebanon. Iran’s leadership has interpreted this move as being intended to free up Israel to concentrate on the Islamic Republic directly, according to the report. Two other events played into their conclusion: Israel’s elimination of Iranian air defense systems in October, and the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States. Israel wants to do everything it can to prevent Iran from returning to Syria and Lebanon, and the Iranians are already investing money and resources in doing so, according to Channel 12. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told JNS at a faction meeting of his Religious Zionism Party that 'more and more arms' of Iranian origin have been used to attack the Jewish state over the past year. 'We need to act against the head of the snake, which is the Iranian regime itself, and his intention to destroy the State of Israel. And that’s what we will do,' said Smotrich. document.createElement('video'); Benny Gantz, leader of the opposition National Unity Party and a former member of the War Cabinet, told JNS on Monday that Israel should take 'all the necessary means' to defend itself against the Iranian threat. He stressed the importance for the entire Middle East to rally against Tehran’s malign influence as it is both a regional and global challenge. 'The fact is that Saudi Arabia was hit by the Iranians, whether directly or through the Houthis—before this current war started—and they were attacked many, many times,' said Gantz. 'We defend ourselves, but the world should do something about it. This is a great opportunity, due to the war and its developments, to do something about Iran,' he added. The Houthis in Yemen came up for discussion in an Israeli Security Cabinet meeting on Sunday. The Iranian proxy has stepped up missile launches against Israel, to the point of upsetting the Iranians. They are no longer acting as a classic proxy, according to the report. The Houthis have advanced weapons that include cruise and surface-to-surface missiles, as well as drones. These assets are spread out over large areas and are difficult to reach, making it challenging for Israel to create a bank of targets, according to Channel 12. Multiple Houthi missiles have hit Tel Aviv and its environs in recent days, prompting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to promise the Israeli public that the terror group would be dealt with. 'Just as we have acted forcefully against the terror arms of Iran’s axis of evil, so too will we act against the Houthis,' he said on Sunday. Mossad chief calls to target Iran in response to Houthi attacks Mossad Director David Barnea is advocating for an Israeli strike on Iran in response to attacks on Israel carried out by the Houthis, a Yemen-based proxy of Tehran, according to a Sunday report in Ynet. Officials familiar with recent high-level meetings said that Barnea argued that Jerusalem should 'go for the head, Iran.' 'We need to attack Iran, unrelated to the Houthis,' Yisrael Beitenu Party head Avigdor Liberman said in response to a question by JNS on Monday. The Israeli opposition politician stressed that it is no longer possible to wait, citing the U.N. nuclear watchdog’s warnings that the Islamic Republic is quickly approaching the nuclear threshold. 'I do not want a nuclear Iran. And remember what [former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi] Rafsanjani said at the time, that the State of Israel is a one-bomb state,' said Liberman. Regarding the Houthis, he urged the Israeli government to 'establish contact with all other actors in Yemen, and the official government, by the way, does not sit in Sanaa, but in Aden. 'In addition, we can mark more than a hundred targets in Houthi-controlled territory, which simply need to be eliminated,' he said, naming missiles, energy facilities and other terrorist infrastructures as examples. Likud Party lawmaker Dan Illouz charged that 'it’s clear that Iran is and will remain a problem, even if we defeat all of its proxies.' However, 'proxies were only one of the strategies that Iran used,' Illouz said in a conversation with JNS on Monday. 'We also know that Iran is building nuclear weapons.' 'When we look at Oct. 7, and we see what Iran’s proxies did without nuclear weapons, we can only imagine what would happen if Iran gets nuclear weapons, and that’s something we cannot ignore,' he explained, referencing the Hamas-led terror attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. According to Illouz, 'this problem will need to be addressed, and we have an opportunity now' due to the weakening of Hamas and Lebanon-based Hezbollah, as well as the fall of the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria. 'We have a weakened Iran, and, on the other hand, we have a Trump administration that will come in. And I just want to remind you that Iran reportedly tried to assassinate Trump, and Trump isn’t the type of person that forgets such a thing,' he stated.

Archeologists find Jewish empire where Putin claims Russian Chris...	The team also unearthed a tall ceramic vessel bearing a Hebrew seal reading 'God: Justice,' dated to the ninth or tenth century. By Jewish Breaking News An unlikely archaeological project funded by a Russian oligarch has unearthed evidence of Jewish life so ancient it makes Vladimir Putin’s claims of Russian Orthodox dominance look like yesterday’s news. Bankrolled by businessman Oleg Deripaska’s Volnoe Delo Foundation, a sprawling first-century Jewish quarter has emerged hidden beneath the soil of Phanagoria along the Black Sea. The Jewish quarter sat at the intersection of two main streets in the city’s wealthiest district, complete with an irrigated garden where massive ceramic jars stored water for what might have been an orchard. Among the most compelling finds are more than 200 Jewish gravestones, their surfaces still bearing witness to ancient craftsmen’s work. The stones feature timeless Jewish symbols that would be familiar to any modern rabbi, such as a shofar, menorah, and delicately carved lulavim. Yet it’s the marble tablets that have archaeologists buzzing. Dating to 16 and 51 CE, they record a practice of freeing slaves who earned their liberty by pledging continued service to the synagogue. Carved in ancient Greek, the inscriptions mention both a 'house of prayer' and a 'synagogue,' proving Jewish religious life was firmly established here while Rome still ruled the Mediterranean. Unfortunately, the synagogue itself met a violent end when sixth-century invaders stormed Phanagoria. Evidence of stone projectiles from siege weapons litters the site. As for the congregation, they appear to have made a last stand in their house of worship, where excavators found 58 copper coins scattered in the shattered floor near the bimah and benches. Eventually, the entire city was destroyed by invading forces, leaving Phanagoria abandoned for 130 years. When life finally returned to the ruins, it was under the banner of the Bosporan Kingdom. Interestingly, the team also unearthed a tall ceramic vessel bearing a Hebrew seal reading 'God: Justice,' dated to the ninth or tenth century. Historian Larissa Golofast believes this artifact may link Phanagoria to the Radhanites, a term describing Jewish merchants who maintained vast trading networks during the early medieval period. 'The geographer Ibn Khordadbeh mentions four routes of the Radhanites. All of them began in Spain or France and ended in China. One of these routes passed through the territory of Khazaria. On their way from France and Spain, the Radhanites visited numerous centers, selling some items and buying others along the way,' Golofast tells Haaretz. The discovery poses uncomfortable questions for Putin’s regime, which has staked its legitimacy partly on claims of Russia’s deep Orthodox Christian roots. After Phanagoria’s destruction, Judaism would actually become the state religion in the region from the seventh to ninth centuries – a historical footnote that rarely makes it into official narratives.

Hope for cancer patients: Israeli researchers unveil innovative d...	Tumor size reduction and delayed progression were significant, with treated mice showing a 2.5-fold improvement in time to progression and a twofold increase in median survival compared to those receiving free drugs. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli and European researchers on Sunday unveiled a new approach to treating cancerous tumors by using biodegradable nanoparticles to simultaneously deliver two drugs to amplify their effects. The findings offer hope for patients with breast, skin, pancreatic and brain cancer. The research team, led by Prof. Ronit Satchi-Fainaro and doctoral student Shani Koshrovski-Michael from the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology at Tel Aviv University’s School of Medicine, collaborated with an extensive network of experts across Israel, Italy, Portugal, and the Netherlands. The study’s findings were recently published in the peer-reviewed Science Advances journal. Satchi-Fainaro explained the motivation behind the innovation: 'Cancer treatment often involves a combination of drugs working synergistically to enhance their anti-cancer effects. However, differences in their chemical and physical properties—such as degradation rates and tumor penetration capabilities—often prevent them from reaching the tumor simultaneously, limiting their combined efficacy.' To tackle this issue, the researchers developed polymeric nanoparticles capable of encapsulating two drugs and selectively targeting tumors. These nanoparticles biodegrade into water and carbon dioxide within a month, ensuring safety and reducing long-term side effects. By attaching sulfate groups that bind to P-selectin—a protein overexpressed on cancer cells and their blood vessels—the nanoparticles home in on the tumor, leaving healthy tissues untouched. The team loaded the nanoparticles with two FDA-approved drug pairs. The first pair, BRAF and MEK inhibitors, targets melanoma with a BRAF gene mutation, found in 50% of melanoma cases. The second pair, PARP and PD-L1 inhibitors, addresses BRCA-mutated breast cancer. These mutations present well-defined molecular targets, making them ideal for testing precision drug delivery methods. The platform was tested in 3D cancer cell models and animal models representing primary melanoma and breast cancer tumors. The nanoparticles also successfully penetrated the blood-brain barrier, making it possible to treat brain metastases effectively without harming healthy brain tissue. The blood brain barrier is a highly selective and protective barrier of tightly-packed cells that separates the circulating blood from the brain and central nervous system. This protects the brain from harmful substances in the blood while allowing in essential nutrients. However, its selective nature poses challenges for delivering therapeutic drugs to the brain. The dual-drug delivery method demonstrated superior effectiveness compared to separate drug administration, even at doses 30 times lower than those used in prior studies. Tumor size reduction and delayed progression were significant, with treated mice showing a 2.5-fold improvement in time to progression and a twofold increase in median survival compared to those receiving free drugs. Untreated control groups fared even worse, with survival rates three times lower than those of treated mice. The technology is adaptable for a variety of drug pairs and cancer types, potentially extending its impact to other tumors that express P-selectin, such as pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer. 'This technology can transport various drug pairs that enhance each other’s effects, improving treatment for a wide range of cancers expressing the P-selectin protein,' Satchi-Fainaro said.

El Al bets big on new fleet after disastrous global ranking	However, even with a shiny new fleet, El Al has faced mounting criticism over alleged price gouging during the Israel-Hamas war. By Jewish Breaking News The skies aren’t looking so friendly for El Al after nearly scraping bottom in AirHelp’s 2024 global rankings. El Al placed a dismal 105th out of 109 airlines evaluated, outperforming only four carriers including Bulgaria Air and bottom-ranked Tunisair. The airline’s performance was particularly abysmal in claims processing, where it scored a mere 0.1 out of 10. Even its satisfaction rating of 8.0 couldn’t salvage its overall standing, dragged down by a mediocre 5.7 score in punctuality. But El Al is betting big on a comeback after just inking a deal on Sunday with Boeing for up to 31 new 737 MAX jets. Besides luxury, the new MAX aircraft promise to slash fuel consumption by 20% compared to current planes and reduce noise footprint by 50%. It’s all part of an ambitious fleet renewal strategy that began earlier this year when El Al ordered three additional 787-9 Dreamliners with options for six more. One new aircraft is scheduled for delivery in mid-2025, and two more leased aircraft are expected to arrive in the near future. CEO Dina Ben-Tal Ganancia trumpeted the purchase as a 'significant milestone,' claiming it will offer customers the 'most advanced service and technology experience in the industry.' 'El Al has a central role in ensuring open skies for Israel. The implementation of our strategic plan – which aims to expand the fleet, increase the value proposition for customers and increase capacity and seating – will ensure a strong and growing company for many years to come,' Ben-Tal Ganancia said. However, even with a shiny new fleet, El Al has faced mounting criticism over alleged price gouging during the Israel-Hamas war. The airline’s response has been to implement what it calls fare caps on four European routes – Larnaca ($200), Athens ($300), and Vienna and Dubai ($350). Yet, critics note these token gestures do little to address the broader issue of sky-high fares, particularly in North America where El Al faces virtually no competition after American carriers suspended service citing security concerns after October 7, 2023. According to Globes, El Al’s overall revenue jumped 63% to $1.1 billion in the first nine months of 2024. Revenue from flights to Europe jumped 36% to $1.2 billion, and for Asia and Africa there was an 11% increase. In total, El Al’s profits in January-September rose 42% to $2.5 billion, while net income jumped more than fivefold to $411 million.'

Gaza war fueling groundbreaking Israeli medical innovations	More than 12,000 soldiers have been injured both physically and psychologically in over 14 months of war. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The Israel-Hamas war has led to hundreds of deaths on the battlefield, over 12,000 injuries both physical and psychological – and many medical breakthroughs and innovations to treat them. Mediwound, based in Yavne, uses enzymes extracted from pineapple stems to rapidly remove dead skin, called eschar, from third-degree burns, such as those caused by exploding Hamas or Hezbollah booby traps. Because it is a topical treatment, it obviates the need for surgical removal of the eschar, which is both painful and can leave deeper scarring. It also speeds the healing process. Although 3D printing has been around for years, hospitals’ prosthetics departments have made significant progress in their complexity and the turnaround time for producing them has gone from weeks to mere hours. Using robotic technology during surgery also isn’t new, but it has taken a leap forward since the war began as well. A guidance system made by Medtronic Israel is being used in Hadassah Hospital to turn long and complicated surgeries into minimally invasive procedures, including one where a bullet was successfully removed from a soldier’s spine in a way that prevented paralysis or nerve damage. Over a third of the injuries are psychological in nature, ranging from depression to psychosis to PTSD, all conditions that can often be completely debilitating. The sheer number of such wounded is daunting, and there are not enough mental health professionals in Israel to help them in a timely manner. LIV is an AI-driven clinical support system designed in a collaboration between Sheba Medical Center, Microsoft and accounting giant KPMG to jumpstart the treatment process. It can interact with patients from their homes 24/7, asking them personalized and detailed questions about what is bothering them, how they react to different circumstances, and more, to create a complete picture of their condition. It can also monitor facial expressions and voice frequencies as well as access myriad relevant electronic records, all to provide a complete clinical summary to physicians so that they can diagnose correctly and quickly, and provide the necessary medical support. A self-guided app to actually help prevent PTSD was developed at the Samueli Initiative for Responsible AI in Medicine and the Psychological Trauma Research Lab at Tel Aviv University, also together with Microsoft engineers. It is based on the EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) method. On a different psychological front, phantom pain, which is created when the brain keeps telling a non-existent limb to move and it doesn’t respond, affects many of the hundreds of IDF amputees who lost their limbs in Gaza or Lebanon. Israeli startup 6Degrees has invented the MyMove system that delivers significant pain relief through playing games on a VR headset, where the player 'uses' a virtual limb, thereby tricking the brain into believing its signals are being answered. These and many more innovations can obviously be used in the civilian sector as well, and some of the companies have already seen their stocks rise and interest from investors piqued, lending a small silver lining to the hellish results of the war Israel has been fighting for over 14 months and counting.

Iraqi militias announce end to attacks on Israel – report	Fearing blowback from the incoming Trump administration and wary of the new Sunni regime in Syria, Iran-backed paramilitary groups in Iraq announce a halt to military operations abroad, including against Israel. By World Israel News Staff Iraqi militias aligned with Iran are suspending their military operations in Syria, as well as their attacks against Israel, according to a report Monday by a Lebanese media outlet associated with an Iranian proxy force. The report, published by the pro-Hezbollah Al-Akhbar newspaper, cited a senior militia official who said that pro-Iranian militias in Iraq, including the Al-Nujaba Movement, have decided on a strategic pause in their actions against Israel, and to refrain from getting involved in internal Syrian affairs following the toppling of the Assad regime. This decision follows discussions with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and aligns with directives from Iran, which reportedly has given the Iraqi militias freedom of action to determine their own policies. The official cited concerns over the direction of the incoming Trump administration as one of the reasons for the decision. 'The factions have decided not to interfere in Syrian affairs and to monitor the situation from a distance while also awaiting the policy directions of US President-elect Donald Trump, particularly regarding the Middle East and Iran.' 'The resistance will stop military operations against Israel as part of its support for Gaza and will not interfere in political changes in Syria,' the official continued. Despite this de-escalation, the militias assert their opposition to the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq, and declined to make any statements regarding suspending their attacks on American bases in Iraq and Syria. The decision to halt operations against Israel marks a major shift, just a month after two of the largest pro-Iranian militias in Iraq pushed back against calls by the al-Sudani government to refrain from attacking Israel.

Trump will have ‘almost zero time’ to prevent nuclear Iran	The report argues that U.S. support for a potential Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear program is the best way to 'build leverage and halt Tehran’s nuclear clock.' By Yaakov Lappin, JNS Once he takes office on Jan. 20, President-elect Donald Trump will have very little time to stop Iran’s march to nuclear weapons and no margin for error, according to a report by the Jewish Institute for National Security of America. The report, released on Dec. 19, calls on the incoming U.S. administration to join Israel in giving Iran 'an ultimatum at the outset of the presidency: agree fully and immediately to verifiably dismantle its nuclear weapons program, or invite its imminent and utter destruction.' The plan also calls for a blend of massive economic and diplomatic pressure, backed by a credible military posture. This would include the implementation of sanctions on Chinese banks and other companies conducting trade with Iran. The report argues that U.S. support for a potential Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear program is the best way to 'build leverage and halt Tehran’s nuclear clock,' and calls for Trump to publicly state that such a strike 'is consistent with longstanding U.S. prevention policy.' Other suggested steps include expediting delivery of U.S.-made KC-46A aerial refueling tankers purchased by Israel in 2021, and 'ensuring America’s prepositioned weapons stockpile in Israel is properly updated with precision guided munitions (PGM), including potentially bunker busters and air-to-air missiles, to fulfill the depot’s official purpose of supporting Israel in an emergency such as wartime.' On the diplomatic front, Washington must outmaneuver Iran’s attempt to split 'the United States from its allies' by forging and maintaining a 'wide-ranging coalition of Israeli, Arab, and European partners that will be vital for deterring and denying further Iranian nuclear advances, and, if necessary, compelling Tehran to negotiate urgently and earnestly,' the report states. The Trump administration must signal a credible military threat from day one, the report argues. Last week, the JINSA plan was presented by members of the organization’s Iran Policy Project, including co-chairs Ambassador Eric Edelman and U.S. Air Force General (ret.) Charles Wald. Edelman stated during a webinar that following the collapse of the Assad regime, which will make it almost impossible for Iran to resupply its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah, a unique moment has arrived. 'Iran is both progressing towards nuclear weapons and … the debate in Iran internally has begun to be one about those who would like to accelerate the program and rely on nuclear deterrence in order to create a shield, behind which Iran can rebuild its whole network of malign activities, and those who are talking about negotiation,' he said. 'We understand President Trump has a predisposition to want to do deals, and he might understandably want to avoid beginning his presidency with the risk of moving into a military operation,' said Edelman, adding, 'It could lead to war.' However, 'We think it’s very important that if he does decide to opt to go down the negotiations route that he put very strict parameters on it and not allow the Iranians to do what they’ve done in the past, which is to use negotiations as dilatory tactics while they build up their own nuclear program and run out the clock,' he said. Ambassador Elliott Abrams, a member of the task force and former U.S. special representative for Iran, added, quoting former U.S. statesman George Shultz, 'The hard reality is that diplomacy not backed by military force is ineffectual.'

2024 Men of the Year: Real Americans against Hamasniks	For standing up against the terrorist-loving mobs, we salute Mario Torres, the Pi Kappa Phi brothers, baseball fans, and all the other everyday American heroes who said 'enough' to the Hamasniks By The Washington Free Beacon Americans are tolerant people. We grudgingly accept many things that would horrify other civilized societies: brat summer, Cybertrucks, 'pit diapers.' But our tolerance has its limits. And one of those limits is cheerleading for terrorists. A mob of pro-Hamas student protesters learned this the hard way last spring when they stormed a Columbia University building in the middle of the night, ransacked the place, and barricaded themselves inside—along with several innocent maintenance workers. Unfortunately for the pro-terrorist gang, one of the trapped janitors was Mario Torres. And he wasn’t going to sit back and tolerate their nonsense. In a scene straight out of Scooby Doo, Torres pinned the rioters’ masked ringleader against the wall and ripped off his Columbia hoodie—revealing him to be creepy, 40-year-old trust fund baby James Carlson. Carlson, who was neither a student nor a staff member at Columbia, was later charged with trespassing and arson related to the protests. At the University of North Carolina last spring, a group of patriotic Pi Kappa Phi brothers also had enough when they saw Hamas-loving activists attempt to seize the Stars and Stripes from a campus flagpole and replace it with the Palestinian flag. The fraternity brothers encircled the American flag for hours, protecting it from touching the ground, even as anti-Israel protesters taunted them with obscenities and threw rocks and water bottles at them. (Parker Ali/Daily Tar Heel) Sports fans also shut down pro-Hamas demonstrators. At an Orioles-Guardians game last summer, thousands of spectators loudly booed a handful of anti-Israel activists who unfurled a 'Free Palestine' banner in the bleachers, cheering when the agitators were booted from Camden Yards. 'F—-' Palestinian bull—-,' one fan yelled. F—-' Palestinian bull—-, indeed.

Israel and Slovakia sign historic $582 million deal to boost air ...	In November, Israel Aerospace Industries reported a record-breaking order backlog of approximately $25 billion and a 74% increase in net income in its third-quarter earnings report. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel and Slovakia signed a 2 billion shekel ($582 million) agreement on Monday to boost the European country’s air defense systems, in the largest defense export deal ever between the two. The centerpiece of the deal is the BARAK MX air defense system, a state-of-the-art platform designed to counter aerial threats, including missiles and aircraft. Produced by Israeli Aerospace Industries, the system’s versatility allows it to address threats from fighter jets, helicopters, UAVs, cruise missiles, and tactical ballistic missiles. Its three different interceptor rockets range from 35-150 km. 'The expansion of Israeli defense exports in parallel with the war is a direct continuation of the achievements of Israeli technologies on the battlefield. We see growing interest from additional countries in the extraordinary performance of the IDF and Israeli combat systems, both in defense and offense,' said Defense Ministry Director General Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir. 'Defense exports are a central component of our security and economic resilience. They are what allow us to continue to develop the next generations of the most advanced combat systems in the world.' In November, Israel Aerospace Industries reported a record-breaking order backlog of approximately $25 billion and a 74% increase in net income in its third-quarter earnings report. The growth was driven by IAI’s Missile and Space Systems Division, with $1.87 billion in sales for the first nine months of 2024, up from $1.63 billion in 2023. The Arrow missile system earned global acclaim, supported by increased R&D investment of $81 million in Q3, up from $65 million. IAI also reported a record-breaking $25 billion order backlog as of September 30, 2024. This represents a $7.22 billion increase from the previous year and secures 3.5 years of operations at current sales volumes. International demand for Israel’s military technology has surged as European countries increased their defense budgets in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Israel is developing a multilayered aerial defense system that has drawn global attention.

Australian news host fired over pro-Israel views meets with Israeli President and Knesset Speaker, emphasizes Israel’s right to self-defense. By World Israel News Staff President Isaac and First Lady Michal Herzog Monday met with Australian journalist Erin Molan who was visiting Israel as part of a delegation organized by the Australia Israel and Jewish Affairs Council (AIJAC). Molan, 41, had worked as a television news anchor at Sky News Australia before she was fired earlier this month. After her firing, Molan claimed that her dismissal was due to her outspoken support for Israel and public criticism of not only the Hamas terror organization but Israel’s critics abroad as well. During their meeting, President Herzog thanked her for standing up for Israel. 'We followed you during this war as one with moral clarity,' said Herzog. 'We are under this huge attack - endless attack - by people who don't understand, who don't get the picture.' 'We are the ones who are fighting for the free world. We are the ones who are stopping this empire of evil. We're at this for frontier of clash of civilization, of values, and we are to blame? And here comes somebody who has an opinion and moral clarity and we are very grateful.' 'Something has to change. Terror is unacceptable. All this violence is unacceptable. This is the watershed that we are dealing with, and I think that is why your voice means so much, and that's why Israelis identify with what you say.' Molan emphasized that despite media attention on anti-Israel voices, most Australians side with Israel in the current war. 'You see so much horror and terror and heartbreak, but then you also feel the most incredible sense of hope.' 'I can assure you the vast majority of Australians stand with you. The loud minority gets a very big run. Clearly, we all believe, and we stand with you.' 'But I didn't quite comprehend the level of depravity of what occurred on October 7, and you can't until you watch that video and you visit where it happened. We all want kids in Gaza to stop dying. I don't know anyone who doesn't, but the way we do that is get the hostages home and end Hamas.' A day earlier, Molan met with Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana (Likud).

Mossad agent reveals how exploding pager plot was carried out aga...	The operation was the 'tipping point' of the war against Hezbollah, said one agent. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Two recently retired senior Mossad agents with direct knowledge of their agency’s plot to attack thousands of Hezbollah operatives through their pagers revealed new details of the operation to the CBS program '60 Minutes' Sunday. The two men, 'Michael' and 'Gabriel,' spoke to interviewer Leslie Stahl with their heads completely covered and their voices changed, to protect their identities. 'Michael' explained that the Mossad had begun by tampering with walkie talkies over ten years ago. 'The walkie-talkie was a weapon, just like a bullet or a missile or a mortar,' he said. The agency invented a way to place an explosive device inside the battery in a way that couldn’t be detected, and then sold 16,000 of them to the terror organization. 'They got a good price,' the former agent noted. When asked exactly who was the middleman, as Hezbollah could not suspect that it came from the Jewish state, 'Michael' answered, 'We have an incredible array of possibilities of creating foreign companies that have no way of being traced back to Israel.' Since 'walkie talkies are only used in battle,' Stahl commented, in 2022 the Mossad decided to try for something that the terrorists would carry with them all the time – the pagers. The agency found out that Hezbollah had already bought beepers from a Taiwanese company called Gold Apollo and duped the company into signing a cooperative agreement to manufacture the pagers under its name. 'Gold Apollo had zero clue that they are working with the Mossad,' said'Gabriel,' confirming the company’s declaration after the mini-bombs went off. He also laid to rest the rumor that the pagers were also used to track the terrorists, saying 'This is a very stupid device by nature – this is the reason [the terrorists] use it. There’s almost no way how to tap it.' The Israelis used dummies to test exactly how much explosive material would be the maximum possible to hurt the beeper’s owner but not anyone nearby. 'Even if his wife or his daughter will be just next to him, he is the only one that’s going to be harmed,' the second agent explained. Still, to make it into a bomb, it had to be somewhat larger than the regular commercial ones, which would make them less comfortable in a pocket. So the agency marketed them in ads online by extolling its 'added features,' such being waterproof, dustproof, extremely durable, and having an extra-long battery life, besides being rechargeable. Only 'several grams' of explosives were packed into each one at the end, the agent noted. When regular customers called to order them, they were fobbed off by the expensive price they were quoted, 'Gabriel' said. The agency used a Gold Apollo saleswoman Hezbollah was familiar with, who offered them the first batch of the 'upgraded' beepers for free. In the end, 5,000 terrorists were carrying them around when they were detonated on September 17, after the Mossad thought that the organization was beginning to suspect their pocket pagers. It was also very soon after the government had declared that another war goal was to return evacuated Israelis to their homes in the north, which meant dealing a heavy blow to Hezbollah so it could not keep launching rockets and UAVs over the border. About 30 people were killed in the attack and some 3,000 were injured. One day later, the walkie talkies were detonated, wounding more and even killing a few terrorists who were attending the funerals of their comrades. 'This was the tipping point of the war,' said 'Gabriel,' because when Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah went on the air a day after that, 'if you look at his eyes, he was defeated&#8230;.If his soldiers looked at him during that speech, they saw a broken leader.' Nasrallah had been in close proximity when a few pagers exploded, 'Gabriel' noted. 'Just next to him in the bunker [were] several people receiving the [incoming pager] message, and with his own eyes he saw them collapsing,' he said. When asked how he knew that, he answered, 'It’s a strong rumor.' Ten days later, Nasrallah was dead himself, after the IAF dropped 80 tons of bombs to reach his bunker, hidden deep under a civilian apartment building in Beirut.

‘We won’t accept jihadists on our border’- Israel to Syrian rebel...	The IDF has deployed troops in a region of southern Syria, which was previously designated as a demilitarized zone. By World Israel News Staff Israel has warned Syria's new government that it will not tolerate the presence of radical Islamic extremists on its border, as the IDF gears up for troops to remain in a former buffer zone for the foreseeable future. While Israel is not in direct contact with the rebels, the country's leaders are communicating with Syria's emerging government via third parties including the U.S., according to a Ynet report. Jerusalem was said to have stressed that the Jewish State will neutralize any threat posed by armed extremists along its shared border with Syria. Following the the ouster of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad by Islamic rebel groups, Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes on Syrian military infrastructure, arms depots, and chemical weapons research facilities. 'I don’t know if we killed anyone, but we certainly smashed the weaponry of the Syrian army,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Wall Street Jounral. 'We don’t want all the stuff the Syrians amassed falling into the hands of the jihadists.' The IDF has also deployed troops in a region of southern Syria, which was previously designated as a demilitarized zone, including the former Syrian side of Mt. Hermon. After the 1974 Yom Kippur War, an armistice agreement signed by Syria and Israel pledged that a swathe of land between the two countries would be free of any troop presence. Although rebel leader Ahmed al-Shaara, who led the flash offensive that toppled Assad, has vowed to respect previous security agreements between Syria and Israel, Jerusalem has signaled that it is unwilling to maintain the buffer zone until the country's internal affairs are stabilized. Netanyahu has emphasized that the deployment of Israeli troops in the 155-mile buffer zone is 'a temporary defensive position until a suitable arrangement is found.' The premier added that Israel wants to 'establish neighborly relations and peaceful relations with the new forces emerging in Syria.'

Syrian First Lady divorces deposed President Assad – report	Asma Assad reportedly hopes to move back to her native Britain after filing for divorce from deposed Syrian President Bashar Assad - but Britain's foreign affairs chief says she is persona non grata in the UK. By World Israel News Staff The former First Lady of Syria is divorcing her husband, the recently deposed president of the Arab republic, according to reports by Arab and Turkish media outlets. Asma Assad, the 49-year-old British-born wife of Bashar Assad, has lived in Moscow with the couple's three children for the past month, after anti-regime rebels made gains against loyalist forces in northern Syria. President Assad joined his wife after fleeing Damascus as rebel forces seized control of the city on December 8th. Born to Sunni Syrian expatriates living in London, Asma married Bashar, an Alawite Shi'ite, in 2000, shortly after he succeeded his father, Hafez Assad, as President of Syria. Having retained her British citizenship, Mrs. Assad has filed for divorce and is seeking to return to the UK. According to a report by The Jerusalem Post, Asma has submitted a request with a Russian court to allow her to take her children out of the country. Currently, the Bashar family are living in Moscow as asylum-seekers, leaving their ability to travel - even within Russia - curtailed. Russia has reportedly frozen Assad's assets in the country, which are estimated at roughly $2 billion. Other members of the Assad family have applied for asylum and are under house arrest in the interim. Even if Asma receives permission to leave Moscow, however, it is unclear if Britain will allow her to return. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in an address to Parliament on December 10th, two days after the fall of the Assad regime, that the former Syrian First Lady 'is not welcome here in the UK.' A Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday denied reports that Asma had filed for divorce, and rejected reports that Moscow had frozen the family's assets. 'They do not correspond to reality,' said Peskov.

Jerusalem seminary fire leaves 48 injured	Three victims in critical condition and dozens more in moderate or light condition after a fire tore through a seminary dormitory in Jerusalem. By World Israel News Staff Nearly 50 people were injured Monday, after a fire broke out at a seminary in Jerusalem. The fire erupted Monday morning in the seminary's dormitory on David Yellin Street in the capital. Jerusalem district firefighters were called to the scene to battle the blaze and rescue victims inside the building, while emergency first responders from United Hatzalah and Magen David Adom (MDA) were dispatched to treat the injured. Of the 48 victims treated, three are listed in critical condition, according to United Hatzalah, with two in moderate condition, with the remaining 43 in light condition. According to MDA, the three most seriously injured victims range in age from 18 to 25, while the two victims listed in moderate condition have been identified as an 18-year-old man and a 32-year-old man. 'The fire broke out in a residential building that partly serves as a girls' seminary,' Dr. Aryeh Yaffe, a volunteer doctor with United Hatzalah, and United Hatzalah volunteer EMTs Ariel Drey and Zevi Klein reported from the scene. 'We provided initial medical assistance to numerous casualties, including three men who ran into the building to rescue to victims, and 14 girls who were evacuated by United Hatzalah ambulances.' 'Additionally, medical teams treated three critically injured victims at the scene, along with two girls in moderate condition and dozens with minor injuries. Large firefighting forces operated at the scene to extinguish the flames and rescue those trapped in the burning building.' MDA paramedic Eliyahu Ben-Hamo recalled the scene from the fire: 'We got there with a large number of units, and we saw a lot of fire coming out from the building.' 'We linked up with firefighter units who brought out victims to us who had been staying inside the building. We then began the triage screening of the victims.' 'All victims were fully conscious, we saw three victims in severe condition, two in moderate condition suffering from smoke inhalation, and several young people who were walking near the building.

Iran looking to create airborne supply line to Hezbollah – report	After fall of Assad regime, Tehran scrambling to find alternative route to supply Hezbollah, including possible build-up of Beirut airport as major terror hub – even if it means violating the ceasefire in Lebanon. By World Israel News Staff The Iranian government is evaluating the possibility of creating an airborne supply route directly to Lebanon, in an effort to bolster its proxy forces in the area, chief among them the Shi’ite terror group Hezbollah, The Times reported. According to the report published Sunday night, Iran recently resumed direct flights between Tehran and Beirut, but has been forced to redirect the routes of the flights to avoid entering Syrian airspace following the collapse of the Assad regime. The rebel alliance which seized control of Syria earlier this month has barred Iranian aircraft from entering the country’s airspace, Walla reported over the weekend. While the provisional Syrian government’s ban was originally aimed at Iranian military aircraft, by Sunday it reportedly became evident that the prohibition had been extended to all Iranian planes. Having lost both the land-based supply routes which connected Iran to Lebanon via Iraq and Syria, as well as the use of Syrian airspace, Tehran is now under pressure to find an alternative path to transfer weapons and other equipment to Hezbollah. According to a regional source cited by The Times, Iran is considering massively upgrading its operations in Beirut’s Rafic Hariri International Airport, turning the airport into a major logistical hub for Iranian proxy forces abroad. Such a move, however, would violate the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, which went into effect on November 27th, and would thus risk reigniting the fighting between the IDF and Iranian proxies in Lebanon. Western powers, the source told The Times, are 'concerned that Iran has lost [Damascus as] its go-to airport in the region for smuggling weapons and is now trying to turn Beirut airport into its new logistics hub, just as they did in Syria.' This, the source added, 'could lead to the next escalation.'

Hamas kidnappers will get ‘bullet in the forehead’ – Trump adviso...	Incoming National Security Adviser Mike Walz aims to levy severe consequences against terrorists who kidnap U.S. citizens . By World Israel News Staff President-elect Donald Trump's designated National Security Adviser promised on Sunday that under the incoming administration, terror groups kidnapping Americans would face severe consequences. 'You take an American, you illegally detain them, if you're a nation state or if you're a terrorist, you hold them hostage there is going to be all hell to pay!' Rep. Mike Waltz, who is expected to be confirmed as Trump's National Security Adviser, told conservative commentator Ben Shapiro in a podcast interview published on Sunday. 'There are going to be nothing but consequences for you financially and maybe even a bullet in your damn forehead if you take an American, period!' Waltz noted that the Americans still in Hamas captivity have been held for longer than those during the 1979 Tehran hostage crisis. 'That’s totally unacceptable, and I think writ large, there has never been enough consequences,' Waltz said. 'That’s what we need to be talking about with these people.' Waltz added that the punishment for taking American hostages must be severe, in order to deter future kidnappings by terror groups. 'The next time you think about it… a lot of these groups are going to say, ‘Woah, it’s just not worth it under Donald Trump,'' he said. 'If the bad guys are incentivized to take more [hostages] because they keep getting more, then they’re going to keep doing it. If the bad guys feel nothing but cost and pain for taking our people, they’re going to stop doing it.' There are seven American citizens currently held by Hamas in Gaza, with four of them confirmed to have been murdered on October 7th. Itai Chen and Omer Neutra, two U.S. born IDF soldiers, were killed battling Hamas terrorists during the onslaught. Judith Weinstein Haggai and Gadi Haggai, a married couple with Israeli and American citizenships, were brutally murdered while on a morning walk in Kibbutz Nir Oz. The bodies of Chen, Neutra, Weinstein Haggai and Haggai were kidnapped by the terror group and taken to Gaza. IDF soldier Edan Alexander, who was born in New Jersey, North Carolina-born retiree Keith Siegel, and son of American immigrants Sagui Dekel-Chen are all believed to still be alive, and remain in Hamas captivity.

After Houthi attacks, will Israel directly strike Iran?	Israel may wait until President-elect Donald Trump returns to office before launching a strike on Iranian soil. By World Israel News Staff Israel is weighing the option of directly attacking Iran, after two Houthi ballistic missile strikes in central Israel. While the Houthis are based in Yemen, they are a proxy group of Iran that is supported logistically and financially by Tehran. The hypersonic missiles used by the Houthis last week appear to feature advanced technology for evading detection and interception, which was almost certainly provided by Iran. According to Hebrew-language media reports, Mossad head Dedi Barnea is urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to directly strike Iran as a response to the Houthi attacks. Notably, a series of Israeli strikes on Houthi-controlled ports and oil infrastructure in Yemen last week failed to deter the terror group from attacking Israel. According to Channel 12 News, Tehran is gearing up for an Israeli strike on its soil. The ceasefire with Hezbollah, previous Israeli strike that reportedly destroyed much of Iran's air defenses, and weakening of Shia militia groups in Syria following the ouster of the Assad regime are all factors stoking Iranian concern that an Israeli attack is imminent. Some analysts have speculated that Netanyahu may wait until president-elect Donald Trump returns to office on January 20th before launching a direct attack on Iran. Maj. Gen. (res.) Yaakov Amidror, a former National Security Advisor of Israel, told Radio103 FM that Israel should focus on attacking Iran, rather than 'wasting resources' on striking the Houthis. 'We need to give high priority to Iran. The damage the Yemenis are doing to us is really not that significant,' Amidror said. 'A country has to choose its wars, and we have a much more important war against Iran,' he added. Amidror said the poverty and lack of infrastructure in Yemen, which has been ravaged by a nearly-decade long war between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis which killed an estimated 400,000 Yemenis, created a unique challenge for Israel. Because the Houthis are already accustomed to 'difficult conditions,' Amirdor said, attacks on their civilian infrastructure are far less effective than in a developed country.

Hamas admits IDF neutralized most of its military capabilities	IDF Arabic Spokesman: 'The East Jabalia Battalion has collapsed,' adding that any claims otherwise are false boasts by Hamas.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hamas officials admitted to Saudi newspaper A-Sharq Al-Awsat that the IDF has neutralized most of its military capabilities, and absent concrete leadership, groups of terrorists are making their own decisions on the ground. Although terrorists try to inform higher-level Hamas officials of their activities, communication is slow and can often take days or weeks. Among the surviving Hamas leadership are Mohammed Sinwar, the brother of Yahya Sinwar, who is reportedly leading the military wing; Izz ad-Din al-Haddad, responsible for overseeing terrorist activities in northern Gaza; Mohammed Shabana, former commander of the now-dismantled Rafah Brigade; and Tawfiq Abu Naim, head of Hamas' internal security forces. However, Hamas's rhetoric would seem to belie the chaos, and the IDF's Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee said the terror group is making vain boasts to give the impression that it is still functioning. 'Hamas and its minions are spreading news and rumors about fake heroic acts and operations in Jabalia, including claims about the use of knives and explosive belts, to boost the morale of their collapsing members. Don't believe these rumors and lies from the defeated,' Adraee stated. In another post on X, he declared that 'The East Jabalia Battalion has collapsed,' adding that any claims otherwise are false boasts by Hamas. The IDF has destroyed much of Hamas's military infrastructure in Gaza, and the elimination of key figures in the terror organization also prevented them from replenishing supplies. Hamas is releasing videos implying they are still functioning militarily, with one showing a drone fired from Khan Younis that was intercepted in the Negev and another of five terrorists planting explosive devices in shafts. During a situational assessment in Rafah on Wednesday, IDF Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said continued military operations will pressure Hamas to return the 100 hostages remaining in Gaza and create the optimal security situation to allow residents of border communities to return home. 'We are dismantling Hamas and targeting its infrastructure and forces to ensure that there will never be another October 7,' Halevi said. 'We are applying daily pressure on Hamas, driving it into greater distress, to secure the return of the 100 hostages—hopefully alive—and for those who are not, to give them a proper burial in Israel.'

Wizz Air returns as major airlines extend Israel flight ban	The Knesset’s Economic Affairs Committee is also working to amend consumer protection laws regarding flight cancellation compensation. By Jewish Breaking News Major airlines are continuing their flight freeze to Israel despite intense pressure from top aviation officials, while a handful of smaller European carriers trickle back to limited routes. The slow return of international flights has frustrated Israeli aviation officials, who have watched most major carriers extend their cancellations after a northern cease-fire took effect three weeks ago. Among U.S. carriers, American Airlines has pushed back service until September 2025, while United Airlines has scrubbed Israel completely from its schedule. Delta Air Lines and Air Canada have suspended flights through March. Wizz Air represents one of the few bright spots, announcing a restart of service last week between Tel Aviv and Larnaca with four weekly flights. The Hungarian budget carrier is offering promotional fares of 50 euros for the first 1,000 tickets on the route. However, it marks a dramatic reduction from Wizz Air’s pre-war service, which included flights to Milan, Warsaw, Vienna, Budapest, and London. As for other European airlines, only three have returned to Israeli skies. LOT Polish Airlines is operating daily flights to Warsaw with potential future expansion. Air Europa has restored Madrid connections, while Aegean Airlines is serving Athens and Larnaca routes. Meanwhile, the exodus of carriers continues to grow. Air France has suspended service through January 9, while the entire Lufthansa Group – including Swiss, Austrian, Brussels Airlines, and Eurowings – won’t return until February. Rome-based ITA Airways is also holding off until February. Budget giants Ryanair and EasyJet have announced they won’t consider returning until April at the earliest, while British Airways has canceled through March. Israel’s Transportation Ministry and Civil Aviation Authority are continuing to press carriers to resume service, but obviously with limited success. 'This is a very slow and gradual, if not disappointing, return,' a senior Israeli aviation official tells Haaretz. 'Every event that takes place is an additional warning sign for the airlines. They aren’t in any hurry to announce their return to Israel; as far as they’re concerned, the war isn’t over even if the northern front is quiet.' The Knesset’s Economic Affairs Committee is also working to amend consumer protection laws regarding flight cancellation compensation. However, ongoing concerns about insurance costs, risk management, and crew accommodations in Israel continue to deter carriers from committing to resumed service.

Inside Israel’s next gen fight to save its heroes	Surgical robots are proving their worth at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, where Medtronic’s robotic guidance system removed a bullet lodged in a soldier’s sacrum in just 90 minutes, preventing paralysis and lead poisoning. By Jewish Breaking News Israel’s defensive war in Gaza has been devastating, with 818 soldiers dead, 12,000 in rehabilitation, 40% with limb trauma, and a third of troops battling psychological wounds. But inside Israel’s hospitals, a quiet revolution in combat medicine is taking shape. Designed for amputees haunted by phantom pain, Israeli startup 6Degrees has developed the MyMove system, now employed at Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan. Patients wear lightweight bands and VR headsets, engaging with games where virtual versions of their lost limbs move naturally. Clinical trials show 88% of users report significant pain relief. For IDF soldier Aaron Bours, who lost over three inches of bone in his right leg while attempting to rescue his commanding officer, MyMove has been a game-changer. 'I broke a sweat like I hadn’t done in many months. It’s fun, so the results are that much better,' Bours tells the New York Post. 'We’re a survivalist nation. We have to be because otherwise we’d die.' At Sheba’s 3D Center, surgeons used a precisely designed skull model to reconstruct IDF officer Omri Rosenblit’s facial structure after he was severely injured when a building collapsed on him in Khan Yunis. The technology even helped restore his vision. In another remarkable case, a 3D-printed implant helped reconstruct a shattered IDF canine’s skull. Surgical robots are proving their worth at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, where Medtronic’s robotic guidance system removed a bullet lodged in a soldier’s sacrum in just 90 minutes, preventing paralysis and lead poisoning. Meanwhile, Aidoc’s AI-powered medical imaging system is transforming emergency response, demonstrated dramatically when it helped save a 23-year-old Nova massacre survivor by mapping a bullet’s path through her brain in seconds. The psychological toll of war has spurred equally innovative mental health solutions. GenAI-powered platform LIV at Sheba helps overwhelmed psychiatrists by conducting initial patient interviews and gathering clinical data. By the time patients meet with a psychiatrist, LIV’s detailed summaries allow doctors to focus on decision-making rather than lengthy intake sessions. At Tel Aviv University, researchers have developed a self-guided version of trauma intervention, backed by Microsoft Israel R&D engineers. Based on EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), the technology is designed to prevent PTSD from developing after a traumatic event. Even battlefield medicine has seen dramatic advances. Magen David Adom has helped IDF become the first military in the world to implement whole blood transfusions in combat zones, achieving a 93% survival rate for massive trauma cases. New chip-bearing dog tags enable medics to track treatment details from battlefield to hospital bed. Perhaps most surprising is the rise of unconventional treatments like NexoBrid, which uses pineapple stem enzymes to remove dead tissue from severe burns. Recently FDA-approved for pediatric use, the U.S. Department of Defense has invested $15 million in this groundbreaking technology for Israel’s wounded soldiers.

Haifa Airport takes off again after months-long war closure	Beginning January 2, the airline will expand its network with five weekly flights to Athens. By Pesach Benson, TPS After months of being closed by war, Haifa International Airport resumed domestic and international flights on Sunday. 'The return to operations of Haifa Airport is another step back to routine and growth, and to strengthening the northern region,' said Transportation Minister Miri Regev. 'This is a historic moment for Israeli aviation: After 30 years, a new Israeli airline is joining, connecting North to South in the spirit of the ‘Connecting Israel’ vision.' The newly established airline, Air Haifa, inaugurated its services with a maiden flight to Eilat, followed by its first international flight to Larnaca, Cyprus, later in the day. Beginning January 2, the airline will expand its network with five weekly flights to Athens. 'We are very excited to launch operations from Haifa Airport. During this period, it is especially important to strengthen the region and provide the residents of the north with aviation services that they have been waiting for for many years,' said Air Haifa CEO Gonen Ussishkin. The Airports Authority recently completed extensive upgrades to Haifa Airport’s infrastructure, with investments totaling tens of millions of shekels. Renovations included a comprehensive overhaul of the now 1,300-meter runway to meet international safety standards, the installation of biometric screening stations, and enhancements to the passenger terminal. To further improve access, the Transportation Ministry launched a direct 15-minute shuttle service connecting the airport to Israel Railways, the metro, the Haifa cable car, and a planned scenic light rail line to Nazareth. 'The past year was not easy,' said Airports Authority Sharon Kedmi. 'Haifa Airport was forced to suspend its operations for a while. The airport’s return to operations proves once again the resilience of the northern region and its ability to develop and grow, despite all the challenges. I am confident that Air Haifa will lead us to a future in which Haifa will be a significant aviation hub, connecting us all to the wider world and to economic and social prosperity.'

Syria’s new rulers name HTS commander as defense minister	Earlier on Saturday, the ruling General Command named Asaad Hassan al-Shibani as foreign minister, SANA said. By Reuters and The Algemeiner Syria’s new rulers have appointed Murhaf Abu Qasra, a leading figure in the insurgency which toppled Bashar al-Assad, as defense minister in the interim government, an official source said on Saturday. Abu Qasra, who is also known by the nom de guerre Abu Hassan 600, is a senior figure in the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group which led the campaign that ousted Assad this month. He led numerous military operations during Syria’s revolution, the source said. Syria’s de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa discussed 'the form of the military institution in the new Syria' during a meeting with armed factions on Saturday, state news agency SANA reported. Abu Qasra during the meeting sat next to Sharaa, also known by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, photos published by SANA showed. Prime Minister Mohammed al-Bashir said this week that the defense ministry would be restructured using former rebel factions and officers who defected from Assad’s army. Bashir, who formerly led an HTS-affiliated administration in the northwestern province of Idlib, has said he will lead a three-month transitional government. The new administration has not declared plans for what will happen after that. Earlier on Saturday, the ruling General Command named Asaad Hassan al-Shibani as foreign minister, SANA said. A source in the new administration told Reuters that this step 'comes in response to the aspirations of the Syrian people to establish international relations that bring peace and stability.' Shibani, a 37-year-old graduate of Damascus University, previously led the political department of the rebels’ Idlib government, the General Command said. Sharaa’s group was part of al Qaeda until he broke ties in 2016. It had been confined to Idlib for years until going on the offensive in late November, sweeping through the cities of western Syria and into Damascus as the army melted away. Sharaa has met with a number of international envoys this week. He has said his primary focus is on reconstruction and achieving economic development and that he is not interested in engaging in any new conflicts. Syrian rebels seized control of Damascus on Dec. 8, forcing Assad to flee after more than 13 years of civil war and ending his family’s decades-long rule. Washington designated Sharaa a terrorist in 2013, saying al Qaeda in Iraq had tasked him with overthrowing Assad’s rule and establishing Islamic sharia law in Syria. US officials said on Friday that Washington would remove a $10 million bounty on his head. The war has killed hundreds of thousands of people, caused one of the biggest refugee crises of modern times and left cities bombed to rubble and the economy hollowed out by global sanctions.

Wreckage of Israeli chopper downed in Yom Kippur War found in Syr...	The families of the six victims of the April 27, 1974, crash were notified, Israel’s Channel 12 News reported on Sunday. By JNS Israeli forces in Syria have found the wreckage of an Israeli Air Force helicopter which crashed during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. The remains of the helicopter, which went down due to bad weather conditions during a rescue mission, were uncovered last week on the Syrian side of Mount Hermon. The wreckage was returned to Israel on Saturday, and the families of the six victims of the April 27, 1974, crash were notified, Israel’s Channel 12 News reported on Sunday. Israeli forces took up defensive positions on the Syrian side of Mount Hermon shortly after Syrian President Bashar Assad was ousted by rebels on Oct. 8. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Israel will remain on the Syrian side of the strategic plateau until another arrangement can be found. Israeli officials have described the move as limited and temporary, with the aim of ensuring the security of Israel’s border area. &#xfe0f;CLOSING A CIRCLE IN SYRIA - 50 YEARS LATER: On April 27, 1974, an IAF Super Frelon helicopter was scrambled to evacuate wounded IDF Paratroopers who had been struck by Syrian shellfire on Mount Hermon (the Syrian side).

Iran in midst of energy crisis, despite wealth of gas, crude	Iran needs about 350 million cubic meters of natural gas a day to function, and with overnight winter temperatures in the 30s and 40s Fahrenheit, demand has spiked. By David Isaac, JNS For much of last week, Iran was 'virtually shut down' to conserve energy, with the nation’s leaders offering no solution other than to say sorry, The New York Times reported on Dec. 21. 'We must apologize to the people that we are in a situation where they have to bear the brunt,' Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a live televised address this month. 'We are facing very dire imbalances in gas, electricity, energy, water, money and environment. All of them are at a level that could turn into a crisis,' he said. Power outages started during a heat wave in August and now have become a full-blown crisis. Government offices are shuttered or operating on reduced hours, schools are online-only and factories have lost power, 'bringing manufacturing to a near halt,' the Times reported. This, despite the fact that Iran is awash in natural gas and crude oil. (It ranks second in the world in natural gas reserves and fourth in oil reserves.) Seventy percent of Iran’s energy comes from natural gas, with 90% of Iranians relying on gas for heating and cooking. Most Iranian power plants run on natural gas. Iran needs about 350 million cubic meters of natural gas a day to function. With overnight winter temperatures in the 30s and 40s Fahrenheit, demand has spiked. The government was faced with either cutting gas service to homes, or shutting down power to electric generation plants. The former would cut heat to residents during the cold winter months, so the government chose the latter. 'The policy of the government is to prevent at all costs cutting gas and heat to homes,' Seyed Hamid Hosseini, a member of the Chamber of Commerce’s energy committee, told the Times. 'They are scrambling to manage the crisis and contain the damage because this is like a powder keg that can explode and create unrest across the country.' Seventeen power plants had been taken offline by Dec. 20. The rest are operating on a partial basis. Tavanir, the state power company, said widespread power cuts could last days or weeks. Mehdi Bostanchi, head of the country’s Coordination Council of Industries, told the Times that the situation was catastrophic and industries had never experienced anything like it. He estimated last week’s power cuts could cut manufacturing in Iran by 30% to 50%, amounting to tens of billions of dollars. Smaller and medium factories were hit the hardest, he said. Sanctions, mismanagement, aging infrastructure and wasteful consumption were reasons cited by the Times for the power crisis. It also listed targeted attacks by Israel, noting Israel’s destruction of two Iranian gas pipelines in February. Iranians mainly blame the government. 'The Islamic Republic has set us back centuries and ruined our lives,' said one citizen quoted by Iranian International, an anti-government, London-based news outlet, on Nov. 20. Corruption, mismanagement and foreign wars According to the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (FDD), a Washington-based think tank, 'The people know the real cause is the regime’s unending corruption, mismanagement and foreign wars. Thus, the overwhelming majority blames [Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei and his lieutenants.' Iran simply doesn’t produce enough electricity, FDD noted, saying consumption peaks at 17,500 megawatts above production, 'a shortfall equivalent to more than eight Hoover Dams.' The Islamic regime is blaming everyone but itself, sparking further anger among the population. Pezeshkian claimed the blackouts are due to his decision to ban mazut, a type of low-cost fuel used in the Soviet-era, which is highly polluting. But his ban affects only three out of 16 plants that burn the substance. 'Nor does he explain why taking three plants offline would cause such shortages, as Iran has 140 other major power plants,' FDD said. In any case, the government reversed its partial ban on the fuel in a Nov. 17 decision, 'authorizing provinces to use mazut in all power plants and industries,' Iranian International reported. The government also has accused the population of wasteful energy use, sparking even more anger among average Iranians. In November, Mohammad-Jafar Ghaempanah, Pezeshkian’s executive deputy, blamed the public for the shortages and the mazut burning. In September, Vahid Yaminpour, a state television presenter and secretary of the Supreme Council of Youth, called the power cuts a 'positive event' that strengthens the family foundation, Iranian International reported. 'In Lebanon, even in non-war conditions, many people have about four hours of state electricity,' Yaminpour said. 'Be grateful and don’t complain.' His comments met with widespread criticism. Hassanali Taghizadeh, chairman of the Iran Electrical Industry Syndicate, rejected the assertion that domestic use was disproportionately high, saying, 'Don’t blame the people.' One critic said: 'There are donation boxes all over the cities to help the people of Gaza and Lebanon, while the officials of the Islamic Republic don’t care about the Iranian people at all.' Another pointed out that unlike Lebanon, Iran is energy-rich. A third said Iranian officials are unable to provide for their own people and only know how to launch missiles.

Kurds to Netanyahu and Trump: The clock is ticking	Despite decades of oppression, the Kurds have emerged as a vital democratic force in one of the world’s most volatile regions. By Linda Sadacka, Exclusive to World Israel News The Kurdish people, a nation of 45-50 million spread across Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey, have long been stateless. As indigenous people of the Middle East, their struggle for autonomy is rooted in their history, culture, and values. Despite decades of oppression, the Kurds have emerged as a vital democratic force in one of the world’s most volatile regions. Today, a senior Kurdish policy adviser, speaking directly to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, warns: The clock is ticking. The recent upheaval in Syria, marked by the ousting of President Bashar al-Assad and the subsequent power vacuum, has intensified the challenges faced by the Kurdish population. With various factions vying for control and Turkey escalating its aggression, urgent action is needed to prevent further chaos and ensure regional stability. Who are the Kurds? The Kurds are an indigenous people who have lived in the Middle East for thousands of years. Despite their rich culture and contributions to the region, they have been denied statehood since the Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1920 divided their homeland into four parts. This division subjected them to systemic oppression in all four countries, including bans on their language, culture, and political rights. In Syria, the Kurds have established self-governance structures in the northeast, emphasizing inclusivity, gender equality, and secularism. However, these achievements are under threat as Turkey increases military operations, targeting Kurdish civilians and infrastructure. Turkey’s recent offensives, coupled with its support for extremist factions, further destabilize an already volatile region. The current crisis in Syria The ousting of Bashar al-Assad has created a dangerous power vacuum in Syria, leaving the Kurds and other minorities vulnerable. Kurdish regions, which account for 30–35% of Syrian land and 90% of its resources, are critical to the region’s stability. Turkey’s President Erdogan, using NATO resources, continues to launch airstrikes and drone attacks on Kurdish regions. These attacks aim to suppress Kurdish autonomy and undermine their role as a buffer against jihadist groups and the Iranian regime. The Kurds have also been excluded from international discussions about Syria’s future, further marginalizing their contributions to peace and security. Sash, the senior Kurdish adviser, warns: 'Erdogan’s unchecked aggression will lead to catastrophic humanitarian and security crises. If we do not act now, jihadist forces will grow stronger, threatening Israel and the West.' The Kurds, who played a pivotal role in defeating ISIS, now face renewed threats from both jihadists and regional powers. The international community, particularly the United States and Israel, must act to prevent the resurgence of extremism and ensure Kurdish representation in determining Syria’s future. Sen. John Kennedy’s warning to Erdogan As global leaders deliberate on the unfolding crisis, Sen. John Kennedy issued a stern warning to Erdogan this morning: 'Leave the Kurds alone… the Kurds are America’s friends. The people most responsible for destroying ISIS caliphate were the Kurds. We lost less than 20 American lives; our Kurdish friends lost more than 10,000 fighting alongside us. Over 30,000 Kurds were wounded. Without the Kurds, ISIS would still be there.' Kennedy went on to emphasize the alliance between Turkey and NATO, questioning Turkey’s commitment: 'Turkey is supposed to be our friend, Turkey is a member of NATO. Lately, they haven’t been acting like our friend.' He directly addressed Erdogan’s intentions: 'Erdogan, because of his hatred for the Kurds, is going to attack them… Kurds live very peacefully in northeast Syria. Don’t do it. Leave the Kurds alone.' Kennedy concluded with a stark promise: 'If you invade Syria and touch a hair on the head of the Kurds, I’m going to ask this Congress to do something, and our sanctions are not going to help the economy of Turkey. Leave the Kurds alone!' This statement underscores the gravity of the situation and serves as a reminder of the moral and strategic imperative to stand with the Kurds. A critical message for Trump and Netanyahu Speaking under the pseudonym 'Sash' for personal safety, the Kurdish adviser emphasizes the urgency of the moment: • To President Trump: 'President Trump, the Kurdish people have stood as a bulwark against ISIS and extremism in the Middle East. With your support, we defeated ISIS, prevented Iran from gaining more ground, and safeguarded resources in Northeast Syria. But Erdogan’s aggression threatens to undo these achievements. 'We urge you to pressure NATO to stop Turkish airstrikes and drones targeting Kurdish civilians. Force Erdogan to stay within his borders and prevent further destabilization. Recognize Kurdish autonomy and support our democratic values. This is not just a Kurdish victory—it is an American victory for global security.' • To Prime Minister Netanyahu: 'Prime Minister Netanyahu, Erdogan has shown his alignment with Hamas and openly threatens Israel’s sovereignty. During the October 7 terror attacks, Erdogan stood with Hamas, even threatening Jerusalem. His support for jihadist forces in Syria is a direct threat to Israel’s security. 'Kurds and Jews share a unique bond as indigenous peoples of the Middle East. We have never joined the antisemitic campaigns of the region and have stood as natural allies to Israel. It is time for Israel to take a clear stand against Erdogan’s aggression and support Kurdish statehood. Together, we can stabilize the region and counter the rise of extremism.' Why the Kurds matter The Kurds have proven themselves to be invaluable allies to Israel and the West: 1. Democratic values: Kurdish regions are governed by secular principles, with women holding 50% of leadership roles. 2. Defenders against extremism: Kurdish forces were instrumental in defeating ISIS and continue to act as a buffer against Iranian influence and jihadist groups. 3. Natural allies: Kurds and Israelis share historical bonds as two stateless peoples in the Middle East who prioritize peace and democracy. The Kurds' call to action The Kurds are asking for immediate international support: 1. Pressure Turkey to halt attacks: Stop Erdogan’s airstrikes and drones targeting Kurdish civilians. 2. Provide defensive support: Equip Kurdish forces with defense systems to protect their people. 3. Recognize Kurdish aAutonomy: Advocate for Kurdish statehood as a stabilizing force in the Middle East. Sash concludes: 'Helping the Kurds today is not just about justice for our people. It is about securing peace and democracy for the future. Today, the threat is on us. Tomorrow, it could be you.' The recent developments in Syria present both challenges and opportunities. Kurdish contributions to global security and their shared values with Israel and the U.S. make their cause a priority for both Trump and Netanyahu. Supporting the Kurds is not only a moral imperative but also a strategic necessity to counter growing extremism and ensure stability in the Middle East. Now is the time for decisive action. The clock is ticking.

Hostage deal talks 90% complete, says Palestinian official	Israel and Hamas have made significant progress towards a ceasefire and hostage deal, says a senior Palestinian official, though several key points remain unresolved, including Israeli control of Egypt-Gaza border. By World Israel News Staff Negotiations in Doha, Qatar aimed at reaching a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and a hostage deal are 90% complete, according to a senior Palestinian official who spoke with the BBC. The official, who is involved in the talks, said that several issues remain unresolved, but added that once they are bridged, a deal could be reached within a matter of days. The top issue yet to be resolved is control of the Philadelphi Corridor, which runs along the frontier between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. Israel has insisted the IDF retain control over the strategic area, while Hamas has demanded that Israel withdraw from the corridor. The talks have included a proposal for a demilitarized buffer zone several kilometers wide along the Israel-Gaza border. Since Israeli forces entered the Gaza Strip after October 7th, the IDF has cleared out buildings near the Israeli frontier for a potential buffer zone. According to the official, during the first phase of a three-stage ceasefire, Hamas would release female soldiers, with Israel freeing 20 jailed terrorists in exchange for each of the five female soldiers. As part of the deal now under consideration, the official said, Israel would permit the large-scale return of Gazans to the northern Strip, under the oversight of Egypt and Qatar, with some 500 trucks entering the Gaza Strip daily to deliver international aid. In the third stage of the ceasefire, the war between Israel and Hamas would be terminated and the Gaza Strip handed over to a committee of non-partisan technocrats endorsed by various Palestinian factions including Hamas and Fatah. According to a report Sunday by the Egyptian outlet Al-Ghad, Israel is pushing for the release of 11 men during the first stage of a ceasefire. That would bring the number of hostages to be released in the first stage to a total of 34, or more than half of the remaining hostages who have not been confirmed as dying in captivity. Hamas is reportedly demanding 'special consideration' from Israel in selecting additional jailed terrorists to be freed in exchange for the release of the male hostages.

Pope Francis accuses Israel of ‘cruelty’ and slaughtering childre...	Israel's foreign ministry blasts pontiff's accusations against Israel, calling his attacks a 'double standard' against the Jewish state. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Pope Francis accused Israel twice over the weekend of 'cruelty' in the Gaza Strip, and claimed Israeli forces were 'machine-gunning' Arab children in the coastal enclave. On Saturday, Pope Francis gave his annual Christmas address to Vatican department chiefs, during which he condemned an Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip which the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry claimed killed 25 people. 'Yesterday, children were bombed,' Pope Francis said. 'This is cruelty. This is not war. I wanted to say this because it touches the heart.' A day earlier, Israeli Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli (Likud) ripped the pontiff over a quote attributed to him in a recently published book in which he appeared to accuse Israel of genocide in the Gaza Strip. Last month, Pope Francis issued a clarification regarding his comments, published recently in Hernán Reyes Alcaide’s new book, Hope Never Disappoints. Pilgrims Towards a Better World, in which he called for an investigation into allegations of genocide in Gaza. 'According to some experts, what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide,' Pope Francis was quoted as saying. 'We should investigate carefully to determine whether it fits into the technical definition formulated by jurists and international bodies.' Following a wave of criticism, Pope Francis said that Alcaide had taken his comments out of context. The pontiff rekindled the firestorm on Saturday, however, with his fresh allegations against Israel, drawing a sharp retort from the Israeli Foreign Ministry. 'Cruelty is terrorists hiding behind children while trying to murder Israeli children; cruelty is holding 100 hostages for 442 days, including a baby and children, by terrorists and abusing them,' the ministry tweeted. 'Unfortunately, the Pope has chosen to ignore all of this, as well as the fact that Israel’s actions have targeted terrorists who used children as human shields.' The ministry called the Pope's comments 'disappointing' and 'disconnected,' and accused the pontiff of 'singling out' Israel. 'The blame should be directed solely at the terrorists, not at the democracy defending itself against them. Enough with the double standards and the singling out of the Jewish state and its people.' On Sunday, however, the Pope doubled down on his comments, again accusing Israel of 'cruelty' in the Gaza Strip, and intimating that the IDF is intentionally massacring Gazan children. 'And with pain I think of Gaza, of so much cruelty, of the children being machine-gunned, of the bombings of schools and hospitals. What cruelty,' Pope Francis said after the weekly Angelus prayer.

Israel will ‘crush Hezbollah’ if terror group breaks ceasefire – ...	Israeli defense minister vows to 'crush Hezbollah's head' if the terror group fails to withdraw from southern Lebanon or tries to attack Israel in violation of ceasefire. By World Israel News Staff Israel's defense chief vowed Sunday that the IDF would respond harshly if the Iranian-backed Lebanese terror group Hezbollah attempts to attack Israel, or refuses to withdraw from southern Lebanon as required by the ceasefire agreement. Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) visited Israeli troops deployed to southern Lebanon on Sunday, and was accompanied by the commander of Division 91, Brigadier General Shai Kalfer, as Israel's top brass prepares security arrangements for the gradual withdrawal of IDF forces from Lebanese territory. Katz held a situational assessment during his visit with division commander Colonel Or Volozhinsky, along with the commanders of Battalion 13 and Battalion 605. On November 27th, the Israeli security cabinet signed a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah, brokered by the U.S. and France, under which Hezbollah agreed to withdraw from the Israeli frontier and move north of the Litani River, in exchange for a gradual withdrawal of IDF forces from Lebanon over a 60-day period. During his visit, Katz said that Israeli forces had devastated Hezbollah, and pledged that if the terror group violates the ceasefire or continues to operate along the Israeli border, the IDF will 'crush' the Shi'ite terror organization. 'We have hit Hezbollah with unprecedented strength. We have defanged the snake, and if Hezbollah does not withdraw beyond the Litani River, or if it attempts to violate the ceasefire agreement, we will crush is head,' Katz warned. 'I came here to the IDF outpost, which overlooks the Shi’ite villages of Maroun al-Ras and Yaron, which posed a significant threat to the communities in the Galilee, to ensure from up close that the IDF's achievements in Lebanon are well-preserved.' 'We will not enable Hezbollah operatives to return to villages in southern Lebanon and re-establish terror infrastructure that threatens Israel's northern border, and we will ensure the IDF's ability to continue to fully enforce the reality on the ground.' 'We will ensure the removal of the threat and the restoration of security to allow the residents of the north to return safely to their homes.'

Samaritan Ten Commandments tablet sells for $5M	The tablet presents a distinctive version of the Ten Commandments, notably omitting the commandment not to take the Lord’s name in vain and including a directive to worship at Mount Gerizim. By JNS A stone tablet bearing the biblical Ten Commandments, which Sotheby’s auction house has declared the oldest known example of its kind, was sold on Wednesday for $5 million at auction. The anonymous buyer has announced intentions to donate the artifact to an Israeli institution. Sotheby’s dates the tablet to approximately 1,500 years ago, during the late Roman-Byzantine era. The artifact, weighing approximately 115 pounds and extending 24 inches in length, features the Ten Commandments carved in ancient Hebrew script. Jacob Kaplan, who discovered the tablet in 1943, reported that it was initially found in 1913 during railroad construction along Israel’s southern coastline. According to Kaplan, the stone had been repurposed as flooring in a residence, with its inscribed surface facing upward. Kaplan, who passed away in 1989, documented his findings in a scientific journal in 1947. The artifact’s ownership history includes several transfers: It passed to an Israeli antiquities dealer in 1995, then to Brooklyn’s Living Torah Museum, before being acquired by collector Mitchell S. Kapel in 2016 for $850,000. Kapel sold the tablet on Wednesday at Sotheby’s New York. The tablet presents a distinctive version of the Ten Commandments, notably omitting the commandment not to take the Lord’s name in vain and including a directive to worship at Mount Gerizim, a location revered by Samaritans in Judea and Samaria. The auction proceeded despite significant expert skepticism regarding the tablet’s authenticity. 'This region’s antiquities market is notorious for forgeries,' noted Brian E. Daniels, director of research and programs at Philadelphia’s Penn Cultural Heritage Center. However, he added, 'There remains the possibility that it is entirely authentic and represents a genuine historic discovery.' Christopher A. Rolston, who heads the Department of Classical and Near Eastern Languages and Cultures at George Washington University, challenged the dating assertion. 'Sotheby’s claim of the Samaritan Ten Commandments inscription being roughly 1,500 years old cannot be verified,' he told The New York Times. 'Without archaeological context or documented discovery, we can’t even confirm who originally found it.' Rolston further questioned the discovery narrative. 'The absence of any 1913 documentation is problematic, particularly since forgers and antiquities dealers commonly fabricate such origin stories to lend credibility to inscriptions. This could well be an invented narrative,' he said. Selby Kiffer, Sotheby’s senior specialist in books and manuscripts, emphasized the stone’s physical deterioration patterns as crucial dating evidence. He particularly noted the significance of the script style, explaining, 'The ancient Hebrew script provides crucial dating evidence, as we have clear historical records of when it ceased to be commonly used.' 'This exceptional price reflects the artifact’s unprecedented historical significance,' remarked Richard Austin, Sotheby’s worldwide head of books and manuscripts. 'To stand in the presence of this tablet is remarkable—it represents a tangible link to the shared foundations of faith and culture that continue to influence our world today.'

Jerusalem residents indicted for spying for Hezbollah during war	Salam is accused of sending photos from Caesarea, while Asili reportedly shared news articles about Israel and its security situation. By Pesach Benson, TPS Two Jerusalem residents were indicted on Sunday for providing information to Hezbollah during the recent war. According to the indictment, Abd al-Salam, 33, and Ta’ar Asili, 35, were in contact with a woman named Dania via a WhatsApp group. Despite realizing she was affiliated with Hezbollah, Salam and Asili continued to share information with her. Salam is accused of sending photos from Caesarea, while Asili reportedly shared news articles about Israel and its security situation. The defendants were also instructed to contact a senior Hezbollah intelligence operative known as 'Al-Hajj.' Asili allegedly purchased a new SIM card for this purpose but refused a request to photograph the Metula area. The indictment further accuses Al-Salam of being photographed with a weapon during a visit to Jenin, an area controlled by a local authority called 'Abu Harb.' He faces additional charges for attempting to carry a weapon without a permit. On Thursday, a Nazareth teen. Muhammad Saadi, 19 was charged with having repeated contact with the Lebanon-based terror group for several years and making several attempts to join its ranks. Saadi is also accused of communicating with Hezbollah’s television station, Al-Manar, providing photos and videos. When Hezbollah began launching daily rocket and drone attacks after Hamas’s October 7 attack, Saadi allegedly transmitted missile impact locations, aircraft movements, and the positioning of Israeli military units.

CAIR sues US State Department over ‘failing to evacuate American ...	CAIR claims that the State Department has run afoul of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, which 'guarantees equal protection for citizens and legal residents abroad under federal law.' By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner The Council for America-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a group that purports to advocate for Muslim Americans, filed a lawsuit against the U.S. State Department for 'failing to evacuate American citizens, American legal residents, and the family members of Americans trapped under Israeli bombardment in Gaza.' According to CAIR, the plaintiffs in the case have ' tried, for months, to exhaust non-legal means to escape Gaza.' 'Each plaintiff in the lawsuit is eligible to be evacuated but has been summarily ignored by the State Department and other Biden administration officials,' CAIR wrote in a statement. The organization claims that the State Department has been sluggish in extracting American citizens caught in the crossfires of the Israel-Hamas war. In contrast, CAIR contends that the agency has responded with more urgency to evacuate American citizens caught in previous conflicts. CAIR claims that the State Department has run afoul of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, which 'guarantees equal protection for citizens and legal residents abroad under federal law.' 'The law requires the U.S. government to protect Americans wherever they may be. With every passing day, the danger of our clients dying from Israeli bombardment or the starvation and disease now rampant in Gaza only goes up,' CAIR attorney Maria Kari said. 'The State Department must do the right thing and save these people from certain death.' The State Department has cited the closure of the Rafah Crossing as the reason for the slowed evacuations of Americans from Gaza. However, the plaintiffs have called for evacuations to be conducted from the Kerem Shalom crossing, arguing that evacuations have been carried out from this site in previous conflicts between Israel and the Hamas terrorist group. CAIR’s lawsuit against Israel was not its first time stepping into controversy. The organization’s co-founder and executive director, Nihad Awad, said in November that he was 'happy' to witness Hamas’ rampage across southern Israel on Oct. 7, when the Palestinian terrorist group invaded the Jewish state from neighboring Gaza, murdered 1,200 people, and kidnapped over 250 others as hostages. The massacre launched the ongoing war in Gaza, where Israel has been waging a military campaign aimed at dismantling Hamas and freeing the hostages. 'The people of Gaza only decided to break the siege — the walls of the concentration camp — on Oct. 7,' CAIR co-founder and executive director Nihad Awad said in a speech during the American Muslims for Palestine convention in Chicago last November. 'And yes, I was happy to see people breaking the siege and throwing down the shackles of their own land, and walk free into their land, which they were not allowed to walk in.' According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), 'some of CAIR’s current leadership had early connections with organizations that are or were affiliated with Hamas.' CAIR has disputed the accuracy of the ADL’s claim and asserted that it 'unequivocally condemn[s] all acts of terrorism, whether carried out by al-Qa’ida, the Real IRA, FARC, Hamas, ETA, or any other group designated by the US Department of State as a ‘Foreign Terrorist Organization.’' The post CAIR sues US State Department over ‘failing to evacuate American citizens’ from Gaza appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/cair-sues-us-state-department-over-failing-to-evacuate-american-citizens-from-gaza/	2024-12-22T03:38:31-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shutterstock_1446195485-scaled.jpg
IDF introduces new security measures to protect Gaza aid trucks	By utilizing alternative routes, as well as Gate 96 near Netzarim in northern Gaza, the IDF has created safer pathways for aid deliveries, decreasing exposure to looters. By Yaakov Lappin, JNS The Israel Defense Forces has in recent days introduced a new arrangement to boost security for the passage of humanitarian aid into Gaza, directing aid convoys on the first stage of their journey through Israeli-secured routes in the Strip. Over this period, 400 aid trucks entered the Gaza Strip in four convoys of 100 trucks each, following routes along the IDF-controlled Philadelphi Corridor and the Gaza-Israel border road. This initiative has markedly decreased hijackings by Hamas terrorists and criminal gangs, meaning that more aid is reaching Gazan civilians. Aid trucks entering Gaza have been highly vulnerable to armed looters, with drivers frequently being wounded in hijackings. Hamas and local criminal families frequently intercepted these convoys, seizing valuable supplies and reselling them on the black market at exorbitant prices. Armed and masked Palestinians on trucks loaded with humanitarian aid entering southern Gaza through the Kerem Shalom Crossing from Israel, April 3, 2024. Photo by Abed Rahim Khatib/Flash90. On the Gaza side of the Kerem Shalom Crossing in the southern part of the Strip on Thursday, trucks and forklift operators—the latter being Gazan employees—were busy loading and unloading goods that had passed a security screening. An IDF official explained: 'Hamas people, but also I would say … mafia clans, were coming until today with guns, with weapons, and looting and stealing these goods and reselling them to incredible prices on the market.' The scale of the problem was immense. By some estimates Hamas profited by as much as half a billion dollars. These funds enabled the group to bolster its military capabilities, including funding recruitment and recruiting new terrorists in northern Gaza. However, the new convoy system could form a partial solution. Trucks now travel under safer roads from Kerem Shalom to designated entry points into Gaza, minimizing opportunities for theft. Despite these improvements, challenges persist. At Kerem Shalom Crossing, large quantities of humanitarian aid remain stuck because a number of aid organizations have refused to send drivers into Gaza, citing safety concerns. 'Some of the drivers are injured,' an IDF source said on Thursday. That same day, the military got word of a driver who had been shot and wounded by looters. With over 800 trucks’ worth of supplies stranded at the crossing, the impasse underscores the ongoing risks faced by aid workers in Gaza. According to some reports, international aid organizations have even paid off looters to avoid attacks, particularly on shipments of essential goods such as medical supplies. Here is an inside look into the Gazan side of the Kerem Shalom Crossing with COL Abdullah, a commander at @cogatonline. pic.twitter.com/G2zztnfSqD &mdash; Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) December 20, 2024 Col. Abdullah Halabi, head of the IDF’s Coordination and Liaison Administration for Gaza, highlighted the comprehensive screening and monitoring procedures now in place. 'All of the humanitarian aid coming to Kerem Shalom has been inspected by the Israeli side, and we’re delivering them to the Gazan side from here,' he stated. Halabi also emphasized the IDF’s efforts to increase aid deliveries. In December alone, an average of 250 trucks per day entered Gaza, including 50 to the north and 200 to central and southern Gazan areas. By utilizing alternative routes, as well as Gate 96 near Netzarim in northern Gaza, the IDF has created safer pathways for aid deliveries, decreasing exposure to looters. 'We escort them from [the] Philadelphi Corridor until the Rashid Road [south of Gaza city] … then they succeed to take the cargo [via] another road,' said Halabi. The cargo goes to warehouses in Gaza operated by international aid organizations, and from there to the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, as well as to population centers in Deir el-Balah and Nuseirat in central Gaza, and other areas. Some aid groups, such as UNICEF, the World Central Kitchen, Save the Children and others have successfully coordinated with the IDF to deliver essential supplies. Others, like the U.N.’s World Food Program and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), have not succeeded, leaving vital aid unused for months. 'The main obstacle or the main challenge is the international community’s capabilities [for distribution],' said Halabi. 'When they will send more trucks, we will bring more trucks to Kerem Shalom.' The IDF has urged aid organizations to increase their efforts, offering additional infrastructure to expedite deliveries. However, the risk of violence remains a deterrent for many. The IDF has repeatedly stated its commitment to facilitating humanitarian aid for Gaza’s civilian population, despite ongoing hostilities. 'Israel has, first and before anything else, [an] interest … [to] facilitate what we call humanitarian assistance getting into the Gaza Strip,' an IDF officer explained. 'Every day, we push the organizations to bring more trucks,' said Halabi.

UN condemned Israel three times as much as the rest of the world ...	Nearly three-quarters of all United Nations General Assembly motions condemning a country or countries in 2024 were directed at Israel, watchdog group says. By World Israel News Staff The United Nations passed nearly three times as many resolutions condemning Israel this year as it did resolutions condemning any other country on earth, a watchdog group said last week. In a statement issued Thursday night, UN Watch released data on motions passed by the United Nations General Assembly in 2024 condemning one or more countries. The UN General Assembly rebuked Israel on Thursday in three separate resolutions, concluding the world body's 2024 activity with a total of 17 resolutions that single out the Jewish state, compared to a total of 6 regarding the rest of the world combined. Last Tuesday, the UNGA adopted one resolution each on the regimes of North Korea, Iran, Syria and Myanmar, and one on Russia's violations in Ukraine. In October, there was also one resolution condemning the U.S. for its embargo of Cuba. 'The UN’s latest assault on Israel with a torrent of one-sided resolutions is surreal,' said Hillel Neuer, Executive Director of UN Watch, an independent non-governmental organization based in Geneva. 'It's absurd that in the year 2024, out of a total of 23 UN General Assembly resolutions that criticize countries, 17 of them—nearly three quarters—were focused on a single country, Israel. Make no mistake, the purpose of the lopsided condemnations is to delegitimize Israel and to demonize and dehumanize Israelis,' continued Neuer. 'This demonization fuels the pro-Hamas agitators in America and around the world who today are targeting Jews with hate and violence on campus, at synagogues and community centers, and at their businesses.' While ignoring evidence that the UN's own relief agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, was complicit with the Hamas terror organization, the General Assembly voted last Thursday to back a resolution drafted by Norway's delegation, singling out Israel for the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip. The resolution was passed by a margin of 137 to 12, with 22 abstentions. The measure expressed support for UNRWA despite the agency's ties to Gaza terrorists, while 'welcoming' a July 2024 International Court of Justice advisory opinion which declared that 'Israel’s continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful.' The text made no mention of Hamas's looting of aid convoys as contributing to the humanitarian condition, UN Watch reported. 'We're not surprised to see Norway covering for terror-infested UNRWA,' said Neuer, 'given that the director of Norway's foreign ministry, Leni Stenseth, recently served as deputy chief of UNRWA, when she infamously visited Gaza and kowtowed before Hamas terror chief Yahya Sinwar.'

Germany refuses citizenship to migrant who denied Israel’s right ...	The Palestinian-born man had denied the Jewish state's right to exist, stating to authorities that 'There is no Israel.' By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A German court has ruled that a stateless Syrian could not become a citizen due to his anti-Israel views, according to court records publicized last week. The man, recognized as a refugee in 2016, had applied for naturalization in 2022 and passed a citizenship test. The Bavarian Office for the Protection of the Constitution had then raised doubts due to his regular attendance of a Salafist mosque and extremely anti-Israel statements, and he was asked in for an interview. Two months before Hamas’ invasion of Israel last year that sparked the ongoing war, he was asked forthrightly whether he recognized Israel as an independent state. His answer, according to the records, was, 'There is no Israel. There are Jews, but Israel is not a country.' When the official asked again, 'You do not recognize the international agreement to create the State of Israel?' he immediately replied, 'No.' He later asked to revise his answers, claiming that he hadn’t understood the questions or that his answers had been misinterpreted. He wrote that he had 'no problem with Jewish people,' that it was all right for Jews to live in Israel, and that 'I also recognize the State of Israel after the Oslo peace process.' His intention, he insisted, had only been to criticize Israel’s 'occupation' of Palestinian land. The Office rejected the correction on the basis that his new statement was made as a tactical move to gain naturalization, and an administrative court agreed, upholding the ban in March. The applicant appealed, stating that his rejection of Israel's right to exist was not motivated by anti-Semitism, but by anti-Zionism. The Regensburg court in Bavaria ruled on October 7 that his rejection showed 'deep-seated anti-Zionist antisemitism,' that his subsequent statements about accepting post-Oslo Israel were disingenuous, and that a new emendation to the country’s Citizenship Act made it clear that he could not be naturalized. The June emendation requires that prospective citizens declare a commitment to Germany's 'historical responsibility' for Nazi crimes and their consequences and to 'protect Jewish life,' as well as commit to democracy and the peaceful coexistence of peoples. The court ruled that a commitment to Israel’s right to exist is included in this general formulation, as Germany’s responsibility is 'inevitably' linked to Israel as a homeland and sanctuary for the Jewish people. 'To obtain a German passport, individuals must accept Germany's moral obligations, including the recognition of Israel's existence,' the judge wrote. In addition, even though the naturalization decision predated the emendation, German law had already held that anyone who was antisemitic could not truthfully declare that he was committed to the German democratic order.

Why can’t Israel shoot down Houthi missiles?	The Houthi missiles may feature technology including maneuverable warheads, which are designed to avoid detection and interception. By World Israel News Staff A hypersonic missile that struck a park in southern Tel Aviv over the weekend has left Israelis on edge; both from the attack itself, which wounded 16, and from the fact that the missile, which was launched from Yemen by the Houthis, was not intercepted by Israel's air defense systems. Last Thursday, another ballistic missile launched by the terror group struck an elementary school in Ramat Gan, completely destroying a building. While the IDF initially claimed that the missile had been intercepted and the damage was due to shrapnel, the extent of the destruction raised serious questions. While the IDF said it is still investigating that incident, early findings suggest that the missile may have been struck by an interceptor, which failed to destroy the missile's warhead. That intact warhead appears to have struck the school, causing massive damage. Some military experts have offered explanations as to why the missiles were able to evade Israeli interception. 'The Houthis made changes to the missiles, including reducing the explosive payloads and adding more fuel. If at the beginning of the war they mainly reached Eilat, then today they are suddenly reaching the Gush Dan [Tel Aviv] area,' former IDF Air Defense commander Brig.-Gen. (res.) Zvika Haimovich told Channel 12 News. 'The Houthis have become Iran's first line of attack,' Haimovich added.'They have taken on this role, and that is why we have seen the threat intensify since the beginning of the ceasefire [with Hezbollah]. The solution is to escalate our steps against the Houthis, and deal with Iran as the initiator of the aggression.' Other security sources have suggested that the missiles, which were likely designed and manufactured in Iran, have maneuverable warheads. Designed to avoid detection, this feature sees the warhead detach from the missile and change its trajectory towards the end of its flight, making it extremely difficult to intercept. Another, less likely theory, is that the missile was launched in a 'flattened' trajectory from an unexpected location, meaning that it was not picked up by American or Saudi Arabian radar systems in the region. In a statement, the IDF pledged to apply lessons learned from the failures in future interceptions.

Defeat the Houthis to reopen the Port of Eilat: Local leaders	Houthi attacks on Red Sea ships lead to shut down of Israel' southernmost port. By World Israel News Staff The Houthi terror group has escalated its attacks against the Jewish State in recent days, with two ballistic missiles striking central Israel on Thursday and Friday. As the political and military echelon discuss retaliatory measures to deter future attacks, local leaders from Eilat are warning that the failure to curb Houthi attacks on shipping lanes in the Red Sea has crippled one of the city's most critical sites. The Port of Eilat, which serves ships traveling to Israel via the Red Sea, 'is an important, significant and central asset, which directly and indirectly employs hundreds of workers,' Eilat Mayor Eli Lankri told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. For more than a year, Houthi attacks on both the port itself and ships traveling through the Bab al-Mandab Strait near Yemen have meant that virtually no ships are arriving at the Port of Eilat. Lankri said that for the last 14 months, the port has been virtually shuttered and that residents have endured sporadic missile and drone attacks. A decisive military victory over the Houthis is the only way to restore security to residents of Eilat and encourage shipping companies to once again use the port. 'Securing Eilat is not just an urban interest but a national interest. Eilat is the southern gateway to the State of Israel, and as such, it must be kept open and safe,' Lankri added. Moshe Azulai, chair of the labor union representing the Port of Eilat's workers, told Ynet>/em> that the port is 'effectively closed.' Azulai said that despite initially negotiating with management to keep employees, nearly all the port's workers are currently on unpaid leave. 'It's sad to see the port like this,' Azulai, a native of Eilat, said. 'We are doing everything we can, but there is a serious problem, because there is no work.' Since the outbreak of the October 7th war, the Houthis have fired hundreds of missiles and explosive drones at Israel. In July 2024, one explosive drone struck a building in Tel Aviv - some 200 meters away from the American consulate - and killed a Belarussian-Israeli man.

Israel planning future strikes on Houthis: Report	Israel is currently gearing up for an additional wave of strikes targeting the Houthis. By World Israel News Staff Israel is planning to carry out additional strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, after ballistic missiles launched by the terror group struck central Israel twice in recent days. Last week, a missile struck an elementary school in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan, destroying a building. The IAF launched retaliatory air strikes targeting three ports and oil facilities in Yemen several hours later, but the defiant Houthis pledged to keep up their attacks. Less than a day later, during the early hours of Saturday morning, the Houthis launched another hypersonic missile which evaded interception and struck a park in south Tel Aviv, wounding 16. On Saturday evening, a U.S.-led coalition attacked Houthi weapons depots and other strategic sites in Yemen. But according to reports, Israel is not confident that this will deter the Houthis from future attacks against the Jewish State. According to Hebrew-language outlet Kan News, Israel is currently gearing up for an additional wave of strikes on the Houthis. Jerusalem is also lobbying for other countries to support and even participate in the strikes, Kan News reported. The Houthis are the last Iranian proxy in the region that has not been significantly weakened by Israel in the ongoing war. Hezbollah and Hamas, which received funding and support from Iran, have both been crippled by the IDF sine the October 7th massacres. Shia-aligned militias in Syria have also significantly reduced their attacks against Israel, following the ouster of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad. The IAF previously struck Houthi targets in Yemen in July 2024, the day after an explosive drone launched by the terror group killed a Belarussian-Israeli man in Tel Aviv. Following a Houthi missile attack targeting Ben-Gurion Airport, Israel launched another wave of attacks on Houthi sites in September 2024.

Several hostage families receive evidence loved ones are alive	The report did not name the families contacted to protect their privacy and also did not indicate in what form this evidence was presented. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Several families of hostages have received evidence that their loved ones are still alive in Gaza, Channel 12 news reported Friday night. The report did not name the families contacted to protect their privacy and also did not indicate in what form this evidence was presented. Following months with little evidence that hostages are alive, Hamas released videos of Edan Alexander and Matan Zangauker last month, videos which appeared to have been taken recently. The families were also told that a hostage release deal could be reached within a week to ten days but cautioned that Hamas could create obstacles to this reality. The families were reportedly informed that the regional situation, American influence, the current status of the war, and other factors have created circumstances that increase the possibility of successful negotiations. However, the families were told that while conditions have improved, challenges remain, and efforts are ongoing with the hope of a breakthrough. Channel 12 reports that both sides agree on Palestinian prisoners who will be released in exchange for female, elderly, and sick hostages in the first phase of the deal. However, the point of contention was Israel's demand that prisoners who had murdered Israelis not be released to Judea and Samaria but should be made to go abroad. Lebanese outlet *Al-Akhbar* reported Thursday that, according to Hamas officials, 'The state of the negotiations underway in Doha is excellent, and most of the issues in dispute have been resolved, so it is possible that we will very soon have an agreement.' Israeli negotiators have been in talks with Hamas and American officials in Qatar since Monday, with CIA Director Bill Burns arriving on Wednesday. Saudi-owned *Asharq Al-Awsat* reported Wednesday that Hamas officials claimed an agreement was 'imminent' and could be signed by the end of the week. The London-based newspaper noted that, in the first of three stages, lasting 45-60 days, Hamas would release about 30 hostages, both alive and deceased.

US meets with terrorist who became Syrian leader, cancels $10 mil...	We haven’t committed any crimes that justify calling us a terrorist group,' al-Julani said in an interview with the BBC on Wednesday. By Andrew Bernard, JNS U.S. diplomats carried out their first visit to the Syrian capital of Damascus in more than a decade on Friday for meetings with the new government following the fall of longtime Syrian dictator Bashar Assad. Barbara Leaf, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, told reporters that she had informed Abu Mohammad al-Julani, leader of the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group that led Assad’s overthrow, that the United States would not pursue a $10 million terrorism bounty on him for his role as the head of a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist group. Julani, whose real name is Ahmad al-Sharaa, told Leaf that he 'committed' to not allowing terrorist groups to pose a threat within Syria or externally to the United States and its regional partners. 'Based on our discussion, I told him we would not be pursuing the Rewards for Justice reward offer that has been in effect for some years,' Leaf said. HTS emerged as a splinter organization from al-Qaeda’s Syria branch, the Nusrah Front, which was founded in 2012 as an extension of the Iraqi insurgency amid Syria’s burgeoning civil war. A Syrian national, Julani joined al-Qaeda in Iraq in 2003 shortly before the U.S. invasion and was arrested by American forces in 2006 and imprisoned for five years. The U.S. State Department first designated the Nusra Front as a terrorist organization in 2012 as an alias of al-Qaeda in Iraq and labeled HTS a terrorist group in 2018 following repeated splits, reorganizations and renamings. Julani has been a U.S. 'Specially Designated Global Terrorist' since 2013 and has been repeatedly accused of carrying out attacks on civilians. His group announced its official split from al-Qaeda in 2016, and in recent years, he has sought to portray himself and HTS as pragmatic and has argued that the group should be delisted as a terrorist organization. 'We haven’t committed any crimes that justify calling us a terrorist group,' Julani said in an interview with the BBC on Wednesday. 'Sanctions must be lifted, because they were targeted at the old regime. The victim and the oppressor should not be treated in the same way.' Leaf said on Friday that Washington was 'beginning a discussion with HTS.' 'If I’m sitting with the HTS leader and having a lengthy, detailed discussion about a whole series of interests of the U.S., interests of Syria, maybe interests of the region, suffice it to say it’s a little incoherent then to have a bounty on the guy’s head,' Leaf said. 'Otherwise, I should ask the FBI to come in and arrest him or something.' The meeting was the first public interaction between U.S. diplomats and Julani and the first U.S. diplomatic visit to Damascus since 2012, when Washington withdrew its diplomats when it cut off relations with the Assad regime. Leaf said she could not preview the lifting of any sanctions in Syria but that she expected the interim government to face internal pressure from the Syrian people to conform with the requirements for lifting sanctions under the U.S. Caesar Act and U.N. Security Council resolution 2254. The U.S. diplomats also sought information from the new Syrian government about the fate of Austin Tice, a U.S. citizen and freelance journalist who was kidnapped in Syria in 2012. Roger Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, said it has been difficult to find out what happened to Tice given the labyrinthine nature of Assad’s security infrastructure. 'I’ve been rather amazed at the amount of secret prisons that Assad seems to have amassed,' Carstens said, adding that the search for Tice might ultimately require examining as many as 40 prison sites. The U.S. diplomats did not mention any discussion of Israel’s presence in Syria, which has expanded following the fall of the Assad regime to include control of all of Mount Hermon and a buffer zone inside Syria along the border. Leaf, however, said that Washington has definite views about the roles of other regional powers inside Syria. 'Turkey obviously has a very sizable role, has sizable influence,' Leaf said. 'It has historically, and it’s a neighboring state, and it has national security interests and all sorts of other interests.' 'Iran will have no role whatsoever, and it shouldn’t,' she said. 'Iran’s had decades now of the most predatory and destructive behavior and presence in Syria and during the war itself mustered foreign militias, its own IRGC forces, Hezbollah fighters, and really preyed upon and really viciously brutalized the Syrian people.' 'It’s hard for me to imagine Iran having any role whatsoever,' she added. 'Why should it?'

Sweden ends UNRWA funding amid controversy over Hamas ties and Oc...	Knesset member Yulia Malinovsky, the sponsor of a bill to sever Israel’s ties with UNRWA, attributed Sweden’s decision to Israeli legislative efforts. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Sweden has officially ceased its financial support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA), Aid Minister Benjamin Dousa announced during an interview with TV4 on Friday. Dousa stated that Stockholm would redirect its humanitarian assistance to Gaza through alternative channels. This move comes amidst intensified scrutiny of UNRWA’s operations, particularly in the aftermath of Hamas’s October 7 attacks on Israel. 'UNRWA, whose personnel actively participated in the October 7 atrocities, whose facilities became terror hubs, and whose schools spread Hamas propaganda and incitement, has lost its legitimacy to exist,' Israeli Diaspora Minister Amichai Chikli said while commending Sweden’s decision on X (formerly Twitter). Knesset member Yulia Malinovsky, the sponsor of a bill to sever Israel’s ties with UNRWA, attributed Sweden’s decision to Israeli legislative efforts. 'When Israel takes decisive action, the world follows,' she claimed in a statement to The Press Service of Israel. 'Once the law passed, the world itself would stop funding this organization, and this is exactly what’s happening now.' Israel’s skepticism toward UNRWA has deepened over the past year. In February, Israeli forces discovered a Hamas complex beneath UNRWA’s Gaza City headquarters, raising alarms about the agency’s role in enabling terrorist activities. Further, Israel’s largest bank froze UNRWA’s accounts over suspicious financial activity. Israeli intelligence has implicated UNRWA staff in Hamas operations, including during the October 7 attacks, where more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and over 250 taken hostage. A recent internal UN investigation led to the termination of nine staff members, but Israeli officials criticized the probe as 'inadequate,' claiming the agency ignored evidence against at least 100 personnel. UNRWA was also ordered to vacate its Jerusalem offices in May over lease violations. UNRWA’s critics have also pointed to its unique mandate, which supports Palestinian refugees and their descendants—a stark contrast to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, which assists all other refugee populations globally. Sweden’s move aligns with a growing international trend of reevaluating UNRWA’s legitimacy. Earlier this year, Israel officially cut ties with the agency, and lawsuits have been filed against UNRWA, accusing it of aiding Hamas. Analysts suggest that UNRWA’s deeply embedded presence in Gaza—providing education, healthcare, and financial aid—has made it vulnerable to exploitation by militant groups. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015 and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Netanyahu: Strikes against Houthis are protecting entire world	Sixteen people were lightly wounded overnight on Friday when a ballistic missile fired by Houthis struck Tel Aviv's Jaffa neighborhood. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Following IDF strikes on Thursday against Houthi targets, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that the operations are not just protecting Israel, 'but the entire world.' 'They are not only attacking us,' Netanyahu said in a video statement. 'They are attacking the entire world. They are attacking international shipping and trade routes.' IAF planes struck the western coast and, for the first time, in the rebel-held capital Sana’a. 'When Israel acts against the Houthis, it acts for the entire international community,' Netanyahu said, adding Israel's allies 'understand this well.' The premiere noted that the Houthis were the last Iranian proxy left 'after Hamas, Hezbollah and the Assad regime in Syria.' He added the Houthis 'are learning and they will learn the hard way that anyone who attacks Israel pays a very heavy price.' Sixteen people were lightly wounded overnight on Friday when a ballistic missile, fired by Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists in Yemen, struck a residential area in Tel Aviv's Jaffa neighborhood at 3:44 a.m. The blast created a crater in a local playground. Magen David Adom paramedics treated at least 14 of the injured, mostly for cuts from glass shards caused by the explosion. The victims were evacuated to Wolfson Medical Center in Holon and Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov Hospital) in Tel Aviv. Additionally, 14 people were injured while heading to a protected area, and seven others suffered from anxiety. Millions of residents in the greater Tel Aviv area rushed to protected spaces after hearing air-raid sirens. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed that the missile hit following 'unsuccessful interception attempts.' The military was probing the circumstances of the attack. The IDF stated that only a partial interception of the missile launched from Yemen occurred, and the warhead likely exploded, causing damage to the school. The IAF and Home Front Command are conducting a more thorough investigation into the incident.

Topography, security, and survival highlight Israel’s Syrian stra...	The Golan Heights’ mountainous terrain provides critical surveillance points overlooking Damascus, Beirut, and Jerusalem, and from a security perspective, this topographical advantage is invaluable. By Jewish Breaking News Israel’s recent moves to establish a security buffer zone in Syria represent not just tactical necessity, but strategic wisdom in an increasingly volatile Middle East. While critics may decry this as territorial expansion, they fundamentally misunderstand the security imperatives facing the Jewish state. Assad’s downfall has created a dangerous power vacuum, with various militias jostling for control near Israel’s borders. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham’s government in Damascus offers no guarantees of stability, nor do we know if his newfound power will intoxicate him like it did Assad. More concerning is the persistent threat of Iranian weapons flowing through Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon. The Golan Heights’ mountainous terrain provides critical surveillance points overlooking Damascus, Beirut, and Jerusalem. From a security perspective, this topographical advantage is invaluable. Critics conveniently forget that Israel’s previous withdrawals from territories have often resulted in security disasters. Since the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, a UN-monitored demilitarized zone of about 400 square kilometers has separated Israeli-held Golan Heights from Syria proper. Overseen by 1,100 UN peacekeepers, this arrangement was meant to ensure stability. Now, with Syria’s downfall, the UN’s track record suggests it won’t look out for Israel’s survival. Those wringing their hands about international law such as Saudi Arabia should remember that Israel’s security cannot be sacrificed for failed theoretical legal frameworks. On Thursday the Kingdom put out a statement condemning Israel’s 'occupation' in Syria. 'The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expresses the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s strong condemnation and denunciation of the Israeli occupation government’s decision to expand settlements in the occupied Golan Heights and its continued sabotaging of Syria’s prospects for restoring its security and stability. The Kingdom reiterates its call on the international community to denounce these Israeli violations, emphasizing the importance of respecting Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Kingdom reaffirms that the occupied Golan is Syrian, Arab land.' The only international opinion that matters is that of the United States, which under President Trump recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights. His historic recognition back in 2019 acknowledged both Israel’s birthright and, now more than ever, her security realities.

The IDF said that there was only 'a partial interception of the missile launched from Yemen and that the warhead [likely] exploded and damaged the school.' The IAF and Home Front Command were conducting a more in-depth probe. The damage caused from a Ballistic missile fired from Yemen at a school in Ramat Gan, December 19, 2024. (Flash90/Avshalom Sassoni) The Israeli strikes against the Houthis were carried out in two waves by 14 fighter jets, refuelers and spy planes, which were already en route to Yemen when the enemy fired its ballistic missile at Ramat Gan around 2:35 a.m. on Thursday. The first IAF strikes hit at 3:15 a.m., targeting the Ras Isa oil terminal on the Red Sea as well as the Hodeidah and Salif ports. Eight tugboats, used for guiding ships into the ports, were also destroyed. At 4:30 a.m., the second wave targeted the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, hitting the Haziz and D’Habban power stations, according to reports. 'Over the past year, the Houthi terrorist regime has been operating with the direction and funding of Iran, and in cooperation with Iraqi militias, in order to attack the State of Israel and Israeli civilians,' the IDF said following the IAF operation. 'The conducted strikes degrade the Houthi terrorist regime, preventing it from exploiting the targets for military and terrorist purposes, including the smuggling of Iranian weapons to the region,' the statement continued. 'The IDF is determined to continue operating against all threats posed to the citizens of the State of Israel, wherever necessary.'

Earlier, an Israeli Navy ship intercepted a Houthi drone over the Red Sea before it crossed into Israeli territory. On Dec. 9, a Houthi drone hit a residential high-rise building in the central Israeli city of Yavne, northeast of Ashdod. On Dec. 1, a ballistic missile launched from Yemen triggered sirens in the Judean Foothills (the Shfela region). The Iran-backed Houthi rebels have launched over 200 missiles and 170 drones at Israel in support of Hamas since the Gaza-based terrorist group’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre in the northwestern Negev. In July, a Houthi drone killed a civilian in central Tel Aviv. In response, Israel struck Yemen’s Hodeidah Port. On Sept. 29, the Israeli Air Force carried out dozens of strikes in the area of Hodeidah. The targets included 'power plants and a seaport, which were used by the Houthis to transfer Iranian weapons to the region, in addition to military supplies and oil,' the IDF said.

Ramat Gan Mayor: ‘We were lucky there were no children at school’...	The Mayor announced the damage was 40 million shekel ($11 million) and that a replacement Ramat Ef’al elementary school building would be constructed. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Thursday, Ramat Gan Mayor Carmel Shama-Hacohen expressed gratitude that there were no children at the school targeted by a Houthi ballistic missile overnight. The multistory building collapsed on impact with the partially intercepted ballistic missile. Footage from the scene circulating on social media show a building with its wall blown off, exposing the classroom inside. Partially collapsed roofs, shattered glass, and scattered debris are also seen. The Mayor announced the damage was 40 million shekel ($11 million) and that a replacement Ramat Ef’al elementary school building would be constructed. The Ramat Gan municipality said in a statement that students in grades 1-4, including special education students, will attend classes in nearby schools. Students in the 5th and 6th grades will attend classes online. The IDF initially announced it had intercepted the missile, but a part of the missile or the interceptor fell on the school destroying it. There were no reported injuries, but some parked cars were damaged by debris. The missile set off sirens in central Israel, with citizens crowding into bomb shelters in the middle of the night. The Israeli Air Force struck numerous Houthi-controlled assets in Yemen, including major ports and oil sites, during the early hours of Thursday morning, as the terror group launched a ballistic missile that triggered sirens throughout central Israel.

Lebanese sheik: ‘Israel has left nothing of Hezbollah’	Mourab also criticized Iran for the destruction of its terror proxy By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Sunni Sheikh Hassan Mourab, a supporter of Hezbollah, told Lebanese television that 'Israel has left nothing of Hezbollah.' Discussing the assassinations of Hezbollah leadership, he said, 'The organization has suffered severe blows at the high command levels, the lower levels, and in the infrastructure in southern Lebanon.' Mourab added,'What else is left that the enemy has not achieved? What else is left for them to do?' What is left for us? Tell me.' 'Southern Lebanon has been completely destroyed. And at the end, Hezbollah was also forbidden from operating weapons inside Lebanon and outside it. Okay? So what is left of Hezbollah? Nothing. The organization has become powerless.' Mourab also criticized Iran for the destruction of its terror proxy. 'Iran is the one that destroyed Hezbollah more than anything else. I believe that Iranian conduct has led to a decline in the organization’s power, and this is evident in the reality on the ground.' According to the World Bank, Lebanon has experienced $8.5 billion in damages and economic losses due to the ongoing conflict—$3.4 billion in physical infrastructure damage and $5.1 billion in broader economic losses. Over the past 14 months, Hezbollah is believed to have suffered casualties as high as 10 times the number it lost during the 2006 Second Lebanon War, which lasted for a month. An assessment by Israel’s Channel 12 News and the Institute for National Security Studies indicates that the Israeli military estimates Hezbollah has lost approximately 3,000 fighters in Lebanon, including at least 11 brigade commanders, 37 battalion commanders, and 46 company commanders. A source with knowledge of Hezbollah’s operations told Reuters on Thursday that as many as 4,000 terrorists may have been killed, the majority of them since September. This increase in casualties came after Jerusalem escalated its offensive in Lebanon, adding the return of tens of thousands of displaced residents to their homes in the north to its official war objectives.

New post-election poll reveals why voters rejected Harris so badl...	By a 13-point margin (39% to 26%), independents reported decreased trust in government following the election. By Jewish Breaking News As speculation and debate continue to rage over how the Democrats got beaten so badly in November, new post-election polling data reveals what voters really wanted. Four years ago, Joe Biden beat Donald Trump’s first chance at election by promising to restore faith in democracy and government. Vice President Harris tried out the exact same playbook as she tried to become the nation’s first female president. She ended up walking into a buzzsaw of voters more interested in results than rhetoric. According to the first comprehensive post-election poll by George Washington University’s Graduate School of Political Management, while trust in government took a nosedive after the election – with 39% of voters saying their confidence had dropped – Americans still picked Trump’s promise of action over Harris’s pledge of integrity. When asked about government effectiveness under the new administration, 40% expect improvement compared to 36% predicting decline. The contrast was even starker among independents, a crucial voting bloc that broke decisively against Democrats. By a 13-point margin (39% to 26%), independents reported decreased trust in government following the election. Similarly, they expressed less confidence in receiving accurate information by an 11-point margin (39% to 28%). However, these same independent voters believed by a 10-point margin (39% to 29%) that the Trump administration would prove more effective at achieving results. America’s fractured media landscape also proved instrumental in sinking Democratic 'trust us' messaging. Three-quarters of voters under 30 now get their news from social media, while 84% of seniors stick to television. The divide gets even sharper on platforms like TikTok and Instagram, where 61% and 55% of young voters turn for news compared to single digits among those over 65. Trump capitalized on this divide, with his headline-grabbing Joe Rogan podcast appearance racking up over 27 million YouTube views and dominating social media feeds for weeks. Concerns about misinformation loomed large, with 69% of Americans reporting that online disinformation made it harder to access 'fair and truthful news during the 2024 election campaign.' A similar 71% expressed worry about the role of 'deepfakes' in spreading false information. Perhaps most troubling for both parties, 45% of Americans now say they trust neither the government nor news organizations to provide accurate information. It’s clear Americans have grown cynical enough to separate belief from results and prefer a distrusted government that delivers than a trusted one that doesn’t. After watching their party get wiped out in the House, and Senate, and an embarrassing presidential defeat, Democrats are left to ponder whether their cherished 'democracy first' message has finally hit its expiration date.

Fani Willis barred from Trump election case	Willis claimed that her intimate relationship with Wade did not begin until after she appointed him to the case in 2021, despite testimony from witnesses that it began in 2019. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon A Georgia Court of Appeals on Thursday removed Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis from the 2020 election interference case against President-elect Donald Trump due to her romantic relationship with the case’s lead prosecutor. The judges said Willis’s affair with ex-special prosecutor Nathan Wade presents 'significant appearance of impropriety' and 'no other remedy will suffice to restore public confidence in the integrity of these proceedings' than to disqualify Willis from the case. The court did not dismiss the charges against Trump, but throwing out Willis’s office leaves the future of the case uncertain. The Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia is responsible for finding another prosecutor to take over the case and deciding whether to continue to pursue it, according to the Associated Press. Willis claimed that her intimate relationship with Wade did not begin until after she appointed him to the case in 2021, despite testimony from witnesses that it began in 2019. Fulton County Superior Court judge Scott McAfee ruled in March that Willis would be allowed to stay on the case but that Wade would have to be removed due to the 'appearance of impropriety.' He resigned hours later. 'After carefully considering the trial court’s findings in its order, we conclude that it erred by failing to disqualify DA Willis and her office,' the Appeals Court ruling reads. 'The remedy crafted by the trial court to prevent an ongoing appearance of impropriety did nothing to address the appearance of impropriety that existed at times when DA Willis was exercising her broad pretrial discretion about who to prosecute and what charges to bring,' it continued. 'In granting President Trump an overwhelming mandate, the American People have demanded an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and a swift dismissal of all the Witch Hunts against him,' Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement celebrating the court's ruling. 'We look forward to uniting our country as President Trump Makes America Great Again.'

Supreme Court to Ben Gvir: ‘Why Aren’t Nukhba terrorists prisoner...	Ben Gvir: 'The Israel Prison Service is diligent in ensuring compliance with the law, providing only the bare minimum required by legal standards.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Supreme Court issued a conditional order on Thursday to National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir asking him to provide an explanation why prisoners of the Nukba Force, the wing of Hamas that carried out the October 7th massacre, aren't being given sufficient food. The order follows a petition by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, that claims 'there is a significant decrease in the weight of prisoners and security detainees.' The decision read, 'A conditional order is hereby issued, directing the respondents to appear and explain why they have not taken steps to ensure that security prisoners are provided with food that meets basic living conditions as required by applicable law.' The Association for Civil Rights, which filed the petition against Ben-Gvir, commented: 'The Supreme Court has upheld our position. The fact that the State is required to respond to this issue marks a profoundly troubling moral low.' Ben Gvir responded by saying, 'Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has become a protector of those Nukhba terrorists who slaughtered, raped, burned, and kidnapped our sons and daughters with Nazi-like cruelty.' 'The Israel Prison Service is diligent in ensuring compliance with the law, providing only the bare minimum required by legal standards, and nothing more. During my tenure, the era of luxuries like marmalades and lamb will end. There will be no more bakeries or canteens funded by terrorist money,' he added. 'No more 'hotel accommodations' in terrorist prisons. The Supreme Court seems intent on returning us to the days of all-inclusive summer camps. The Israeli public will be the judge.' A Palestinian terrorist convicted of kidnapping and killing an Israeli teenager has petitioned a judge after the Israel Prison Service (IPS) denied him the 'right' to play videogames. Iham Kamamji, a Palestinian Islamic Jihad member serving two life sentences for his role in the 2006 kidnapping and murder of 18-year-old Eliyahu Asheri, said the prison administration had previously allowed him to have a Sony PlayStation 2 in his cell.

Former Mossad agents will reveal secrets behind Hezbollah beepers...	The program will discuss previously unreleased information about the operation that was years in the making. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Former Mossad agents who were involved in the 'exploding beeper' operation that devastated Hezbollah several months ago will reveal secrets of the mission for the first time on ABC's 60 Minutes on Sunday. The program will discuss previously unreleased information about the operation that was years in the making. On September 17, thousands of pagers issued by the Hezbollah terrorist organization to its operatives exploded simultaneously. It was reported that 12 terrorists had been killed by the beepers and thousands injured. A former commander of British military forces in Afghanistan, Colonel Richard Kemp, praised the beeper offensive against Hezbollah as 'precise and discriminatory' and effective at weakening the morale and capacity of the Lebanese terror group. Israel's outsmarting them with this terror attack has led to Hezbollah's 'demoralization.' Kemp also praised the mission because it effectively targeted only terrorists and limited civilian casualties. 'It's hard to think of a more precise and discriminating method of attack than detonating pagers known to be specifically assigned to individual terrorists, using devices that limit the potential for collateral damage.' He added that the exploding beepers were intended only for terrorists who are 'legitimate and lawful targets for attack as Israel seeks to defend its citizens from violent aggression,' he said. Kemp added that three distinctive characteristics of the mission made it particularly effective. First, the mission resulted in extensive damage to Hezbollah, second it engendered anxiety in Hezbollah members and may discourage others from joining and third, it has humiliated Hezbollah on the world stage. The now-deceased leader of Hezbollah at the time, Hassan Nasrallah, declared the exploding beepers were an 'act of war.' Nasrallah said, 'We undoubtedly suffered a major security and humanitarian blow, unprecedented in the conflict and maybe in the history of mankind.' Nasrallah added, 'We were hit hard, but that's the situation in war. We understand that the enemy has technological supremacy. Especially since the we and the West support it.'

Iran eyes Sudan to choke Israel’s economy with Russian backing	Both Russia and Iran have held high-level talks in recent months to establish military bases in Port Sudan. By Jewish Breaking News Israel’s sustained attacks on its proxy force Hezbollah in Lebanon have forced Iran to turn its attention to Sudan in an effort to destabilize maritime security and shipping routes critical to the Jewish State’s economy. According to an explosive report by Bloomberg, Iranian military support has increased dramatically in Sudan. In January, Sudan’s paramilitary forces shot down a drone near the capital Khartoum that weapons experts identified as an Iranian design – the Ababil model. While this drone was assembled in Sudan, it was built using parts shipped in from Iran. But what really caught the attention of security experts are satellite images revealing the presence of Iran’s Mohajer-6 drone at Sudan’s Wadi Sayyidna air base. Unlike the basic Ababil, the Mohajer-6 is a combat drone made by Iran’s Quds Air Industries that can carry and launch precision-guided missiles. Between January and July 2024, at least seven flights between Tehran and Port Sudan were operated by Qeshm Fars Air, a US-sanctioned airline with documented ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force unit. What raised suspicions for intelligence officials was where these cargo planes were landing back in Tehran. Instead of using a regular commercial area like normal cargo flights, they touched down in a restricted military zone of Mehrabad Airport reserved only for Iran’s Air Force. For planes operated by a civilian cargo company to be landing in military areas suggests they weren’t exactly hauling commercial goods. Russia’s involvement has been equally substantial. Following a June meeting between Sudan’s deputy leader Malik Agar and Russian officials, Moscow reportedly offered an S-400 surface-to-air missile defense system, though Sudan has hesitated to accept, fearing Western backlash. Russia has also dramatically scaled up fuel shipments, delivering 2.8 million barrels of diesel and gasoline between April and October. At least 12 tankers from various Russian ports, most with undisclosed ownership, have docked in Port Sudan since March. Bloomberg’s investigation also reveals both Russia and Iran have held high-level talks in recent months to establish military bases in Port Sudan. Satellite images show rapid military expansion at Port Sudan International Airport, where new hangars and storage facilities have been built in its military wing. Meanwhile, at the city’s seaport, officials speaking anonymously described how military intelligence regularly cordons off the southern terminal to secretly unload weapons shipments. Their combined military support has already shifted the balance of power in Sudan’s civil war, helping the army recapture parts of Khartoum and vast territories from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Since April, over 11 million Sudanese have been displaced and more than 2 million are facing potential famine. For Israel, this emerging Russian-Iranian military presence along the Red Sea represents a significant strategic threat. If plans for military facilities in Port Sudan are followed through, it would give Iran unprecedented ability to disrupt Israeli shipping so critical for its economy.

Nazareth teen indicted for spying for Hezbollah	Saadi allegedly transmitted missile impact locations, aircraft movements, and the positioning of Israeli military units. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli authorities arrested a 19-year-old resident of Nazareth accused of recently passing sensitive information to Hezbollah, it was cleared for publication on Thursday. The indictment charges Muhammad Saadi with having repeated contact with the Lebanon-based terror group for several years and making several attempts to join its ranks. He is also accused of communicating with Hezbollah’s television station, Al-Manar, providing photos and videos. When Hezbollah began launching daily rocket and drone attacks after Hamas’s October 7 attack, Saadi allegedly transmitted missile impact locations, aircraft movements, and the positioning of Israeli military units. 'The investigation of the affair once again revealed the fact that the elements of the Shiite axis led by Iran are working to promote terrorist activity in Israel, including by recruiting residents of the State of Israel who are exploited by them for espionage activities for their needs,' the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) said.

IDF hits Tulkarem terror cell, reportedly killing Fatah commander	Judea and Samaria leaders on Sunday issued a letter to Israel’s Security Cabinet before its weekly meeting, calling on the government to take preventative military measures amid an uptick in terrorism. By JNS An Israeli Air Force craft attacked a terrorist cell in the western Samaria city of Tulkarem on Thursday afternoon. According to the Palestinian Authority, the IAF strike killed four people, including Tareq al-Doush, a local commander of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, a 'military' arm of P.A. leader Mahmoud Abbas’s Fatah party. Two months ago, al-Doush told the anti-Israel Mondoweiss website that Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre of some 1,200 people 'was like a dream for us.' The terrorist Tareq al-Dosh, commander of the Al-Aqsa Brigades, Tulkarm Battalion, was eliminated. pic.twitter.com/lyOYrCxVuk &mdash; נועה מגיד | Noa magid (@NoaMagid) December 19, 2024 Palestinian media reported that the IDF was also implementing a 'pressure cooker' protocol—increased gunfire to force a wanted terrorist out—in Nablus, some 12 miles southeast of Tulkarem. Arab reports claimed that at least two people were killed and several others were wounded during the military raid in the Samaria city. Judea and Samaria leaders on Sunday issued a letter to Israel’s Security Cabinet before its weekly meeting, calling on the government to take preventative military measures amid an uptick in terrorism. According to Israel’s Channel 14 News broadcaster, Cabinet members convened at IDF Central Command headquarters near Jerusalem’s Neve Yaakov neighborhood on Sunday to discuss security developments in Judea and Samaria. In recent years, Iranian-backed terrorist groups have taken over cities and towns in Samaria, including Jenin and Tulkarem, prompting Israeli forces to carry out counter-terrorism raids. Under the terms of the Oslo Accords, which Jerusalem signed with the Palestine Liberation Organization in the 1990s, the newly created P.A. was tasked with fighting terrorism in parts of Judea and Samaria. The Palestinian Authority earlier this month launched a rare counter-terror operation due to fears that terrorist organizations could attempt a coup inspired by the rebel takedown of Bashar Assad’s regime in Syria. Last week, Islamic Jihad terrorists from Tulkarem reportedly shot at the headquarters of the P.A. police in the city, lightly wounding two officers. Members of Ramallah’s forces have a long history of carrying out attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians. Last year, Fatah boasted that most of its 'martyrs' had served in the Palestinian Authority Security Forces. In addition, the Hamas terrorist organization has recruited dozens of PASF operatives, using them as terrorist combatants and for intelligence gathering, Israel’s Kan News public broadcaster reported in mid-2023.

Blinken says there is still time to negotiate nuclear deal with I...	I don't think that a nuclear weapon is inevitable,' the secretary of state told the Council on Foreign Relations. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that there is still time to negotiate nuclear deal with Iran, despite the opinion of the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog. Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Blinken said, 'I don't think that a nuclear weapon is inevitable,' and that 'there is the prospect of negotiations' with the incoming Republican administration. He did acknowledge circumstances had somewhat changed recently, saying that the Iranians have recently 'lost different lines of defense' so 'sure, you're going to see more thinking' about racing to a bomb. The Islamic Republic has just seen its most important client state, Syria, fall to Sunni Islamist rebels almost without a fight, and its chief terror proxy, Hezbollah in Lebanon, decimated by the IDF and agree to a ceasefire and withdrawal miles away from Israel. In addition, in retaliation for Iran’s second unsuccessful attempt at striking Israel with a massive wave of missiles in October, the IDF destroyed vital components of the mullahs’ ballistic missile program as well all their advanced air defenses in an airstrike later that month. Incoming president Donald Trump, who had pulled out of the old nuclear deal in 2018, calling it 'terrible,' had 'said he wanted, as he called it, a better, stronger deal. Fine,' Blinken said. The secretary of state spoke just two days after International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi told Italian news agency ANSA that 'The philosophy of the original accord with Iran can be used, but that agreement is no longer useful.' This is because the Islamic Republic had 'developed much stronger capabilities,' he explained, noting that 'It has uranium at 60% — 90% is military grade — and is thus practically at the same level as nuclear-armed states.' According to the nuclear watchdog, as of October 26, Iran has 182.3 kilograms (401.9 pounds) of 60% enriched uranium, which has no civilian use whatsoever. It is only a very short technical step between the two levels, and the IAEA reported earlier this month that Iran is 'likely' to have enough enriched uranium to build four bombs. At the same time, the Americans’ Office of National Intelligence officially estimated that the mullahs have 'enough fissile material to make more than a dozen nuclear weapons,' although the decision to go for one has not yet been made. It will be 'a complex process' to 'define a system that serves the new Iranian reality,' Rossi said. In his speech, the secretary of state noted as a bottom line that no American administration would allow Iran to obtain a nuclear bomb.

18 notable Jews who died in 2024	In chronological order, here is a selection of obituaries of 18 notable Jews who died in 2024. By, JTA As 2024 comes to a close, we look back and mourn the Jewish icons who have left outsized legacies on politics, the arts, sports and everything in between. In chronological order, here is a selection of obituaries of 18 notable Jews who died in 2024. Pearl Berg At the time of her death, Pearl Berg was thought to be the oldest Jewish person in the world, and the ninth-oldest overall. A philanthropist active in her local Hadassah chapter, Berg was married for 58 years to Mark Berg, a businessman and investor. He died in 1989. 'She maybe had a sip of Sabbath wine but she didn’t drink, she didn’t smoke, she ate sensibly, she had good emotional balance and she clearly had remarkable genes,' Berg’s youngest son, Robert Berg, told the Los Angeles Times. She died on Feb. 1 at 114. Charlie Biton In 1971, Charlie Biton co-founded the Israeli Black Panthers, a movement that fought against the racism and poverty experienced by Mizrahi Jews in Israel. That set Biton on a course of activism and politics that would have seemed unlikely for someone with limited schooling and a criminal background. Biton rode the success of his protest group to a 15-year career as a member of Israel’s parliament, serving from 1977 to 1992 mostly alongside communists in the Hadash faction. Biton distinguished himself as a fighter for social change and an early voice for peace with the Palestinians. He died on Feb. 24 at 76. Richard Lewis Comedian Richard Lewis parlayed his neurotic Jewish personality and self-deprecating humor into a 50-year career as a standup and actor. Most notably, he starred in the ABC sitcom 'Anything but Love,' and played a fictionalized version of himself in HBO’s 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' from 2000 until 2024. Said Larry David, the show’s creator and Lewis’ close friend, 'He had that rare combination of being the funniest person and also the sweetest.' He died on Feb. 27 at 76. Martin Greenfield Martin Greenfield survived Auschwitz and Buchenwald, where he learned to sew after accidentally tearing a Nazi soldier’s shirt. After immigrating to the United States, he became a master tailor who dressed a series of presidents from Dwight Eisenhower to Barack Obama. Working out of a third-floor office in his East Williamsburg factory, Greenfield became one of the best-known — and some would say best — men’s tailors in the country. 'Receiving your first tailoring lesson inside a Nazi concentration camp was hardly the ideal apprenticeship,' Greenfield recalled in his memoir. 'I would have much preferred to hone my craft on Savile Row or in the mills of Milan. Looking back, though, that moment in the camps marked the beginning of the rest of my life.' He died on March 20 at 95. Joe Lieberman Joseph Lieberman served as a senator from Connecticut for 24 years and, as Al Gore’s running mate in 2000, became the first Jew on a major presidential ticket. A moderate — some would say conservative — Democrat turned independent, Lieberman was known for his attempts to build bridges in an increasingly polarized Washington, sometimes losing old friends and allies along the way. Lieberman died on March 27 at 82. Ken Holtzman Ken Holtzman, who played 15 seasons in the major leagues, was the winningest Jewish pitcher in baseball history. The MLB veteran threw two no-hitters, won four World Series rings and made two All-Star teams. A leftie, he played for the Chicago Cubs in two stints; the Oakland Athletics, where he won three consecutive titles from 1972-1974; the Baltimore Orioles; and the New York Yankees, where he won his fourth ring in 1978 despite not appearing in the series. In his retirement, he worked at his hometown Jewish community center. He died on April 15 at 78. Rabbi Moshe Kotlarsky A leading figure in the Chabad-Lubavitch community, Rabbi Moshe Kotlarsky was known for his efforts to build the Hasidic movement’s global outreach efforts and for his personal ties with community members. As chairman of various Chabad affiliates, Kotlarsky played a key role in carrying out the vision of the movement’s late leader, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, known as the Rebbe, in launching what are now more than 5,000 outreach centers in more than 100 countries. 'He was caring for everybody and that’s why everybody feels so close,' said one rabbi who flew to Brooklyn from Amsterdam for his funeral. Kotlarsky died on June 4 at 74. Kinky Friedman As a cigar-chomping, mustachioed Texan country singer and mystery novelist, Kinky Friedman’s body of work often seemed like the un-kosher marriage of the Borscht Belt and the Bible Belt. The frontman for the flamboyant 1970s country group Kinky Friedman and the Texas Jewboys, he was notorious for satirical songs such as 'They Don’t Make Jews Like Jesus Anymore,' a raucous sendup of racism, while also turning serious with works like the 1973 song 'Ride ’em Jewboy,' a haunting elegy on the Holocaust recorded by Willie Nelson and sung in concert by Bob Dylan. Friedman died on June 27 at 79. Ruth Westheimer A Holocaust survivor and Israeli military veteran, the diminutive Ruth Westheimer charmed and educated millions of listeners as the taboo-breaking radio sex therapist known as 'Dr. Ruth.' Her program, 'Sexually Speaking,’' which launched in 1980 on the now-defunct WYNY-FM, broke broadcasting taboos around talking about sex and helped make her the most famous sex therapist in the world — albeit one with a motherly demeanor and thick German accent. She was a firm believer in sex as healthy dialogue among consenting partners, and also emphasized psychology over biology. 'When it comes to sex, the most important six inches are the ones between the ears,' she once famously said. She died on July 12 at 96. Queenie Hallegua When a JTA correspondent visited Kochi, India in 2020, a researcher said only two Jews were still living in Jew Town, a once-vibrant community where perhaps 3,000 Jews lived at its peak in the 1950s. The death of Queenie Hallegua, the last of the Paradesi, or 'foreign,' Jewish women in Kochi, left her nephew Keith as the last Jew there. Queenie Hallegua was the warden and managing trustee of the Paradesi Synagogue, a 450-year-old landmark, from 2012 to 2018. Queenie and her late husband Sammy hosted Queen Elizabeth and her husband, Prince Philip, when they came to the Paradesi Synagogue in 1997. She died on Aug. 11 at 89. Silvio Santos Silvio Santos, a son of Sephardic Jewish immigrants, rose from working-class roots to become one of Brazil’s wealthiest men and a popular television personality. Born in Rio de Janeiro, the former street vendor built a media empire, including SBT, one of Brazil’s top three television networks. Calling him 'Brazil’s first-ever celebrity billionaire,' Forbes magazine once compared him to Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg. He died on Aug. 17 at 93. Hersh Goldberg-Polin Hersh Goldberg-Polin moved with his family to Israel when he was a child and became a symbol of the plight of Israelis held hostage in Gaza after Hamas terrorists abducted him from the Nova music festival on Oct. 7, 2023. His parents, Rachel Goldberg-Polin and Jon Polin, became prominent advocates for bringing the hostages home, sharing frequently and eloquently about their son, whom they described as a wise, inquisitive, kind and gentle soul who was an engine of justice in the family and beyond. He and five other hostages — Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Almog Sarusi, Alex Lubnov and Carmel Gat — were killed as Israeli troops closed in on the tunnel below Rafah where they had been held; they were 23, 24, 25, 27, 33 and 40 years old when their bodies were recovered on Aug. 31. 'I no longer worry about you,' Rachel Goldberg-Polin said at her son’s funeral. 'I know you are no longer in danger.' Mark Podwal In Mark Podwal’s illustrations — created for children’s books, major newspapers, synagogue tapestries and gallery walls — he devised a Jewish visual vocabulary that made him one of the best known Jewish artists of his era. He also became the only working dermatologist whose works on paper are included in the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Modern and Contemporary Art Collection. He died on Sept. 13 at 79. Fania Brantsovsky Fania Brantsovsky was the last surviving member of the Jewish underground in the Vilna ghetto and a keeper of the flame of the city’s once-glorious Yiddish past. Brantsovsky escaped the ghetto in 1942 and fought against the Nazis and their local collaborators in the Rudninkai forest with a group of Jewish partisans under the command of Abba Kovner. In the years after the war, she became a lifelong advocate for the memory of Lithuanian Jewry and their Yiddish language. She died on Sept. 22 at 102. Lily Ebert A Hungarian-born Holocaust survivor, Lily Ebert went on to educate millions on TikTok and cultivate a late-in-life friendship with King Charles III. After surviving Auschwitz and living in Switzerland and Israel, Ebert eventually moved to Britain in 1967. She gave testimony at museums and universities and co-wrote a book about her experience with Dov Forman, one of 38 great-grandchildren among her descendants. With Forman, she co-created a TikTok account to educate social media users about the Holocaust and the prevalence of antisemitism. Forman was 16 at the time they created the account in 2021; at the time of her death, it had 2 million followers. Ebert died on Oct. 9 at 100. Lynda Obst Lynda Obst, a film producer whose credits include 'Interstellar,' 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,' 'Contact,' 'One Fine Day' and 'Sleepless in Seattle,' was an editor at The New York Times magazine before going to Hollywood in the late 1970s. She produced her friend Nora Ephron’s directorial debut, 'This Is My Life' (1992), and was the executive producer for Ephron’s wildly successful romantic comedy 'Sleepless in Seattle' in 1993. She became deeply engaged with Judaism while helping her son recover from addiction. She died on Oct. 22 at 74. Bernie Marcus Bernie Marcus, the billionaire who co-founded Home Depot, became a Republican megadonor and supporter of civic and political causes in the United States and Israel. Marcus’ legacy includes the transformation of downtown Atlanta with the establishment of the Georgia Aquarium; a massive advance in autism awareness and research thanks to the Marcus Autism Center, also in Atlanta; and the founding of the Israel Democracy Institute in Jerusalem, an important think tank focused on governance.

Israeli forces destroy Hezbollah compound in Southern Lebanon	Several weapons storage facilities were located, including one embedded inside a mosque, where hundreds of explosives, rifles, grenades and more military equipment were being stored. By Joshua Marks, JNS Israeli forces destroyed an underground Hezbollah command and control facility in Southern Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces said on Wednesday night. Engineering troops from the 91st Division’s 188th Brigade located a tunnel dozens of meters long that led to the command center, which according to the military was used by the Iranian proxy to plan attacks and direct rocket fire at Israeli communities in the Galilee over the past year. Weapons, surveillance systems and additional military equipment were confiscated during the operation. Nearby, several weapons storage facilities were located, including one embedded inside a mosque, where hundreds of explosives, rifles, grenades and more military equipment were being stored. After soldiers from Yahalom, a special forces unit of the Combat Engineering Corps, investigated the compound, engineering troops destroyed the command center and tunnel. The IDF emphasized that 188th Brigade troops 'continue to act to remove threats in Southern Lebanon in accordance with the understandings between Israel and Lebanon and the conditions of the ceasefire.' On Tuesday, an IDF aircraft struck a Hezbollah terrorist in Southern Lebanon he was observed loading weapons into a car. The IDF stressed that the Iranian-backed terror group’s presence in the area 'violated the understandings between Israel and Lebanon.' Earlier on Tuesday, the Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese daily Al Akhbar reported that a drone had struck a vehicle in the village of Majdal Zoun. According to the report, two people were wounded in the strike. Under the terms of the ceasefire deal reached with Beirut on Nov. 26, Israeli forces are to withdraw gradually from the country over a 60-day period. Hezbollah must retreat north of the Litani River, about 20 miles north of the border, while the Lebanese Armed Forces deploy along the 75-mile frontier, along with monitors from the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL. On Monday, the IDF announced that after three months in Lebanon, its 98th Division was redeploying to the Gaza Strip. The military said that the division had dismantled more than 300 Hezbollah sites in Lebanon. Israeli ground forces entered Southern Lebanon in early October after a year of incessant Hezbollah rocket, suicide drone and missile attacks.

Breakthrough for bioengineering as study deciphers how cells defi...	Understanding how transcription factors navigate chromatin could enable scientists to bioengineer adult cells into other cell types. By Pesach Benson, TPS Research released on Wednesday by Israeli and Scottish scientists sheds new light on how cells establish their specialized roles, with findings likely to transform regenerative medicine and cell therapy. Researchers from Jerusalem’s Hebrew University and the University of Edinburgh uncovered how transcription factors (TFs) — critical proteins responsible for regulating gene activity — navigate complex DNA and chromatin structures to define cellular identity. The findings were published in the peer-reviewed Nature Journal. Understanding how transcription factors navigate chromatin could enable scientists to bioengineer adult cells into other cell types. For example, skin cells could potentially be reprogrammed into heart cells to treat an organ failure, or into insulin-producing beta cells to treat diabetes. The knowledge could also help identify chromatin-related gene regulation errors that cause developmental disorders, enabling early diagnosis and more targeted interventions. 'By uncovering how transcription factors interact with chromatin architecture, we can better understand gene regulation and cellular identity. This knowledge opens exciting possibilities for regenerative medicine, enabling us to precisely control cell fate and develop therapies for diseases caused by cellular dysfunction,' said Hebrew University’s Prof. Yosef Buganim, who led the research with Edinburgh University’s Dr. Abdenour Soufi. Transcription factors bind to specific DNA sequences to regulate gene expression, directing cells to differentiate into specific types, such as skin, muscle, or placenta cells. While their ability to recognize DNA sequences is well-established, the exact mechanism behind their target selection within the vast genome has remained elusive. The study introduces a novel 'guided search' mechanism, revealing how the 3D structure of DNA and chromatin acts as a roadmap for TFs. By leveraging advanced technologies, the researchers explored how TF combinations influence distinct cell identities, focusing on embryo and placenta cells. They found that transcription factors dynamically cooperate or compete based on the chromatin landscape to target genes essential for cell type determination. One key discovery was the influence of chromatin topology, which refers to the folding and looping of DNA within the nucleus. These structures guide TFs along DNA pathways or concentrate them at chromatin junctions densely packed with critical DNA motifs. The findings also open new doors on enhancing gene-editing techniques such as CRISPR.

U.S. will not sanction Smotrich, Ben-Gvir – report	Knowing that the incoming administration would reverse the decision played a large part in dropping the idea. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The U.S. will not sanction either Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich or National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir before President Biden leaves office in January, The Times of Israel reported Thursday. The two nationalist-religious ministers have almost been persona non grata for the Biden administration due to the roles they have been accused of playing in Judea and Samaria. Smotrich has constantly threatened the financial stability of the Palestinian Authority in his economic position, and allegedly prevented moves against unauthorized outposts as minister in the Defense Ministry in charge of settler affairs. Ben-Gvir has allegedly directed the Israel Police, who are under his ministry’s purview, to ignore Jews’ attacks on Palestinians in the region, which have totaled a few dozen over the course of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. President Joe Biden signed an executive order in February allowing severe financial sanctioning of those 'enforcing or failing to enforce policies' that 'threaten the peace, security, or stability of the West Bank,' or who participate in such actions. Included in these were 'threats or acts of violence targeting civilians' and destruction of property. Mention was specifically made of 'high levels of extremist settler violence' which 'undermines the foreign policy objectives of the United States, including the viability of a two-state solution.' Palestinian terrorism was not mentioned, although there have been thousands of Palestinian attacks and attempted attacks throughout Judea and Samaria over the past year alone, some lethal. The only entities and individuals to be sanctioned to date for 'undermining' American objectives have been 17 Jewish settlers and 16 organizations that support the settlement enterprise. Although some Administration officials and dozens of Congress members have felt that Smotrich and Ben-Gvir are prime candidates for sanctions, a view echoed by top EU and British officials in recent months, the move was never made. An American official told the Israeli outlet that the president had been against it because he felt that penalizing ministers of a democratic ally would be going too far, and then when elections neared it became too much of a political hot potato to touch. Once Donald Trump won, the administration knew that he would reverse the decision very quickly, so it did not pay to make the move anymore. Trump could also decide to cancel the order completely, as it is any president’s prerogative to do with such executive actions, and restore all its victims’ financial rights.

‘Until Gaza is free’ – Defiant Houthis pledge more attacks on Isr...	Houthi-launched ballistic missile sends 2 million Israelis into bomb shelters, destroys elementary school near Tel Aviv. By World Israel News Staff Houthi terrorists in Yemen said on Thursday morning that they had fired two ballistic missiles at central Israel hours earlier, claiming that the launches marked a victory for the Shia-aligned anti-Israel proxy groups in the region. 'The operation has successfully achieved its objectives,' read a statement published by Yemen’s state news agency, Saba. The statement claimed that the missile attack had occurred 'simultaneously' with Israeli airstrikes on Houthi-controlled ports, energy infrastructure, and oil facilities. 'The Israeli aggression will not deter Yemen and the Yemenis from performing their religious and moral duty in responding to its massacres in the Gaza Strip,' the Houthis said. At around 2:30 AM on Thursday, the Houthis fired at least one missile at Israel, triggering air raid sirens that sent some 2 million people into bomb shelters. Although the IDF said the missile was intercepted, an elementary school in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan was completely destroyed. Education Minister Yoav Kisch told Hebrew-language media that he believed the educational institution had suffered a direct hit from the missile, while military officials claimed that the extensive damage was caused by shrapnel from the interception. Minutes after the missile was launched, Israel struck three major ports and other strategic infrastructure, killing at least nine people. In a media statement, Hamas condemned Israel's bombing of Yemen, which also blamed Jerusalem for the recent ouster of the Assad regime in Syria. 'We regard this escalation as a dangerous development and an extension of the aggression against our Palestinian people, Syria and the Arab region,' the terror group said. In a separate statement, Hamas’s armed wing, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, urged the Houthis to continue their aggression against the Jewish State. 'We commend the missile attack carried out by our loyal brothers, the Ansar Allah in Yemen, targeting the heart of the Zionist entity,' they said. The Houthis are the last remaining Iranian proxy group in the region that has not been significantly battered by the IDF. Recent months have seen the Hezbollah and Hamas terror groups, which are funded by Iran, suffer serious blows to their leadership, operatives, and capability to attack Israel. Since November, it's believed that the Houthis have launched at least a dozen explosive drones and missiles at the Jewish State.

Is a hostage deal imminent?	Hamas officials have told Arab outlets that the main issues have been resolved; diplomats say there’s a way to go. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News There are conflicting reports over whether a hostage deal is 'imminent,' as Hamas officials have labeled it in recent days. Lebanese paper Al-Akhbar reported Thursday that according to Hamas officials, 'The state of the negotiations underway in Doha is excellent, and most of the issues in dispute have been resolved, so it is possible that we will very soon have an agreement.' Israeli negotiators have been talking with Hamas and American officials in Qatar since Monday, with CIA director Bill Burns flying in on Wednesday. Saudi-owned Asharq Al-Awsat reported Wednesday that Hamas officials have said an agreement was 'imminent' and could be signed by the end of the week. The London-based paper said that in the first of three stages, lasting 45-60 days, Hamas would free about 30 hostages, both alive and dead. The Saudi Al-Hadath TV channel cited sources saying that the ill, elderly, and all female hostages, including soldiers, would be included in this stage. In exchange, the IDF would leave Gazan cities, northern Gaza residents would be allowed to return home and Israel would release an as-yet unknown number of Palestinian prisoners, although it is reportedly in the hundreds. At this stage, some reports stated that the IDF would still stay in the vital Philadelphi Corridor on the Egyptian-Gazan border, through and under which Hamas received the vast majority of its arms, and the Netzarim Corridor that the IDF created for security reasons and divides Gaza roughly in half. A Hamas official told AFP that the army would 'partly withdraw' from these by-now well-paved and wide roads, which in the case of Netzarim is also dotted with watchtowers. Hamas has reportedly agreed that a full IDF withdrawal from the coastal enclave can remain for the last stage of the deal. According to Al-Akhbar, disagreement still remains over Israel’s demand for a comprehensive list of both the living and dead hostages, with Hamas saying that it cannot hand one over until there is a week of quiet so that they can reach the abductees and confirm their status. A second point of reported contention is that Israel wants wounded male soldiers to be released in the first stage, while Hamas wants to hold all male soldiers for the second stage, in which the remaining dead bodies would also be released. Along with another batch of Palestinian prisoners, at least a hundred terrorists 'with long-term sentences' would be freed by Israel at this stage, the AFP report stated. Terrorists approved for release but who are serving heavy sentences for their lethal attacks would reportedly be deported to Qatar and Turkey, and not return to the Gaza Strip as Hamas originally demanded. Negotiations are simultaneously taking place in Cairo, with Egyptian security sources saying that one sticking point is that Hamas is demanding international guarantees that the temporary ceasefire will lead to a permanent end to the war in the third stage. While top Israeli government officials such as Defense Minister Yisrael Katz have said the two sides are closer than ever, and Washington has expressed 'cautious optimism,' diplomats involved with the talks have cautioned against believing that it is only a short step away. A source told The Jerusalem Post Wednesday that Hamas has not given the Israelis either a list of those the terror organization is ready to free, or one with the names of the prisoners it wants in exchange. None of the international guarantors mentioned by the Hamas official to AFP – Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, the UN and the U.S. – confirmed their participation, the news agency said.

Netanyahu reassures mother of US journalist kidnapped in Syria	In a personal letter to Austin Tice's mother, Netanyahu says Israel is acting with caution and concerned about her son's life. By World Israel News Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a letter to the mother of an American journalist missing in Syria since 2012, promising her that Israel is refraining from bombing areas where he might be located. Austin Tice, a former U.S. Marine, was kidnapped more than 12 years ago after traveling to Syria to cover the civil war. After the fall of the Assad regime, Tice's family has been desperate to learn more about their son's whereabouts. The Tice family is under the impression that Austin is still alive. He was last seen blindfolded and bound in a 2012 video, while being led away by men dressed in Islamist garb. Speculation has been raised that Tice was actually kidnapped by the Assad regime, and that the video was created in order to give the false impression he was kidnapped by Islamic terrorists. Tice's mother, Debra, penned an open letter to Netanyahu, expressing her concern that the Israeli Air Force may bomb a neighborhood of Damascus where she believes her son is being held. She wrote that the family had received 'credible information' that her son is incarcerated at Mt. Qasioun prison, a secret facility near the Al-Mailki district. 'We urgently request you pause strikes on this area and deploy Israeli assets to search for Austin Tice and other prisoners,' Tice wrote. 'Time is of the essence. We are calling on you to leverage all your relationships and resources to liberate that prison.' In a personal letter to Debra Tice, Netanyahu said that he 'cannot imagine the depth of your concern over your son Austin's life and wellbeing.' Netanyahu urged her to 'stay strong,' saying that he admired her resilience . 'Please rest assured that Israel and its intelligence agencies are fully coordinated with the relevant American authorities on the matter and that the IDF is not active in the area where Austin may be located,' he added. Outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Washington was in contact with Syrian rebel groups regarding Tice's whereabouts. 'We have impressed upon everyone we’ve been in contact with the importance of helping find Austin Tice and bringing him home,' Blinken said.

IAF strikes Yemen as Houthis fire missile at central Israel	Nine said killed in IAF bombing of Houthi-controlled ports, oil facilities. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli Air Force struck numerous Houthi-controlled assets in Yemen, including major ports and oil sites, during the early hours of Thursday morning, as the terror group launched a ballistic missile that triggered sirens throughout central Israel. The IAF said in a statement that it 'conducted precise strikes on Houthi military targets in Yemen, including ports and energy infrastructure in Sanaa.' According to the IAF, jets were already en route to Yemen when the Houthis fired a ballistic missile at 2:30 AM that sent at least 2 million Israelis into bomb shelters. Although the missile launched at Israel was intercepted, shrapnel from the projectile caused extensive damage in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan. A school in the Ramat Efal neighborhood was apparently struck by a large piece of debris, causing a building to collapse. There were no casualties. The sites struck by the IAF include three major ports in the Hodeida area, which had previously been targeted by Israel following a deadly Houthi-launched drone attack in July 2024. 'Attacking these targets harms the terrorist authorities by preventing the exploitation of infrastructure for military and terror purposes, including transferring Iranian weaponry to the region,' the military said. 'The long arm of Israel will reach you,' Defense Minister Israel Katz said. 'Whoever lifts a hand will have it severed. Whoever strikes [us], will be struck many times over.' Al Masirah TV, a Houthi-affiliated news outlet, reported that nine people were killed in the overnight bombing. Seven were said to have been killed at the Port of Salif, while another two were killed at the Ras Issa oil refinery. In recent weeks, the Houthis have stepped up their attacks on Israel. On December 16th, the Houthis launched a ballistic missile at central Israel, which was intercepted. That attack caused no damage or injuries. Since November, the Houthis have fired around a dozen explosive drones and missiles at Israel. On December 9th, an explosive drone impacted an apartment building in Yavne, causing extensive damage but no casualties.

Houthi missile attack destroys central Israel elementary school	Ramat Gan mayor says it was 'great luck' that missile fired overnight, and not during school hours. By World Israel News Staff An elementary school in a Tel Aviv suburb was seriously damaged in the early hours of Thursday morning, as Houthi terrorists launched a ballistic missile at central Israel around 2:30 AM. Although the missile was said to be intercepted, Ramat Efal Elementary School, located in Ramat Gan, sustained such severe damage that a building collapsed. No casualties were reported. Nearby cars and homes were also damaged in the attack. Footage from the scene circulating on social media showed a building with its wall blown off, exposing the classroom inside. Partially collapsed roofs, shattered glass, and scattered debris are also seen. The damage may have come from a large piece of shrapnel from the missile, or it may have been that an unexploded warhead struck the school. Last month, an interception only partially destroyed the warhead of a Hezbollah missile, with the explosive load impacting in Ramat Gan. Ramat Efal Elementary School will not be operational until further notice and its students will need to learn elsewhere, Ramat Gan Mayor Carmel Shama HaCohen said in a statement. 'This night ended with great luck for the residents of the city of Ramat Gan. As the mayor and as the father of a child at Ramat Efal Elementary School, I do not want to think about a situation in which this missile would have been fired during school hours,' Shama HaCohen said. 'Teams from the municipality are on the ground and conducting a damage assessment, as well as initial clean-up of the scene.' The Ramat Gan municipality said in a statement that students in 1st through 4th grade, including special education students, will learn in nearby schools. Students in 5th and 6th grades will attend classes online.

Halevy: 'We are dismantling Hamas and targeting its infrastructure and forces to ensure that there will never be another October 7.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News During a situational assessment in Rafah on Wednesday, IDF Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said continued military operations will pressure Hamas to return the 100 hostages remaining in Gaza and will create the optimal security situation to allow residents of border communities to return home. He made the situational assessment alongside alongside senior commanders, including Southern Command chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman and Gaza Division Commander Brig. Gen. Barak Hiram. 'We are dismantling Hamas and targeting its infrastructure and forces to ensure that there will never be another October 7,' Halevi said. 'We are applying daily pressure on Hamas, driving it into greater distress, to secure the return of the 100 hostages—hopefully alive—and for those who are not, to give them a proper burial in Israel.' The IDF activities were also designed to ensure the safe return of Gaza border community residents. 'As residents return, our responsibility grows even greater—not smaller. It is our duty to establish a far stronger security framework, ensuring they can feel safe and secure here,' Halevy said. He thanked the troops for their sacrifice saying,'You are playing a crucial role in the fight against Hamas, the return of the hostages, and the rebuilding of these communities. This knowledge gives me immense strength to continue, and I believe it is a shared mission for every soldier in the IDF—active and reserve alike. Keep up the incredible work. Thank you. Israeli forces will remain in the Gaza Strip after the current war with the Hamas terror organization ends, Israel’s defense chief Israel Katz announced Tuesday, emphasizing that the IDF will be responsible for the long-term security control of the coastal enclave. 'After we defeat Hamas’ military and governmental power in Gaza, Israel will have security control over Gaza with full freedom of action, just as it does in Judea and Samaria,' Katz said. 'We will not allow any terrorist organization to threaten Israeli communities and Israeli citizens from Gaza.'

Swiss Parliament votes to outlaw Hezbollah	The move sends a powerful message that there is no place for terrorist organizations in a just and secure world,' wrote the European Jewish Congress. By JNS Switzerland on Tuesday voted to outlaw Lebanon’s Hezbollah terrorist organization, in a rare move for the historically neutral country. The ban passed the lower house of the Swiss Parliament by 126-20 with 41 abstentions, after being approved in the upper house last week, according to Reuters. It has not been established when the ban will take effect. Proponents argued that Hezbollah was a 'threat to international security' and that the decision would allow Switzerland to 'take a stand against terrorism.' Opponents—including the Swiss government—argued that the ban would violate Switzerland’s commitment to neutrality, according to the report. 'If Switzerland now moves to ban such organizations with special laws, we must ask ourselves where and how the boundaries are drawn,' said Justice Minister Beat Jans during the parliamentary debate. Jewish groups applauded the move. 'We warmly welcome Switzerland’s decision to outlaw Hezbollah,' wrote the European Jewish Congress. 'The move sends a powerful message that there is no place for terrorist organizations in a just and secure world.' They added that the decision was 'particularly significant for Jewish communities' and Israel due to the ongoing threat posed by the terrorist group. The move comes a week after the Swiss parliament approved a five-year ban on the Hamas terrorist group in response to its brutal massacre in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The European country had previously only banned Al Qaeda and Islamic State, which are on the United Nations’ list of designated terrorist organizations.

Half of Israeli Arabs feel ‘shared destiny’ with Jewish populatio...	Israel’s 2.08 million Arabs make up 21.1% of the country’s population, according to figures released by the Central Bureau of Statistics in May. By Pesach Benson, TPS One in two Israeli-Arab citizens believe that the war has created a sense of 'shared destiny' with the Jewish population, a survey released on Wednesday found. The study, conducted by the Konrad Adenauer Program for Jewish-Arab Cooperation at Tel Aviv University’s Moshe Dayan Center reveals a significant shift in Arab-Jewish relations in Israel. According to the findings, 57.8% of Arab citizens now feel a sense of shared destiny with their Jewish counterparts. The finding marks a dramatic change from a year ago, when 69.8% of Arab respondents said the conflict had weakened solidarity between the two communities. 'The war between Israel and Hamas, the longest in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, has profoundly impacted Arab public attitudes. Yet, amidst the turmoil, we see Arab citizens signaling their willingness to collaborate with the Jewish majority in rebuilding society and politics in the post-war era,' said Dr. Arik Rudnitzky, project manager of the Konrad Adenauer Program. Israel’s 2.08 million Arabs make up 21.1% of the country’s population according to figures released by the Central Bureau of Statistics in May. One of the survey’s most striking insights concerns the identity of Arab Israelis. When asked about the most significant component of their personal identity, 33.9% of respondents chose Israeli citizenship, surpassing religious affiliation (29.2%) and Arab identity (26.9%). Only 9% cited Palestinian identity as their primary identifier. 'This is a pivotal shift,' Rudnitzky explained. 'The upheavals and turbulence in the Middle East over the past year—ranging from the prolonged war with Hezbollah in Lebanon to the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria—have boosted Arab citizens’ appreciation for their Israeli citizenship. While Arab Israelis have not abandoned their Arab or Palestinian national identity, their focus on Israeli citizenship signals a willingness to play a more active role in shaping the future of Israeli society.' He added, 'The prominence of Israeli citizenship may also reflect the instrumental value it holds during times of crisis. For many, it represents stability and access to rights and opportunities, especially in a region marked by conflict.' The survey also explored Israeli-Arab opinions on post-war governance in Gaza. Responses were varied: 20.7% supported a Palestinian Authority-led administration, 20.1% preferred a multinational force, and 17.9% suggested Israeli control. Local Gazan entities received 15.8% support, while only 6.7% backed continued Hamas governance. Discussing these findings, Rudnitzky said, 'Arab citizens are looking for pragmatic solutions in Gaza that can bring stability, but the lack of consensus reflects the complexity of the situation. The responses highlight a diverse range of opinions within the Arab public, which mirrors the broader uncertainties about Gaza’s future.' Despite these divisions, the survey found that 71.8% of Arab Israelis support the inclusion of an Arab party in the Israeli government after the next elections. Nearly half (47.8%) expressed willingness to join any coalition, not just a center-left one. 'This level of support for Arab political participation is unprecedented,' Rudnitzky remarked. 'It signals a readiness to engage more actively in the political sphere and contribute to rebuilding Israeli society after the war. Arab citizens are clearly stating they want a seat at the table.' Asked about personal safety, majority (65.8%) of respondents reported feeling unsafe. However, 63.1% attributing this to surging criminal violence in Arab communities while 24.6% pointed to the impact of the war. In 2023, a record number of 244 Israeli-Arabs were murdered, more than double the 120 homicides in 2022. The surging violence continued to with 205 Israeli-Arabs murdered in 2024 so far. The spike in violence is attributed to organized crime groups fighting turf battles and trying to eliminate rivals. Arab criminal organizations have been involved in extortion, money laundering, and trafficking in weapons, drugs and women. Crime, more than any other issue, 'is eroding the sense of personal security among Arab citizens. The government must prioritize this if it hopes to strengthen Arab-Jewish relations further,' Rudnitzky said. At the same time, respondents demonstrated optimism about regional developments. Over half (53.4%) viewed a potential normalization agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia as a positive step, while 49.2% believed resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should not be a precondition for such an agreement. 'Under the dark shadow cast by the war over all citizens of Israel, both Arabs and Jews, we are seeing indications of significant change. A sense of shared destiny is sprouting between Arabs and Jews that could redefine the rules of the game in the post-war era,' said Rudnitzky. 'This is a clear and hopeful message. Arab citizens are ready to contribute, to engage, and to redefine their role within Israeli society. It’s a message that the authorities and the Jewish majority must hear and act upon.'

‘This mission brings hope’: Israeli, African doctors collaborate ...	Founded at the Wolfson Medical Center in 1995, Save a Child’s Heart has saved the lives of more than 7,000 children from 70 countries and has brought over 150 local healthcare professionals to Israel for training. By Pesach Benson, TPS A delegation of Israeli medical personnel in Zambia is in the middle of a marathon series of life-saving operations on 25 children with congenital heart defects. 'We are delighted to welcome an international team to the National Heart Hospital. The exchange of knowledge and expertise is invaluable, and we sincerely thank Save a Child’s Heart Israel for their commitment to training both our team and the visiting professionals,' said Dr. Chabwela Shumba, Senior Medical Superintendent at Zambia’s National Heart Hospital in Lusaka. The mission, organized by Save a Child’s Heart, an Israeli humanitarian organization, also brought experts from neighboring Tanzania for the open heart surgeries and catheterizations taking place from Dec. 16-20. Leading the cardiologists, surgeons, anesthesiologists, ICU specialists, technicians, and nurses are performing open-heart surgeries and catheterization procedures. Leading the effort are Dr. Godwin Godfrey Sharau of Tanzania, Dr. Mudaniso Kumani Ziwa of Zambia, both trained by Save a Child’s Heart in Israel, and Dr. Lior Sasson, Director of Pediatric Cardiac Surgery at Israel’s Wolfson Medical Center. 'Too many children in Africa suffer and die from treatable heart conditions. This mission brings hope by enabling us to save lives and share knowledge, ensuring that children in Zambia receive care closer to home. Our Tanzanian team from JKCI are proud to be part of this important mission and share the knowledge and skills gained over our own 10+ year journey in pediatric cardiac care,' Sharau said. In addition to the open-heart surgeries, a specialized team will visit Zambia to perform catheterizations. These advanced procedures allow for the repair of heart defects in children without the need for open-heart surgery. 'It is incredibly rewarding to see the doctors we trained in Israel now leading life-saving missions and building sustainable cardiac care programs in their home countries,' said Sasson, who has been training African doctors for 15 years. 'The specialized training they received at Wolfson Medical Center has empowered them to perform complex heart surgeries and train others, creating a ripple effect that extends far beyond Israel. Witnessing the successful collaboration of these skilled professionals, who were once our trainees and are now leaders in global pediatric cardiac care, fills me with pride and hope for the future of children with heart disease around the world,' he said. Founded at the Wolfson Medical Center in 1995, Save a Child’s Heart has saved the lives of more than 7,000 children from 70 countries and has brought over 150 local healthcare professionals to Israel for training. Since 2017, the organization has worked closely with Zambia’s Ministry of Health to strengthen pediatric cardiac care in the African country. This partnership has led to the treatment of over 100 Zambian children and the training of numerous medical professionals. 'This mission represents the best of international cooperation and humanitarian commitment. Israel’s dedication to training medical professionals and sharing life-saving expertise underscores our deep belief in the power of partnerships to create a healthier, more compassionate world. We are proud to see this collaboration bring hope and healing to children and families in Zambia and beyond,' said Israeli Ambassador to Zambia Ofra Farhi. Dr. Chabwela Shumba, Senior Medical Superintendent at the National Heart Hospital praised the international collaboration. 'The exchange of knowledge and expertise is invaluable, and we sincerely thank Save a Child’s Heart for their commitment to training and equipping our team. This partnership is instrumental in building Zambia’s capacity to deliver world-class cardiac care and establish our center as a focal point in Sub-Saharan Africa.'

Israel allocating $64m for tourism projects, including in Judea a...	In recent months, the ministry reviewed 119 applications, representing a total requested investment of approximately $446 million. By Amelie Botbol, JNS The Israeli Ministry of Tourism will allocate approximately 230 million shekels ($64 million) to 55 tourism projects across the country. This will include $6 million in Judea and Samaria, the highest budget for the region in the last five years, and $18 million in the country’s north. 'On assuming my role as tourism minister, I decided to increase investment in the Judea and Samaria region, the biblical heartland of Israel, with its rich history, stunning landscapes and natural beauty,' Tourism Minister Haim Katz told JNS on Tuesday. 'Judea and Samaria are a magnet for Jewish and Christian tourists alike. With this significant financial investment in tourism projects in the region, the Tourism Ministry is working to improve the visitor experience, to make history accessible and increase the lodging options in the area,' he continued. 'As we work toward the ‘day after [the war],’ we are focusing our attention on the faith-based market, which continues to prove loyal to Israel. We invite you to show your support for Israel by planning your next visit within the coming year,' Katz said. The ministry’s allocation is part of a total investment of approximately $114 million in the approved projects, which include an ecological promenade in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, laser shows at the marina in Eilat and the citadel in the Knights’ Halls in Acre, and a walk-on-water experience in Kibbutz Ginosar on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. In Judea and Samaria, projects include accessibility improvements at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, the establishment of an archaeological park in Beit El in the Binyamin region, and the creation of a Psalms Trail segment and park project in Mount Hebron. 'We have distributed the investment across the country,' said Ministry of Tourism Director-General Dani Shahar. Ninety-eight local authorities responded to the ministry’s invitation to submit requests for funding. In recent months, the ministry reviewed 119 applications, representing a total requested investment of approximately $446 million. 'The ministry evaluated the projects based on criteria such as potential to attract visitors from Israel and overseas, proximity to existing or planned accommodations, alignment with ministry and government policies, local authority’s ability to maintain the project, maintenance complexity, and diversification or enhancement of the tourism product,' Shahar said. 'The infrastructures we are creating will offer an unforgettable visitor experience in every place.'

Smotrich declares hostage deal would be a ‘mistake’ and urges ‘cr...	Smotrich: 'Hamas is at its weakest point since the war began. This is not the moment to offer it any reprieve.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Wednesday, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich expressed strong opposition to the potential hostage-for-prisoner release deal. Smotrich told Kol Barama radio, 'Hamas is at its weakest point since the war began.' 'This is not the moment to offer it any reprieve. We must continue to apply pressure and defeat it, ensuring that the hostages are returned under terms that demonstrate its surrender, not ours,' he added. Smotrich continued, 'Deals that involve releasing hundreds of terrorist murderers, who will return to killing Jews, or agreements that see us withdrawing from northern Gaza and allowing a million Gazans to come back and undo the hard-earned progress we've made with so much bloodshed—those are grave mistakes.' 'If we weren't negotiating with Hamas and instead focused solely on targeting them with our sights, tank fire, airstrikes, and the efforts of our heroic fighters, the hostages would have been freed long ago.' Smotrich emphasized that he is fully aware this deal is 'bad, doesn't serve the State of Israel's goals or interests, nor does it lead to victory in the war. It also doesn't bring back the hostages because, in the end, it's only a partial agreement.' Despite earlier reports that Israel was 'closer than ever' to a hostage deal, Israeli officials have denied that an agreement is imminent. Israeli officials with firsthand knowledge of the ongoing talks between Israel and the Hamas terror group poured cold water on widely reported claims that the two sides are nearing a hostage deal. Speaking to Axios, three sources said that there are still major issues of contention between the parties. 'The gaps are still significant. There are gaps that the negotiation teams can bridge, and that is what they are trying to do now in Qatar. In any case, there is still a long way to go,' an Israeli official with knowledge of the talks told Axios. Another Israeli government insider slammed Hebrew-language media for publishing reports claiming that the parties are close to a deal. 'It doesn't help the negotiations. It misleads the public and creates false illusions,' the source said. A third Israeli official told Axios that 'a deal is not around the corner.'

Israeli activists established outpost inside Lebanon, says IDF	Israeli military acknowledges that Israeli settlement activists managed to cross the border into Lebanon and set up tens as part of a makeshift outpost 'settlement.' By World Israel News Staff A group of Israeli activists managed to cross the border from Israel into Lebanon and briefly establish a makeshift outpost 'settlement' on Lebanese territory, the IDF said Wednesday. The incident occurred on December 5th, when activists from the Uri Tzafon movement snuck across the Israel-Lebanon border and set up tents on the Lebanese side of the frontier, near Maroun El Ras. The settlement activists dubbed the outpost 'Mei Marom.' According to the movement's website, the outpost was established in honor of Staff Sergeant Yehuda Dror Yahalom, a 21-year-old Golani Reconnaissance soldier from Hebron who was killed during a battle with Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon in October. During their stay in southern Lebanon, the activists planted cedar trees at the site of the short-lived outpost. The IDF had initially denied the movement's claim that it had established an outpost on Lebanese soil. On Wednesday, however, following an internal probe, a spokesperson acknowledged that activists had in fact managed to cross the border and set up tents, but emphasized that the outpost was quickly dismantled by IDF forces. 'This is a very serious incident which will be investigated. Any attempt to near or cross the border into Lebanese territory which is not in coordination [with the army] presents a danger to life and harms the IDF's ability to operate in the area and fulfill its mission.' The Uri Tzafon activists spent several hours in Lebanese territory, and when confronted by IDF soldiers, left without incident. 'We arrived here in preparation for the establishment of a 'seed' group which will settle the area in the future,' Uri Tzafon said in a statement. 'Maroun El Ras was an ancient Hebrew community named Mei Marom. Yehuda fell in battle in Ayta ash Shab, a village where a group of Kohanim lived in the past. With God's help, we will yet return to all these areas in Lebanon, where Jews lived in the past.' Established in early 2024 in honor of IDF soldier Yisrael Socol, 24, who was killed battling terrorists in Gaza this January, Uri Tzafon claims over 3,000 members in its Whatsapp group. Prior to the Mei Marom incident earlier this month, Uri Tzafon has published material laying out its vision for Jewish settlement across southern Lebanon and organizing demonstrations in northern Israel and hikes near the Lebanese frontier. The group has also distributed flyers and leaflets to southern Lebanon via drones and balloons, encouraging locals to leave the area. 'Caution! This is the Land of Israel that belongs to Jews. You must evacuate it immediately,' the leaflets read, according to the far-left Jewish Currents.

IDF to establish five new reservist brigades for volunteers ages ...	So far, 3,000 of the planned 15,000 volunteers aged 38-58 have signed up for the David Division. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The IDF is trying to establish a new division consisting of five reservist brigades as part of its efforts to shore up border security for the State of Israel, as one of the lessons learned from the Hamas-led surprise invasion of the southern part of the country last October 7. The nascent David Division will consist of volunteers aged 38-58 who would join the brigade closest to their communities and train in response methods so that they can prevent another such mass terror attack. The idea is that in case of sudden need, they could haul out uniforms and weapons, which would always be in their homes, and arrive quickly to the menaced area to deal with the threat. The IDF gave as an example 'a company that will protect the Kfar Yona area if terrorists breach the barrier wall around Tul Karem,' that could be 'activated immediately, put on uniforms, and deployed in defense.' Another admitted goal is 'to lighten the burden of those serving in the existing divisions,' as for example, the volunteers’ service can enable the new Eastern Division on the Jordanian border to carry out more security operations to prevent the rampant weapons smuggling of recent years. The five brigades will cover the borders of the Negev ('Negba'), Plains ('Yonatan'), the Valleys ('Yizraeli'), Jerusalem ('Ari'), and Galilee-Golan regions. They will be purely ground forces, with no armored element, but will include rocket launchers, sharpshooters and drone teams who can use the small aerial vehicles to locate and engage with the enemy. The army is searching for these once-and-future soldiers among veterans of combat engineer units, commandos, and infantry who have passed the necessary advanced courses to become riflemen of Grade 07 or higher, which includes marksmanship proficiency. It would like at least one Bedouin battalion (about 400-500 men), with four companies of its fighters residing in the Galilee and one in the Negev. Another special battalion in the Negev division will consist of Israeli Navy veterans, who are typically exempted from reserve duty once their mandatory service period is over. All the volunteers will have to pass a mental and physical health test, and have clean criminal record, among other criteria. Recruitment actually began nine months ago, but has been slow, with only some 3,000 of the necessary 15,000 volunteers having signed up to date. Six thousand others have expressed interest and 'we are in the process of getting to them,' the army said. The IDF is going to launch a campaign to entice more to join, it noted, with Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi saying that 'Although they are not of the official reserve age, they have the right spirit and understanding of the need.' On the army website describing the David Division, it says, 'Once a fighter, always a fighter!' It invites former officers and enlisted men and women to fill out forms that ask them, among other questions, to list their army profiles and what they did when they served if they were combat positions, and areas of expertise for those in combat support roles, such as training others, communications, and General Staff aides. Training is expected begin in 2025, and will include 'a course to refresh combat skills, combat exercises in built-up areas and complex scenarios, specialized training for commanders and professional positions, and training that will be conducted on an ongoing basis to maintain competency,' the army said.

Conspiracy theories link Syria’s new de facto leader to Israel’s ...	Critics of the Syrian rebel alliance that toppled President Assad this month push conspiracy theories linking Islamist chief to Israel's Mossad, with rumors that the Sunni fundamentalist with ties to Al Qaeda is actually Jewish. By World Israel News Staff The radical Sunni rebel commander who claimed de facto control over Syria earlier this month after deposing President Bashar Assad has found himself the target of rumors alleging he has a hidden Jewish background, that he is a secret Mossad agent, or even that he is actually the president of Ukraine in disguise. Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa, known also as Abu Mohammad al-Julani, led the Islamist rebel force Tahrir al-Sham to victory of regime forces on December 8th, and subsequently declared himself leader of a new Syrian regime. Born in Saudi Arabia to a Syrian family from the Golan Heights, al-Sharaa joined the Al Qaeda terrorist organization in 2003 and actively fought against American forces in Iraq, before being captured. Upon his release in 2011, al-Sharaa established the Al Qaeda-aligned al-Nusra Front - a Sunni force formed to challenge the Alawite-Shi'ite regime of the Assad family in Syria. For years, al-Sharaa maintained ties with Al Qaeda, and was placed on the U.S. State Department's terrorist wanted list, before distancing himself from Al Qaeda in 2016. Despite his Muslim bona fides, following the capture of Damascus, critics of the Syrian rebels and supporters of the Assad regime have promoted rumors that al-Sharaa is Jewish - or at least of Jewish heritage - and that he is an active agent of Israel's Mossad, America's CIA, or both. 'Why is there no knowledge of Abu Muhammad al-Julani's family,' an Iranian X/Twitter handle named Dr. Shahla asked. 'Look it up and make sure. It is very likely that he will turn out to be like Abu Hafs, the preacher of the Libyan mosque, who turned out to be a Jewish officer in the Israeli Mossad.' Another user, operating under the moniker 'Roaring of the Syrian Revolution,' which has tens of thousands of followers, dubbed al-Sharaa a 'creation of the Mossad.' Others have even claimed al-Sharaa is actually Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, The Jerusalem Post reported. 'The terrorist Julani kept dressing, talking and taking pictures like the Jew Zelensky,' claimed Egyptian journalist Hossam al-Ghamry. 'And the media applauds him… Netanyahu is so happy with you.' 'This tells us that Mossad and CIA have a shortage of stylist jobs.' Still others compared the rebel chief to the late Israeli spy Eli Cohen, who managed to infiltrate Syria's military intelligence establishment in the 1960s before being uncovered and executed. 'Israeli Mossad: This is a spy we prepared well,' tweeted Egyptian jurist Salwa al-Soubi. A Danish economist-turned-politician, Mads Palsvig, posted a tweet on X claiming that al-Sharaa is Jewish, and was born as Yonatan Zvi David. The claim was viewed over two million times on X.

A $2,000 soccer ball for Hamas-friendly Qatar and a $1,500 bowl f...	Biden presented Al-Thani with the ball as Qatar faced enormous international pressure over mass human rights abuses in the lead up to World Cup games, which took place in stadiums built largely using forced labor from foreign workers. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon A $1,962 soccer ball for Hamas ally Qatar. A $1,557 bowl for Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping. A $2,310 handblown glass vase for Cambodian dictator Hun Sen. These are just some of the taxpayer-funded gifts the Biden-Harris administration awarded to foreign dictators, human rights abusers, and anti-American world leaders, financial disclosure forms reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon show. The administration doled out the gifts from October 2022 to September 2023, as President Joe Biden and his top cabinet members traveled the globe for diplomatic powwows. While it is customary for U.S. officials to present foreign leaders with gifts as a sign of goodwill, the Biden-Harris administration spent liberally on presents for some of the globe’s foremost human rights abusers. China’s Xi, for instance, received a $1,557.84 'custom glass bowl' during Biden’s travel in November 2022, according to non-public financial disclosure forms submitted to Congress this month and reviewed by the Free Beacon. The lavish bowl was packaged in a 'Navy gift box' and included 'hand-painted White House wood.' When Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to China in June 2023, he presented then-foreign affairs minister Qin Gang with a pewter tea set worth $1,345. The State Department sought special permission to purchase the gift because it exceeded the internal limit of $1,200 set under federal guidelines. During the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, meanwhile, Biden presented the gulf state's emir, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani, with a $1,962 'custom leather presidential soccer ball.' The souvenir included the 'seal and signature of the president of the United States' and was bestowed in a 'custom leather presentation box with inscription.' Biden presented Al-Thani with the ball as Qatar faced enormous international pressure over mass human rights abuses in the lead up to World Cup games, which took place in stadiums built largely using forced labor from foreign workers. Qatar also remains one of Hamas’s top backers, supporting the terror group financially and providing its remaining leaders safe haven in Doha. Jordan’s anti-Israel regime, led by King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein, received upwards of $10,000 in gifts during multiple visits with Biden and his wife Jill. During his February 2023 visit to the United States, for example, the administration gifted Al-Hussein a 'ship’s bell double clock' that featured 'the president’s signature' and was valued at $1,912. He also received a $1,129 'custom handblown green glass bowl.' The administration presented Al-Hussein’s wife, Queen Rania Al Abdullah, with a 'custom handmade 14 karat yellow gold brooch' worth $854. First Lady Jill Biden presented the gift in a 'blue lacquer jewelry box' that featured 'the first lady’s signature.' In May 2023, during a trip to Jordan, Biden presented Al-Hussein with a $2,236 'custom leather stationery set' that included a 'custom hand-painted fountain pen made from White House wood.' On that same foreign jaunt, Jill Biden gave Jordan’s queen an '18 karat yellow gold diamond necklace' priced at $2,400. Cambodian dictator Sen, who served as the nation's prime minister until August 2023, received a $2,310 glass vase from Biden in November 2022. Around that time, Biden's State Department determined Sen's government was guilty of mass human rights crimes, including 'unlawful or arbitrary killings' of political opponents. A month later, during the 2022 U.S.-Africa Leader Summit in Washington, D.C., Biden gave South Sudan’s minister of foreign affairs, Mayiik Ayii Deng, a $1,936 gift package that included 'framed vintage American art' and other valuables. South Sudan is complicit in massive human rights atrocities that include 'extrajudicial executions, unlawful killings, [and] conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence,' according to Amnesty International. Prominent anti-Israel leaders also received luxury gifts. Moussa Faki Mahamat, chair of the African Union Commission, received 'framed vintage American art' and a 'pair of aviator sunglasses' valued at nearly $2,000. As the African Union’s top official, Mahamat has described Israel’s war against Hamas and Hezbollah as 'immoral and unacceptable,' saying the Jewish state is waging an 'unjust war against Palestinians.' Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan—a prominent anti-Israel figure who is said to have 'set back Turkey’s human rights record by decades'—received a $1,078 'men’s presidential watch' in July 2023, when Biden was in Lithuania for NATO meetings. Erdogan’s gift also included a 'pair of aviator sunglasses featuring the seal of the president of the United States.' Far-left Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who landed in hot water earlier this year for making a series of anti-Semitic remarks, received more than $3,000 in gifts from the Biden-Harris administration after taking office. Lula was given a 'steel democracy eagle sculpture' worth $1,123 in January, when a White House delegation attended his inauguration. He got a $2,000 'archivally printed peace treaty from the U.S. National Archives' in February of that year when he travelled to Washington for meetings.

Knesset mulls law to block establishment of a Palestinian state	An 80-MK majority would be needed to give up land or any Israeli territorial waters, or 61 MKs and a national referendum. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The Land of Israel lobby in the Knesset is proposing a new bill for consideration by the Constitution, Law and Justice Committee to help prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state. The law, in the form of an amendment to the Referendum Law, would require either a super-majority of 80 MKs to approve the transfer of territory, or an absolute majority of 61 of the 120 legislators plus a public referendum. Lobby heads MKs Yuli Edelstein (Likud), Limor Son Har-Malech (Otzma Yehudit) and Simcha Rotman (Religious Zionism) wrote a letter to the Committee, which Rotman heads, explaining their reasoning. 'There is broad agreement in Israeli society and in the Knesset that a Palestinian state should not be established,' they noted. 'On our initiative, the Knesset voted on a declaration against a Palestinian state by a large majority. The law that is being promoted is the practical expression of the Knesset's decision.' In July, the Knesset voted 68-9 on a resolution saying that such a state 'in the heart of the Land of Israel will pose an existential danger to the State of Israel and its citizens, perpetuate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and destabilize the region,' as it would soon be taken over by Hamas and turned into 'a radical Islamic terror base.' 'After October 7, the State of Israel will not allow terrorist groups to establish themselves on its borders and endanger the security of its citizens,' the letter continued. 'The Israel Security Law amends the Referendum Law, and brings all areas of the historic Land of Israel and territorial waters within the scope of the law.' 'We consider this amendment important and essential at this time and request that the discussion be scheduled as soon as possible,' they wrote. Judea and Samaria, the region that Israeli liberated in 1967’s Six Day War and which the Palestinians covet as their state, was a large part of the ancient kingdoms of Judea and Israel. The inclusion of Israel’s territorial waters in the terms is a reaction to the 2022 agreement demarcating the maritime boundaries between Israel and Lebanon that was approved solely by the Cabinet of then-prime minister Yair Lapid. In the deal, which each side signed with the United States and not with each other as they are technically still at war, Israel ceded hundreds of kilometers of disputed sea. According to the Opposition, Israel also gave up several kilometers of its actual territorial waters, a claim that Lapid denied, saying that only maritime territory in Israel’s economic sphere was included, not sovereign waters, and thus a national referendum or Knesset approval was unnecessary. Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara had ruled that the only legal requirement was a nonbinding review of the agreement by the Knesset. In all, 26 MKs signed onto the bill, including some from ultra-religious Shas and United Torah Judaism, and some members of the Israel Beiteinu and National Unity parties, which are in the Opposition. In 2018, the Knesset passed a similar law requiring a super-majority regarding giving up any part of Jerusalem. The 'United Jerusalem' amendment to the Basic Law: Jerusalem, Capital of Israel, stated that 80 MKs must approve any government decision that includes the transfer of any part of the city to 'a foreign political or governing power&#8230;or foreign authority,' or changes its status in any way. In all negotiations with the Palestinians regarding the 'two-state solution,' they have demanded that eastern Jerusalem be transformed into the capital of their desired country.

Palestinian gunmen wound Israeli near Joseph’s Tomb	Last week, three Israelis were shot and lightly wounded on their way to pray at the Joseph’s Tomb compound. By JNS Palestinian terrorists overnight Tuesday shot and lightly wounded an Israeli bus driver bringing Jewish pilgrims to Joseph’s Tomb in Nablus (Shechem) in Samaria, according to Hebrew-language media. The gunmen reportedly opened fire on the bus as the driver was leaving the area after dropping off some two dozen pilgrims.

The three men, members of the Breslov sect of Chassidic Judaism, had entered Nablus after driving through an Israeli military checkpoint and fled after being fired on, later seeking medical attention at Hadassah Mount Scopus Hospital, where police subsequently detained them. In June, a haredi Jew sustained minor wounds in a Palestinian attack as he tried to enter Nablus to pray at the tomb site on the outskirts of the city. In March, Jewish worshippers who entered Shechem to pray at Joseph’s Tomb were fired on as they exited the city.

Yeshiva University’s centennial Chanukah gala lights up the night	Donor support has surged, particularly since October 7, as contributors increasingly seek institutions that combine academic excellence with strong values. By Jewish Breaking News As a wave of antisemitism darkens college campuses nationwide, Yeshiva University is lighting the way forward, announcing a staggering $100 million fundraising triumph at its centennial Chanukah celebration on Monday. Drawing more than 500 supporters, YU’s landmark event marked 100 years since the university’s first Chanukah celebration in 1924. That inaugural celebration featured Albert Einstein, setting a precedent for distinguished guests that would later include vaccine pioneer Jonas Salk, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, and President John F. Kennedy. YU’s recent growth has been remarkable, with more than twenty new degree programs launched and its graduate student population doubling. 'Hanukkah illuminates the idea that the seeds of redemption are sown in darkness. For over 100 years, Yeshiva University has been a beacon of light, rooted in academic excellence and a values-based education,' said YU President Ari Berman. 'Even in the face of profound challenges, we rise with courage and conviction to meet this unprecedented moment in history, empowering our students to bring hope, strength, and moral clarity to our society and our world. Tonight, we celebrate the unwavering dedication of those who make this vision possible and the promise of a brighter tomorrow for us all.' Donor support has surged, particularly since October 7, as contributors increasingly seek institutions that combine academic excellence with strong values. The $100 million raised brings the university’s campaign to $520 million, edging closer to its $613 million target. It will go a long way in supporting various exciting initiatives, including the school’s newly announced Honors Leadership Society. The evening honored several key figures, including longtime Board of Trustees member Chella Safra, who received an honorary doctorate. The Wilf Family, owners of the Minnesota Vikings and prominent philanthropists, were awarded the Centennial Medallion for their sustained support of Jewish education.

‘Israelis are gravely mistaken’ to think war against them is over...	Iran's supreme leader tweets in Hebrew that regional 'uprising' against Israel is far from over, even after ouster of Assad in Syria. By World Israel News Staff Iran vowed Tuesday to continue its de facto war against Israel, despite major setbacks in the region, including the loss of its long-time ally in Syria, deposed President Bashar Assad. In a Hebrew tweet Tuesday night, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wrote that 'The enemies are imagining that after the recent developments in Syria, the uprising is already over. They are gravely mistaken.' Earlier on Tuesday, Khamenei's primary X/Twitter account posted an English message calling for the destruction of the State of Israel at the hands of Palestinian and Lebanese terrorists. 'God willing the Palestinian and Hezbollah fighters will see the day when the malevolent Zionist enemy is trampled under their feet.' 'We stand with the Palestinian fighters and the Hezbollah mujahideen who fight on the path of God. We support them and will help them in any way we can.' 'Zionist regime imagines it’s preparing itself by way of Syria to be able to surround Hezbollah forces. However, the one that will be uprooted is Israel.' Khamenei also took aim at the United States in one of his tweets Tuesday. 'Considering what’s happened in Syria, the crimes being committed by the Zionist regime and the US, they thought the Resistance is over. They are gravely mistaken.' The collapse of the Assad regime earlier this month reportedly has left Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on edge, with senior officials blaming each other for the removal of a key Iranian ally. The rebel victory also marked a major setback for Hezbollah, an Iranian proxy force, which earlier this year suffered blows to its leadership with a string of bombing attacks killing dozens and injuring thousands of officers, followed by airstrikes which assassinated Hezbollah secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah and other top officials.

Argentina, Israel mark 75 years of diplomatic ties in Jerusalem	Argentina’s ambassador to Israel, Rabbi Axel Wahnish, said, 'Argentina was for 74 years a partner but now, in its 75th year, under president Milei Argentina has become a friend to Israel.' By Etgar Lefkovits, JNS Israel and Argentina on Monday marked 75 years of diplomatic relations at a gala event at the Israeli Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem, as ties between the two countries reached unprecedented heights under Argentinian President Javier Milei. The event included a call for the immediate release of the remaining hostages being held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, some of whom are Argentinian nationals. In written remarks read out at the event by the South American country’s ambassador to Israel, the Argentinian leader pledged to continue speaking out against Islamic terrorism targeting the Jewish state, saying, 'silence is complicity.' Milei, who has pledged to move his country’s embassy to Jerusalem went on to write: 'The foundation of the relationship between Argentina and Israel is the value of freedom and democracy. In this regard, I have prioritized our bond with Israel, elevating it to an unprecedented level.' The South American leader, who took office last year, made one of his first official visits as president to Israel, where he reiterated his pledge to move the embassy to Jerusalem, visited southern Israeli communities hard-hit in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas massacre and met with Argentinian-born Israelis that had been freed from captivity in Gaza. 'Argentina was the first Latin American country to recognize the State of Israel,' noted Israeli President Isaac Herzog at the event. 'Now, under the leadership of my dear friend Javier Milei, there is no doubt that ties have become stronger than ever,' he added. From ‘partner to friend’ Argentina’s ambassador to Israel, Rabbi Axel Wahnish, said, 'Argentina was for 74 years a partner but now, in its 75th year, under president Milei Argentina has become a friend to Israel.' Wahnish has studied Torah with the libertarian Argentinian leader, a Catholic who has shown immense interest in Judaism. An iconoclast and political outsider, Milei was elected in November 2023 amid a burgeoning economic crisis and skyrocketing inflation that has long beleaguered the large South American country, which is making strides toward recovery under his leadership. A week after his election victory, he visited the United States for government meetings, stopping at the grave in New York of the late Lubavitcher Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. It was his third such visit that year. Since taking over, he has subsequently listed Hamas as a terror organization and called out Iran’s terrorism. 'The future of friendship between Israel and Argentina has never looked brighter,' said Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, whose Argentinian-born father immigrated to Israel 59 years ago, and who was in the audience. Israel’s top diplomat is scheduled to lead a private-sector delegation to Argentina in March to further economic ties between the two countries. Knesset speaker Amir Ohana, who visited Buenos Aires this fall and has invited Milei to address Israel’s parliament in Jerusalem, concurred. 'The bond between Argentina and Israel has never been stronger,' he said, adding, 'Times of crisis have a way of bringing heroes into focus. Milei’s Argentina has emerged as a booming moral voice shaking the world stage.'

Gazans sue Biden administration over Israeli arms sales	Five Palestinian Arabs sue the United States State Department, accusing it of ignoring alleged Israeli violations of American human rights laws, enabling continued arming of the Israeli military. By World Israel News Staff A group of Palestinian Arabs have filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration's State Department over American arms sales to the Israeli military. The suit was filed on Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for Washington D.C. by a group of five Palestinian Arabs residing in the Gaza Strip, Judea and Samaria, and the United States. The U.S.-based group DAWN - Democracy for the Arab World Now - helped organize the lawsuit. The lead plaintiff in the suit is a Gazan woman and former UNRWA employee who claims to have been displaced seven times since the Hamas invasion of Israel on October 7th, and lost 20 family members in the conflict. Three others are Palestinian Arabs with U.S. citizenship, while the fifth is Shawan Jabarin, director of the Palestinian NGO Al-Haq and an activist with ties to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terror organization. In the court filing Tuesday, attorneys for the plaintiffs accused the State Department of knowingly circumventing the so-called 'Leahy Law' - a pair of amendments passed in 1997 and 1998 which bar the U.S. from arming foreign units credibly accused of gross human rights violations. The law was amended again in 2019, mandating that the State Department vet foreign units slated to receive American weaponry for possible human rights violations. The plaintiffs' attorneys argue that by allegedly ignoring the Leahy Law, the State Department can be sued under the Administrative Procedure Act. 'The State Department's calculated failure to apply the Leahy Law is particularly shocking in the face of the unprecedented escalation of Israeli gross violations of human rights since the Gaza War erupted on October 7, 2023,' the court filing reads in part. 'The International Court of Justice has issued provisional orders to Israel to stop depriving Palestinians in Gaza of items essential to their survival, finding that its actions are plausibly genocidal.' The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for [gross violations of human rights].'

Democrats pressure Biden to impose arms embargo on Israel	With just over a month left in office, Democratic lawmakers are lobbying President Joe Biden to impose a sweeping arms embargo on Israel. By World Israel News Staff President Joe Biden is facing calls from within his own party to sharply curtail the sale of military equipment to Israel, accusing the Israeli military of violating humanitarian standards imposed by U.S. law. On Tuesday, a group of 20 Democratic members of Congress, including two members of the far-left 'Squad' submitted a joint letter to the Biden administration calling on the White House to impose an arms embargo on Israel, barring the transfer of all offensive military equipment. The letter, penned by Reps. Greg Casar (D-TX) and Summer Lee (D-PA), accuses Israel's military of violating the Leahy Law, a pair of 1997 measures spearheaded by Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy which prohibit the transfer of arms to foreign military units under 'credible' suspicion of committing 'gross human rights' violations. In October, the Biden administration warned the Israeli government in a letter that it was giving the IDF one month to alter its policies in the Gaza Strip, or face the potential loss of access to American arms under the Leahy Law. In their letter Tuesday, the 20 Democratic lawmakers argued that despite the administration's statement in November that Israel was found to be in compliance with the law, they believe the IDF has 'failed to meet' the standards imposed by American regulations. 'We believe continuing to transfer offensive weapons to the Israeli government prolongs the suffering of the Palestinian people and risks our own national security by sending a message to the world that the US will apply its laws, policies, and international law selectively,' the letter reads in part. 'Furthermore, a failure to act will put Israeli lives in danger by prolonging Netanyahu’s war, isolating Israel on the international stage, and creating further instability in the region,' the lawmakers continued. 'While Israel made nominal progress in some areas, it overwhelmingly failed to meet the minimum standards laid out in the Administration’s own letter.' 'We urge your Administration to adhere to and uphold U.S. law by suspending offensive military transfers to Netanyahu and his government.' 'Failure to do so not only risks our leverage in ceasefire negotiations, it undermines our country’s own national security and weakens America’s commitment to human rights as a cornerstone of our foreign policy.' 'We remain committed to saving Palestinian and Israeli lives. This means doing everything possible to prioritize the release of hostages, secure a lasting ceasefire deal, and move toward long term peace.'

Watchdog: Iran on brink of nuclear weapon, old deal is pointless	Iran 'has uranium at 60% — 90% is military grade — and is thus practically at the same level as nuclear-armed states,' says head of nuclear watchdog group. By World Israel News Staff The head of a nuclear watchdog group warned on Monday that Iran is on the verge of becoming a nuclear state, meaning that reinstating the 2015 nuclear deal is no longer a relevant starting point for negotiations with Tehran. In recent days, the United Nations' head of political affairs called for a revival of the plan, urging signatories - including the U.S. and the European Union - to 're-engage' with Iran. But Raphael Grossi, chair of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said that Iran's nuclear program had progressed significantly in recent years, including enriching uranium up to levels nearing wepaons-grade. Due to the fact that Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities are far greater than they were at the time the original deal was drafted, the 2015 'agreement is no longer useful,' Grossi told Italian news agency ANSA on Monday. Iran 'has uranium at 60% — 90% is military grade — and is thus practically at the same level as nuclear-armed states,' he added. 'We must reformulate the agreement,' Grossi said. 'This is a complex process whereby the European countries and the U.S., Russia, and China will have to sit at the table with [the IAEA] to define a system that serves the new Iranian reality.' In October 2024, Israel reportedly destroyed a secret nuclear weapons testing facility south of Tehran. 'The strike was a not so subtle message that the Israelis have significant insight into the Iranian system even when it comes to things that were kept top secret and known to a very small group of people in the Iranian government,' a Biden administration official told Axios. After the strikes, which also targeted Iran's ballistic missile and drone manufacturing factories, along with its air defenses, Foreign Minister Israel Katz said that Iran is 'more exposed than ever to strikes on its nuclear facilities.' He added that 'we have the opportunity to achieve our most important goal—to thwart and eliminate the existential threat to the State of Israel.'

Report: Hostage deal not imminent, has a ‘long way to go’	Claims that Israel and Hamas are nearing an agreement 'don't help the negotiations,' says Israeli official. By World Israel News Staff Israeli officials with firsthand knowledge of the ongoing talks between Israel and the Hamas terror group poured cold water on widely-reported claims that the two sides are nearing a hostage deal. Speaking to Axios, three sources said that there are still major issues of contention between the parties and that 'The gaps are still significant. There are gaps that the negotiations teams can bridge, and that is what they are trying to do now in Qatar. In any case, there is still a long way to go,' an Israeli official with knowledge of the talks told Axios. Another Israeli government insider slammed Hebrew-language media for publishing reports claiming that the parties on the cusp of a deal. 'It doesn't help the negotiations. It misleads the public and creates false illusions,' the source said. A third Israeli official told Axios that 'a deal is not around the corner.' In a statement on Tuesday, Hamas said ongoing negotiations in Qatar 'serious and positive.' The terror group then claimed that 'reaching an agreement for a ceasefire and prisoner exchange is possible if the occupation [Israel] stops imposing new conditions.' Hamas official told the Saudi media outlet Asharq al-Awsaton Monday that the sides were 'closer than ever' to securing a deal. the Lebanese outlet Al-Akhbar, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, reported on Monday that both Israel and Hamas had demonstrated 'unprecedented readiness' to reach a deal. According to Arabic media reports, Hamas is demanding the release of imprisoned arch-terrorist Marwan Barghouti as part of a hostage deal. Barghouti, a founder of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades terror group, is an extremely popular figure among Palestinians. Israeli negotiators were said to have outright denied the demand. Barghouti, 65, is currently serving five life sentences for his involvement in deadly terror bombings targeting Israeli civilians during the Second Intifada.

‘Antisemitic liar’ – FM slams Irish president over latest slander	Let us not forget that Ireland was at best neutral during World War II,' says Israel's Foreign Minister. By World Israel News Staff Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar slammed Irish president Mike Higgins for the second time in days, after the Irish leader falsely accused Israel of planning to usurp land from Egypt and establish settlements. The exchange came as tensions between Israel and Ireland continue to worsen, with Sa'ar recently closing the Jewish State's embassy in Dublin due to the country's 'extreme anti-Israel' stance. Sa'ar said that Higgins and others in the Irish government are 'encouraging antisemitism' via the 'delegitimization and dehumanization of Israel.' On Tuesday, Higgins responded by claiming that Sa'ar's comments are intended to serve as a distraction from Israel's alleged violations of international law. 'It is a very serious business to actually brand a people because in fact they disagree with Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu, who is in breach of so many bits of international law, and who has beached the sovereignty of three of his neighbors, in relation to Lebanon, Syria, and would like in fact actually to have a settlement into Egypt,' Higgins said. Sa'ar didn't hold back when responding to the latest accusations from the Irish president. 'Once an antisemitic liar — always an antisemitic liar,' Sa'ar said of Higgins in an English-language statement. 'From Lebanese territory, Israel’s sovereignty was breached for over a year,' the statement continued. 'For no reason and unprovoked, Hezbollah joined Hamas on October 8th [2023] and since then fired tens of thousands of missiles, rockets and drones at Israeli citizens and communities. Israel did what any country would — it defended itself against a brutal aggressor.' Higgins' claim of Israeli designs on Egyptian territory are nonsensical, Sa'ar stressed. He 'invented the claim that Israel seeks to form settlements there. In the context of our peace agreement with Egypt, Israel withdrew from a huge area — all of the Sinai desert, and uprooted all of its communities there. This peace agreement has been maintained since 1979.' Sa'ar concluded by noting that Ireland had not joined the Allies in fighting Nazi Germany. 'Let us not forget that Ireland was at best neutral during World War II,' he said. 'At that time, the free world was fighting Hitler’s axis while Ireland sat on the side and did nothing.'

Saudis want peace with Israel, don’t care about Palestinian state...	Netanyahu believes that the Saudi Crown Prince is not particularly interested in a Palestinian state. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Saudi Arabia may drop its requirement that Israel make an absolute commitment to the establishment of a Palestinian State as a pre-condition for a normalization agreement, according to a report in Haaretz. Instead of requiring Israel to promise to establish a Palestinian state, the wording of the agreement now requests that Israel merely 'create a pathway' to a two-state solution. The talks began after the ceasefire with Lebanon with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu conducting the negotiations with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman through Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer. According to the report, Netanyahu believes that the Saudi Crown Prince is not particularly interested in a Palestinian state, but feels he must address the issue to deal with public pressure. Therefore, the open-ended wording that Israel should 'create a path towards statehood' will likely garner political support. In addition, a normalization agreement is likely to facilitate a hostage release deal since Riyadh has expressed interest in the reconstruction of Gaza, a positive for Israel since it would involve a more moderate Arab State. Just a few months ago, the chances of a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia seemed remote. In September, Saudi Arabia suspended negotiations regarding a U.S.-brokered peace deal with Israel due to concerns over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 'extreme right' coalition partners, according to a Saudi outlet. The Elaph newspaper reported that the Gulf kingdom has frozen talks due to worries that Netanyahu's government will not agree to sweeping concessions to the Palestinians, which Saudi Arabia considers a major condition for a normalization agreement. The report blamed Religious Zionist Party head Betzalel Smotrich and Otzma Yehudit chairman Itamar Ben-Gvir for being unwilling to negotiate in good faith regarding 'any gestures' towards the Palestinians. Smotrich stressed in an interview with Army Radio that he would not support a normalization agreement that included 'any concessions to the Palestinians.' He added that although Israel was interested in formalizing ties with the Gulf kingdom, such a deal 'has nothing to do with Judea and Samaria.'

After Hezbollah supply lines cut in Syria, Tehran will ‘reexamine...	The Iranians could try to establish connections with rebel factions by buying them out, thereby attempting to rebuild the weapons corridor. By Yaakov Lappin, JNS Iran’s arms supply lines to Hezbollah via Syria have been severed by the fall of President Bashar al-Assad, leading to an unprecedented strategic setback for Tehran and its Lebanese terror proxy, according to observers in Israel. Tal Beeri, head of Research at the Alma Center, which specializes in Israel’s security challenges in the northern arenas, told JNS on Monday that 'we’re talking about a very, very significant blow' to Hezbollah’s Iranian supply chain. The first reason for this initial near-term assessment, he said, is that the Syrian territory once controlled by Assad served as Iran’s primary conduit for transporting weapons into Lebanon. 'Practically all the weapons for Hezbollah were funneled through this corridor,' which encompassed land routes, air routes through Syrian airports—possibly including the Russian airbase Khmeimim—and sea routes stretching from the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas in Iran to northwest Syria, mainly the port of Banias, from where weapons would be delivered to inland depots. 'That’s how the Iranians moved goods to Lebanon. Meaning, effectively, the entry gate of Iranian weaponry on Syrian soil has been cut off,' said Beeri. 'In the end, control throughout Syria is in the hands of the rebel factions and Kurds, who, by the way, dominate all of eastern Syria, including the land entry routes. So currently, it is not possible to transfer weapons to Hezbollah through Syria.' The second factor, he added, is the large-scale air strikes conducted by the Israel Defense Forces, targeting the entire Syrian military and its weapons depots. This prevented 'a last-minute quick transfer of relevant weapons into Hezbollah’s hands,' according to Beeri. 'For these two reasons, there is basically a nearly complete severing of the weapon oxygen line to Hezbollah,' he said. However, Beeri cautioned that Iran and Hezbollah might yet adapt and adjust to the new situation. 'I estimate they will recalculate and make new efforts … possibly by attempting direct shipments of weapons to Lebanon' by air or sea. Such efforts could see ships and planes travel to Lebanon from Iran via third-party countries to try and deceive Israeli intelligence,' he added. In addition, said Beeri, 'money trumps ideology.' The Iranians could try to establish connections with rebel factions by buying them out, thereby attempting to rebuild the weapons corridor. Professor Boaz Ganor, president of Reichman University and founder of the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism, told JNS, 'The biography of Ahmad al-Sharaa [aka Mohammed al-Julani, the leader of the largest rebel umbrella group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham] points to fundamental hostility toward Israel. His senior membership in Al Qaeda, close to [Abu Musab al-]Zarqawi and [Ayman al-]Zawahiri, could indicate the future trends of Syria under his rule.' Ganor warned that 'we must not let the seemingly pragmatic position he presents recently mislead the world or Israel.' Addressing moves by Turkey to exploit the situation, Ganor added, 'Syria will not be able to exist without the aid of another country or countries. Those countries will become the patron of the new regime, and there is no doubt that Iran will try to bridge past hostilities with the rebels and establish ties with al-Julani through generous economic aid, emphasizing an anti-Israel ideological common denominator and concealing the religious tensions between Sunni and Shi’ite.' (The Syrian rebel factions are mostly Sunni Muslims, whereas Iran is Shi’ite.) Ganor noted that Iran could have back-door influence on Al Qaeda through the organization’s leader, Saif al-Adel, who sought and received asylum in Iran after U.S. forces entered Afghanistan. 'If al-Julani returns to his ideological roots in Al Qaeda, Iran’s influence on him could grow stronger,' said Ganor. That might enable the reestablishment of the weapons corridor if Iran and the new Syrian regime found common ground, he added. On Dec. 13, Israel Hayom reported that Hezbollah’s Secretary General Naim Qassem had acknowledged publicly the impact of Assad’s collapse on the terror group, including the loss of military supply routes in Syria. However, he claimed Hezbollah would work around this and look for new ways to smuggle weapons into Lebanon.

Summit of U.S. and Canadian mayors launch joint initiative to out...	During the conference, a new tool was introduced—the Municipal Action Index Against Antisemitism—which ranks and evaluates local authorities based on their commitment and effectiveness in combating antisemitism. By Jewish Breaking News In the United States, mayors of major cities gathered for a summit against antisemitism, with a focus on honoring Israeli mayors and community leaders. Representing Israeli municipal leaders was Yisrael Ganz, Governor of the Binyamin Regional Council and Chairman of the Yesha Council. The event, initiated by the Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM), took place in Beverly Hills, California, and brought together around 170 prominent mayors from across the United States and Canada. According to the organizers, 'Antisemitism is an urgent and growing threat, endangering not only Jewish communities but also the core values of our diverse democratic society. Mayors have a unique ability to proactively address antisemitism at the local level, where it is most acutely felt.' During the conference, a new tool was introduced—the Municipal Action Index Against Antisemitism—which ranks and evaluates local authorities based on their commitment and effectiveness in combating antisemitism. At the event’s peak, the mayors paid tribute to Israeli community leaders for their steadfast resilience over the past year. Representing the Israeli leaders, Yisrael Ganz, Governor of the Binyamin Regional Council and Chairman of the Yesha Council, expressed his gratitude: 'On behalf of all Israeli municipal leaders, their residents, and the residents of Judea and Samaria, I thank you for your warm support during these challenging times. In meetings with several of you over the past year, and again today, there is an understanding that was not always reflected in the policies of the outgoing administration: those who allow extremists and antisemites to thrive in their backyard may wake up to their own version of October 7—whether in the U.S. or Europe,' Ganz said. 'In Israel, we learned this lesson the hard way. We allowed Palestinian Arabs and Hamas to grow stronger in the heart of the Land of Israel, and now we’ve woken up to the consequences. Despite our warnings that withdrawals from the Land of Israel and concessions to terror would only amplify it, we were not heeded, and this is the result.' He continued, 'The antisemitic rhetoric and incidents we have witnessed—and still see—against Jews in the U.S. indicate a simmering backyard that, regrettably, gains legitimacy in certain circles, even on campuses.' Ganz called on his fellow municipal leaders: 'I urge you, as the representative of Israeli municipalities, to issue a joint call to outlaw the BDS movement in your cities and states. You are leaders of the United States, and you have the opportunity to guide this great nation toward a more moral and secure future—not only for Jews but for yourselves, as citizens of the free world who cherish liberty.' In his speech, Ganz explained, 'The BDS movement is antisemitic, operating under the guise of political criticism. In a free world, it has no place. What began as a boycott of Judea and Samaria’s products has escalated into a boycott and incitement campaign against the entire State of Israel, Israelis, and Jews everywhere.' The Mayor of Beverly Hills, who hosted the summit, announced that the October 7 Memorial, established in the city to honor those murdered and kidnapped, will become a permanent fixture.

One-quarter of Israelis struggle with food insecurity, report rev...	According to the findings, 86.4% of families had to forgo mental health assistance, and 70.8% refrained from buying necessary medications or seeking medical care. By Pesach Benson, TPS One-quarter of Israelis face food insecurity according to a report released on Monday. 'The Alternative Poverty' report, released by a Latet, a Tel Aviv-based non-profit fighting poverty found that one-third of Israel’s children — more than one million kids — are affected. Food insecurity refers to a situation in which individuals or households lack consistent access to enough nutritious food for an active and healthy life. This is typically due to financial constraints, insufficient food availability, or lack of access to affordable and nutritious options. The report noted that 65% of the households supported by Latet saw their financial situation worsen in the past year, forcing parents to cut back on essential items. Eighty percent of the families said they lacked money to buy sufficient food while half said they had to reduce or stop purchasing baby formula. The financial stress is also impacting health-related decisions. According to the findings, 86.4% of families had to forgo mental health assistance, and 70.8% refrained from buying necessary medications or seeking medical care. The report said 2.76 million Israelis — or 28.7% of the population — live below the poverty line and warned of lower-middle-class families slipping into hardship. According to Latet, The minimum monthly household cost for a family of four rose 6.9% over the past year, reaching 13,617 shekels ($3,549) in 2024 — an additional 10,500 shekels ($2,900) annually.

Iranian American tech executive charged in fatal attack on US tro...	According to court documents, the scheme began in 2015 when Sadeghi established a technology company in Massachusetts after receiving funding from an Iranian government foundation. By Jewish Breaking News Federal authorities have charged two men in connection with a years-long scheme to illegally export sensitive American technology to Iran that led to a deadly drone attack on US forces in Jordan. On January 28, a drone strike hit a US military outpost in Jordan near the Syrian border that killed Staff Sergeant William Jerome Rivers, 46, Sergeant Kennedy Ladon Sanders, 24, and Sergeant Breonna Moffett, 23. Forty other American service members were also injured in the devastating attack. While Iran denied responsibility, investigators traced the drone’s navigational system to a company owned by Mohammad Abedininajafabadi, 38, of Tehran, who has deep connections to the Iranian government and military. As the investigation progressed, evidence led them to Mahdi Mohammad Sadeghi, 42, a dual US-Iranian citizen who worked as a product marketing manager at Analog Devices Inc. in Norwood (ADI). According to court documents, the scheme began in 2015 when Sadeghi established a technology company in Massachusetts after receiving funding from an Iranian government foundation. He later connected Abedininajafabadi with his employer through a Swiss front company called Illumove, facilitating at least 14 illegal technology transfers between 2022 and 2024. 'We often cite hypothetical risk when we talk about the dangers of American technologies getting into dangerous hands,' said Acting Massachusetts US Attorney Joshua Levy at a Boston press conference. 'Unfortunately, in this situation we are not speculating.' Sadeghi appeared in US District Court in Boston Monday and was ordered held pending a detention hearing. Abedininajafabadi was arrested in Italy and faces extradition to the United States. The charges include conspiracy to illegally export sensitive technology and, for Abedininajafabadi, providing material support to a terrorist organization resulting in death. A spokesperson for ADI said the company is cooperating with investigators. 'ADI takes its compliance obligations and role in national security very seriously,' a spokesperson said in an email Monday night. 'We have cooperated fully with federal law enforcement and will continue to do so throughout the proceedings. ADI is committed to preventing unauthorized access to and misuse of our products and technology.'

Two soldiers killed in Gaza, bringing IDF toll to 818	The death toll among Israeli troops since the start of the Gaza ground incursion on Oct. 27 stands at 386, and at 818 on all fronts since the Hamas-led massacre on Oct. 7, 2023. By JNS Two Israel Defense Forces soldiers were killed during counter-terror operations in the southern Gaza Strip, the military announced Tuesday morning. The slain soldiers were identified as Maj. (res.) Moshiko Maxim Rozenwald, 35, and Sgt. Maj. (res.) Alexander Anosov, 26, both from the city of Modi’in-Maccabim-Re’ut in central Israel. According to a preliminary probe, the two were killed when a heavily damaged building collapsed in the Rafah area. Last week, three IDF soldiers were killed in combat in northern Gaza. The same day, the military announced the deaths of four soldiers in Southern Lebanon, despite the ceasefire currently in effect there. The death toll among Israeli troops since the start of the Gaza ground incursion on Oct. 27 stands at 386, and at 818 on all fronts since the Hamas-led massacre on Oct. 7, 2023, according to official IDF data. Additionally, Chief Inspector Arnon Zamora, a member of the Israel Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit, was fatally wounded during a hostage-rescue mission in Gaza in June, and civilian defense contractor Liron Yitzhak was mortally wounded there in May.

Israeli troops reported outside of Damascus	Russian report claims that Israeli ground troops were deployed via helicopter to an area outside the Syrian capital of Damascus, possibly in search of remains of executed Israeli spy. By World Israel News Staff Israeli ground forces were spotted operating outside of the Syrian capital city of Damascus on Monday, according to a report Tuesday by the Russian media outlet Sputnik. The report claimed that an IDF helicopter landed near Damasus Monday night, allowing Israeli soldiers to disembark. Sources cited by the report claimed that the IDF troops operated near the helicopter landing site for 20 minutes before moving south. 'Soldiers entered the site and left after about 20 minutes, heading toward southern Syria.' Later Monday night, airstrikes attributed to Israel were reported in the Sitt Zaynab area outside of Damascus. Arab media outlets reported Monday and Tuesday that the IDF has increased its operations in and around the buffer zone along the Syrian frontier. Al-Mayadeen, a Lebanese outlet aligned with Hezbollah, claimed Tuesday that Israeli forces were operating inside the town of Hader in Syria. IDF officers have reportedly met with leaders from local Druze communities, some of which have urged Israel to take control of the area following the collapse of the Assad regime. A report by The Times of Israel claimed that Israeli forces have been operating in Syrian territory in a bid to locate the remains of Eli Cohen, an Israeli spy executed in 1965 after he infiltrated the Syrian military intelligence establishment. Following the removal of President Bashar Assad from power on December 8th, Israel's military has also operated across Syria to dismantle the country's offensive capabilities, including chemical weapons facilities, arms caches, naval and air bases, and missile emplacements. On Monday, Israeli forces decimated Syria's air defense network and struck missile depots in the Tartous region on the Mediterranean coast in what the anti-regime Syrian Observatory for Human Rights called the 'heaviest strikes' on the area in over a decade.

Settler leaders call on Israel to use ‘Gaza model’ to purge Judea...	This front against Israel is a danger that must be recognized and forceful action must be taken, they wrote to the security cabinet. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Judea and Samaria leaders demanded Sunday that the IDF use the ‘Gaza model’ to empty their region of terrorists in light of the danger that this front could easily erupt at any time and cause loss of life that was preventable. In a letter to the security cabinet, the heads of the settlement umbrella group the Yesha Council and local regional councils said that terror hotspots in the Palestinian Authority should be cleared out en masse of their residents, much as the Israeli army has done in northern Gaza. 'The population living in zones identified with terrorism, with a focus on ‘refugee’ camps and known terror complexes, should be moved,' they wrote. 'After moving the population, the terrorism infrastructure should be dismantled exactly as we have done in the Gaza Strip, meaning: any incriminated building to be destroyed, every terrorist to be taken out.' Only such actions would enable Israel to deal with the various Palestinian terrorist groups in a way that will 'exert effective pressure and extract a significant price.' The threat to their population was real, they said, because Iranian efforts to roil the territory was bearing fruit and deadly terror attacks and attempted attacks were on the rise. Just last month, the Shabak (Shin Bet internal security agency) and the IDF seized a large shipment of Iranian weapons that had been smuggled into the region, which included rockets, remote-control bombs, mortar and RPG launchers, firearms and ammunition. Yesha Council Chairman Yisrael Gantz pointed out that there was no way of knowing how many shipments the security authorities had missed, and that the danger was not limited to Judea and Samaria. 'Even a single missile that may have been successfully smuggled into the country, which we are unaware of and is hidden in someone's home, is enough to put every plane landing at Ben Gurion Airport at risk,' he noted. The leaders also asked in their letter that Palestinian movement should be restricted on the region’s roads, which had been the focus of thousands of shooting, ramming and rock throwing attacks a year even before October 7. The letter said that the precarious security situation in the region was 'the result of policies initiated under the Oslo Accords,' and said that 'is within your power to change this, and it is your duty to do so.'

Israeli man arrested for plotting terror attacks on behalf of Ira...	Authorities say the Jerusalem man had spied on behalf of Iran and was plotting terrorist attacks orchestrated by Iranian intelligence operatives. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli man working on behalf of Iranian intelligence spied on targets in Israel, and plotted terrorist attacks on behalf of the Islamic republic, Israeli authorities announced Tuesday. In a coordinated operation in November 2024, Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency and the Central Unit of the Jerusalem Police arrested a 23-year-old Jerusalem resident, Erdler (Israel) Amoyal, on suspicion of conducting espionage and planning attacks under the guidance of Iranian intelligence operatives. Amoyal is alleged to have received financial compensation for his activities. According to the joint investigation, Amoyal began communicating with Iranian intelligence agents in October via social media. Initially contacted by a profile named 'Ariana,' Amoyal’s correspondence was later transferred to an operative identified as 'John,' who managed his activities. Despite understanding early in their interactions that 'John' was an Iranian operative, Amoyal agreed to carry out intelligence-gathering and other assignments, including photographing sites, spraying graffiti, and sending detailed reports back to his handler. Tasks completed by Amoyal reportedly included photographing locations in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Netanya, as well as spraying graffiti bearing the name 'Sinwar' in Tel Aviv. He documented his missions using a GoPro camera and produced a video depicting a vehicle fire. Investigators also found evidence that Amoyal had searched online for firearms, silencers, and explosive-making materials, and watched tutorials on constructing explosive devices. Furthermore, Amoyal attempted to recruit additional individuals, including those with criminal backgrounds, to assist in future operations. He proposed plans to sabotage Jerusalem's light rail system by targeting its power supply and even suggested burning a police car. Video footage of potential targets near the light rail was shared with his Iranian handler. In exchange for his activities, Amoyal received payments in cryptocurrency from his Iranian contacts. The Shin Bet and police emphasized that this case highlights ongoing efforts by Iranian intelligence to recruit Israeli citizens for espionage and terrorism. 'This investigation once again exposes the relentless efforts of Iranian intelligence to enlist Israeli citizens to further their agenda of espionage and terror within Israel,' a Shin Bet spokesperson said Tuesday. 'This is done with the full knowledge of the operatives about their handlers' identities, motivated by financial gain.' Israeli authorities have filed a prosecutor’s statement against Amoyal, with a formal indictment expected in the coming days. His detention has been extended until December 20, 2024. The Israeli police reiterated their commitment to countering threats against national security, stating: 'Espionage for a hostile state during wartime, or otherwise, is a grave and dangerous act that constitutes betrayal of the country. Israeli security forces will spare no effort in bringing those involved to justice.'

Hamas calls to escalate civil war in Palestinian Authority as US ...	Gaza-based terror group looks to enlist support of other organizations as internecine battle between Palestinian factions continues in Jenin, while the US urges Israel to allow upgrading of Palestinian Authority’s paramilitary force. By World Israel News Staff The Gaza-based terror organization Hamas is attempting to escalate an ongoing internecine conflict within the Fatah-ruled Palestinian Authority, calling on additional terror groups to join a battle for control of the city of Jenin in Samaria. In a statement issued Tuesday morning, Hamas urged 'all movements, factions, tribal gatherings, and human rights organizations to mobilize massively' and unite behind a terrorist alliance in Jenin currently battling the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority. Hamas framed the ongoing conflict between Jenin terrorists and the Palestinian Authority as part of the broader conflict against Israel, accusing the PA of serving Israeli interests. 'We emphasize that the continuation of the PA's security operation indicates that it is turning a deaf ear to all Palestinian voices calling for its cessation and for the protection of the resistance,' Hamas claimed, saying the PA crackdown 'serves only the occupation army and its futile dreams of ending the resistance in the West Bank.' Beginning earlier this month, the Palestinian Authority’s paramilitary force, the Palestinian National Security Forces, has engaged in a running battle against Hamas forces in Jenin, as well as the so-called Jenin Brigades – a new terrorist faction centered in northern Samaria established by a member of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement. Both Hamas and the Jenin Brigades joined in clashes with PA forces during an uprising in late July which was ultimately put down by the PNSF. Starting on December 5th, PA forces entered Jenin, challenging the Jenin Brigades for control of the city after Jenin terrorists stole PNSF security vehicles. The rogue group, which has consolidated support within the city from terrorists affiliated with a number of other terror organizations, usurped control of Jenin from the PA in 2022, becoming the de facto ruling force in the city. The Biden administration is urging Israel to allow the U.S. to upgrade the PNSF’s arsenal, in the hopes of bolster the PA in its conflict with the Jenin Brigades. PNSF forces claimed Monday evening to have moved deeper into Jenin, making headway against the Jenin Brigades, with almost half of the Jenin refugee camp under PA control.

Meet Yaniv Bazini, the Israeli college soccer star who could lead...	Bazini’s 14 goals this season are a team high, and he has scored in six of UVM’s seven postseason games, including a clutch game-tying goal in Vermont’s semifinal win over Denver on Friday. By Jacob Gurvis, JTA Yaniv Bazini has scored 14 goals for the University of Vermont’s Division I soccer team this season, making him one of the top scorers in the entire country. But he’s still thinking about one particular goal from well over a year ago. It was Oct. 14, 2023, and UVM was leading Binghamton University 4-0 late in the game — their second contest since the brutal Hamas attack on Bazini’s native Israel only one week prior. Bazini suited up on Oct. 7, but he was, understandably, distracted. One week later, he scored his first goal since the attack, in which Hamas killed 1,200 and took 250 hostage. After netting UVM’s fifth goal of the 5-0 win, Bazini ran to the sideline, grabbed an Israeli flag, and draped it across his back. 'When everything happened in Israel a year ago, I said, well, I won’t really help if I come back to Israel, but I can be the best ambassador, and to show people the real face [of Israel], not the one that they see in the social media,' Bazini, 25, said in an interview on Monday. 'Everybody has such a great energy and attitude towards what we want, and the same goal,' Bazini said. 'Every game, we take it one at a time, and that’s why we got here.' Bazini’s 14 goals this season are a team high, and he has scored in six of UVM’s seven postseason games, including a clutch game-tying goal in Vermont’s semifinal win over Denver on Friday. What a moment #MCollegeCup x @UVMmsoccer pic.twitter.com/VcUKqVggno &mdash; NCAA Soccer (@NCAASoccer) December 14, 2024 Bazini, a senior, was named to the America East All-Conference First Team in 2023 and 2024, and the All-Tournament Team this season. His 30 points this season are tied for third-most in program history, and he’s one goal away from tying the single-season goal record of 15. Bazini was born in Ness Ziona in central Israel and moved to the United States after his military service to pursue soccer. He played one season at North Carolina State University before transferring to UVM for the 2022 season. Bazini said he was drawn to UVM because of the soccer program and its staff. He’s the only Jewish player on the team and has been pleasantly surprised by the outpouring of support he’s received in Burlington, where he’s been involved with the campus Chabad. 'I did not know that there are so many Jewish people in Burlington,' he said. 'Before I came here, I said, well, I’m going to a kind of small place, so I know that most of the Jews are in the big cities. So I did not expect to have [this community], but such a great community.' It hasn’t been an easy few years to be Israeli in Burlington, or at the University of Vermont. The City Council came close to becoming the first in the United States to boycott Israel, pulling a resolution in 2021 amid allegations of antisemitism. This year, the council narrowly vetoed a citizen-led initiative to declare Burlington an 'apartheid-free community,' a protest against the current war. Before the current war, the university drew criticism for permitting an allegedly antisemitic climate, in part over its handling of anti-Israel protest; it agreed in April 2023 to do more to protect Jewish students from antisemitism. 'It’s hard to see that people are ignorant and just antisemitic, or just going with something that is not right, just to be part of something,' Bazini said. 'So it is sad and frustrating, but I think throughout the year and a half that it’s going on, I grew up and understood that it’s a waste of time to talk with them or to deal with that.' He continued: 'You kind of understand that there are those people in the world, and you will never understand it, and you just kind of need to try to do the best to show the face of the reality of Israel or the Jews, or whoever it is, because it is a good face.' Bazini echoed a sentiment that many Israelis have expressed about Oct. 7: that it feels like it never ended. 'It makes you take everything in perspective,' he said. 'And it took me a while to play like myself, and it’s hard until today. You still read the news every day, and you’re still in it, so it’s the same day since Oct. 7.' Bazini represented the U.S. team at the 2023 Pan American Maccabi Games in Argentina. Preston Goldfarb, who coached the team, has high praise for Bazini. 'I have had some outstanding strikers and players over my 52-year career in soccer, but Yaniv is without question one of the purest strikers and most complete players I have been honored and privileged to coach and to remain close with,' Goldfarb said through a Maccabi USA press release. And no matter how Monday’s title game plays out, Bazini is hoping to give Israelis something to be proud about this week. The MLS, America’s professional soccer league, holds its player draft on Friday, and Bazini is hoping to hear his name called. If he’s not chosen, Bazini plans to pursue professional soccer elsewhere, possibly in Europe or Israel. If he joins the MLS, Bazini would be at least the third Israeli player currently in the league, joining the Philadelphia Union’s Tai Baribo and Charlotte F.C.’s Liel Abada. Bazini doesn’t take the opportunity to represent Jews and Israelis lightly. 'It means everything,' he said. 'I got so many messages in the past couple days of kids that are impacted, and not only my soccer, but how I show that I’m Jewish and not afraid of it. By doing ‘Shema Yisrael’ at every beginning of the game or halftime, or every time I score, every time to thank God. 'I impacted a lot of people, and I’m happy that I’ll be in a bigger stage, that I can impact even more people and give them the power not to hide their identity,' he added. 'I had one goal.

IDF order could kick off big expansion of Judea and Samaria citie...	The Jewish population in Judea and Samaria surpassed half a million people, according to a report published almost one year ago. By JNS An order signed by IDF Central Command head Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth on Sunday could kick-start a massive surge in building throughout cities in Judea and Samaria. The military order—which extends the application of legislation related to urban renewal that was previously only in effect within the Jewish state’s pre-1967 lines to Judea and Samaria—could allow for the building of tens of thousands of housing units in the region’s larger cities such as Modi’in Illit, Beitar Illit, Ma’ale Adumim and Ariel. Municipalities in Judea and Samaria can now approve urban renewal projects through shortened planning procedures that do not require political approval. Under the framework, construction projects in Judea and Samaria will reportedly also benefit from significant tax benefits under existing laws. The move was a joint project of the Construction and Housing Ministry, the Defense Ministry and its Civil Administration, the Authority for Urban Renewal, the Israel Tax Authority and other Israeli agencies. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who also serves as a minister in the Defense Ministry responsible for civilian issues in Judea and Samaria, told Israel Hayom that normalizing the area is a 'critical national task.' 'The most important part of this order is that it creates normalization: One law for Efrat and Ra’anana,' he said. According to Smotrich, the order 'will allow for the continuation of urban development in Judea and Samaria, just as it is happening in the rest of the State of Israel.' Construction and Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf said in a statement, 'The approval of the order allows companies and entrepreneurs to promote urban renewal and construction projects in Israeli local authorities in Judea and Samaria. 'Judea and Samaria, the birthplace of the Bible, are an inseparable part of the State of Israel,' Goldknopf said, adding that the change will 'contribute to strengthening security in all parts of the country and increase the supply of apartments, which will help solve the housing shortage.' The Jewish population in Judea and Samaria surpassed half a million people, according to a report published almost one year ago. There were 502,991 Jews living in Judea and Samaria as of Jan. 1, according to the report, which cited data from the Interior Ministry. The 500,000-plus Jews living beyond the 1967 Green Line account for some 12% of all Jews in the Jewish state. The natural growth of the Jewish population in Judea and Samaria is expected to result in a population in excess of 600,000 by 2030, 700,000 by 2035 and one million by 2047, the report added.

By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon The prisoner CNN's Clarissa Ward purportedly discovered and helped free from a secret Syrian facility last week is actually an intelligence agent who served in Bashar al-Assad's regime and helped the brutal dictator torture and kill civilians, a Syrian news watchdog said Sunday. While searching a secret Damascus prison in the wake of Assad's fall from power, Ward’s broadcast team 'made a startling discovery when a rebel fighter uncovered a hidden prisoner still unaware of Assad’s ouster,' according to the outlet.

But Verify-Sy, a Syrian fact-checking group, identified the man as Salama Mohammad Salama, a first lieutenant in the Syrian Air Force Intelligence, an agency that served the Assad regime. Residents of Homs identified him as an agent frequently stationed at a checkpoint in the area, according to Verify-Sy. Salama 'participated in military operations on several fronts in Homs in 2014, killed civilians, and was responsible for detaining and torturing numerous young men in the city without cause or on fabricated charges,' according to Verify-Sy. 'Many were targeted simply for refusing to pay bribes, rejecting cooperation, or even for arbitrary reasons like their appearance.' A CNN spokesperson acknowledged that the prisoner 'may have given a false identity' and said the network is investigating his background. 'The events transpired as they appear in our film. … We reported the scene as it unfolded, including what the prisoner told us, with clear attribution,' the spokesperson told the Daily Beast. 'We have subsequently been investigating his background and are aware that he may have given a false identity. We are continuing our reporting into this and the wider story.'

Israel rolls out first domestically made quantum computer	Quantum computers are particularly powerful for tasks like cryptography, optimization, material science, and simulations of complex systems. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel rolled out its first domestically made operational quantum computer, laying the groundwork for further technological advancements. 'This power will have a dramatic impact on science and the global hi-tech industry. Israel, as a world innovation leader, must remain on the cutting edge of these developments. The unveiling of Israel’s first quantum computer is an important milestone,' said Eli Bin, CEO of the Israel Innovation Authority, which worked in collaboration with the Israel Aerospace Industries, Hebrew University, and Yissum, the university’s technology transfer company. Quantum computing is a cutting-edge field of technology that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations. Unlike traditional computers, which process information in binary bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use 'quantum bits,' also known as 'qubits' which can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing quantum computers to process a vast number of possibilities at once. Quantum computers are particularly powerful for tasks like cryptography, optimization, material science, and simulations of complex systems, but they are still in the experimental stage. Quantum computing also promises to revolutionize computing speed and capacity. 'Quantum technologies are set to fundamentally elevate human capabilities across a wide range of fields,' said Boaz Levy, CEO of Israeli Aerospace Industries. The IAI has made substantial investments in quantum technology, including the establishment of Quantum QHIPU’s laboratory, which focuses on designing, simulating, integrating, and adapting practical applications for the superconducting quantum computer. These efforts involve collaborations with global companies and research institutes. Israel first announced plans to build its own quantum computer in 2022 to establish quantum independence. The U.S. and China are regarded as the leading countries in quantum technology, but other countries, including Canada, Germany, Japan and India are also making advances.

CENTCOM targets Houthi base in Sana’a as IDF preps possible strik...	The IDF is preparing for the potential need to conduct another operation in Yemen, following the air force’s bombing of the Houthi-controlled port in Hodeidah on July 20. By JNS American forces carried out an airstrike against a Houthi command and control in Yemen on Monday, according to U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). 'The targeted facility was a hub for coordinating Houthi operations, such as attacks against U.S. Navy warships and merchant vessels in the Southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden,' said CENTCOM. The strike, which took place in territory controlled by the Iranian terror proxy in Sana’a, 'reflects CENTCOM’s ongoing commitment to protect U.S. and coalition personnel, regional partners, and international shipping,' the statement concluded. CENTCOM Conducts Precision Airstrike Against Iran-Backed Houthi Facility in Yemen On Dec. 16 Yemen time, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) forces conducted a precision airstrike against a key command and control facility operated by Iran-backed Houthis within Houthi-controlled… pic.twitter.com/DlZ9SQcAqX &mdash; U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) December 16, 2024 Meanwhile, Channel 12 reported on Monday that Israel’s military was weighing a strike on the Houthis following the downing of a ballistic missile earlier in the day that triggered air-raid sirens in the greater Tel Aviv area. 'Following alerts that were activated a short time ago in central Israel, one missile that was launched from Yemeni territory was intercepted and shot down before it crossed into Israeli territory,' the Israel Defense Forces said. The IDF is preparing for the potential need to conduct another operation in Yemen, following the air force’s bombing of the Houthi-controlled port in Hodeidah on July 20, according to Israel’s Channel 12 News. The military has operational plans in place and the necessary capabilities to carry them out, should the political leadership decide to proceed, according to the report. Earlier on Monday, an Israeli Navy ship intercepted a Houthi drone over the Red Sea before it crossed into Israeli territory, according to the military. Hezam Alasad, a senior member of the Houthis’ political bureau, said in a Hebrew-language X post on Monday night that, 'The Israeli enemy will pay a price for its continued brutal aggression and siege on our people in Gaza [and] its attacks and invasions in Syria.' On Thursday, the IDF intercepted a Houthi drone headed for the city of Eilat. That UAV likewise did not cross into Israeli airspace. On Dec. 9, a Houthi drone hit a residential high-rise building in the central Israeli city of Yavne, northeast of Ashdod. On Dec. 1, a ballistic missile launched from Yemen triggered sirens in the Judean foothills. The missile was intercepted before entering Israeli airspace, the IDF said. Four people were injured running to shelters, according to Magen David Adom. In July, a Houthi drone killed a civilian in central Tel Aviv. In response, Israel struck Yemen’s Hodeidah Port. On Sept. 29, the Israeli Air Force carried out dozens of strikes in the area of Hodeidah. The targets included 'power plants and a seaport, which were used by the Houthis to transfer Iranian weapons to the region, in addition to military supplies and oil,' the IDF said.

Israel to retain control over Gaza after war, says Defense Minist...	Pushing back on report claiming he told US Israel had no interest in controlling post-war Gaza, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz says IDF will remain in charge of security in the coastal enclave even after Hamas is defeated. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli forces will remain in the Gaza Strip after the current war with the Hamas terror organization, Israel's defense chief announced Tuesday, emphasizing that the IDF will be responsible for the long-term security control of the coastal enclave. Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) took to X/Twitter Tuesday morning to respond to reports in the Hebrew media earlier in the day claiming he had vowed to U.S. officials that Israel had no interest in controlling post-war Gaza, and downplayed calls within the Israeli government to resettle the Gaza Strip. 'Israel does not want either military control or civilian governance over the residents. There are no decisions regarding settlement in Gaza,' Israel's Channel 12 quoted Katz as telling American officials, adding that the Netanyahu government was working to strengthen the Palestinian Authority from Iranian influence and Hamas encroachment. In his tweet Tuesday morning, however, Katz said Israel would maintain long-term 'security control' over Gaza and would retain the right of 'full freedom of action' militarily. 'In response to various publications - my position on Gaza is clear,' Katz wrote. 'After we defeat Hamas' military and governmental power in Gaza, Israel will have security control over Gaza with full freedom of action, just as it does in Judea and Samaria.' 'We will not allow any terrorist organization against Israeli communities and Israeli citizens from Gaza. We will not allow a return to the reality of before October 7th.' In his tweet Tuesday, Katz did not mention the push within the Netanyahu government to resettle the Gaza Strip, 19 years after the Sharon government evacuated all Jewish towns in the area. On Monday, an MK from the ruling Likud party submitted a bill to the Knesset which would lift the ban on Israelis entering the Gaza Strip. In its explanatory notes, the bill says the move marks the first step in Israel's resettlement and annexation of the Gaza Strip. 'The war against the Islamists in Gaza must end with their complete loss of control over the territory. Therefore, one of the first actions the Knesset should take is to remove the disgraceful provision of a ‘no-go zone for Jews’ from Israeli law.'

‘I won’t stop until every hostage is returned,’ Biden vows at WH ...	I am a Zionist,' declares President Joe Biden at his last White House Hanukkah party, as he pledges to continue working to secure the release of the remaining Israeli captives. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Joe Biden hosted the final White House Hanukkah party of his presidency Monday night, alongside Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff. During his address to the hundreds of attendees, Biden called himself a Zionist, echoing similar comments he has made in the past. 'And I am a Zionist,' the president said. Turning to the ongoing hostage situation in the Gaza Strip, where roughly 100 Israeli captives have been held by terrorists for over 14 months since the October 7th invasion, Biden took credit for the release of 105 captives in the November 2023 hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, and pledged to continue to push for the release of the remaining captives as long as he remains in office. 'I’ve gotten over 100 hostages out. I will not stop until I get every single one of them home.' 'I've said many times before, my commitment to the safety of the Jewish people and security of Israel and its right to exist as an independent nation state remains ironclad.' A total of 100 Israelis remain held in the Gaza Strip, of whom 96 were taken captive on October 7th, 2023, while four others were already held by Hamas prior to 2023, including the remains of two fallen IDF soldiers seized by Gaza terrorists in 2014. Emhoff, who was tapped by the administration to oversee efforts to curb antisemitism in the United States, said he was 'rededicating' himself to the role during the last month of the Biden White House. 'Tonight, I am rededicating myself to fighting antisemitism and hatred of all kinds,' Emhoff said. 'Even as we saw antisemitism continue to grow and rise in our country and around the world, I walked around with my head held high, my shoulders and chest back, so proud to be a Jew.' 'And everywhere I went, I encouraged our community to do the same, not to cower and not to live in fear ever. And in spite of this scourge of antisemitism, we came together.'

IDF downs Houthi missile fired at central Israel from Yemen	IDF: 'One missile that was launched from Yemeni territory was intercepted and shot down before it crossed into Israeli territory.' By JNS Air-raid sirens pealed in the greater Tel Aviv area on Monday afternoon after Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists fired a missile at the Jewish state from Yemen, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed. 'Following alerts that were activated a short time ago in central Israel, one missile that was launched from Yemeni territory was intercepted and shot down before it crossed into Israeli territory,' the IDF said. Air-raid sirens were activated to warn civilians for the possibility of falling missile fragments following the interception, the army said. The Magen David Adom emergency response group said it treated five people who were lightly injured while running for cover amid the attack. The injured were evacuated to a hospital for treatment, MDA added. Earlier on Monday, an Israeli Navy ship intercepted a drone over the Red Sea that was launched by the Houthis. The UAV was downed before crossing into Israeli territory, according to the military. Hezam Alasad, a senior member of the terror militia’s political bureau, vowed in a Hebrew-language X post on Monday night, 'The Israeli enemy will pay a price for its continued brutal aggression and siege on our people in Gaza [and] its attacks and invasions in Syria.'

The Iran-backed Houthi rebels have launched multiple missiles and drones at Israel in support of Hamas since the Gaza-based terrorist group’s Oct. 7, 2023, invasion of the northwestern Negev. In July, a Houthi drone killed a civilian in central Tel Aviv. In response, Israel struck Yemen’s Hodeidah Port.

In 2005, 9000 Israelis were evacuated from 25 settlements in Gaza, and since then, many Israelis have advocated for a renewing a Jewish presence in the region. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Likud MK Avichai Boaron proposed a bill that would permit free movement of Israelis and settlement in Gaza, Ynet reports. On Thursday, coalition MKs are touring the Gaza border with a plan to resettle the area once the war is over. The bill declares that 'In the summer of 2005, the Israeli government decided to expel all Jewish residents from Gaza and the northern West Bank, and to withdraw the military from these areas.' 'As part of this decision, the Knesset passed a law to implement the Gaza disengagement, which included, among other provisions, a ban on Israeli entry into these regions.' 'The ban on entry recalls dark periods in the history of the Jewish people.' The bill states October 7th demonstrates that 'yielding to antisemitism can lead to dangerous consequences.' 'The war against the Islamists in Gaza must end with their complete loss of control over the territory. Therefore, one of the first actions the Knesset should take is to remove the disgraceful provision of a 'no-go zone for Jews' from Israeli law.' 'Full freedom of movement and presence should be granted in Gaza,' Boaron concluded. Coalition MKs Limor Son Har-Melech and Zvi Sukkot will lead the tour of the Gaza border on Thursday to encourage the idea of renewing settlements. Both Har-Melech and Sukkot are head of the lobby advocating for renewing Gaza settlements. Daniela Weiss, the founder of the settler-activism movement Nachala, will join them. In November, Housing and Construction Minister Yitzchak Goldknopf said that he inspected the sites of proposed future Israeli settlements in Gaza. In 2005, 9000 Israelis were evacuated from 25 settlements in Gaza, and since then, many Israelis have advocated for a renewing a Jewish presence in the region. In his tweet, Goldknopf wrote, 'Today, I toured the Gaza Strip settlements. Jewish settlement here is the response to the horrific massacre and a response to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which, instead of focusing on the 101 hostages, chose to issue arrest warrants against the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense.'

Israel, Jordan hold secret talks over Assad’s chemical weapons st...	Intelligence officials also raised concerns about Iran exploiting Syria’s instability to smuggle weapons to terrorist factions in Judea and Samaria. By Jewish Breaking News Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad became infamous in 2013 after he attacked his own people with chemical weapons in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta, killing hundreds of civilians and children. Using chlorine gas and sarin nerve agents, Assad carried out similar attacks again in 2017 and 2018 in the Idlib province, killing hundreds more. Assad’s escape from Syria last week following rebel advances has raised urgent concerns about his abandoned chemical weapons stockpiles potentially falling into terrorist hands. Secret high-level talks between Israel and Jordan have emerged in response to this terrifying threat, according to three Israeli intelligence officials cited by Axios. Jordan has positioned itself as a key mediator between Israel and Syria’s Hay’at Tahrir ash-Sham (HTS), the Sunni Islamist opposition group that led the revolution against Assad. Israel’s Shin Bet security agency and senior IDF officers secretly met Friday with Ahmad Husni, the director of Jordanian general intelligence, and top Jordanian military commanders to help secure Assad’s chemical weapons stockpiles and open a dialogue of communication with HTS. Intelligence officials also raised concerns about Iran exploiting Syria’s instability to smuggle weapons to terrorist factions in Judea and Samaria. Meanwhile, Israel has taken matters into its own hands by conducting strikes on chemical weapon warehouses and seizing territory in the Golan Heights, including the Syrian military outpost on Mount Hermon. On Sunday, the IDF announced it has conducted nearly 500 airstrikes on Syrian military targets and destroyed most of Assad’s air force, navy, and air defense systems. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly told White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan that the IDF will 'temporarily' maintain control of the border area in Syria, while senior Israeli officials indicated that the IDF will retain its presence in Syria’s buffer zone for 'several months and maybe longer.' In response, Syria’s ambassador to the United Nations, Koussay Aldahhak, sent a letter to the Security Council protesting Israel’s actions. 'At a time when the Syrian Arab Republic is witnessing a new phase in its history in which its people aspire to a state of freedom, equality, social justice, the rule of law, peace and stability, the Israeli occupation army has escalated its ongoing aggression on the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic,' Aldahhak said. 'Syria renews its call on the United Nations and the Security Council to assume their responsibilities and take firm measures to compel Israel to immediately cease its ongoing attacks on Syrian territory, ensure that they are not repeated, and withdraw immediately according to the areas agreed upon in the Disengagement Agreement.' HTS leader Ahmad al-Shara also condemned Israel’s military actions, calling them 'an unjustified escalation' and urged the international community to help 'respect Syrian sovereignty.'

Global terrorists ‘resilient, determined,’ per US State Departmen...	The United States and its allies adopted a 'tactic more rooted in diplomacy, partner capacity building and prevention' rather than a 'military-centric, U.S.-led approach,' according to the report. By JNS Although the United States and its global partners have had 'key counterterrorism successes,' world terror groups 'remained resilient and determined,' according to the new U.S. State Department report on terrorism in 2023. 'In 2023, Iran remained the leading state sponsor of terrorism, facilitating a wide range of terrorist and other illicit activities in the United States and globally,' the department states in its report, which it is required to file with the U.S. Congress annually. Global terror is 'fast-moving, complex and ideologically diverse,' the report states, noting the Hamas-led terror attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, 'which killed 32 U.S. citizens—with five others still held hostage as this report is being drafted—were a stark and horrific reminder that terrorist groups overseas remain a persistent and pervasive threat to the United States and U.S. citizens and facilities abroad.' 'The ensuing crisis in Gaza has exacerbated widespread instability across the Middle East and globally, with terrorists and violent extremists across the ideological spectrum exploiting the conflict to threaten attacks against U.S. interests worldwide,' it adds. The United States and its allies adopted a 'tactic more rooted in diplomacy, partner capacity building and prevention' rather than a 'military-centric, U.S.-led approach,' according to the report. 'This balance recognizes the full range of counterterrorism tools and ensures a more sustainable whole-of-government and whole-of-society counterterrorism approach with allies and partners around the world,' it states. The report notes that beyond the terror attacks on Israel, Hezbollah’s rocket fire forced the Israeli government to evacuate 'some 80,000 civilians from its northern border for their own safety.' 'Separate from the war in Gaza, Israeli authorities reported 289 shooting attacks in 2023, after 305 such incidents reported in 2022,' according to the report. 'Most of the shootings occurred as Israeli troops entered Palestinian cities in the West Bank to arrest suspects allegedly involved in terrorist activities, but many terrorist attacks targeted Israeli civilians.' (The Biden administration, and some others, refer to Judea and Samaria as 'the West Bank.') The State Department report cited data from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which 'reported 1,232 incidents of Israeli settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, including 871 attacks against Palestinian property, 52 attacks that caused physical injury and 134 attacks that caused both property damage and injury, the highest level of violent incidents in the West Bank Judea and Samaria ever recorded since the United Nations started reporting settler-related violence in 2005.' The report adds that 'settler attacks on Palestinians increased after Oct. 7' and that the State Department 'made public statements condemning Israeli settler violence, and in some cases referred to it as terrorism, including in August following the murder of a Palestinian by a group of armed settlers.' Additionally, 'the Palestinian Authority and the PLO continued payments to Palestinian security prisoners, some of whom were connected to terrorism, and the families of ‘martyrs’ likewise connected to acts of terrorism,' the report states. The authority’s '2017 cybercrime law prohibited the production or sharing of content that jeopardizes ‘the public order,’ including promoting human trafficking, drugs and terrorism,' per the report. 'However, PA enforcement has been inconsistent. Certain official PA traditional and social media, affiliated with the Fatah political party, featured content praising or condoning acts of terrorism.' Islamic Republic The Iranian government, as it has done in prior years, 'continued supporting terrorist plots or associated activities targeting dissidents and other perceived enemies of the regime,' according to the report. It noted that the U.S. Justice Department unsealed an indictment in 2023 charging three people with connections to Iran of trying to kill an Iranian dissident in New York City. A U.K. court also found a man who had ties to the Islamic Republic guilty of gathering information for terror purposes. 'In recent years, Albania, Belgium and the Netherlands have all either arrested, convicted or expelled Iranian government officials implicated in various terrorist plots in their respective territories,' the report states. 'Denmark similarly recalled its ambassador from Tehran after learning of an Iran-backed plot to kill an Iranian dissident in that country.' 'Iran pursued or supported terrorist attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets in 2023, including a thwarted plot to attack Israeli tourists in Cyprus,' it adds. 'These plots were being implemented by current and former members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force.'

New mayor of Florence, Italy, is the first woman and first Jew to...	Today Florence has around 1,000 Jews among a total population of more than 350,000, and a grand synagogue famous for its late 19th-century Moorish Revival architecture. By Rossella Tercatin, JTA In April, when a group of pro-Palestinian activists pressured Florence’s city hall to have the local honorary Israeli consul resign, they also took aim at a politician, Sara Funaro, who was running for mayor. 'We’re sorry that we haven’t heard one word of condemnation of the Israeli government’s behavior from Marco Carrai,' the honorary consul, the activists said. 'Just as striking is the silence of Councilor Funaro, who has actually wished this person well in his work.' Funaro didn’t respond — and doesn’t appear to have publicly addressed the statement at all. Two months later, she won the mayoral election, becoming the first woman and first Jew to lead the city known as the birthplace of the Italian Renaissance. The April petition incident reflects how Funaro, 48, has navigated being a Jewish politician in Italy. She has expressed support for Israel, talked about what led her to embrace Judaism as an adult and, after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, received police protection due to antisemitic attacks. But she also has not placed Judaism or Israel at the center of her career, instead trying to respond to hate against her with a poker face and framing her public persona around her family’s deep roots in the Tuscan city. 'When you put yourself out there in the context of an electoral campaign as mayor, you know that someone will try to exploit certain things against you,' Funaro told Corriere della Sera, a leading Italian newspaper, after facing antisemitic invective last year on social media. 'It happened also in the past. I have always responded with great peace of mind.' Funaro, who declined the Jewish Telegraphic Agency’s request for an interview, comes from a family that has taken leading roles in Florence’s politics as well as its Jewish community. The Jewish community was mentioned in writing as far back as the 14th century, according to its website. Today the city has around 1,000 Jews among a total population of more than 350,000, and a grand synagogue famous for its late 19th-century Moorish Revival architecture. Funaro’s father, an architect by profession, serves as president of the Opera del Tempio Ebraico di Firenze, a not-for-profit organization established to maintain the synagogue. Funaro’s mother, a Catholic, is the daughter of Piero Bargellini, a centrist who served as the mayor of Florence in the 1960s. His term is best known for the catastrophic 1966 flood of the Arno River, which killed dozens and devastated the city and many of its artworks. He later served as an Italian senator. Funaro was born and raised in Florence, where she studied psychology at the local Università di Firenze. When she was 20, she started working with children with disabilities, and shortly afterward, she became an educator in a care home for psychiatric patients. Funaro says she and her brother were raised without any formal religion. But two decades ago, during a stint working with underprivileged children in Brazil, she decided to formally convert to Judaism. Italy’s official Jewish communities, like traditional Jewish movements globally, adhere to the standard that only those born to a Jewish mother are Jewish, but Funaro told the Corriere della Sera, 'In reality I didn’t have a conversion: I embraced Judaism.' 'Both my dad and mom had a very strong religiosity, but they understood it was a very important individual choice,' she recalled in an interview with the paper. 'Growing up, I began studying Torah and Talmud. I held long conversations with the rabbi. At 26, during my experience in Brazil among needy children, I made my decision.' Funaro has remained involved in the city’s Jewish community, attending synagogue on holidays, said Ugo Caffaz, a friend of her father. 'She studied for many years to get converted; she really wanted it,' he said. She first ran for City Council under the leadership of the center-left mayoral candidate, and future Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi. She lost, but won a seat five years later with the center-left Democratic Party, and was reelected in 2019. In the council, Mayor Dario Nardella tapped her to lead efforts concerning welfare, housing,integration and the advancement of women. She’s focused her political career on making Florence more inclusive, supporting the underprivileged, and fostering diversity. She has made a point of attending the city’s Pride parade and helped establish Florence’s first mosque. She has also spoken up against antisemitism, denouncing the use of yellow stars, a symbol of the Holocaust, by anti-vaccine protesters during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, she criticized an event organized by two far-left Florence municipal council members whose posters described Israel as an apartheid state. 'Florence has always been a city of peace and dialogue and does not tolerate divisive messages that incite hatred,' she said at the time. 'Putting up posters in the city stating that Israel is an apartheid state is not acceptable.' In the summer of 2023, she was the subject of an antisemitic attack on social media. An Instagram user called her a 'Zionist to the bone' and a lobbyist for Israel. Later, Funaro received death threats, and according to Corriere della Sera, the Italian authorities assigned her police protection beginning in October 2023, the month of the Hamas attack on Israel. The 2023 Instagram post drew condemnation from Nardella, who called it 'mean and revolting,' and added, 'Sara is a strong and intelligent woman, and I am sure she isn’t intimidated by these insulting attacks.' Like the leader of the Italian Democratic Party, Elly Schlein, who also has a Jewish father, Funaro has said she 'absolutely' supports the two-state solution, which would see a Palestinian state established alongside Israel. 'Anyone who has been to Israel and Palestine realizes that the only possibility of resolving this conflict is a recognition of the peoples, identities and cultures of belonging,' she told Corriere della Sera in July. In the days following Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, she said, 'We need to keep living in the day-to-day, as we have always done,' a message she said she heard from local and national Jewish leaders as well. She added, 'I think that’s the right spirit, of course with a view to the concern and the pain from what has happened.' As in the rest of Italy and globally, antisemitism spiked in Florence following the Oct. 7 attack. 'Some Jewish kids were bullied at school, there have been antisemitic insults against people as they were leaving the synagogue, graffiti, and some unpleasant situations in the university,' said Enrico Fink, president of the Jewish Community of Florence. 'At the same time, we have always felt supported by the authorities who increased security at Jewish sites.' Funaro’s Jewish identity, or her position on Israel, was not a focus of this year’s campaign and did not stir controversy, despite the April petition criticizing her. She has continued to shy away from weighing in on the issue while in office, including declining to comment after the Florence City Council’s vote, just days before the first anniversary of Oct. 7, to urge Italy to recognize the state of Palestine. Agnese Pini, the editor-in-chief of Florence’s newspaper La Nazione, said Florentine voters do not see their new mayor in terms of her religion. 'I think that if anything, for the people of Florence, Funaro is the heir of [her grandfather] Bargellini, I do not think that her religion played a role in her election, neither positively nor negatively,' Pini said. 'Like many others, she received attention from internet trolls, but more for being a woman than for being Jewish.' But Fink said that in the post-Oct. 7 world, Funaro’s election is a positive sign for the local Jewish community. 'I know Sara very well, and I believe she is a good person and capable politician,' he said. 'She has always taken pride in her identity and history, the Jewish and the non-Jewish parts, and in Florence, everyone knows it, so there was no reason for further discussing the topic during her campaign.' Funaro campaigned under the slogan 'Florence in the plural – Many ideas, one city.' Her 89-page platform focused on fostering equality, security, sustainability and welfare, including proposals such as a minimum wage for city employees, keeping public daycares and elementary schools open until 6:30 p.m. to help parents, stationing police in a public park with high crime rates and increasing the number of affordable apartments in the city. Pini said she would not be surprised to see Funaro entering the national political arena someday. 'Serving as the mayor of Florence opens up many opportunities,' said Pini. 'All Florence mayors went on doing something at the national or international level. If Funaro decides to pursue this path, she will definitely have a good chance of succeeding.' In the meantime, the mayor told the Corriere della Sera that she is not scared, despite the attacks against her. 'I have always felt safe in my city,' she said.

Saving lives, building bridges: Emergency readiness fosters coexi...	In the Western Galilee district to which his battalion belongs, Hamed trained and supported teams in 20 municipalities over the past year. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Israeli-Arab volunteers are working with the army’s Home Front Command to improve emergency preparedness in the Galilee in a new sign of coexistence with the Israel Defense Forces. 'In moments of crisis, every second counts. By equipping local communities with the tools and knowledge to act immediately, we’re not just saving lives—we’re building confidence and resilience within the communities themselves,' Commander Wasim Hamed of the 974th Rescue Battalion told The Press Service of Israel. The Basic Self-Help Teams are comprised of local volunteers to offer immediate and independent response to crises such as missile attacks or earthquakes, until better-equipped national rescue services arrive. This model has been nurtured nationally through collaboration with the Israeli Home Front Command. 'At the start of the war, the level of preparedness in many municipalities, especially the Arab ones, was average, sometimes even below. But the transformation has been remarkable. Today, under the guidance of the Home Front Command, most municipalities are ready for almost any scenario,' Hamed said. In the Western Galilee district to which his battalion belongs, Hamed trained and supported teams in 20 municipalities over the past year. Fifteen of the communities in Hamad’s district are Arab, two are Druze and some are mixed. Several of the Arab communities are Christian or a mix of Muslims and Christians. And that means adjusting the training to the local populace. 'In Arab communities, we’ve adapted our training to their cultural and linguistic needs,' Hamed, a Druze from Galilee and native Arabic speaker, noted. 'This flexibility has built trust and allowed us to create a true partnership that strengthens local resilience. Their commitment to their communities is extraordinary and I was truly inspired by them.' Mohammed Awad, Security Officer for Tamra, a Central Galilee municipality of 30,000 civilians, shared with TPS-IL his community’s rapid progress in readiness. 'We jumped from zero to a hundred in terms of emergency preparedness,' said Awad. 'Before, there was little awareness or involvement in these efforts. But now, with the support of the Home Front Command, we’ve trained and retained multiple groups of volunteers who are ready for any crisis.' Awad’s team began with 40 volunteers at the end of 2023 and quickly grew to over 85 in the past year, with teams notably including women. 'The diversity in these teams has become their strength,' Awad stressed. 'Women especially have taken leadership roles, showing that this is about community solidarity, not just crisis response.' Tamra has sustained at least three direct Hezbollah rocket strikes over the past few months, resulting in several injuries among civilians, some of them serious. The strikes galvanized locals to volunteer. For Tamra resident Kheer Abo Elhija, volunteering is deeply personal. 'As a nurse for 20 years, I realize that many people lack the awareness and tools to act during emergencies. When the state of emergency started, I felt it was my responsibility to help, so I gathered a group of friends, and together we approached the municipality to see what we could do,' he told TPS-IL. 'And in no time, our training was organized. That’s how our Self-Help team started.' 'At first, it felt strange having the military so involved in our community,' Abo Elhija admitted. 'But over time, their guidance, advice, and support have been invaluable. They’ve helped us improve, plan, and build a better system for maintaining and expanding our volunteer network.' When one severe missile barrage caused heavy damage in the nearby municipality of Shfaram in November, volunteers from Tamra came to assist. To train the volunteers, sites were needed where complex rescue operations could be simulated. A suitable site was found in the nearby town of Kabul. For weeks, volunteer groups from different municipalities trained for long hours, often after sundown and with loud equipment. Despite the inconvenience, residents living near the training site brought coffee for the trainees to make them feel welcome. 'When volunteers come to train, we make sure to welcome them fully,' Zead Bokai, the Kabul municipality’s Security Officer told TPS-IL. 'It’s not just about drills — we’ve created an environment where people feel valued, whether it’s offering a cup of coffee or ensuring the facilities, such as equipment for area lighting, are ready for them.' 'We’re close to sensitive areas, and during the war, we saw damage from missile fragments,' Bokai added. 'Yet, our town used this experience to learn and improve. Preparation and teamwork are how we’ve managed to stay strong.' Nader Taha, head of the Kabul municipality, praised the Home Front Command. 'The mutual respect and understanding that developed were extraordinary,' Taha told TPS-IL. 'We’re all in the same boat, and if we can help others as well, we’re happy to do so. We have an incredible group of volunteers who participated in every event. They were an integral part of our preparations, perhaps even the most important part. Truly, without volunteers, you realize in times like these how impossible it would be to manage.' Hamed expressed a similar thought. 'These teams are no longer just for emergencies. They’re a testament to the resilience and strength of communities when given the tools to succeed. If you had asked me before 2020 how the army would be received in Arab municipalities, I wouldn’t have believed it. But today, these communities embrace us, knowing we’re here to help them prepare for emergencies and protect lives.'

Sword linked to pharaoh of Passover story discovered in Egypt	According to Egypt’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, besides the sword, researchers found what were essentially ancient mess halls and kitchens. By Jewish Breaking News Egyptian archaeologists have found what they believe is a sword linked to the Pharaoh who was famously told by Moses to 'Let My People Go' as recounted in the Torah. The 3,200-year-old bronze ceremonial sword bearing the name Ramses II in hieroglyphics was discovered in the remains of an ancient military complex at Tell Al-Abqain. While the exact age of the fortress remains uncertain, it operated during the reign of Ramses II who held Egypt’s second-longest rule (1279-1213 BC). This period, known as the New Kingdom, was marked by economic and political prosperity but also war. Under Ramses II’s leadership, whose name was also found inscribed on limestone at the site, Egypt engaged in multiple conflicts with the Hittites and Libyans. Of course, he is famously referenced in the Torah as the ruler who refused to let his Jewish slaves free until the 10 plagues rained upon his kingdom. According to Egypt’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, besides the sword, researchers found what were essentially ancient mess halls and kitchens. The soldiers had dedicated storage areas filled with large grain bins and massive clay pots still containing old fish and animal bones. They even uncovered the remains of cylindrical clay ovens where meals were once prepared. The excavation also yielded a wealth of personal belongings from the soldiers’ daily lives, including military weapons, hunting equipment, personal adornments, and ivory kohl applicators. Necklaces crafted from carnelian and faience beads, along with a partial bronze ring as well as various scarab beetle artifacts referencing Egyptian deities were unearthed at the site as well. Notably, archaeologists found a cow burial site, significant given the ancient Egyptians’ view of cattle as symbols of divine power, strength, and prosperity. This ritual finds a compelling parallel in the biblical Passover story, when the Jews sacrificed sheep – animals the Egyptians revered as gods – to symbolize their freedom.'

Assad makes first public statement since fleeing Syria	Exiled former Syrian President Bashar Assad details his departure from the country after rebels seized control, claiming he 'fought on until the end.' By World Israel News Staff Exiled Syrian President Bashar Assad, who was deposed last Sunday after an alliance of anti-government forces seized control of the capital city, spoke out publicly for the first time since the collapse of his regime. In a statement published via Telegram Monday afternoon, Assad wrote that he had not planned to flee Syria, claiming instead that he remained on as long as he could and left the country only after Moscow implored him to do so. 'My departure from Syria was neither planned nor did it occur during the final hours of the battles, as some have claimed,' Assad wrote. 'On the contrary, I remained in Damascus, carrying out my duties until the early hours of Sunday, December 8, 2024. As terrorist forces infiltrated Damascus, I moved to Latakia in coordination with our Russian allies to oversee combat operations.' 'Upon arrival at the Hmeimim airbase that morning, it became clear that our forces had completely withdrawn from all battle lines and that the last army positions had fallen.' The deposed Syrian leader claimed he finally agreed to Russia's request to leave the country 'following the collapse of the final military positions and the resulting paralysis of all remaining state institutions.' 'At no point during these events did I consider stepping down or seeking refuge, nor was such a proposal made by any individual or party. The only course of action was to continue fighting against the terrorist onslaught,' he said. The 59-year-old former ruler added that he would not negotiate with anti-regime forces, saying he 'refused to barter the salvation of his nation for personal gain or to compromise his people in exchange for numerous offers and enticements.' 'I stood alongside the officers and soldiers of the army on the front lines, just meters from terrorists in the most dangerous and intense battlefields,' he said. Assad boasted that he had 'never abandoned the resistance in Palestine and Lebanon nor betrayed his allies who stood by him,' arguing that he could not 'forsake his own people or betray the army and nation to which he belongs.'

Israeli DM and Hamas say they are ‘closer than ever to hostage de...	Hamas official and Israel's defense minister say negotiations are now closer than ever to a breakthrough on a ceasefire and hostage deal. By World Israel News Staff Talks between Israel and the Hamas terror organization, brokered by Egypt and Qatar, are 'closer than ever' to reaching a breakthrough that could lead to a hostage deal and ceasefire agreement, Israel's defense chief told the Knesset on Monday. Speaking with the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) said that while he could not provide details, the current proposal on the table will secure the support of most Israelis, adding that an agreement now appears to be in the offing. 'There will be a vast majority in support of the deal that is on the table. We've never been closer, but the less we say, the better. Katz hinted that recent reports that Hamas has softened its position regarding a key Israeli demand - continued IDF control over strategic areas in the Gaza Strip including the Egyptian-Gaza border and the Netzarim zone in central Gaza - are correct. 'I placed the hostages' return at the top of the Ministry's priority list. The Philadelphi Corridor and the Netzarim Corridor will not be an obstacle to implementing a deal. There is flexibility from the other side on these issues,' he said. Also on Monday, a Hamas official told the Saudi media outlet Asharq al-Awsat that talks with Israel are 'closer than ever' to reaching a breakthrough, echoing Katz's comments. 'We are closer than ever to reaching a prisoner exchange deal and a ceasefire, provided that Netanyahu does not obstruct the agreement,' the official said. Hamas has now adopted a 'progressive and highly flexible position,' he added, including the acceptance of an extended IDF presence in Gaza, with the Israeli military gradually withdrawing in phases. Earlier on Monday, the pro-Hezbollah Al-Akhbar outlet in Lebanon reported that both Israel and Hamas had demonstrated 'unprecedented readiness' to reach a deal.

Podcaster Candace Owens named Antisemite of the Year	StopAntisemitism crowns conservative pundit Candace Owens, who compared pushed medieval blood libels and allegations of 'secret Jewish gangs,' as Antisemite of the Year for 2024, beating out pro-Hamas climate activist Greta Thunberg. By World Israel News Staff Conservative podcaster Candace Owens has been named this year's Antisemite of the Year by a watchdog group monitoring anti-Jewish bigotry, after the former Daily Wire personality pushed antisemitic blood libels and a host of conspiracy theories aimed at Jews. On Sunday, StopAntisemitism announced that Owens, 35, had received over 30,000 votes in the annual Antisemite of the Year poll, beating out climate activist Greta Thunberg. 'Owens edged out Hamas apologist Greta Thunberg and terror-supporting Twitch streamer Hasan Piker for the title, inheriting the dishonor from 2022 winner, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib,' StopAntisemitism said. 'Once celebrated for her unapologetic takes that catapulted her into the conservative spotlight, Owens was given platforms by prominent Jewish conservatives like Dennis Prager and Ben Shapiro. But after Hamas’ October 7th massacre, she revealed her shocking antisemitism, leading to her departure from the Shapiro's Daily Wire and condemnation from PragerU.' 'Owens’ remarks were so vile that even evangelical and conservative groups denounced her, including her father-in-law, Sir Michael Farmer. In addition, She’s been banned from countries like New Zealand and Australia, blaming the fallout on a 'Zionist media empire.'' 'From defending Hitler’s actions in Germany and mocking Jewish fears over Kanye West’s antisemitic tweets to claiming Israel forces Muslims into segregated quarters and insinuating Hollywood is run by 'sinister Jewish gangs', Owens has been rightfully crowned 2024’s Antisemite of the Year.' Owens responded to the announcement in a series of tweets, comparing StopAntisemitism to the Black Lives Matter movement. 'Obviously I will prepare an acceptance speech for my show tomorrow. So many people to thank.' 'The ratio under this post is incredible lol. Zionists are completely out of touch. Reminiscent of BLM in 2020 running around calling everything and everyone racist. From excruciatingly annoying, to mildly entertaining to utterly obsolete. We are all fatigued with ‘antisemitism’.' Once a prominent personality in The Daily Wire's lineup, Owens parted ways with the conservative platform in March, following a series of controversial comments regarding Israel, Jews, and Daily Wire cofounder Ben Shapiro. Along with promoting claims of an evil 'Zionist empire' controlling world affairs and Jewish-run Hollywood sex gangs, Owens has also challenged the historical veracity of the Holocaust and even appeared to offer a defense of Adolf Hitler. 'We have been indoctrinated and we actually know nothing about the person other than the fact that we must fear him,' Owens said in July. In the same podcast, Owens cast doubt on the Holocaust, calling it 'an ethnic cleansing [that] almost took place,' while accusing the Allied powers of ethnically cleansing Germans in Eastern Europe. The Allied powers, she claimed, 'ethnically cleansed 12 million Germans&#8230; in the exact same [concentration] camps that we then transferred the Germans into so that we could mass kill them.' Owens also denied the experiments - often deadly - conducted by the SS officer Josef Mengele, calling documentation of the experiments 'bizarre propaganda.' 'The idea that they just cut a human up and then sewed them back together. Why would you do that? Even if you're the most evil person in the world, that's a tremendous waste of time and supplies.'

Hamas pushing for release of top terrorist in hostage deal: Repor...	Hamas said to be demanding Israel free Marwan Barghouti, who is currently serving five life sentences for his involvement in deadly terror attacks. By World Israel News Staff Hamas is demanding the release of imprisoned arch-terrorist Marwan Barghouti as part of a hostage deal that would see the terror group release Israeli captives held in the Gaza Strip for more than a year, according to Arabic media reports. Barghouti, 65, is currently serving five life sentences for his involvement in deadly suicide bombings during the Second Intifada. A founder of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades terror group, Barghouti is an extremely popular figure among Palestinians, with polls finding he would easily win a Palestinian Authority election for president. Releasing Barghouti is a non-starter for Israel, according to the reports, and Israeli negotiators have outright denied the demand. 'Israel has a vision of alternative lists of Palestinian prisoners, including people who were recently arrested, which could delay the drafting of the agreement,' an Egyptian source told Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, which is affiliated with Hezbollah. The source added that Israel wants to exile the released prisoners to third countries, rather allowing them to return to PA-conrolled enclaves in Judea and Samaria or the Gaa Strip. This condition 'may be accepted by the mediators as a compromise to end this new obstacle,' the source said. A Hamas official, speaking anonymously, told a Saudi outlet on Monday that Israel and the terror group were 'closer than ever to reaching a ceasefire and prisoner exchange deal.' However, the group specified that the deal could only come to fruition 'if [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu does not obstruct the agreement,' urging the Biden administration to increase its pressure on the Israeli government. The Hamas official claimed that the terror group has demonstrated 'great flexibility,' including approving a 'gradual end to the war and a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces according to an agreed-upon timetable, and guarantees from international mediators.'

IDF to secure Judea & Samaria with border system overrun on Octob...	Hamas mostly neutralized those on the Gaza border on Oct. 7; army says the systems are now better protected. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The IDF is planning to install numerous remote firing platforms to safeguard villages in Judea and Samaria from Palestinian attacks, Army Radio reported Sunday. The 'Shoot on Sight' systems, which are already being produced, consist of an observation tower strewn with cameras and intelligence-collection equipment, and a firing system that soldiers can control remotely, thereby minimizing the operators’ contact with the enemy. Female observers of Unit 636, the intelligence collection unit of the Judea and Samaria Division, will be trained to use the systems. In case of need, they will also be able to fire manually at terrorists attempting to infiltrate the Jewish communities, the report said. In the initial stage, the IDF will set up the platforms in places it defines as the most threatened, with dozens planned for either the entrances to villages or commanding positions in the area. The systems have been in use since 2008, but only on the border with Gaza. Critics have questioned their efficacy, as during the Hamas invasion last October 7, the terrorists neutralized most of the platforms in less than a minute by sending 140 drones simultaneously to drop explosives on the cameras and firing systems, rendering them useless. The few that were not hit operated effectively, killing dozens of terrorists, but overall, the IDF’s forward 'eyes and ears' were lost, leading to an inability to form an accurate picture of what was happening and effectively slowing down the army’s response. The IDF has reportedly said that it has learned its lessons from what happened last year, and has both improved the platforms’ defensive capabilities against such aerial threats and upgraded their operating systems. Other Hebrew-language media questioned whether the IDF was again deciding to rely too much on technological means to secure the country’s citizens. In Judea and Samaria specifically, the regional council heads have begged for years for the IDF to be proactive instead of reactive, considering the danger that the Palestinian Authority poses to their communities in its active encouragement of terrorism and the number of men it has under arms. 'The Palestinian police…are an army for all intents and purposes, armed with automatic weapons and undergoing military training' that can easily be turned against Israel instead of Hamas, the leaders wrote in an open letter to the security cabinet Sunday, after the PA sent forces into Jenin to fight its Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas rivals. The 'Shoot on Sight' systems are expected to become operational in the coming months.

Actor offers blistering response to ‘Free Palestine’ congressman	7 days in Judea and Samaria on me' - Actor Michael Rapaport offers to fly Squad members and vocal Israel critics Jamaal Bowman and Cori Bush to Ramallah. By World Israel News Staff Actor and comedian Michael Rapaport took aim last week at a pair of outgoing members of Congress and outspoken critics of Israel, suggesting the two visit the Palestinian Authority in person. On Friday, Rapaport took to X in response to statements on the House floor by New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman and Missouri Rep. Cori Bush. Both Bush and Bowman lost their Democratic primary elections this year, after facing criticism over their stances on Israel. 'Free Palestine, free the Bronx, and free all marginalized people,' Bowman said, joined by Bush, during a House address last Thursday, in a video clip posted by Rapaport. 'Since Jamaal Bowman [and] Cori Bush are now unemployed & sooooo interested in and fascinated by Gaza, I’m offering to fly them to ISRAEL & have a SUV drop them off in RAMALLAH,' Rapaport wrote. '7 Days in Judea Samaria on Me. I will add $150 a day per diem. You guys down?' Comedian and podcaster Dave Rubin responded to Rapaport's tweet, writing: 'I will throw in 20K if they wear a sign that says JEW on their shirt while visiting…' Bowman expressed outrage over the tweet, calling Rapaport a 'clown' and a 'culture vulture.' 'Behold culture vulture Michael Rapaport. We let him in and he represents nothing that Hip Hop stands for. A clown of epic porportions [sic].' 'Is this some sort of threat? I’ve been to Ramallah. Hebron as well. Why don’t you take a trip with Encounter or Breaking the Silence Israel so you might learn something. You won’t because you embody fake Twitter gangsta blowhard shit.

In first since 1967, Syrian mayor meets Israeli officers	Residents of six Druze villages in the Golan have expressed a desire to have them annexed by Israel. By JNS Community leaders in the Syrian side of the Golan, including at least one mayor, openly met with IDF officers holding the area, an Israeli newspaper reported on Sunday. That revelation coincided with reports of a desire by some Druze villagers in Syria to have their communities come under Israeli rule. In one meeting, the mayor of an unnamed village in Syria met with three Israelis, two of them army officers visible in a photograph published on the cover of Yediot Achronot. Wearing full gear and toting assault rifles, the officers, one of them a captain, are seen conversing in what looks like a conference room with a man wearing traditional Arab garb. 'Other meetings are also happening, the fear barrier from the Assad regime has been breached and there are new opportunities for cooperation, including economically, that are already being worked out,' an unnamed Israeli officer told the paper. The meetings are the first of their kind in over 50 years. Israel seized controlling positions in nearby Syria last week following the fall of the regime of Bashar Assad. Israel has also carried out many airstrikes in Syria in a bid to destroy weapons it does not want to see fall into the hands of the Islamists who deposed Assad, Syria, Iran or other regional players. The Israeli side of the Golan Heights, which Israel took from Syria in 1967 and de facto annexed in 1981, passing the Golan Heights Law and applying Israel’s government and laws there, has about 20,000 Druze residents in four thriving villages that have coexisted harmoniously with the area’s majority Jewish population and the hundreds of thousands of tourists who visit the area annually. Leaders and most members of that community have long defined themselves publicly as Syrian citizens living under occupation and declined to take up Israeli citizenship. This was largely understood as a policy of deniability in case the Golan is returned to Syria under the dictatorship of Assad, an Iranian ally whose late father, Hafez, waged several wars against Israel. Israel has another 150,000 Druze who are citizens elsewhere in the country, mainly in the Galilee. Syria has about 600,000 Druze while Lebanon has some 250,000. In recent years, the number of Golan Druze who took up Israeli citizenship has skyrocketed, along with participation in municipal elections. However, a large majority of Golan Druze have not done either. The outbreak of the civil war in Syria in 2011, which set the scene for Assad’s ouster, convinced many Golan Druze to become Israeli. Six Druze villages Against this backdrop, a Kurdish news site, Kurdistan News24, reported on Friday that residents of six Druze villages in the Golan have expressed a desire to have them annexed by Israel. A leader of the village of Hader, which is currently under Israeli control and is situated about two miles east of the Druze Israeli town of Majdal Shams, reportedly also said this. The issue was discussed at a meeting Friday in Hader, Kurdistan News24 reported in an article that featured a video from that meeting. It shows a man speaking before about 200 people, reportedly in Hader, asking them: 'What’s our fate, my brothers?' with the crowd responding: 'Israel.' He continued, according to a translation of the speech: 'In the name of all the people of Hader, and if anyone objects, please say,' with no objections heard. 'If we have to choose, we will choose the lesser evil, and even if it’s considered evil to ask to be annexed to the [Israeli] Golan. But it’s a much lesser evil than the evil coming our way. … That evil might take our women, might take our daughters. They might take our homes.' The man also said: 'We want to be annexed to the Israeli Golan to preserve our dignity, and this applies to all of the region’s villages, because their fate is no different. We want to join our people in the Golan and live with freedom and honor.' Israel’s Defense Minister Israel Katz and other officials said the deployment in Syria was temporary. Uri Heitner, a former leader of Golan communities and a resident of Kibbutz Ortal there, welcomed the appeal to annex Druze villages. 'We certainly shouldn’t reject the idea,' he said. Heitner, who led the fight against plans by the Labor Party to return the Golan to Syria in the 1990s, said Israel could work to establish a Druze state or autonomous region from the Hermon in the northern Golan Heights to Jabal al-Druze, situated about 50 miles southeast of the Hermon. 'Another option is to agree to annex the villages, along with a far wider strip of land that would meet the security interests of Israel,' Heitner wrote in his blog on Saturday. He also analyzed the desire to come under Israeli control by some Druze Syrians, whose communities have family ties with the Israeli ones across the border. 'Over the past 58 years, the Druze of the eastern Golan witnessed the freedom and prosperity enjoyed by their brethren in the Golan in the thriving, democratic State of Israel, compared to their life under tyranny and financial stagnation, and then the decline during the civil war,' Heitner wrote. But the main reason for seeking to come under Israeli control, he added, 'is the fear of Syria becoming an ISIS- or Hamas-style Islamic state, where the Druze would be persecuted and oppressed in the best-case scenario, and end up as the Yazidis did in the worst one.'

Report: Israel and Hamas close to deal – but can’t agree on numbe...	Israel and Hamas both reportedly prepared to compromise in order to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal, with the sole major stumbling block being the number of hostages to be released during the truce. By World Israel News Staff Israel and Hamas are closer now than at any point in the past year to reaching a ceasefire and a hostage deal, according to a report Monday, though one major bone of contention has yet to be resolved. According to a report by Lebanon's Al-Akhbar newspaper, a pro-Hezbollah outlet, both sides are eager to reach a deal which would temporarily halt the fighting in Gaza and secure the release of some of the remaining 100 Israeli captives being held in the coastal enclave. Israel estimates that only half of the 100 hostages are still alive. An Israeli official quoted by Ha'aretz Sunday suggested a major breakthrough was near, and that a deal could be signed as early as Christmas Day and implemented by President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20th. However, a report by Israel's Channel 13 News claimed that Hamas and Israel remain divided over how many hostages will be released during the ceasefire. The report said that Hamas is pushing to reduce the number of hostages to be freed, while Israel is insisting on a larger number, with Jerusalem treating the issue as a non-negotiable red line in talks. Ha'aretz reported that the constantly changing condition of the remaining Israeli hostages has also complicated talks, with several captives who were slated for release in a possible deal being murdered or dying in captivity, while others who were not slated for release have suffered from worsening health, which make put them in the category of seriously ill hostages who would be released under the current deal proposal under consideration. The current framework would see the release of several dozen hostages, including women and children along with elderly and seriously ill captives, in addition to several American citizens. In exchange, Israel would released hundreds of jailed Palestinian terrorists during an extended truce, which could last as long as 60 days.

Israel appeals ICC arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Gallant	The appeals concern alleged procedural flaws in the ICC prosecutor’s office under chief prosecutor Karim Khan. By JNS Israel on Friday appealed the arrest warrants issued against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant by the International Criminal Court. The warrants, which Israel and the United States, along with other countries, have rejected and dismissed, accuse the Israeli leaders of committing crimes against humanity and war crimes between Oct. 8, 2023, and May 20, 2024, in Gaza. One of the allegations concerns 'starvation.' Oren Marmorstein, a spokesperson for Israel’s Foreign Ministry, confirmed to NBC News that the appeal had been filed. He described the charges as 'baseless accusations' and asserted Israel’s intent to 'defend the justice of its positions' and oppose what it sees as a 'miscarriage of justice.' Netanyahu has compared the warrants to the trial of Alfred Dreyfus, a Jew who was falsely accused of treason in France in 1894. The appeals do not deal with the allegations, which Israel says are belied by the massive flow of aid into Gaza that it has facilitated, as well as by its efforts to avoid killing civilians—including at the cost of exposing its own troops to elevated risk. Instead, the appeals concern alleged procedural flaws on the part of the ICC prosecutor’s office under chief prosecutor Karim Khan. One of the appeals, penned in November and submitted on Friday, focuses on the jurisdiction of the tribunal, which operates under the Rome Statute. Israel is not a party to the Statute and not a member of the ICC and therefore cannot be tried by it. The court is basing its jurisdiction on the fact that the Palestinian Authority, registered as The State of Palestine, joined it in 2015. But that entity is not universally recognized. 'The court’s legitimacy depends, in equal measure, both on the effective discharge of its mandate, and on adherence to its jurisdictional limitations,' the Israeli appeal says. The second appeal concerns the issue of notification, and alleges that the ICC failed to properly notify the Israelis it went after that it was preparing to prosecute them, relying on a 2021 notification instead of issuing a new one in connection with the war in Gaza.

Damascus Jew says new regime has not harmed the tiny community	Synagogues are safe, and 'We are not afraid,' Damascus Jew says. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News One of the last remaining Jews in Syria told Israel's Channel 11 Sunday that the new regime that swept into power a week ago has not harmed the country's tiny community. Although the major group in charge, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), is a Sunni Muslim extremist element, the source said, 'We are not afraid.' He acknowledged that on the first day the rebels took Damascus, there was anarchy and both houses and cars were stolen, but nothing happened to the four estimated Jews left in the city, nor to their personal or communal property. 'No one entered the Jewish properties and synagogues,' he said. 'In recent days,' he added, 'I was walking down the street and one of the rebels said hello to me. Everything is routine. It may be better than it was.' He also hastened to say that it hadn’t been bad for the Jews under the previous nationalistic regime, either, saying 'I was satisfied both during the Assad era and now everything is fine.' Heritage sites, including Jewish ones, were preserved under the Assad regime. Considering the tiny number of indigenous Jews, places such as synagogues could mainly be considered a tourist attraction. The man also expressed cautious optimism that there may be a chance for the new government to move towards peace with Israel. This may not be realistic, considering the extremist Muslim orientation of most of the rebel forces, whose leaders have talked in the past of conquering Jerusalem. In the short term at least, Ahmed al-Sharaa, the HTS leader, said on Saturday that 'The situation in Syria, exhausted by years of fighting, does not allow for entering into new conflicts,' and that 'the top priority is construction and stability,' rather than fights 'that will lead to more destruction.' In that context, he noted that Israeli fears that it was threatened by the new Syrian government were unfounded and 'do not justify the recent violations of Syrian sovereignty.' The IDF pre-emptively moved into the abandoned demilitarized zone along the Golan Heights as a precautionary move to ensure the safety of the Israeli communities there. This included the higher Syrian Hermon spur, which has a much more commanding view of the region than the Israeli Hermon. It has also destroyed most of the Syrian air force, its entire navy, and its air defenses, and carried out hundreds of air attacks on missile sites, chemical weapons manufacturing facilities, and other military sites in order to prevent the old regime’s most dangerous and long-range weapons from falling into the rebels’ hands. The IDF encountered no resistance during any of its strikes. The former ISIS fighter, who has tried to moderate his Jihadist group’s image by talking of protecting all Syrian citizens without discrimination, also insisted that Iran had moved its men out of the country as its ally, Assad, was falling almost without a fight. Israel has been striking Iranian military sites in Syria for years in an effort to prevent the Islamic Republic’s entrenchment right on its northern border. HTS antipathy towards the Islamic republic that propped up the Syrian regime for over a decade of civil war would seem to preclude its becoming a new client state of the mullahcracy, but it remains to be seen if it softens its own ideological anti-Israel stance.

IDF downs Houthi drone launched from Yemen	Earlier this month, a Houthi drone hit a residential high-rise building in the central Israeli city of Yavne, northeast of Ashdod. By JNS An Israeli Navy destroyer early on Monday morning intercepted a drone over the Red Sea that was launched by Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists in Yemen. The UAV was downed prior to crossing into Israeli territory, according to the military. On Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces intercepted a Houthi drone headed for the city of Eilat. That UAV likewise did not cross into Israeli airspace. Earlier this month, a Houthi drone hit a residential high-rise building in the central Israeli city of Yavne, northeast of Ashdod. On Dec. 1, a ballistic missile launched from Yemen triggered sirens in the Judean foothills. The missile was intercepted before entering Israeli airspace, the IDF said. Four people were injured running to shelters, according to Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency medical service. The Iran-backed Houthi rebels have launched multiple missiles and drones at Israel in support of Hamas since the Gaza-based terrorist group’s Oct. 7, 2023, invasion of the northwestern Negev. In July, a Houthi drone killed a civilian in central Tel Aviv. In response, Israel struck Yemen’s Hodeidah Port. On Sept. 29, the Israeli Air Force carried out dozens of strikes in the area of Hodeidah. Jerusalem said the targets included 'power plants and a seaport, which were used by the Houthis to transfer Iranian weapons to the region, in addition to military supplies and oil.'

Slain Al Jazeera journalist was Islamic Jihad terror operative	Slain Gazan 'journalists' are often revealed to be members of the Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror groups./eM> By World Israel News Staff The IDF clarified that a Gazan man killed in an airstrike was a member of the Islamic Jihad terror group, after Qatar-controlled Al Jazeera claimed the slain man was a journalist for the network. In a tweet on Sunday, Al Jazeera claimed that Ahmad Al-Louh, 39, was a civilian cameraman who had been 'brutally killed' by Israeli forces. The network went on to accuse Israel of 'systematic killing of journalists in cold blood' and 'evasion of responsibilities under international humanitarian law.' The IDF said in response that Al-Louh was a platoon commander responsible for Islamic Jihad's central Gaza operations. Al-Louh was killed on Sunday during a strike targeting Hamas and Islamic Jihad operatives, who were using a civilian office building in Nuseirat for a meeting. 'The compound was used by the terrorists to plan and execute terror acts against IDF troops in the immediate time frame,' the Israeli army said in a statement. The IDF said that the strike was carried out in a way that minimized the risk of civilian casualties, 'including the use of precise munitions, precise aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence.' The military stressed that 'terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip systematically violate international law, exploiting civilian infrastructure and the Gazan population as human shields for terrorist activity. The IDF will continue to operate against terrorist organizations in defense of the citizens of Israel.' On numerous occasions since the outbreak of the October 7th war, Al Jazeera has claimed that its journalists were intentionally targeted by Israeli forces. The so-called journalist have often been revealed to be members of Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other Gaza-based terror groups. According to reports, three of the four hostages rescued by the IDF in June were held in the home of Al Jazeera journalist Abdallah Aljamal.

‘Israel can’t trust terror-supporting PA for security’	IDF must mirror its Gaza counter-terror raids in Judea and Samaria, urge local leaders. By World Israel News Staff Local leaders in Judea and Samaria are expressing their concern that Israel is repeating the defense mistakes which led to the October 7th terror onslaught by trusting the Palestinian Authority to act against terror in the region. In recent days, fearing a coup by Hamas, the PA has stepped up its efforts to destroy terror cells in its territory. The Biden administration has urged Israel to support the PA in its counter-terror operation with military aid and other assistance. 'This operation is a make or break moment for the Palestinian Authority,' one Palestinian official told Axios. But in an open letter to Israel's Security Cabinet, the heads of Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria warned that the Palestinian Authority is inherently hostile to Israel, stressing that the body could turn its weapons against Israeli civilians. 'It is illogical to leave the issue of maintaining our security in the hands of the Palestinian Authority,' they wrote. 'With one hand, the PA is supposedly fighting terrorism, and with the other, it is financing terrorism and paying salaries to terrorists. In order to clean up terrorism, [Israel] needs to fight it.' The letter emphasized that 'the Palestinian police&#8230;are an army for all intents and purposes, armed with automatic weapons and undergoing military training.' The politicians said that the IDF operations in PA-controlled areas in Judea and Samaria must mirror counter-terror efforts in the Gaza Strip. PA civilians must be evacuated from populated areas where terror infrastructure, then troops should move in and destroy those terror assets, they wrote. Additionally, the IDF's top brass must place Judea and Samaria's security as a top priority for the military. 'Three weeks before October 7, we warned the authorities about the potential for a [mass attack on civilians] in Judea and Samaria. We said that the threat was not lone wolf terrorists, but [full-scale] war. They laughed a us and called us delusional,' Israel Gantz, head of the Binyamin Regional Council, told Hebrew-language outlet Walla. 'In the end, what we warned about happened in Gaza-adjacent communities. We must what we warned about happened in the Gaza Strip. We must clear the area in order to protect the lives of the citizens of the State of Israel. We need to create one hundred percent security. Not ninety percent and not ninety-five percent,' Gantz added. 'We do not have the privilege of making the same mistake again as we did on October 7th.'

Halevi emphasized that the primary reason for the IDF's actions in Syria was the protection of Israeli communities in the Golan Heights. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, during a situational assessment with other officers, sent a message to Syrian rebels that Israel had 'no intention of managing Syria.' The Commanding Officer of the Northern Command, MG Ori Gordin, the Commanding Officer of the 210th Division, BG Yair Palai, and additional commanders from the General Staff Forum were also present at the assessment. He said, 'We are taking action to prevent these terrorist elements from establishing themselves—extremist terrorists will not be allowed to set up camp near the border. We are not involved in what is happening in Syria, and we have no intention of managing Syria.' Halevi emphasized that the primary reason for the IDF's actions in Syria was the protection of Israeli communities in the Golan Heights. 'We are here to defend the border in the Golan Heights, including the northern Golan Heights and Mount Hermon. There was once an enemy state in this area, its army has collapsed, and now there is a threat that terrorist elements could reach this region.' This is an implied response to criticism from Syrian rebel leader al-Julani who said, 'Israel's claims [about attacks in Syria] have weakened and no longer justify its recent violations.' He said the IDF's ground incursions into Syria 'threaten unjustified escalation in the region.' al-Julani criticized 'Israeli aggression' and claimed it violated the 1974 ceasefire agreement. He also called for 'firm and immediate measures' to get Israel out of Syria. Halevy emphasized that Israel's military operations were intended to protect border communities. 'We are firmly intervening in matters that affect the security of Israeli citizens here, in the communities of the Golan Heights behind us. We are doing so professionally, correctly, and with unwavering determination.' Halevy continued, 'In my view, the preparations along the border—from Mount Hermon to the tri-border area of Israel, Syria, and Jordan—are sound and well-executed. These preparations are designed to bring about significant changes.' He concluded, 'All necessary military resources are in place, and there is a strong buildup of forces. We have reserve soldiers, regular troops, full brigades, special units, and support from the General Staff in every direction. It's essential to use all of this wisely.'

The aid is intended to assist the PA in an operation against a terrorist group in Jenin consisting of members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Biden Administration asked Israel to approve military aid to the Palestinian Authority to fight Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas in Judea and Samaria, Axios reports. The aid is intended to assist the PA in an operation against a terrorist group in Jenin consisting of members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). The Palestinian Authority is concerned that the terror group, inspired by the events in Syria and the toppling of the Assad regime, may want to revolt. According to a PA official, US security coordinator Gen. Mike Fenzel met with Palestinian security chiefs and obtained a list of items the PA urgently needed. The requested equipment includes ammunition, helmets, bulletproof vests, radios, night vision gear, explosive disposal suits, and armored vehicles. Israel must approve all military aid going to the PA, and last year, they had given approval but rescinded it after October 7th. On Sunday, Palestinian Authority security forces continued an uncommon crackdown on terror strongholds in Jenin. An Israeli military source told The Press Service of Israel that the raids were 'the most significant Palestinian operation in recent years.' The operation began yesterday morning and triggered a general strike throughout the area, with businesses, schools, and UNRWA offices shutting down in protest. Human rights organizations are calling on the Palestinian Authority to halt the campaign. Named 'Operation Homeland Defense,' Palestinian Authority forces have seized control of four neighborhoods in the Jenin refugee camp, surrounded hospitals, and carried out extensive searches in alleyways. A source within the Palestinian Authority told TPS-IL that the raids were ordered directly by PA President Mahmoud Abbas, who instructed security forces, 'Do not return until you have full control of the camp, whatever the cost&#8230;' During the operation, PA forces killed Yazid Ja'isa, a commander in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group. Ja'isa had previously clashed with the PA, including an incident in which he seized weapons from Palestinian police guarding Joseph's Tomb and threatened to exchange them for the release of Islamic Jihad members held in Jericho.

Does Syrian rebel leader envision a ‘Greater Syria’ that includes...	Al-Julani said the IDF's ground incursions into Syria 'threaten unjustified escalation in the region.' By World Israel News Staff Although Syrian rebel leader Abu Mohammad al-Julani has made conciliatory remarks about not wanting conflict with neighboring countries, including Israel, there is some indication that he is envisioning 'a Greater Syria,' according to Israel HaYom columnist Dr. Yehuda Balanga. Balanga believes that al-Julani may be aiming for a 'Greater Syria' that includes Lebanon, Jordan and Israel. His peaceful talk may just be an attempt to put his Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham group in a positive light as it grabs the spotlight. Some of al-Julani's statements have given hope that the new Syrian government may seek good relations with Israel. Regarding Israel, al-Julani said the current situation 'does not allow for entering new conflicts. The priority at this stage is reconstruction and stability, not getting dragged into conflicts that could lead to further destruction.' The world may be prepared to see Al-Julani, formerly a member of ISIS and Al-Qaeda with a $10 million US bounty on his head, as a reformed 'man of peace.' However, al-Julani has made other statements taking a less charitable view of Israel. He said that Israel's claims about Syria 'no longer justify its recent violations' and the IDF's ground incursions into Syria 'threaten unjustified escalation in the region.' Al-Julani criticized the Israeli 'aggression' and claimed it violated the 1974 ceasefire agreement. He called for 'firm and immediate measures' to get Israel out of Syria, which implies that Syria would be in conflict with Israel if the IDF does not withdraw from its positions and continues to target Syria's military infrastructure. Does al-Julani's group really think that 'Greater Syria' will one day rule its neighbors including Israel? No one can be sure, but hearing Syrian rebels screaming that their next stop is Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem may be a sign of troubling times to come.

Netanyahu talks hostage deal, Syria turmoil with Trump	Netanyahu was one of the first world leaders to speak with Trump after the latter’s Nov. 5 election victory in the United States. By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke overnight Saturday with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, according to Hebrew-language media. The two leaders reportedly discussed a potential hostages-for-ceasefire deal with the Hamas terror group, the fall of the Assad regime to Islamist fighters in Syria and the Iranian nuclear threat. Last week, Trump made it clear that while he hopes for an end to the war in the Gaza Strip, Jerusalem must secure a decisive victory. 'I want [Netanyahu] to end it, but you have to have a victory,' Trump stated. Adam Boehler, Trump’s special envoy for hostage affairs, is visiting Israel this week amid ongoing negotiations to secure the release of the remaining captives in Gaza. He will meet with Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz and Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar on Monday, Ynet reported on Saturday night. His visit comes as a senior Israeli official told the Hebrew news site that 'significant progress' has been made in hostage negotiation efforts, suggesting that Hamas could be willing to drop some of its war-long demands to reach an agreement. The official indicated that a deal could be reached within weeks. Netanyahu was one of the first world leaders to speak with Trump after the latter’s Nov. 5 election victory in the United States. The phone conversation, which lasted some 20 minutes, was described as 'warm and cordial.' The two men were said to have 'agreed to work together for Israel’s security and discussed the Iranian threat.' Trump’s transition team is weighing two main options to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, including preventative airstrikes, The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday, citing four people familiar with the plans. The military option was under 'more serious review' in the wake of the collapse of Assad’s regime and Israel’s decapitation of Hezbollah’s leadership in Lebanon, according to the report. אמרתי שנשנה את המזרח התיכון וזה מה שקורה. סוריה היא לא אותה סוריה. לבנון היא לא אותה לבנון. עזה היא לא אותה עזה. איראן היא לא אותה איראן. pic.twitter.com/IFVso1czkH &mdash; Benjamin Netanyahu - בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu) December 15, 2024 The post Netanyahu talks hostage deal, Syria turmoil with Trump appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/netanyahu-talks-hostage-deal-syria-turmoil-with-trump/	2024-12-15T09:53:59-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed-3-880x495-1.jpg
Satellite intel exposes Iran’s new warship amid wave of East Coas...	Satellite photos have captured Iran’s newest drone carrier sailing in formation with its predecessors – the helicopter-ready Shahid Roudaki and the heavily armed Shahid Mahdavi. By Jewish Breaking News As federal authorities struggle to explain dozens of drone sightings along the East Coast, all eyes are on Iran’s newest maritime threat. Iran’s newest warship 'Shahid Bagheri' began its life as a humble container vessel, but satellite images reveal its remarkable transformation throughout 2023. When Maxar’s high-resolution cameras first captured the ship at Bandar Abbas’ ISOICO shipyard in February, workers were already stripping the commercial ship down to its bones. By mid-November, the vessel had an angled flight deck and distinctive jump ramp that gave it the look of a miniature aircraft carrier, though one built specifically for launching drones. Within just two weeks, the crew had moved their creation to the shipyard’s harbor, and it finally departed in November 2024 for its first sea trials. The Shahid Bagheri isn’t navigating the Persian Gulf alone. Recent Maxar satellite photos have captured Iran’s newest drone carrier sailing in formation with its predecessors – the helicopter-ready Shahid Roudaki and the heavily armed Shahid Mahdavi, which joined Iran’s fleet last March, according to Business Insider. Together, they represent Iran’s growing fleet of drone-carrying vessels, each modified from civilian ships for military purposes. Satellite images of Iranian ships. (Screenshot) Dozens of drone sightings across New Jersey since mid-November have drawn attention due to their proximity to sensitive locations, including Picatinny Arsenal military research facility and President-elect Donald Trump’s Bedminster golf course. Despite denials by the Pentagon, FBI, and Department of Homeland Security, Congressman Jeff Van Drew doubled down Thursday on his claims that Iran is manning the drones. 'This is not the work of a backyard hobbyist,' he declared, adding that he was 'not trying to alarm people' but his information comes from 'high-level, credible sources, people with expertise and clearance to address real threats.' 'Drones are flying into United States air space, coming in and out of international waters,' Van Drew continued, claiming the drones were 'expertly piloted' to evade radar detection. 'We know there is an Iranian drone ship that went missing from its port. And the timing of the disappearance is circumstantially consistent with the beginning of the appearance of these drones. These drones are reportedly the size of minivans,' he said.

Palestinian Authority cracks down on Jenin terror groups	During the operation, PA forces killed Yazid Ja’isa, a commander in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group.

According to the Palestinian source, 'In recent weeks, the Palestinian Authority forces have tried to hold talks with the terrorist organizations, but they have once again provoked the Palestinian Authority, fired at government institutions and even confiscated Palestinian Authority vehicles and driven them around the camp…' A senior PA official told TPS-IL the crackdown is part of a broader strategy to demonstrate PA authority’s ability to maintain governance — Ramallah eyes eventually administering the Gaza Strip. 'This is about restoring Palestinian control in Judea and Samaria and eventually Gaza,' the official stated, emphasizing the importance of demonstrating governance capacity to international stakeholders, particularly the United States.

By Jewish Breaking News For over 14 months, major American carriers have remained conspicuously absent from Israel’s skies despite a ceasefire with Hezbollah and military gains against Hamas. One U.S. lawmaker who will soon take up the position of chairman on the Senate’s Transportation Committee believes it’s intentional. 'The Biden-Harris administration was lax in pursuing why some airlines will not fly to Israel,' Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) tells Jewish Insider. 'Indeed, they may have been worse than lax, and the State Department may have become inappropriately entangled in deliberations over safety and subverted the Federal Aviation Administration.' 'There have been allegations about antisemitic discrimination by airlines and that calls by unions not to fly to Israel were motivated solely by pro-Hamas activists,' he said. 'These allegations are troubling, and, of course, American law prohibits American companies from participating in politically motivated boycotts of Israel,' noting that he 'welcomes a full investigation of these issues.' Operating without competition, El Al commands a staggering 71% of all passenger traffic through Ben Gurion airport on U.S. routes. Delta Airlines has teased an April 2025 return to Israeli skies, and negotiations are still ongoing with Israir and Arkia in leasing a few aircraft to provide North American service. Obviously, a clear divide has emerged between airline unions’ safety assessments and Israeli aviation authorities. 'Flights to Israel are safe,' says Israel’s aviation chief Shmuel Zakai. 'When we think that the airspace is not safe for flights, we close it. That earned us a lot of credit internationally.' Meanwhile, several European carriers are gradually returning to Israeli airspace, with Aegean Airlines leading the way after resuming flights last week.

Obviously, a clear divide has emerged between airline unions’ safety assessments and Israeli aviation authorities. 'Flights to Israel are safe,' says Israel’s aviation chief Shmuel Zakai. 'When we think that the airspace is not safe for flights, we close it. That earned us a lot of credit internationally.' Meanwhile, several European carriers are gradually returning to Israeli airspace, with Aegean Airlines leading the way after resuming flights last week. Wizzair and LOT Polish Airways have also announced their return, with services scheduled to resume on December 22.

Israel eliminates dozens of Hamas terrorists in Beit Hanoun	A separate raid eliminated a Hamas squad planning attacks on Israeli forces. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli soldiers eliminated dozens of Palestinian terrorists in Beit Hanoun, an area of northern Gaza where Hamas has been trying to regroup, the Israel Defense Forces disclosed on Sunday. The raid was based on intelligence about the presence of Hamas in the area. Dozens were killed by airstrikes and ground forces, while others were arrested. Israeli forces discovered and destroyed numerous weapons, including explosives and cluster munitions. A separate raid eliminated a Hamas squad planning attacks on Israeli forces. In addition, Air Force jets on Sunday also struck a Hamas command and control complex that previously served as a health clinic, the IDF said, adding that many weapons were stored there. The army said it took steps to mitigate harming civilians, including using precision weapons and aerial surveillance. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Israel closes its embassy in Ireland over Dublin’s ‘extreme anti-...	Israeli Foreign Minister orders shuttering of Israel's embassy in Dublin, more than half a year after Jerusalem recalled its ambassador to Ireland following its recognition of unilateral Palestinian statehood. By World Israel News Staff Israel is poised to close its embassy in Ireland, the country's foreign affairs chief announced Sunday, as the diplomatic row between the two countries continues. Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar (New Hope) castigated what he called the 'extreme anti-Israel policy of the Irish government,' blaming Dublin for the chilly relations between the two countries. 'The antisemitic actions and rhetoric that Ireland is taking against Israel are based on delegitimization and demonization of the Jewish state and on double standards,' Sa’ar said in a statement Sunday. 'Ireland has crossed all red lines in its relationship with Israel. Israel will invest its resources in promoting bilateral relations with the countries of the world according to priorities that are also derived from the attitude of the various countries towards it.' Sa'ar spoke out days after the Irish cabinet voted last week to join South Africa's petition to the International Criminal Court in The Hague accusing Israel of committing acts of genocide in the Gaza Strip during its ongoing war against the Hamas terror organization. In his announcement Sunday, Sa'ar also said Israel is preparing to open a new embassy in Moldova, replacing the existing facility. The foreign minister compared the downgrading of diplomatic ties with Ireland to the upgrade Israel's mission to Moldova is set to receive. 'There are countries that are interested in strengthening their ties with Israel and do not yet have an Israeli embassy,' Sa’ar said. 'We will adjust the Israeli diplomatic structure of our missions while giving weight, among other things, to the approach and actions of the various countries towards Israel in the political arena.'

Former Israeli state attorney sparks storm after calling on reser...	Moshe Lador had said air force reservists shouldn’t fly if the judicial overhaul process restarts. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel’s top leaders from across the political spectrum and the army slammed Saturday ex-state attorney Moshe Lador's call for air force reservists to refuse to fly if the judicial overhaul process restarts. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that disobeying a call to serve during wartime 'crosses a red line that endangers democracy and undermines our future.' Both he and Justice Minister Yariv Levin asked Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara to 'take immediate action.' 'Calling for insubordination, during normal times and even more so in times of war, is a clear and serious violation of the law,' Levin wrote in his letter to Baharav-Miara Saturday night. Considering Lador’s status as someone 'who was responsible for determining prosecution policy in the country,' and 'the concern that in the absence of enforcement of the law, the phenomenon of incitement to refusal and refusal itself will spread,' Levin said the attorney general had to quickly investigate the former senior official, who retired in 2013. President Isaac Herzog labeled the demand as being 'off-limits,' and said that 'Anyone who says otherwise harms the security of the State of Israel.' Top defense officials were quick to condemn Lador as well. Defense Minister Yisrael Katz said that 'Disobedience of any kind cannot be accepted under any circumstances,' while the man he replaced, Yoav Gallant, said that such a statement by someone who had held 'such a senior public position&#8230;harms the security of the state' and Lador must therefore be put on trial. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi called for an end to any calls for refusal to serve or failure to report for duty, saying that the IDF 'must remain outside any political controversy, especially these days, when security challenges are so tangible.' Lador had addressed an event in Beersheba earlier on Saturday and bluntly said, 'Pilots who have completed their compulsory service and now serve on a voluntary basis are not only allowed, but in my opinion, are practically obligated to say, ‘If that’s the kind of country you’re striving for, and are going to create through aggressiveness and bullying, and turn into dictators of&#8230;I won’t enter the cockpit and fly this plane.'' This was a 'legitimate tool' to stop the government, which he deemed completely 'wrong' in trying to curb the power of an unelected judiciary to overturn Knesset laws and government decisions, an issue which brought hundreds of thousands of protestors to the streets in the year before the Hamas-led invasion of Israel last October 7 that sparked the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip. Leaders of the Opposition joined the many government ministers and MKs who also condemned Lador, including National Unity head Benny Gantz, Yesh Atid chief Yair Lapid, and Israel Beiteinu head Avigdor Liberman. While stating 'I am against all refusals and all evasion from IDF [service],' Lapid referred to those protests, blaming the government for 'dragging us back&#8230;to the days of the judicial revolution that brought us our greatest national disaster in our history.' Documents found in Gaza showed that Hamas leaders had taken the mass protests, as well as the hundreds of signatures of reservists on petitions stating that they would refuse to serve, as a sign of Israeli weakness and societal disintegration. After the terrorists massacred 1,200 people, including dozens of children, and took 251 hostage, the IDF saw well over 100% response to its emergency call-up, including air force personnel who had signed those petitions. Lador’s call came in response to Levin’s most recent refusal to allow the Judicial Selection Committee to vote on appointing a new Supreme Court president, a position that is currently empty. He does not want to follow the tradition of selecting the most senior judge because he prefers a more conservative candidate. The High Court of Justice just ordered Levin on Thursday to hold the vote within five weeks, infuriating the justice minister with what he termed their 'over-reach' into the executive branch’s responsibilities, and their desire to be 'dictatorial rulers' even though no one elected them to power.

Supreme Court forcing return of judicial reform, says Justice Min...	Israel's Justice Minister, Yariv Levin, the architect of the abortive 2023 judicial reform plan, hints at new bid to pass the reform, accusing Supreme Court of running roughshod over Knesset's and government's rights. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Israeli government and the country’s Supreme Court may be on a collision course which could result in another attempt to reform the judiciary and restore the balance of powers between the three branches of government, Israel’s Justice Minister said Saturday night. More than a year after the war in Gaza forced the government’s judicial reform plan off the agenda, and a year and a half since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu froze efforts to move forward with the reform in the face of large-scale protests, Justice Minister Yariv Levin (Likud) suggested over the weekend that Israel’s Supreme Court may force the Coalition to again take up his shelved reform plan. On Saturday night, Levin published a lengthy Facebook post accusing the Supreme Court of running roughshod over the rights of the country’s legislative and executive branches. Levin and the high court have clashed for over a year on the appointment of new justices, as well as the naming of a new chief justice, for the Supreme Court. Under Israeli law, the judicial appointment committee – responsible for appointing judges at all levels of the judiciary – is made up of nine voting members, of whom four come from the Knesset and the government (including the Justice Minister), along with three sitting Supreme Court justices (including the chief justice), and two members of the Israel Bar Association. While most appointments require only a simple majority of five out of nine members, appointments to the high court require a supermajority of seven, requiring at least some level of support from both the Supreme Court’s delegation and the governing coalition, which controls at least three seats on the committee. Since 2023, the court and the government have remained deadlocked over the appointment of three new Supreme Court justices, and the naming of a new chief justice. The last chief justice, Esther Hayut, finished her term in October 2023, with no replacement named to fill the position. Justice Uzi Vogelman declined offers to replace Hayut, given that his remaining term on the court was one year. Vogelman took over Hayut’s duties, however, as acting chief justice for one year, before leaving the court this October. Since then, Yitzhak Amit has served as acting chief justice. The court has pushed to formally appoint Amit as Hayut’s successor, citing his seniority on the bench. The Israeli government, however, has refused to back his appointment, noting that there is no statutory requirement to appoint the most senior justice to head the court. Amit is widely associated with the court’s liberal wing, raising concerns in Israel’s right-wing government. As a compromise, Levin has proposed to have the committee appoint conservative-leaning justice Yosef Elron as chief justice for a single year, after which he would be replaced by the court’s choice; likely Amit. Under the compromise, the government and the court would each nominate two justices, with the committee backing one appointment from each list, with the third vacancy to be filled by a female judge acceptable to both sides. However, acting chief justice Vogelman, and his successor, Amit, rejected the proposal, while the court moved to strip Levin of his authority as justice minister. 'Immediately after the outbreak of the war, the coalition announced a freeze on all activity related to judicial reform,' Levin wrote. 'At the time, I believed it was inappropriate to address contentious issues while the country was engaged in a multi-front war.' 'Minutes after I sent my proposal to Judge Vogelman, he rejected it contemptuously without even discussing it. Judge Vogelman was well aware that I was open to discussing the details of the proposal. The current Acting Chief Justice, Judge Yitzhak Amit, also knows this. However, they chose to entrench themselves in their refusal.' 'Several months ago, the Supreme Court, in a panel led by Justice Willner, ruled that my role as Minister of Justice would be in title only. Justice Willner issued an order that effectively stripped me of my statutory authority to determine the agenda of the Judicial Selection Committee, thereby invalidating the consensus-based process that had so far achieved an unprecedented number of appointments.' The ruling, Levin wrote, 'is patently unlawful;' nevertheless the minister continued to cooperate with the court, he claimed. Levin noted that in addition, the court took the unprecedented step of striking down an amendment to Israel’s Basic Laws – a proto-constitutional set of documents the Supreme Court has claimed have the status of a de facto constitution. Since then, the Supreme Court has attempted to force through the appointment of Amit as chief justice. 'The judges and representatives of the Bar Association blocked the broadcasting of the committee’s deliberations, allowing them to appoint Judge Amit behind closed doors, ignoring the many objections and difficult questions raised.' 'The Court did not stop there — since the war began, it has deliberated on the conditions of the terrorists who perpetrated the October 7 massacre, on humanitarian aid to Hamas in Gaza, on potentially ordering the state to release the bodies of terrorists while our hostages languish in Hamas tunnels, and on many other issues. This evening, it was revealed that Justice Ruth Ronen even visited Ofer Prison to personally oversee the detention conditions of high-ranking terrorists.' Given the situation, Levin said the government is now compelled to return to the judicial reform. 'The Court is leaving the Knesset and the government no choice but to act at this time to restore their powers.' 'They have left us no choice. This cannot continue. We, too, have rights.'

Post-Assad era opens door for recovery of legendary Israeli spy	Beyond the search for Cohen’s remains, Israeli negotiators are also reportedly pursuing a broader agenda that includes locating missing soldiers from the First Lebanon War. By Jewish Breaking News A rare opportunity for Israel has presented itself following the ouster of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad. According to the Lebanese-based Al-Akhbar newspaper, Israel is holding negotiations with Syrian and international bodies in an attempt to locate the body of legendary spy Eli Cohen. Cohen’s espionage career stands as one of the most remarkable chapters in Israeli intelligence history. Born in Alexandria to Syrian Jewish parents, he possessed a natural gift for languages, speaking Arabic, English, and French fluently. After receiving initial espionage training in Israel in 1955, he returned to Egypt, only to be expelled along with other Jews in the wake of the Suez Crisis. He subsequently settled in Israel in 1957, working as a translator and accountant before being recruited again by Israeli intelligence in 1960. In 1961, Cohen was dispatched to Buenos Aires by the Mossad under the alias Kamal Amin Thaabet, posing as an expatriate Syrian businessman. There, he methodically built relationships within the Syrian expatriate community, including future Syrian president Amin al-Hafez. These connections proved invaluable when Cohen relocated to Damascus in 1962, where he rapidly ascended into the highest circles of Syrian society and government. His influence peaked during the 1963 Ba’athist coup, when several of his Argentine contacts seized power. So trusted was Cohen that al-Hafez reportedly considered him for deputy minister of defense. He attended classified military briefings and was granted access to strategic Syrian fortifications in the Golan Heights, all while transmitting crucial intelligence back to Israel. Despite repeated warnings from his handlers, Cohen maintained regular radio transmission schedules. Syrian counterintelligence eventually traced his signal and arrested him in January 1965. Following a military trial, he was publicly hanged in Damascus’s Marjeh Square four months later. To keep his remains out of Israeli hands, Syrian authorities have purportedly moved Cohen’s body multiple times over the years. Beyond the search for Cohen’s remains, Israeli negotiators are also reportedly pursuing a broader agenda that includes locating missing soldiers from the First Lebanon War. While Zachary Baumel’s remains were returned to Israel in 2019, the whereabouts of Yehuda Katz and Zvi Feldman, who died during the 1982 Battle of Sultan Yaaqoub, remain unknown. The negotiations also touch on Syria’s Jewish heritage, with Israel seeking to preserve what remains of the community’s historic sites and cultural treasures. According to Al-Akhbar, roughly half of Syria’s Jewish sites have been destroyed, and numerous sacred artifacts, including ancient Torah scrolls, have vanished. Some of these religious items have since surfaced in Turkey.

What happened to relics of Syria’s Jewish history? Assad’s collap...	By 2020, nearly half of Syria’s Jewish sites were destroyed, according to a report from the Foundation for Jewish Heritage. By Shira Li Bartov, JTA The fall of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has opened up a sea of uncertainty about Syria’s future — and about the treasures of its past, including the remnants of its Jewish history. A 13-year civil war has cost the country more than 600,000 lives and saw some 100,000 people 'forcibly disappeared' into prisons by the Assad regime. The war has also wreaked havoc on Syria’s most important cultural sites — from ancient monuments, castles and mosques to the vestiges of a rich Jewish culture. Well before the war, Syria’s historical synagogues and other Jewish sites languished in neglect after Jews left the country en masse surrounding Israel’s establishment. Now, archaeologists are beginning to assess how much more was lost to bombardment and wartime looting. Syria was home to well-established Jewish communities for more than 2,000 years, dating back to the Roman period, including Sephardic Jews expelled from Spain in 1492 and European Jewish merchants. But the 20th-century rise of Arab nationalist movements, along with a set of anti-Jewish laws and violence surrounding the establishment of Israel, resulted in waves of Jewish emigration. About 100,000 Jews lived in Syria at the start of the 20th century, dropping to 15,000 in 1947. An anti-Jewish riot that year, followed by the creation of Israel in 1948, spurred many of the remaining Jews to leave — though they were not legally permitted to do so in most cases despite facing persecution in Syria. The Aleppo Codex, a landmark 10th-century copy of the Hebrew Bible, was damaged and secreted out of the country to Israel around that time. By 1992, when Assad’s father acceded to pressure to let the Jews emigrate, there were about 4,000 Jews remaining in Aleppo and smaller numbers in Damascus and Qamishli. Most left the country shortly afterwards. In 2011, a now-infamous Vogue profile of Asma al-Assad, Bashar’s wife, quoted her as saying that Jews fit into her vision of religious diversity in Syria. 'There is a very big Jewish quarter in old Damascus,' she told the interviewer, who noted that homes in the quarter had been boarded up since the 1992 exodus. (The article was removed from the internet after drawing criticism for sanitizing the wife of a dictator, and his regime, but remains accessible in an archived form.) In 2022, an estimate of Syria’s Jews counted only four; this year, the widely circulating number is three. Many Jewish sites have had no caretakers for decades, said Emma Cunliffe, an archaeologist with the Cultural Property Protection and Peace team at Newcastle University. 'In a conflict situation, that neglect intensifies,' said Cunliffe. 'Those few people who remained to look after them were then unable to reach them. But then as the war progressed, the damage increased significantly.' By 2020, nearly half of Syria’s Jewish sites were destroyed, according to a report from the Foundation for Jewish Heritage. The Jobar Synagogue in Damascus, one of few Jewish places of worship still visited by a handful of elderly Jews before the war, was mostly turned into rubble in 2014. A host of ancient Torah scrolls, tapestries, chandeliers and other artifacts from the synagogue went missing, with some resurfacing in Turkey. The al-Bandara Synagogue, one of the oldest synagogues in Aleppo, also suffered damage during heavy fighting in the region. The synagogue had been renovated in the 1990s but was damaged again during the civil war in 2016. Cunliffe, who conducted a study of the site in 2017, said some parts of the building were destroyed and its courtyard was littered with debris. (A recent virtual reality exhibition at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem allowed visitors to explore the famed synagogue as it stood in 1947, using photographs taken by a local woman who later emigrated.) Tadef, a town east of Aleppo, was once a popular destination for Jews because of its shrine to the Jewish scribe and prophet Ezra, who was said to stop there on his way to Jerusalem. But after a long period of neglect, the shrine was illegally excavated and looted both by rebel groups and Syrian government forces between 2021 and 2022, according to the rights group Syrians for Truth and Justice. Scholars also worry about the ruins of Roman-era synagogues in Syria’s ancient cities, such as Apamea and Dura-Europos. Satellite imaging has shown that Dura-Europos was heavily looted while being held by Islamic State forces, according to Adam Blitz, a fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute. Remnants from the synagogue of Dura-Europos are treasured by museums, including the Yale University Art Gallery, which displays 40 tiles from the synagogue’s ceiling. But Blitz said other artifacts from the site are feared to have been pilfered by combatants. 'There has been tremendous fear about mosaics being looted,' he said of Syria’s ancient sites. The extent of the damage to Jewish sites is still difficult to assess, according to Cunliffe, who said the skills and training needed for forensic damage collection remain limited in the war-torn country. Investigations through satellite imagery will also take several months. It may take much longer to establish protection for these sites, as Syria’s cultural sector has been overlooked during the war and the Syrian Antiquities Authority has been consigned to a tiny budget. As Syria hurtles into a new era, the fate of its heritage sites hangs in the balance. The country’s gems of Jewish history will only survive as far as its next regime allows, said Cunliffe. The new regime has its roots in Islamic fundamentalist movements but in recent years has taken a pragmatic turn, leaving open questions about the fate of minorities and their interests under its governance. 'Support for the people who are in a position to access them and protect them is critical, and also the need for an inclusive society that will allow that to happen,' Cunliffe said about the historic Jewish sites. 'We don’t know what the future of Syria looks like. Certainly, there’s a lot of fighting, and which group ultimately wins will dictate a lot of what is possible.'

Report: Trump’s Mideast envoy meets with Saudi crown prince	In November, Saudi Arabia reiterated its position that the kingdom will not formalize relations with Israel without a pathway to a Palestinian state. By JNS U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff met with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in Saudi Arabia last week for talks on a 'mega-deal' with Riyadh, including a historic peace accord with Israel, Axios reported on Friday. Witkoff, a Jewish businessman and longtime friend to Trump, held a series of diplomatic discussions during a recent trip to the Middle East that culminated in a visit to Abu Dhabi for a crypto conference. According to Axios, the Biden administration sought a U.S.-Saudi defense treaty as well as an agreement on civilian nuclear cooperation between the countries. Ratification of the treaty by the Senate would have been more likely had it included a peace agreement between Riyadh and Jerusalem. Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 onslaught on Israel’s south and the subsequent wars in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon, however, derailed the negotiations. One major obstacle to normalization is Riyadh’s demand for the establishment of a Palestinian state. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his senior advisers believe that under Trump and with the Jewish state’s successful campaigns against Iran and its proxies in the region, the Saudis might be convinced to forgo this condition, according to Axios. In November, Saudi Arabia reiterated its position that the kingdom will not formalize relations with Israel without a pathway to a Palestinian state, asserting that some deals it is negotiating with the United States are 'not that connected' to Washington’s normalization drive. Riyadh is 'quite happy' to wait until the situation in the Gaza Strip is 'amenable' before normalizing ties with the Jewish state, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said at an investment summit. He added that U.S.-Saudi trade and technology deals are 'not tied to any third parties' and can potentially progress 'quite quickly.' Recent reports suggested that a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip could be reached before Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. According to The Wall Street Journal, Hamas has agreed to two of Israel’s key conditions for a ceasefire in Gaza, raising hopes for an agreement to release Israeli hostages within days. Hamas for the first time agreed to accept the presence of Israeli forces in Gaza during a 60-day truce, the newspaper quoted unnamed Arab mediators as saying. The sources also confirmed to the paper reports from earlier in the week that Hamas had submitted a list of hostages, including U.S. citizens, whom it would release. The purported breakthrough follows a Dec. 3 threat by Trump that there would be 'hell to pay' unless the hostages were freed by the time he assumed office on Jan. 20. Hamas terrorists murdered roughly 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in the deadliest single-day attack in the Jewish state’s history. The Islamist group also kidnapped 251 individuals into the Palestinian enclave, where about 100 still remain—although it is not known how many are alive.

Rebel leader: Israel has no more ‘excuses’ to strike Syria	Abu Mohammad al-Julani said, 'We are currently working to meet Syrians’ primary needs. We are not seeking to engage in any conflict given Syria’s fragile state, and we are addressing the international community.' By JNS Syria’s new leader said on Saturday that Israel’s 'excuses' had run out for striking the deposed Assad regime’s military infrastructure, as well as for deploying troops to several demilitarized zones in the Syrian Golan Heights. 'Excuses have run out, and they have crossed the lines of engagement,' said head of the Syrian Islamist group (HTS) Ahmad al-Sharaa, better known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Julani. Although reports conflicted as to whether he mentioned Israel by name, it was clear that al-Julani’s statements to Syrian state media were aimed at Jerusalem, noting that his group’s sovereignty over most of Syria has ended Iranian intervention in the country and that it is not seeking further conflict. On Nov. 27, a coalition of rebel groups—HTS chief among them—toppled Bashar Assad’s regime in an 11-day armed uprising, reportedly with the backing of Turkey. In response, the Israeli Air Force has waged a massive air campaign against Syrian military targets to make sure they can’t be used against the Jewish state. The operation has seen hundreds of IAF aircraft striking key Syrian military installations, severely damaging what was once one of the strongest air defense systems in the Middle East. On Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces Spokesperson’s Unit said the air force has succeeded in destroying an estimated 90% of Syria’s strategically important surface-to-air missiles. Speaking to the media on Saturday, al-Julani said, 'We are currently working to meet Syrians’ primary needs. We are not seeking to engage in any conflict given Syria’s fragile state, and we are addressing the international community.' He added, 'The Syrian revolution has triumphed, but Syria cannot be governed with a revolutionary mindset. There is a need for law and institutions, and for transitioning from the mentality of revolution to the mentality of statehood.' Speaking about Tehran’s influence over Syria in the past decades, al-Julani said, 'We successfully ended the Iranian presence and hold no hostility toward the Iranian people.' Later on Saturday, Syrian media reported that Israeli airstrikes had resumed in the Damascus area. Israel targeted sites in the town of Hafir in the area of al-Qalamoun, in the countryside of Damascus, according to Voice of the Capital, a Syrian activist group. Meanwhile, the IDF stated that it was continuing its defense mission in the Syrian buffer zone and along the border with engineering, armor, paratroopers and special reconnaissance troops. 'The forces are deployed at commanding points that control the buffer zone and strengthen the defense in the area,' the IDF said. 'We have no interest in anything that is currently going on in Syria,' said Col. Benny Kata, commander of the 474th Golan Regional Brigade. The IDF’s purpose in Syria is to protect the Israeli residents of the Golan, he added. On the Syrian side, the brigade found a large amount of arms, including anti-tank missiles, weapons, vests, ammunition and other military equipment, according to the IDF. In a three-day visit to Israel that started on Wednesday, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) commander Gen. Michael Kurilla met with Israel’s Defense Minister Israel Katz and senior members of the Israeli defense establishment to discuss regional security issues, including the developing situation in Syria and 'preparedness against other strategic and regional threats.' Kurilla said, 'My visit to Israel, as well as Jordan, Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon over the past six days, reinforced the importance of seeing the current challenges and opportunities firsthand through the eyes of our partners, commanders on the ground, and servicemembers. We need to maintain strong partnerships to confront current and future threats to the region.'

Israel prepares to strike Houthi targets in Yemen	The Houthis have been provoking the IDF, which has been preoccupied with more immediate and pressing conflicts; however, with Syria largely stabilized, the IDF can now redirect its focus to Yemen. By Lilach Shoval, JNS The Israeli Air Forces remains uncertain whether Yemen’s Houthi rebels launched three or four unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) toward Israel on Thursday morning. What is clear, however, is that the Houthis have increased their attempts to challenge Israel in recent days. One of the drones was intercepted near Eilat, another was downed using soft-kill methods and a third disappeared from radar and has yet to be located. According to Israel Defense Forces assessments, the escalation of Houthi attacks is partly due to the significant blows sustained in recent weeks by Iran’s 'axis of evil,' with the Houthis attempting to exploit the situation to assume a leading role. Israeli officials acknowledge that the situation cannot continue and are preparing for the possibility of a third significant strike against Houthi targets in Yemen. Evaluating strikes on the Syrian military In Syria, The IDF continues to analyze the results of its strikes on Syrian military assets. Current estimates indicate that 58% to 88% of Syria’s air defense systems have been critically damaged. While IDF briefings have suggested that around 80% of Assad’s military has been damaged, senior officers caution that this figure is overly ambitious and advise more conservative estimates. According to their analyses, overall damage to Syria’s military capabilities is lower, as intelligence does not cover every weapon system. The operation in Syria involved the use of 1,800 munitions—none of which had been part of initial plans. The decision was made to focus on high-value assets. Since the beginning of the conflict on Oct. 7, 2023, the IAF has deployed approximately 83,000 munitions across all combat zones. The IDF’s rapid response in Syria stemmed from the evolving dynamics of the country’s civil war. When rebel offensives raised doubts about Assad’s survival, the IDF prepared plans to target remaining Syrian military assets in rebel-held areas. In just 48 hours, the IAF struck over 500 targets in Syria. The strikes destroyed more than 85% of Syria’s air defense systems and 40% of Assad’s fighter jets. Additionally, 100% of Syria’s armed drones and 390 artillery positions were eliminated. The timing of the operation posed a key dilemma. On one hand, Israel sought to avoid being seen as interfering in Syria’s internal affairs. On the other, action was necessary before certain weapon systems disappeared or were relocated. Before the strikes, Russian forces had numerous air defense systems in Syria, but now only a few remain. According to IDF data, the following Syrian air defense systems have been destroyed: • SA-2 and SA-3 batteries (100% destroyed) • SA-22 and SA-6 systems (86%) • SA-17 batteries (80%) • SA-8 systems (77%) • SA-26 systems (66%) Overall, 86% of Syria’s air defense systems have been neutralized, enabling the IAF to operate almost freely over Syrian territory. In the past, strikes were conducted from a distance using long-range munitions. Now, the destruction of 100% of Syria’s armed drones, along with 90% of its MiG-39 and 80% of its Su-24 fighter jets, ensures greater operational flexibility. The IDF also targeted sites believed to house chemical weapons, but intelligence gaps suggest that some stockpiles may remain undetected. Escalating threats on Israel’s northern front Since the start of the war, over 22,000 rockets and missiles have been fired at Israel, including 12,300 since the launch of 'Operation Northern Arrows' against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Of these, 900 rockets landed in Israel, though only 12 caused significant damage. The IDF reports a 91% interception success rate. UAV threats persist as well. Since the conflict began, 648 UAVs have been launched at Israel, including 239 since 'Operation Northern Arrows' commenced. While 94% have been intercepted, the remaining threats continue to trigger sirens and unsettle the public. Israeli strikes have targeted all land crossings between Lebanon and Syria except the main route between Beirut and Damascus. The objective: preventing the transfer of weapons from Iran to Hezbollah or the movement of remaining Syrian military assets. However, it is likely some smuggling routes remain active and undetected by Israeli intelligence. Looking ahead, 2025 is expected to center on Iran, with the Israeli defense establishment preparing for potential conflict with Tehran and its regional proxies. The IDF continues to strengthen its readiness for addressing the Iranian threat at all levels.

Governor’s race preview? Ritchie Torres holds higher approval rat...	Only 33 percent of New Yorkers stated that they plan on voting for incumbent Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) in 2026, indicating her vulnerability. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner A recent Siena College poll found that Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-NY) holds a higher approval rating among Jewish registered voters in New York State than Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY), setting the stage for an expected race for the governor’s mansion in 2026 between the two US lawmakers. Torres enjoys a 41 percent approval rating among New York Jews, compared to an 8 percent disapproval rating, the poll showed. Comparatively, Lawler, who is Jewish himself, holds a 31 percent approval rating and 24 percent disapproval rating among Jews in the state. Both Torres and Lawler are widely expected to throw their hat in the ring for the 2026 New York gubernatorial election. While the Siena College poll found that about half the electorate either didn’t know the lawmakers or didn’t have an opinion of them, only 33 percent of New Yorkers stated that they plan on voting for incumbent Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) in 2026, indicating her vulnerability. Torres, whose district represents large swaths of the Bronx, has been increasingly critical of Hochul, lambasting her for supposedly being a political 'insider' who lacks the fortitude to combat corruption within The Empire State. He has also called Hochul a 'hypocrite' for switching her positions on gun rights and congestion pricing. Moreover, since his arrival in Congress, Torres has been highly outspoken against antisemitism, oftentimes criticizing fellow liberals over their unwillingness to combat bigotry against the Jewish community. He has relentlessly criticized local universities such as New York University (NYU) and Columbia University for fostering campus environments which condone antisemitic conduct from faculty and students. He has called on local universities to amend their non-discrimination policies to include 'Zionist' students as a protected identity. Lawler, who represents New York’s 17th Congressional District, has also been floated as a potential contender for the New York governorship. Lawler slammed Hochul after the governor announced an 'inflation check' program, which would send $300 dollars to New Yorkers making up to $150,000 per year and $300 to families making $300,000 per year. T he lawmaker has also criticized Hochul over her refusal to aggressively tackle surging crime and violence within the state. 'It should come as no surprise that the most incompetent Governor in New York’s history isn’t capable of reading a balance sheet,' Lawler said recently. 'But it is sad that Governor Hochul feels the need to lie to New Yorkers about how her political ‘vote-for-me’ checks are being paid for.' Like Torres, Lawler has positioned himself as a stalwart ally of Israel since entering Congress, oftentimes spearheading bills to combat antisemitism both domestically and abroad. Lawler has also sponsored legislation to target countries and entities that treat Israel unfairly, such as the 'Stand With Israel Act,' which would defund United Nations agencies that 'expel, downgrade, suspend, or otherwise restrict the participation of the State of Israel.'

Judge bars release of CIA leaker of Israel’s plans to attack Iran	A federal court agreed with the prosecution that Asif Rahman posed a danger to the community and a flight risk if he was allowed pre-trial detention at home. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A federal judge rejected Wednesday defense calls for the pre-trial release of a CIA employee charged with leaking Israel’s plans to attack Iran in October. Asif Rahman will be standing trial on two counts of violating the Espionage Act by willfully retaining classified information and transmitting it to an unauthorized person on or about October 17. A lower court had permitted his release to home detention with GPS monitoring, but in a one-hour proceeding, U.S. District Judge Patricia Giles overturned the decision, siding with the prosecution that Rahman posed a flight risk and a danger to the community. 'It is hard to overstate what other circumstances present graver risks of danger to human life than unilaterally deciding to transmitting information related to plans for kinetic military action between two countries,' prosecutors wrote in court papers. Giles accepted their position that Rahman still knows top secret information by virtue of his former position that is relevant in Israel’s ongoing war with Iranian terror proxy Hamas, which he could reveal to the detriment of the U.S. and its closest Midde East ally. 'I take the government’s point that this is a kinetic situation. It’s a volatile situation … and that creates a different danger,' she said. 'It’s possible to limit someone’s computer access, but you can’t stop him from talking,' Giles added, after the defense had raised the possibility of denying him all access to electronic devices. Israel had reportedly delayed its retaliatory strike due to the leak, following Iran’s second attempt earlier in the month to wreak massive havoc on the Jewish state by launching nearly 200 missiles and UAVs at the country. Rahman allegedly had leaked documents including satellite photos of possible Israeli targets in Iran that had been prepared by the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, to a Telegram account run out of the Islamic Republic. The information also included a report by the National Security Agency on Israeli military preparations for the mission, including what air force planes and missiles could be used. The Israelis ultimately carried out the attack at the end of October and destroyed most of Iran’s advanced aerial defense systems, as well as an active top secret nuclear weapons research facility. Prosecutors also noted that as Rahman comes from a very wealthy family, it would be relatively easy of him to flee the country if he was to await trial at home. The suspect's wealthy background also strengthened the prosecution's claim that his motives must be ideological in some way that they did not specify, rather than financial. Rahman was arrested on November 12 in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, where he was a member of the American embassy staff. The federal agents found eight pages of notes on him, including a 'to-do list,' much of which was encrypted and has yet to be deciphered. Another such list openly enumerated such categories as 'Contingencies' and 'Run.' The 34-year-old agent has pled not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have already said that they would appeal Giles’ decision.

Fearing Hamas coup, PA battles terror groups in Jenin	Palestinian Authority forces kill Jenin Brigades terrorist, sparking condemnation from Hamas. By World Israel News Staff The Palestinian Authority's security forces launched a deadly counter-terror operation in Jenin, against the backdrop of fears that Hamas is gearing up for a coup that would wrest control of territory from the PA to the terror group. On Saturday, intense gunbattles were reported in the city, long known as a hotbed for terror, as PA forces targeted local terror groups. PA spokesperson Brigadier General Anwar Rajab said that the raid, dubbed 'Operation Protect the Homeland,' aimed to 'eradicate sedition and chaos' within PA-administered enclaves in Judea and Samaria. 'These [terror] groups do not represent the nation and they operate&#8230;outside of morality and the historical and national struggle of the Palestinians – behind these groups stands a force that aims to harm Palestinian stability and the peace of the residents,' Rajab staid in a statement on Saturday. 'Unfortunately, we are facing a group that has sold itself for cheap material benefits and is carrying out ISIS-like acts that do not represent the Palestinian people.' According to Arabic-language reports, the PA security forces 'stormed' Ibn Sina Hospital, surrounded another medical center, and searched ambulances, apparently in an attempt to detain terrorists who had been wounded in the firefights. The commander of the Jenin Brigades terror group, Yazid Ja’ayseh, was said to have been killed in the clashes. The PA is reportedly withholding Ja'ayseh's body from his family, presumably out of concern that a mass funeral for the slain terrorists would spark further unrest. Hamas, which is allied with the Jenin Brigades, condemned the killing of the 'martyr leader' as 'shameful,' warning that his death would 'fuel internal disputes.' The Popular Resistance Committee, an umbrella group of terror organizations, slammed the PA in a statement about Ja’ayseh’s killing. His slaying constitutes 'a serious violation of all national norms and traditions,' the group said, claiming that the PA was acting 'in line with the Zionist agenda that aims to eliminate the resistance in the West Bank.'

Gaza civilian death toll massively inflated – report	Study finds Western media outlets unquestioningly accepted Hamas statistics, which massively inflated the number of civilian casualties in order to 'vilify Israel.' By World Israel News Staff Death toll estimates submitted by the Gaza health ministry have consistently exaggerated the number of civilian casualties inflicted during the ongoing war between Hamas and Israel a new report finds. According to the Gaza health ministry - administered under the supervision of the Hamas terror organization - there have been a total of 44,930 fatalities in the Gaza Strip as a result of armed hostilities with Israel over the 14 months since October 7th, 2023. Gaza health officials have claimed that the vast majority of those fatalities were civilians, with an analysis by the United Nations covering confirmed deaths during a six-month period early in the war suggesting that 70% of the dead were women and children. Western media outlets have echoed claims by the Gaza health ministry, including CNN's Fareed Zakaria stating on air that Israel's campaign against Hamas had 'resulted in 35,000 civilians dying.' However, a new study jointly conducted by the Fifty Global Research Group and Henry Jackson Society think-tank, has found that the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry's death toll data consistently marked the ages of those killed downward compared to their information as listed by the Palestinian Population Register - thus inflating the number of children killed in the conflict. 'This misclassification contributes to the narrative that civilian populations, particularly women and children, bear the brunt of the conflict, potentially influencing sentiment and media coverage,' said the study's lead author, Andrew Fox, in an interview with The Telegraph. In addition, the Gaza health ministry fallaciously included deaths unrelated to the war, counting some 5,000 natural deaths as war fatalities, the report claimed. These included cancer patients who were apparently still alive at the time of their alleged deaths from Israeli attacks, appearing on lists of those receiving hospital treatments, before dying later of their illnesses. The report also accused the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry of including deaths caused by misfired Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad rockets, attacks by Hamas terrorists against Gaza civilians, or other internecine violence in their list of fatalities from Israeli attacks. 'The ministry of health, operating under Hamas, has systematically inflated the death toll by failing to distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths, over-reporting fatalities among women and children and even including individuals who died before the conflict began,' the report said. 'This has led to a narrative where the Israel Defense Forces are portrayed as disproportionately targeting civilians, while the actual numbers suggest a significant proportion of the dead are combatants.' The United Nations too, the researchers said, is guilty of misrepresenting the data and conflating civilian and terrorist casualties. 'The omission creates a skewed narrative portraying all casualties as civilian, shaping public opinion and international policy based on incomplete or manipulated data . . with Israel accused of ‘genocide’, ‘ethnic cleansing’ and ‘crimes against humanity’,' the authors wrote. In contrast to the U.N. report, which assessed confirmed deaths from November 2023 through April 2024 and found that 70% were either women or children, the Fifty Global Research Group/Henry Jackson Society report determined that the majority of all war fatalities in Gaza occurred among males between the ages of 15 and 45. Analysing 1,378 news articles by major American and British outlets including CNN, the BBC, The New York Times, The Guardian, The Washington Post, ABC, Reuters, and The Associated Press, the study found a massively lop-sided reliance on Hamas statistics, often cited without question. The report shows that virtual all the articles assessed (98%) cited data provided by the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, while just 3% cited Israeli data. In this vein, few articles noted Israeli and American military estimates that of the Gaza war fatalities, some 17,000 were terrorists affiliated with Hamas - not including members of other terror groups, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Just 1% of the articles noted that the Hamas figures have not been independently verified. By comparison, a whopping 19% of articles examined cited the Hamas-backed data as established fact, without even noting the numbers were provided by the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry.

Israeli intel fears Islamists may topple Jordan’s King Abdullah	Jordan-based terror groups have used the long land border between the two countries to infiltrate Israel and carry out attacks. By World Israel News Staff Israeli intelligence agencies are concerned that Islamist rebels in Jordan could overthrow the Hashemite Kingdom's monarch, King Abdullah II, following the recenter ouster of longtime Syrian dictator Basher al-Assad. Top intelligence officials, including Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) Chief Ronen Bar and the head of the Israeli army's Intelligence Directorate, Maj.-Gen. Shlomi Binder, secretly visited Jordan on Friday to discuss the developments in the region, according to Hebrew-language media reports. Bar and Binder were met with the director of Jordan's national intelligence agency, Ahmed Husni, along with other senior officials. Jordan-based terror groups have used the long land border between the two countries to infiltrate Israel and carry out attacks. Axios reported that the meetings were focused on security issues related to the Islamist groups now tasked with forming a transitional government in Syria, with Jordan serving as a mediator between the militas and Israeli government. While many Jordanian politicians are outwardly hostile to Israel, the country has maintained a cold peace with Jerusalem since 1994, and the two countries frequently collaborate on security issues. Jordan's cooperation with Israel, including allowing its airspace to be used to shoot down incoming Iranian missiles and rockets, has sparked backlash in the kingdom. Some 70 percent of Jordan's population are of Jordanian descent, while the king is a member of the Hashemite minority. Iran and Sunni extremists have long worked to stoke tribal tensions between the groups, with the goal of toppling the royal dynasty that has ruled Jordan for more than a century. Iran has recently ramped up its efforts to smuggle weapons to Palestinian terror groups in Judea and Samaria via Jordan, as well as exacerbating anti-monarchy sentiment in the country.

‘Whoever harms our hostages will pay’ – Netanyahu	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warns Gaza terror group after it released its latest psychological warfare video, showing an unidentified Israeli captive with tattoos. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the weekend warned Gaza terrorists holding Israelis captive in the Gaza Strip, vowing that anyone responsible for harming the hostages 'will pay the price.' On Saturday, a Telegram channel used by Hamas released a pair of psychological war videos, one of which featured glimpses of an Israeli captive held in Gaza. The video of the unidentified hostage highlighted the captive's tattoos, without additional signs or a few of the captive's face to enable positive identification. In the second video released by the Hamas Telegram channel, the terror group published a computer-generated video of Netanyahu digging graves in a cemetery filled with Israeli hostages. On Saturday night, Netanyahu responded to the videos, which he called 'cruel and malicious.' 'The onslaught of Hamas propaganda videos is cruel and malicious psychological warfare,' Netanyahu said, vowing anyone responsoble for harming the hostages will 'pay the price.' 'I am in continuous contact with the hostages' families who are enduring a terrible and prolonged nightmare.' 'I have said and I reiterate: Whoever harms our hostages – will pay the price. We will continue to work relentlessly for the return home of all of our male and female hostages, the living and the deceased.' Hamas released the videos as the terror group reportedly has softened its position on two key issues in the ongoing hostage deal talks with Israel. According to a report last week by The Wall Street Journal, Hamas has indicated to Israel, via Egypt, that it no longer demands the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip as part of ceasefire. Furthermore, Hamas is reportedly now willing to accept a continued Israeli presence in two key strategic areas in the Gaza Strip - the Philadelphi Corridor on the Egyptian border, and the Netzarim Corridor which divides north and south Gaza.
