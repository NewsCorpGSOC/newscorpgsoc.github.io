‘A new chapter’: Jerusalem celebrates Trump inauguration	The Friends of Zion Museum event attracted ambassadors, Holocaust survivors, members of Israel’s Republican community, and evangelical supporters all united in support of Donald Trump. By Sveta Listratov, TPS The Friends of Zion Museum was Jerusalem’s hottest spot on Sunday night as hundreds of people flocked to watch the inauguration of President Donald Trump. The queue of people waiting to enter stretched across several small streets. But while the main event in Washington was thousands of miles away, for the attendees, this was also a day of celebration for Israel. 'This is the beginning of a new era. It’s for the State of Israel. This is a new partnership. It’s going to be four amazing years with the President of the United States,' Mike Evans, founder of the Friends of Zion Museum, told The Press Service of Israel. 'We evangelicals believe in Genesis, where God says, ‘I will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee.’ When America blesses Israel, God blesses America,' he said. The event attracted ambassadors, Holocaust survivors, members of Israel’s Republican community, and evangelical supporters. The swearing-in ceremony was broadcast live on screens across the Museum’s campus. The crowd cheered in standing ovations throughout Trump’s speech, particularly when he spoke about the release of Israeli hostages that took place a day before his inauguration. 'Hamas now understands that working with Trump’s terms is the only way forward; otherwise, hell will break loose,' Evans told the gathering. Evans also predicted significant developments in the region. 'There’s no doubt Trump will support Israel in taking action against Iran, recognizing it as a mutual enemy of Israel and the West. We will soon witness Saudi Arabia coming closer to Israel, and peace will expand, with Egypt contributing to the long-awaited change in the Middle East.' 'This was the most exciting event I’ve attended all year,' Tomer Shlomi, who traveled from northern Israel, told TPS-IL. Carlos Hernandes Sanchez, a Spanish student at Haifa University came with several other international students 'to see the atmosphere and meet the friends of Israel who are not Jewish,' he explained to TPS-IL. 'It’s a new chapter. I am quite optimistic about it for Israel,' he said.

Israel strips Amnesty of tax benefits over anti-Israel activities	Earlier this month, Amnesty International’s international board suspended its Israel branch for two years. By JNS Israel’s Tax Authority has revoked Amnesty International’s tax benefits, accusing the organization of supporting anti-Israel activities and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Monday’s decision follows an inquiry launched in July 2023 and months of review by a special team established by Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. 'Whoever acts against the State of Israel will not be eligible for benefits from the State of Israel,' said Smotrich. The Finance Ministry’s decision to revoke tax benefits stemmed partly from allegations that Amnesty Israel mirrored calls from its parent organization, including support for arms embargoes and tourism boycotts in Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria. Ministry Director-General Shlomi Heizler argued that such actions violated Israel’s Boycott Law, asserting that Amnesty Israel lacks independence due to its reliance on international funding, which constitutes 80% of its budget. Amnesty International’s international board earlier this month suspended its Israel branch for two years, citing failure to align with Amnesty’s research, discrediting its findings, and allegations of 'anti-Palestinian racism.' The Israeli branch, founded in 1964 and one of Amnesty’s oldest chapters, denies the racism claims and disputes the parent organization’s accusations of genocide and apartheid against Israel, labeling the findings flawed and inconsistent with international definitions.

Smotrich: US guaranteed Israel’s right to resume fighting in Gaza	Commenting on the conditions for the agreement with Hamas to last through the second stage, Smotrich said that 'our condition is that there is no Hamas.' By Akiva Van Koningsveld and Amelie Botbol, JNS The U.S. has provided Israel with a written guarantee that Jerusalem can resume its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip if negotiations for the second and third phases of the ceasefire agreement fail, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told JNS on Tuesday. U.S. President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden have provided Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with an official missive confirming that 'the State of Israel will be able to return to the war on day 43' if talks fail during the 42-day first phase of the agreement, Smotrich said, speaking at a meeting of his Religious Zionism Party in the Knesset in Jerusalem. This guarantee was also given to Netanyahu during phone calls with Trump and American government officials, the finance minister said, adding, 'These two things together create an American guarantee allowing us to return to war.' Commenting on the conditions for the agreement with Hamas to last through the second stage, Smotrich said that 'our condition is that there is no Hamas.' If the terrorist organization agrees, 'great, we don’t want to fight. But if it doesn’t agree, we can return to the war,' he concluded. While the Religious Zionism Party voted against the hostage deal with Hamas—which calls for the release of thousands of terrorists and an Israeli withdrawal from strategic areas in the Strip—it decided against leaving Netanyahu’s government over the deal to ensure that the war 'does not end a moment before complete victory,' said Smotrich. Smotrich had previously demanded that Netanyahu commit to resuming the war to dismantle Hamas terrorist infrastructure and secure the release through military pressure of all hostages following the deal’s first phase, which will only see 30 out of the 94 captives still held in Gaza freed. This commitment was a condition for the party remaining in the coalition. U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, whom President Donald Trump has credited with getting the deal over the finish line, refused to confirm the existence of formal guarantees in an interview with Israel’s Channel 12 News after the inauguration on Monday. 'I don’t want to discuss promises that were made; the agreement speaks for itself,' the U.S. envoy stated, adding: 'I think that everyone is well-motivated to negotiate in a good-faith way and see if we can resolve all of this amicably and in a peaceful way and in a diplomatic way.' On Sunday, three Israeli women taken hostage during the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre and held captive in Gaza for 471 days were freed as part of the first phase of the U.S.- and Qatar-brokered agreement with Hamas. Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday he’s not confident that the ceasefire deal with Hamas will hold through all three phases. 'It’s not our war. It is their war. I am not confident. But I think they’re very weakened on the other side,' he said in response to a question in the Oval Office while signing orders in the first hours of his presidency. Asked about the future governance of the Gaza Strip, the president said he believed 'you certainly can’t have the people that were there,' in an apparent reference to the Iranian-backed Hamas terror organization. Talks on the second phase of the deal are scheduled to commence in early February.

Taking responsibility for Oct 7th failures, IDF chief of staff re...	Lt. Gen Herzi Halevi, chief of Israel's military, announces his resignation, while taking responsibility for the IDF's failures on and before October 7th, 2023. By JNS Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi has informed Defense Minister Israel Katz that he will be resigning as of March, Hebrew media reported on Tuesday. Halevi, who succeeded Lt. Gen. Aviv Kochavi in January 2023, said his decision to step down stemmed from his 'responsibility for the IDF’s failure' during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border massacre, in which Gaza terrorists killed some 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. 'At this juncture, when the IDF has recorded significant achievements and is in the process of implementing a deal to release the hostages, I request to end my position on March 6, 2025,' Halevi wrote to Katz. The chief of staff vowed in the letter to transfer his command of the military 'in a qualitative and thorough manner' to his successor. With his resignation, Halevi will become the third-shortest-serving permanent IDF chief of staff after Dan Halutz, who stepped down from the role after some 20 months following the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war. Israel’s Kan News public broadcaster noted that Halevi requested to Katz that he conclude his position after the first 42-day phase of the current hostage deal with Hamas is expected to end on March 1. Hamas’s Oct. 7 assault—the deadliest single-day attack in the Jewish state’s history and the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust—led to a multi-front war against Iran’s proxies and militant allies in the region. The military’s intelligence lapses prior to the terror attack, as well as its failure to swiftly repel the mass infiltration from Gaza, has prompted a flurry of resignations in the IDF, including by top officials.

Pro-Israel group notes terrorists slated for release under hostage deal include convicted killers responsible for the murder of 16 American citizens in Israel, calls on President Trump to demand their extradition for the Palestinian Authority. By World Israel News Staff A pro-Israel advocacy group is calling on President Donald Trump to demand the extradition of Palestinian terrorists freed under the hostage deal who were convicted of murdering American citizens. Americans For A Safe Israel (AFSI) noted that the killers of 16 Americans are expected to be released in the Gaza agreement. Among the Palestinian Arab terrorists who are being released by Israel are: Mohammad Abu Warda, who was responsible for the February 25, 1996 bus bombing in Jerusalem, in which 26 passengers were murdered, including American citizens Sara Duker, Matthew Eisenfeld, and Ira Weinstein. Wael Qassem, Wassam Abbasi and Mohammed Odeh, who were responsible for the July 31, 2002 bombing at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in which nine people were killed, including U.S. citizens Marla Bennett, Benjamin Blutstein, Dina Carter, Janis Ruth Coulter, and David Gritz. Nassim Zaatari, who was involved in the August 19, 2003 bus bombing in Jerusalem in which 23 people were murdered, including American citizens Mordechai Reinitz, Yitzhak Reinitz, Goldie Taubenfeld, and 3 month-old Shmuel Taubenfeld. Ahmed Obeid, who was involved in the September 9, 2003 bombing of Cafe Hillel in Jerusalem, killing seven people, including U.S. citizens David Applebaum and his daughter Nava Applebaum. Abu Gaanam, who murdered three Jerusalem bus passengers, including elderly American Jewish peace activist Richard Lakin, on October 13, 2015. Khalil Jabarin, who murdered American citizen Ari Fuld at the Gush Etzion Junction on September 16, 2018. Americans For A Safe Israel's national chairman Moshe Phillips said that despite the terrorists having been prosecuted and serving time in Israel for the murders, they can still be charged and punished in the American legal system. 'U.S. law permits the prosecution, in America, of terrorists who kill Americans abroad. There is no legal obstacle of ‘double jeopardy,’ since they have never been prosecuted in the United States. President Trump should demand that the Palestinian Authority immediately surrender these killers of Americans so they will face justice here.' 'Allowing killers of Americans to walk free undermines America’s war against terror. It also sends a dangerous message to terrorists everywhere that they can freely murder Americans, knowing they will be released if their comrades take hostages in the future. Failure to bring these killers to justice thus incentivizes terrorism against Americans.'

6 dead, dozens wounded as IDF launches counter-terror op in Jenin	After Palestinian Authority forces pull out, Israeli army launches Operation Iron Wall against terrorist gangs in northern Samaria city of Jenin, with at least 6 dead in initial fighting. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli forces launched a major counter-terror operation in the northern Samaria city of Jenin Tuesday, an IDF spokesperson announced Tuesday afternoon. The counter-terror sweep, dubbed Operation Iron Wall, was launched in conjunction with the Shin Bet internal security agency and Israel Police, and is aimed at rogue terror groups which have dominated the city in recent years, after Palestinian Authority forces failed to reclaim control of Jenin, despite heavy fighting in December and early January. The Palestinian Authority's paramilitary force withdrew from Jenin prior to the launch of the IDF operation, which includes air support, the PA's WAFA mouthpiece reported. Video footage from the operation showed the use of armored vehicles in support of infantry units during battles in Jenin which left multiple terrorists dead and dozens wounded. According to the Palestinian Authority's health ministry, 6 were killed and 35 more wounded in clashes with IDF forces. According to a report by The Jerusalem Post which cited an Israeli security source, Tuesday's operation was launched in response to the deadly terrorist shooting in the Palestinian Authority-administered town of Al Funduq in Samaria on January 6th. Three Israelis were murdered in the attack, which was perpetrated by terrorists with ties to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad's forces in Jenin. 'On the directive of the Security Cabinet, the IDF, the ISA and the Israel Police have today begun an extensive and significant military operation to defeat terrorism in Jenin – 'Iron Wall',' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday. 'This is an additional step in achieving the objective that we have set – bolstering security in Judea and Samaria.' 'We are acting methodically and with determination against the Iranian axis wherever it reaches – in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Judea and Samaria – and we are still active.'

‘I thought I’d die in Gaza’ – Released hostages begin to share th...	Held both above and below ground and moved dozens of times, one was forced to have a medical procedure without anesthetics. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The three hostages released Sunday have begun to share details of their captivity and the terror they felt even as they were being released with a crowd of Hamas fighters around them, Channel 12 reported Tuesday. Doron Steinbrecher, Romy Gonen and Emily Damari were often but not always kept together, they said, cooking and helping each other. Gonen, who had been a medic, cared for Damari’s wounded hand and leg as best she could under the circumstances, according to a different Hebrew-language report on the hostages. They were moved dozens of times over the 15 months of the war, with some of them forced to spend the vast majority of their captivity in tunnels, not seeing the light of day. Some also spent time in places above ground, including humanitarian areas set up by the IDF in the Gaza Strip for civilians who were ordered out of their cities before the army would engage Hamas forces there. Some of them received medications they needed, but at least one had to undergo a medical procedure without being given any anesthetic for the pain. Their captors sometimes allowed them to watch the rallies for the hostages in Israel on television, and even heard their families on the radio fighting for them. They also were exposed to what happened during the Hamas-led invasion, they said. 'We understood that our families survived but found out that we had lost a lot of friends,' they said. They were terrified about what would happen to them, with one of them saying, 'I didn’t think I would return, I was sure I would die in Gaza.' They had no idea they were going to be freed until Sunday morning, they said, and 'couldn’t believe it when they told us we would be home very soon.' Their joy was tempered with fear at the end, because of Hamas’ last act of cruelty. 'We were deathly afraid at the transfer point from the hands of the terrorists to the Red Cross,' they noted, 'because of the combination of the armed terrorists and the crowds of Gazans' that surrounded them as they moved from the Hamas car to those of the international body, whose sole role in the conflict has been as a taxi service between Gaza and Israel for released hostages. Video of the transfer that Hamas publicized showed the women getting out of their car completely surrounded and hemmed in by dozens of uniformed and masked men holding automatic weapons. Many of the Arabs dressed in civilian clothing were yelling things like 'Allahu Akbar [God is great]' as they held up cellphones to record the event, a fact that belies the image Hamas tries to project to the world of a poor and starving population. The vagueness of which hostage said what was due to the censorship rules the media outlet has to abide by, the report noted.

Elon Musk’s straight-armed gesture at inauguration event ignites ...	Jerry Nadler, the Jewish Democratic congressman from Manhattan, called the gesture antisemitic and said other officials should condemn it. By Philissa Cramer, JTA When Elon Musk gave his own victory speech following Donald Trump’s inauguration, it was something he did — rather than something he said — which ignited the biggest reaction. The billionaire, who was Trump’s top donor during the 2024 election, told a crowd in Washington, D.C., 'This is what victory feels like.' Then he saluted those in attendance, twice, with a straight-armed salute. 'My heart goes out to you,' Musk then said. 'It is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured.' To some of his supporters and fans, the salute appeared to be a gesture of his gratitude that was distorted as clips were shared on social media. To many others, mostly among his critics but also including some on the far right, it bore an uncanny resemblance to the straight-armed, palm-down salute of Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party. 'For the record, the distance between Trump declaring that he was saved by God to make America great again & Musk delivering the Hitler salute was less than 4 hours,' tweeted Steve Schmidt, a former Republican operative turned critic of the party with 1.4 million followers on X, the social network Musk owns. 'My first glimpse of the inauguration is Elon Musk grabbing his chest and throwing a seig heil. Not encouraging,' tweeted Mike Rothschild, a writer whose books, including 'Jewish Space Lasers,' examine antisemitic conspiracy theories on the far right. Jerry Nadler, the Jewish Democratic congressman from Manhattan, called the gesture antisemitic and said other officials should condemn it. 'I never imagined we would see the day when what appears to be a Heil Hitler salute would be made behind the Presidential seal,' Nadler tweeted. 'This abhorrent gesture has no place in our society and belongs in the darkest chapters of human history. I urge all of my colleagues to unite in condemning this hateful gesture for what it is: antisemitism.' Full video:pic.twitter.com/OoJHbegUq7 &mdash; Yehuda Teitelbaum (@chalavyishmael) January 20, 2025 Around the same time as Nadler’s tweet, the Anti-Defamation League, the antisemitism watchdog group, issued its own ruling: 'not a Nazi salute.' The ADL has tangled with Musk over hate speech regulation on X; the group’s CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, has also praised Musk’s business acumen. 'This is a delicate moment. It’s a new day and yet so many are on edge. Our politics are inflamed, and social media only adds to the anxiety. It seems that @elonmusk made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute, but again, we appreciate that people are on edge,' the group tweeted . 'In this moment, all sides should give one another a bit of grace, perhaps even the benefit of the doubt, and take a breath,' the ADL added. 'This is a new beginning. Let’s hope for healing and work toward unity in the months and years ahead.' CNN stopped its broadcast of Musk’s speech for two anchors to discuss what one called an 'odd-looking salute.' The anchors did not explicitly compare Musk’s gesture to a 'Heil Hitler' salute. (Trump’s legal team previously sued CNN over its on-air hosts’ comparisons of his rhetoric to that of the Nazis, seeking $475 million in a suit that a Trump-appointed federal judge later dismissed .) But Kasie Hunt noted that Musk is a supporter of a German far-right party and made the analogy obliquely. 'Yes, that salute was evocative of things that we have seen throughout history,' Hunt said. She also signaled that she believed Musk’s supporters would understand the salute the same way she had, saying, 'I think our viewers are smart and they can take a look at that but it’s not something you typically see at American political rallies.' The Nazi salute was itself borrowed from Italian fascists, who adapted it from the ancient Romans. Musk did not immediately comment on the uproar on his account on X. The Jewish pro-Trump pundit Batya Ungar-Sargon, who sides with Musk on speech issues but disagrees with him on the value of issuing visas to workers from abroad, said she attributed his gesture to his famous awkwardness. 'As a person with a *strong* track record of criticizing Elon Musk, I feel extremely confident asserting that this was not a Nazi salute,' she tweeted. 'Elon Musk is a friend to the Jews. This is a man with Aspergers exuberantly throwing his heart to the crowd. We don’t need to invent outrage.' Later, she posted again about Musk’s gesture with a reference to a scientific theory under which a hypothetical subject can be seen in multiple ways with equal accuracy. 'Man it’s not even 5pm on Inauguration Day and we already have a Schroedingers Nazi salute,' Ungar-Sargon wrote . 'Gonna be a long four years…' The post Elon Musk’s straight-armed gesture at inauguration event ignites comparisons to Nazi salute appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/elon-musks-straight-armed-gesture-at-inauguration-event-ignites-comparisons-to-nazi-salute/	2025-01-21T03:37:53-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/musk-salutr.jpg

By Jewish Breaking News NJ Assemblyman Jamel Holley ignited speculation with a social media post stating, 'Just left a conversation and my source indicated to me that a key Democratic senator is expected to change party affiliation to Republican by next week. Wow!' Rumors point to Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman as the potential defector. Analysts suggest that Fetterman’s shift toward conservative policies has alienated far-left Democrats in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, leading to primary challenges and a lack of party support. 'If he maintains his conservative lean, rural PA and suburban Republicans will back him,' commented one analyst.

Hamas praises Trump, credits him with securing Gaza ceasefire	Trump is a 'serious president,' says senior Hamas leader, lauding the new president for 'ending the war' in the Gaza Strip and welcoming Trump's Middle East envoy to visit Gaza. By World Israel News Staff A top Hamas official praised President Donald Trump on the eve of his inauguration, crediting the incoming president with achieving the recently implemented Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal. Mousa Abu Marzouk, a member of Hamas’ ruling politburo and former politburo chairman who now lives in exile in Qatar, told The New York Times via telephone Sunday that the deal reached between Israel and Hamas in Doha last week was achieved thanks to the intervention of then-President-elect Donald Trump and his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. During the interview, Marzouk lauded Trump as a 'serious president,' adding that the hostage deal, which went into effect Sunday morning, could not have been achieved without Trump’s involvement. Marzouk went on to describe the agreement as 'ending the war' in Gaza. 'If not for President Trump, his insistence on ending the war, and his dispatching of a decisive representative,' referring to Witkoff, 'the deal wouldn’t have happened.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior Israeli leaders have stated publicly Israel may resume the war against Hamas after the first six-week phase of the deal. 'Truthfully, Trump gets the credit for ending the war,' Marzouk said. The American-educated former chief of Hamas’ political echelon expressed optimism regarding the prospects of long-term dialogue with the Trump administration, saying he is hopeful the terror group can reach 'understandings' with the U.S. 'We’re prepared for a dialogue with America and achieving understandings on everything.' Marzouk responded to reports from the Trump transition team that Witkoff is mulling a visit to the Gaza Strip itself. 'He can come and see the people and try to understand their feelings and wishes so that the American position can be based on the interests of all the parties, and not only one party,' said Marzouk.

Senate confirms Rubio in 99 to 0 vote, cementing Trump’s first of...	Rubio and President Donald Trump both vowed to rein in the diplomatic agency by refocusing it on what the newly installed White House described Monday as an 'America-First foreign policy.' By The Washington Free Beacon The Senate overwhelmingly confirmed Marco Rubio as America's new Secretary of State on Monday evening, fast-tracking the now-former Florida senator through a confirmation process in which he gained broad backing from lawmakers in both parties. Senators voted to confirm Rubio, who was first elected to represent the Sunshine State in the upper chamber in 2011, in a 99 to 0 vote. During his confirmation hearing last week, Rubio earned praise from both Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he once served as a senior member. Rubio takes over a State Department that aggressively pursued liberal policies under the Biden administration, including through diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives that cost millions in taxpayer dollars. Rubio and President Donald Trump both vowed to rein in the diplomatic agency by refocusing it on what the newly installed White House described Monday as an 'America-First foreign policy.' Rubio is already scheduled to meet this week with the foreign ministers from top U.S. allies in India, Japan, and Australia. The discussions, officials told the Associated Press, are aimed toward combating China’s aggression in the Indo-Pacific region. Rubio described China as a top foreign policy challenge when he appeared before the Senate last week. He also promised to more forcefully confront China’s mass human rights abuses, including most notably its oppression of the Uyghur population. Rubio will play a critical role in shaping the Trump administration’s Middle East policies following four years of often public bickering between Israel and the Biden administration. Those policies are certain to include robust support for the Jewish state. Rubio will immediately oversee a tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which came after Trump promised to rain 'hell' on Hamas if the hostages were not released. 'There are opportunities available in the Middle East that did not exist 90 days ago,' Rubio said during his Senate confirmation hearing, crediting Israel with fundamentally reshaping the region by wiping out Hamas, Hezbollah, and other Iranian proxy groups. In keeping with Trump’s pledge to eradicate wasteful spending and stop the American government’s embrace of left-wing policies, Rubio signaled his desire to abandon international institutions that pursue anti-Israel and anti-American policies. This includes the International Criminal Court (ICC), which is facing tough U.S. sanctions for trying to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'The ICC has done tremendous damage to its global credibility,' Rubio said last week. 'This is a test run. This is a trial run to see, can we go after a head of state from a nation that’s not a member. If we can go after them and get it done with regards to Israel, they will apply that to the United States at some point.' U.S. foreign assistance, Rubio added, 'is not charity. Fealty to progressive politics became the benchmark for success. That view is diminishing very quickly.' Ahead of Rubio confirmation, a large number of State Department diplomats vacated their posts at the Trump administration’s behest, including political appointees and career foreign service officers who served in senior roles under former president Joe Biden. A similar effort is reportedly underway at the White House National Security Council.

‘Hostages’ voted Hebrew word of the year	Runner-up words were gevurah (heroism) and hutar l’pirsum (it was allowed to be published), the academy said. By Pesach Benson, TPS In solidarity with the captives held by Hamas for 473 days, Israeli voters selected the word 'hostages' (hatufim in Hebrew) as 2024’s Word of the Year, the Hebrew Language Academy announced on Monday. 'In these days when we are all following with anticipation and vigilance the release of the kidnapped men and women from Hamas captivity in Gaza, the public voted en masse and chose the word 'hostages' as the word of the year – by a majority of 45%,' the academy said. 'This year, the year of the longest and most difficult war in our history, was also a year in which we sometimes felt at a loss for words. And yet, throughout the year, words stood out that reflected reality: the pain, sorrow, and anger on the one hand, and the pride, exaltation, and gratitude to those who sacrificed their lives on the other. The words chosen for the top spots represent this whole,' the academy explained. 'We all hope that on the eve of Hebrew Day next year, we will be torn between words that indicate joy and peace,' it added. Runner-up words were gevurah('heroism') and hutar l’pirsum ('it was allowed to be published'), the academy said. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 94 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. The academy announces its annual word of the year on the Hebrew birthday of Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, a linguist who was the driving force behind reviving Hebrew as a modern spoken language. Born in present-day Belarus in 1858, he moved to Israel in 1881. Living in Jerusalem, he wrote the first dictionary of modern Hebrew and published a Hebrew language newspaper.

IDF: Gazans can return to north next week if Hamas honors deal	The IDF also warned against approaching Israeli territory and the buffer zone near the border, calling the latter area 'extremely dangerous.' By JNS Unarmed Palestinians will be allowed to return to the northern Gaza Strip without needing to pass security checkpoints starting next week if Hamas adheres to the ceasefire deal, the Israeli military reiterated on Tuesday. Jerusalem remains 'committed to ensuring all aspects of the agreement are implemented,' tweeted Israel Defense Forces Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, head of the Arab Media Branch in the IDF’s Spokesperson’s Unit, on Tuesday. 'If Hamas adheres to all the details of the agreement, starting next week, the residents of the Gaza Strip will be able to return to the northern part of the Strip, and directives will be issued in this regard,' wrote Adraee. In the meantime, the spokesman warned Gazans against approaching the Netzarim Corridor, which divides the Strip’s south from its north. 'Per the agreement, IDF forces will remain deployed in specific areas of the Gaza Strip. Do not approach IDF forces in the area until further notice. Approaching the forces exposes you to danger,' he said. Adraee also warned against approaching Israeli territory and the buffer zone near the border, calling the latter area 'extremely dangerous.' Video footage aired by Israel’s Kan News public broadcaster on Tuesday showed armed members of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s 'armed wing,' burying terrorists in the Jabaliya area in northern Gaza. הלוויה במחנה הפליטים ג'באליא בצפון הרצועה, הארונות מכוסים בדגלי חמאס ומלווים באנשי הזרוע הצבאית של חמאס pic.twitter.com/BcvbeaTMfk &mdash; Nurit Yohanan (@nurityohanan) January 21, 2025 According to the terms of the deal between the Jewish state and the Palestinian terror group, seven days after the Jan. 19 implementation of the agreement, noncombatants will be allowed to return to the northern Strip by foot, without weapons or security checks, via Al-Rashid Street. Vehicles may also return northward via the Netzarim Corridor on the seventh day, subject to inspection by a private security company designated by the mediators and coordinated with Jerusalem. On day 22 of the deal, unarmed Palestinians will be allowed to return to the northern Strip on foot via Salah a-Din road, also without inspection. On Monday evening, Hamas announced it would next free four more hostages on Saturday, backtracking on previous threats to delay their release by a day. Hamas reversed course following Israeli appeals to the mediators, Ynet reported. An Israeli government source stressed in comments cited by local media that a Sunday release would violate the terms of the deal, which calls for four captives to be returned seven days after Jan. 19. Hebrew media had previously reported that the government in Jerusalem was trying to determine whether the terror organization’s reported threat constituted a legitimate announcement or psychological warfare.

Israeli defense chief orders army to block Palestinian victory ce...	Defense Minister Israel Katz instructs IDF to take steps to prevent public celebrations in Judea and Samaria over the release of Palestinian terrorists as part of the hostage deal with Hamas. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israel's defense minister has ordered the IDF to actively prevent public celebrations and victory marches by Palestinian Arabs in Judea and Samaria, following the release of jail terrorists as part of the hostage deal with Hamas. Israel released 90 jailed Palestinian terrorists on Sunday, in the first stage of a staggered swap which is set to span six weeks. Hamas is slated to release 30 additional Israeli hostages, both dead and alive, while Israel has committed to release 30 jailed terrorists for every freed Israeli civilian, and 50 for each IDF soldier released from captivity. On Monday, Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) penned a letter to IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, instructing the military to prevent public gatherings in Judea and Samaria celebrating the terrorist releases, to actively target armed terrorists who take part in any victory parades, and to crack down on terror groups operating in the area. 'All necessary measures must be taken to prevent the recurrence of release celebrations and large Palestinian processions in honor of the release of Palestinian terrorists to Judea and Samaria – and to target any armed Palestinian terrorist participating in these processions,' wrote Katz. 'The fight against Palestinian terrorism in Judea and Samaria is now the top priority for the IDF and the State of Israel,' Katz continued, citing recent attacks, including a deadly shooting in Samaria, and efforts by Iranian-backed terror cells to expand operations in Judea and Samaria. 'The Iranian terror network and radical Sunni Islamic [groups] primarily operate within Palestinian refugee camps to advance advanced terror means, funding, and directives for carrying out terror activities against IDF soldiers and Jewish settlers. Action must be taken against them with full force to eliminate the terror infrastructure.' 'Victory celebrations for terrorists must not provide additional encouragement to terrorism. It is our duty to provide full protection to the settlers and communities in Judea and Samaria and along the security barrier.'

Trump ‘not confident’ Gaza ceasefire will last, hints US may help...	Hours after taking office, President Trump says he is 'not confident' that the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip will hold through all three stages, while adding Hamas 'weakened' and most of its leaders dead. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump said Monday he is not very confident the recently implemented ceasefire between Israel and the Hamas will hold through all three planned phases, while suggesting his administration may aid in the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip. Hours after his inauguration on Monday, President Trump spoke with reporters in the Oval Office as he signed a series of executive orders, overturning dozens of policies put in place by the Biden administration. When asked by a reporter whether he is confident the ceasefire in Gaza - which went into effect Sunday morning - will hold, Trump responded that he is 'not confident.' 'I am not confident. It's not our war. It is their war. I am not confident. But I think they are very weakened on the other side,' Trump said, referring to the leadership of Hamas and the terror group's patron, Iran. When questioned regarding the future of the Gaza Strip and the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the coastal enclave after the war, Trump said Gaza has been left by 15 months of war 'like a massive demolition site' and will have to be 'rebuilt in a different way.' Trump said he 'might' aid in the reconstruction of Gaza after the war, while suggesting Strip's 'phenomenal location' on the coast give it tremendous potential. 'You know, everything's good,' he said. 'Some beautiful things could be done with it, but it's very interesting, but some fantastic things could be done with Gaza.' The president ruled out Hamas' return to power after the war, saying the terror group 'didn't exactly run [Gaza] well, they ran [it] viciously and badly,' adding that 'You certainly can't have the people that were there. Most of them are dead.'

Iran ‘terrified’ for nuclear program as Trump takes office: Analy...	Iran researcher says that regime is concerned about Trump, now willing to engage inn negotiations over future of its nuclear development program. By World Israel News Staff The Iranian regime is extremely concerned about the future of its nuclear program and crippling economic sanctions following the inauguration of President Donald Trump, an Iranian affairs analyst told Hebrew-language outlet Ma'ariv. Benny Sabati, an Iran researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies, said that 'the Iranian regime is really afraid of Trump taking office.' He noted that 'every day, there is another statement from a senior Iranian official, declaring that the regime wants talks and that they want negotiations, and do not want nuclear weapons, and that the economic situation is difficult.' Sabati said these statements 'really scream 'come talk to us.'' He noted that the willingness to engage in talks was mostly coming from the more 'moderate wing of the Iranian regime,' which may include President Masoud Pezeshkian and his advisors. Sabati explained that Trump's election had exacerbated existing schisms with Iran's leadership. 'The regime is in conflict with itself, because there are two schools of thought within the Iranian regime. Iran is in a kind of mess,' he told Ma'ariv. With its public threats to Israel, Tehran 'has climbed a very high tree, and it is difficult for it to get down.' The conservative flank of the Iranian government includes many influential personalities who are 'unwilling to agree to talks and negotiations,' Sabati said. Those leaders are pushing for Iran to emphasize its strength, along with encouraging the 'Revolutionary Guards continue to bare their teeth.' Sabati said that the Iranian people - unlike their government - are excited about Trump's election, and have high hopes for the American president's potential impact on their country. 'The public is very happy with Trump's inauguration. They believe that his arrival will bring about a very significant change in the Iranian regime, and perhaps even overthrow it,' Sabati said. 'These are [the Iranian people's] heartfelt wishes.'

Trump nixes sanctions on Israeli settlers – days after Biden exte...	As one of his first acts after taking office, Trump rolls back dozens of Biden's executive orders, including sanctions against a list of Israeli residents of Judea and Samaria - days after Biden extended the order for another year. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Just hours after taking office on Monday, President Donald Trump signed a flurry of executive orders revoking orders put in place by his predecessor, Joe Biden, including several targeting Israel or Israeli citizens. Among the executive orders Trump signed Monday overturning Biden-era policies was a measure terminating restrictions on arms sales to Israel imposed during the war in Gaza. Additionally, Trump signed a sweeping order overturning 66 of Biden's executive orders and 12 of his presidential memorandums, including the February 1st, 2024 Executive Order 14115, which targeted Israelis living in Judea and Samaria whom the Biden White House designated as 'extremist settlers.' Last Tuesday, then-President Biden issued a new order extending the sanctions by one year. Biden issued a statement defending the move, calling the alleged actions of the sanctioned settlers an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' to American national security and foreign policy. 'The situation in the West Bank — in particular high levels of extremist settler violence, forced displacement of people and villages, and property destruction — has reached intolerable levels and constitutes a serious threat to the peace, security, and stability of the West Bank and Gaza, Israel, and the broader Middle East region,' Biden claimed. 'These actions undermine the foreign policy objectives of the United States, including the viability of a two-state solution and ensuring Israelis and Palestinians can attain equal measures of security, prosperity, and freedom.' The original February 2024 executive order was issued in response to claims by left-wing NGOs in Israel and reports by the United Nations accusing Israeli residents of Judea and Samaria of violence and harassment against Palestinian Arabs in the wake of the October 7th, 2023 invasion.

Scared of Trump? Hamas back to original hostage release dates	Hamas said that the next hostage release will take place on Saturday, January 25, as was originally scheduled. By World Israel News Staff Hamas has reversed a decision to change the dates upon which it releases hostages, after American and Israeli commentators noted that the delay constitutes a violation of the newly-implemented ceasefire with Israel. The terror group said in a media statement on Monday evening that it would deviate from the agreed-upon terms in the truce, which require Hamas to provide Israel with the names of hostages to be released on Fridays and transfer the captives to the Red Cross on Saturdays. For seemingly no other reason besides psychological warfare, Hamas announced that it would delay the process by 24 hours, giving Israel the names on Saturdays and only releasing the kidnapped Israelis on Sundays, forcing the hostages to spend yet another day in captivity. But in a hastily-released statement published hours later on Monday night, Hamas clarified that it would indeed abide the original terms of the agreement. Hamas said that the next hostage release will take place on Saturday, January 25, as was originally scheduled. President Donald Trump has stressed that he expects both Hamas and Israel to respect the terms of the ceasefire, threatening serious consequences for violations of the truce. The terror group may have backed down from its original plan to the delay the release under pressure from the Trump administration. According to Hebrew-language media reports, Israeli officials expect the release of one civilian and three female soldiers, who were kidnapped from the Gaza-adjacent Nahal Oz base. Over the next month, three hostages are expected to release on Saturdays. A final group of 14 hostages is expected to be released on the last day of the first phase of the ceasefire. If the ceasefire holds and all 33 hostages are released in the initial stage, Israel and Hamas will continue negotiations for the second and third phases of the truce. There are currently 94 hostages held in the Gaza Strip. The post Scared of Trump?

IDF preparing for major operations in Judea and Samaria	As thousands of terrorists to be released to Judea and Samaria, IDF readying to crack down on terror. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli military is gearing up for 'significant operations' in Judea and Samaria, following a ceasefire with Hamas that will free thousands of Palestinian terrorists from prison and return them to the region. 'Along with the intense defense preparations in the Gaza Strip, we must be prepared for significant operations in Judea and Samaria in the coming days in order to preempt and catch the terrorists before they reach our civilians,' IDF Chief of Staff Herzi HaLevi said in remarks published by the military. Halevi also added that the IDF's senior leadership must 'formulate plans for the continuation of the fighting, both in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon.' Nearly 2,000 terrorists are currently slated for release during the ceasefire, including some of the masterminds of the deadliest Palestinian terror attacks in Israeli history. Mohammed Abu Warda, who is currently serving 48 life sentences for his involvement in a series of bus bombings during the Second Intifada, is expected to be released within the next month. Zakaria Zubeidi, the commander of the Al Aqsa Marytrs' Brigade in Jenin who successfully escaped Gilboa Prison in 20212, is also set to be freed. Since October 7th, 2023, Israel has been fighting a war on multiple fronts, enduring attacks originating from Gaza, Judea and Samaria, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Yemen. With a ceasefire appearing to hold in Gaza and Lebanon, Syria focused on its internal struggles, and the Iranian axis weakened, the IDF is likely shifting its focus to Judea and Samaria. Iran has long worked to instigate violence and unrest within Judea and Samaria, with Tehran working to smuggle weapons to terrorists based in Palestinian Authority-controlled territory. Although Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has referred to the Gaza ceasefire as a 'temporary pause,' President Donald Trump has stressed that he expects a permanent end to the fighting.

Trump removes Biden-era weapon shipment restrictions on Israel	Trump’s executive order signals a complete reversal of Biden’s approach, removing all conditions on military aid to Israel. By Jewish Breaking News President Donald Trump signed an executive order today removing all restrictions on U.S. weapons shipments to Israel that were previously imposed by the Biden administration. The move was hailed by Israeli leaders as a significant step in safety and security for Israel. Background: Biden and Harris Policies on Arms to Israel During President Joe Biden’s administration, restrictions were placed on certain arms transfers to Israel following international concerns over the use of advanced U.S. weaponry in conflicts with Gaza. Vice President Kamala Harris, reportedly pushed for tighter scrutiny of military aid to Israel. This led to delays and limitations on high-tech arms deliveries, including precision-guided munitions. The Biden administration justified these measures as necessary to balance U.S. support for Israel with concerns over civilian casualties in military operations. However, the policy faced backlash from pro-Israel lawmakers and advocacy groups, who argued it undermined Israel’s ability to defend itself against terrorist threats such as Hamas. Trump’s Decision Trump’s executive order signals a complete reversal of Biden’s approach, removing all conditions on military aid to Israel. In his announcement, Trump emphasized the importance of Israel’s security and its right to defend itself, calling the restrictions 'unnecessary and harmful to our greatest ally in the Middle East.' Implications The decision is expected to accelerate the delivery of advanced weaponry, including precision-guided missiles and defense systems, bolstering Israel’s military capabilities. Critics argue that removing restrictions may exacerbate tensions in the region and lead to increased scrutiny from international watchdogs. This executive order underscores Trump’s broader foreign policy pivot toward solidifying alliances with key partners while taking a harder stance against adversaries in the Middle East. The move may also influence U.S. domestic politics, with Democrats likely to push back on what they see as an overly aggressive policy shift.

Hamas used ‘altered images’ to fake huge turnout at hostage relea...	A few hundred people crammed together to make it look like endless masses.' By World Israel News Former IDF spokesperson Peter Lerner, a seasoned expert in media coverage, recently shed light on Hamas's ongoing manipulation of public perception during the release of three Israeli hostages on Sunday. The hostages, freed after 15 months of captivity as part of a 42-day ceasefire agreement, were handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza amidst highly orchestrated media optics. Lerner took to social media platform X to address the portrayal of events on the ground, calling out the staged scenes meant to project Hamas's strength. 'I was asked several times today about the optics of Hamas’ obvious strength. Here’s the real optics,' he posted, sharing both authentic and altered images to highlight the manipulation. 'A few hundred people crammed together to make it look like endless masses. Today the images from the ground were orchestrated by Hamas; they wanted to project power. Everything they show is manipulation.' This strategy of media control is not new for Hamas. During the 2014 Operation Protective Edge, the group implemented a strict campaign to control narratives coming out of Gaza. Documents from the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center reveal that Hamas’s Ministry of Interior and its media division issued explicit directives to shape coverage. Journalists were prohibited from photographing rocket launch sites or showing Hamas operatives’ faces, and every terrorist casualty had to be reported as an 'innocent civilian.' The risks for journalists who defied these orders were significant. According to Honest Reporting, reporters who documented rocket launchers near civilian areas were expelled from Gaza if they exposed the findings. Others waited until they were safely outside Gaza before sharing their accounts of what they had witnessed. These documented examples of Hamas inflating casualty numbers and tightly controlling media narratives reveal a consistent strategy over the past decade. Lerner has also been vocal about Israel's shortcomings in public relations, particularly after the October 7 attacks. In an interview with Haaretz, he criticized Israeli leadership for failing to provide a coherent communication strategy as global sympathy for Israel began to wane. Having participated in 750 international interviews, Lerner described feeling unsupported by the government in addressing pressing questions about Israel’s objectives and future plans. 'I, as a spokesperson, started fielding questions on the subject already on October 10: ‘What are your goals, what are you trying to achieve, what are your plans for the future?’' Lerner explained. 'Very soon I understood that I didn’t have the answers to these questions. Not because they haven’t decided, but because they’re just never going to decide.' As Hamas continues its calculated efforts to influence global opinion, Lerner’s insights serve as a reminder of the importance of countering propaganda with transparency and factual reporting. These tactics, rooted in manipulation, highlight the ongoing challenges of navigating narratives in one of the world’s most complex conflicts.

By World Israel News At a rally marking his post-inauguration, former President Donald Trump declared a 'golden era' in U.S.-Israel relations, turning a typically political event into a platform for advocacy and human connection. The event, defined by its emotional weight, featured former hostage Noa Argamani and families of Israeli captives who remain in Gaza. Wearing yellow scarves symbolizing hope and solidarity, the group stood as a living testament to the ongoing crisis and the human toll it has taken. Introduced by Middle East negotiator Steve Witkoff, Argamani and the families joined Trump on stage in a moment that underscored the urgency of their plight. Argamani's visibly sorrowful demeanor—stemming from her boyfriend Avinatan Or's continued captivity—added a personal dimension to the broader narrative of international diplomacy. Trump's promise to strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship and his commitment to securing the release of hostages resonated deeply with the audience. Witkoff, the event’s sole speaker before Trump, praised the former president's leadership in brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Highlighting the role of decisive leadership in achieving the fragile peace and recent hostage releases, Witkoff credited Trump with breakthroughs that many had deemed impossible. The rally took a poignant turn as families of hostages joined him on stage, marking a powerful moment of unity and purpose. Throughout the evening, Trump, joined by former First Lady Melania Trump and Senator JD Vance, personally greeted each family member, shaking hands and offering words of encouragement. While the rally also touched on broader political themes, the presence of these families became the symbolic heart of the event, signaling a clear alignment with Israel during a fraught moment in international relations. The inclusion of these families highlighted the administration’s stance on combating terrorism and supporting Israel, underscoring a commitment that extends beyond diplomacy to address deeply personal human struggles. For the families, it was not just a political moment but a platform to bring global attention to their cause—a cause that Trump vowed to champion as part of his broader foreign policy objectives. In his speech, Trump left no ambiguity about his allegiance, ensuring that the U.S.-Israel alliance would remain a cornerstone of his administration’s strategy. The rally, charged with raw emotion and strategic messaging, bridged the personal and political, turning a routine event into a call for unity and action in the face of adversity.

Hamas violates hostage deal by delaying next release of hostages	The terror group announced on Monday that the next four hostages would be released to Israel next Sunday rather than on Saturday, as previously agreed. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hamas has violated the terms of the hostage deal by delaying the next release of captives from Saturday to Sunday. The terror group announced on Monday that the next four hostages would be released to Israel next Sunday rather than on Saturday, as previously agreed. Hamas spokesperson Nahed Fakhoury said, 'The second phase of the initial process will begin on Saturday, January 25, 2025. On this day, the resistance will submit the names of Israeli captives to be released, and in return, Israel will present a list of Palestinian prisoners to be freed. The exchange itself is scheduled to occur on Sunday, January 26, 2025, based on these lists.' Israeli officials expect the release of one civilian and three female soldier observers kidnapped from the Nahal Oz base on October 7. As with previous releases, the hostages are expected to be brought by Hamas to the Red Cross in Gaza before being transported to Israel to be reunited with their families and receive medical care. Prior to the release of three female civilian hostages on Sunday, Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher, and Emily Damari, Hamas delayed releasing the names on Saturday afternoon, as required by the agreement. Although the delay didn't lead to a breakdown in the hostage deal, an Israeli official warned that such infractions by Hamas should not be frequent. In the following weeks, 33 hostages are slated to be released, most of them women, children, men over 50, and ill hostages. The 33 hostages are Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Ohad Ben Ami, the four members of the Bibas family, Yarden, Shiri, Ariel, Kfir, Agam Berger, and Romi Gonen. Other names include: Daniella Gilboa, Emily Damari, Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn, Omer Wenkert, Alexander Troufanov, Arbel Yehud, Ohad Yahalomi, Eliya Cohen, Or Levy, Naama Levy, Oded Lifshitz, Gadi Moshe Mozes, Avera Mengistu, Shlomo Mansour, Keith Samuel Siegel, Tsahi Idan, Ofer Calderon, Tal Shoham, Doron Steinbrecher, Omer Shem-Tov, Itzik Elgarat, Hisham al-Sayed, and Eli Sharabi.

British, Israeli soccer teams celebrate return of Hamas hostage, ...	Tottenham fans have shown solidarity with Damari many times since she was kidnapped in 2023 by releasing yellow balloons in her honor, hanging posters about her, and tying hundreds of yellow ribbons around the team’s home stadium. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner The English Premier League soccer team Tottenham Spurs and the Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer team in Israel celebrated the return home of British-Israeli dual citizen Emily Damari as one of the three civilian hostages who were released from Hamas captivity on Sunday as part of the ceasefire deal between Israel and the terrorist organization. Damari, a 28-year-old passionate Tottenham supporter, as well as Nova music festival survivor Romi Gonen, 23, and veterinary nurse Doron Steinbrecher, 30, returned to Israel on Sunday morning after being abducted more than 15 months ago during the Hamas-led terrorist attack in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Damari, the only British hostage still in captivity, and Steinbrecher were both kidnapped from their homes in Kibbutz Kfar Aza. On Sunday, the official account on X for Tottenham supporters in Israel shared a photo of Damari and the caption read, 'Emily is coming home TODAY! #ShesOneOfOurOwn.' At several soccer matches since Damari’s abduction, fans of the north London team have chanted 'Emily Damari, she’s one of our own, she’s one of our own, Emily Damari, bring her home.' Former Tottenham player Ramon Vega also shared his excitement about Damari’s return. After Tottenham loss to Everton 3-2 on Sunday, the 53-year-old Swiss soccer player wrote on X: 'At least one positive thought today from the Spurs family! Welcome home, Emily. COYS Spurs!' At least one positive thought today from the Spurs family! Welcome home, Emily. COYS Spurs! &mdash; Ramon Vega (@Ramon_Vega71) January 19, 2025 Tottenham fans have shown solidarity with Damari many times since she was kidnapped in 2023. They released yellow balloons in her honor, hung posters about her, and tied hundreds of yellow ribbons around the team’s home stadium. Last week, Arsenal and Tottenham fans united in support of Damari at the north London derby. Maccabi Tel Aviv additionally celebrated Damari’s return home on Sunday. 'Our Emily is back home!' the team wrote in a Hebrew-language post on Instagram. 'We waited and prayed for 471 days for your return and today the heart is filled with happiness that you are back with us together with Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbercher.' Former Maccabi Tel Aviv player Yonatan Cohen, who now plays for the Australian team Melbourne City, also commented on Damari’s return in a Hebrew-language post on Instagram and revealed that he has been in contact with her family since her abduction. 'After the cursed day of October 7, when Emily was taken, her family reached out to me and told me about her — her joy for life, her strength, and the light she brought everywhere she went. Her story deeply touched me, and since that day, I’ve been in regular contact with her family. Emily has been on my mind constantly,' he wrote on Instagram. 'For every match, in every stadium, I wore a shirt with her picture on it, and I prayed every day that she would return to her beloved family. With every goal and every happy moment, I wished in my heart for her to smile her big smile again. When we moved to Australia, I packed her shirt with me, and I’ve been waiting ever since for the day she would become a symbol of our victory.' 'Emily’s touching comeback, full of pride and joy, is not just a victory for her family and the people of Israel — it is a victory of faith and of hope, that the good will always win,' Cohen added. 'Emily and family, today I’m excited to send you a strong hug from afar and wish you to quickly return to normal, wrapped in the warmth and love of your family and relatives. I’m already waiting to see each other when I get back to Israel. You are our victory!' The Israeli soccer team Hapoel Haifa shared several messages on social media celebrating the return of the three hostages with special attention given to Gonen, an avid fan of the team who they’ve honored in previous matches. Hapoel Haifa team members and its coach recorded a personal video message for Gonen, welcoming her back home. They also offered her free season tickets and a shirt bearing her name.

Trump to immediately halt funding to UNRWA	The executive order is one of several expected to be signed by Trump during his first week back in office. By Jewish Breaking News Former President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order halting U.S. foreign assistance immediately upon assuming office for a second term, with UNRWA reportedly at the top of the list. UNRWA, the United Nations agency responsible for distributing aid in Gaza, has faced repeated accusations of ties to Hamas. The UN recently admitted that nine of its staff may have been involved in the October 7 attack on Israel. 'The United States and American citizens have been some of the most generous people in the entire world,' an incoming White House policy adviser stated. 'But at this point, we have to understand that foreign policy is domestic policy, and if this is not aligned with our interests, then Uncle Sam should not be opening up his pocketbook any longer.' The executive order is one of several expected to be signed by Trump during his first week back in office. Other anticipated directives include: Removing insubordinate government employees. Reversing Joe Biden’s green energy projects. Keeping TikTok operational. Declaring a state of emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border. Ending 'catch and release' immigration policies. Designating Mexican drug cartels as 'foreign terrorist organizations.' Trump’s administration has signaled an aggressive approach to fulfilling campaign promises and reshaping U.S. foreign and domestic priorities.

‘The circle has closed’: 10 years after falling in combat, Oron S...	Before the funeral, Zehava Shaul met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and expressed her gratitude for recovering the body. By TPS Thousands gathered today to pay their last respects to Staff Sgt. Oron Shaul, whose body was recovered from Gaza on Sunday. Shaul, who would be 34 today, was killed on July 20, 2014 in Gaza City’s Shejaya neighborhood. He and six other soldiers were killed when their armored personnel carrier was attacked by anti-tank missiles. He was laid to rest in the northern Israeli community of Poriya. 'After so many years, I can’t believe it is happening. I still have not proceeded the fact that you are here, and that we saying good bye to you,' Oron’s brother, Ofek said. 'This hurting, devastating journey of us has come to an end,' Ofek Shaul said. 'We are sad and happy. We should be happy that you can finally rest in the place you loved so much. The circle has closed today.' Another brother, Aviram, mentioned that Oron had insisted on being drafted into a combat unit despite having health issues. 'The whole country holds its breath and salutes you today,' Aviram said. Their mother Zehava Shaul said she was grateful to all those who made the funeral possible. 'I did not believe he would return. I thank everybody – the IDF, the Shin Bet, the Prime Minister – that they did one good thing and brought you to me,' she said. Before the funeral, Zehava Shaul met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and expressed her gratitude for recovering the body. In his eulogy, President Isaac Herzog said, 'He always knew that he was fighting for his nation, his country, for the light.' Herzog reiterated Israel’s commitment to leaving no soldier behind and apologized for the lengthy wait to bring Oron home. He also assured the family of Lt. Hadar Goldin family that efforts would continue to recover their son’s remains home. Goldin’s body was captured by Hamas during fighting in Gaza in 2014.

Poll: 21% of US voters support Hamas over Israel in conflict	The Harvard/Harris survey also found that a majority of the American public believes that the negotiations led by the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump led to the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. By JNS Twenty-one percent of American voters say they support Hamas over Israel in Jerusalem’s ongoing war against the U.S.-designated terrorist organization, according to a Harvard CAPS/Harris poll published over the weekend. Harvard/Harris surveyed a representative sample of 2,650 registered voters on Jan. 15-16. (The reported margin of error for the total sample is plus or minus 1.9 percentage points at a confidence level of 95%.) Asked 'Do you support more Israel or more Hamas?' in the war, 75% of Democrats backed the Jewish state, while 25% expressed more approval for the Palestinian terrorist group. Among Republican voters, 81% said they supported Jerusalem more, compared to 19% for Hamas. Support for Hamas polled the highest among the 25 to 34 age group, where almost one-third said they favored the terrorists over Israel. The Harvard/Harris survey also found that a majority of the American public believes that the negotiations led by the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump led to the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. Fifty-seven percent of respondents said that Hamas 'agreed to the deal because of negotiations' led by Trump’s team, compared to 43% who thought that outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden made it happen. Eighty-four percent of Republicans said Trump was responsible, compared to 75% of Democrats who thought that Biden’s negotiations led Hamas to accept the truce. Among independent voters, 60% credited Trump and 40% Biden. The vast majority of respondents, 82%, said they backed 'the ceasefire deal reached between Israel and Hamas which aims to end the war in Gaza and release hostages.' Support for the deal was higher among Democrats, 87% of whom said they backed the deal, with 81% of Republicans expressing approval. Trump on Sunday evening hailed the ceasefire agreement as a 'first step toward lasting peace in the Middle East.' Speaking at a rally hours before being inaugurated as the 47th president of the United States, Trump called the agreement that freed hostages Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari 'epic.' 'This week, we achieved an epic ceasefire agreement as a first step toward lasting peace in the Middle East. And this agreement could only have happened as a result of our historic victory in November,' he told attendees at the Capitol One Arena in Washington, D.C. 'I’m glad to report that the first hostages have just been released,' he added. 'Our incoming administration has achieved all of this in the Middle East in less than three months without being president. We’ve achieved more without being president than they’ve achieved in four years with being president,' Trump said, thanking incoming Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. 'He’s an amazing guy. I said: I got to get myself a negotiator. We have to get a good negotiator. A lot of guys are knowledgeable, but they can’t negotiate. They don’t have the personality or whatever,' said Trump. 'And Steve does, and Steve’s a great negotiator, very successful guy, but he’s our new special envoy to the Middle East for helping reach this great breakthrough, and really couldn’t have been done without Steve.' Israel reportedly signaled its support for the deal—which calls for the release of thousands of terrorists and an Israel Defense Forces withdrawal from strategic areas in the Gaza Strip—after being pressured by Witkoff.

These pardons remain controversial as the individuals involved have not been charged but played pivotal roles in contentious events of recent years. By Jewish Breaking News None of those pardoned are known to have been found guilty of any pardonable crimes, but these are being viewed as preemptive pardons. Gen. Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has faced criticism for calling Donald Trump a 'fascist' and for his public condemnation of Trump’s behavior during the January 6, 2021, riot.

Hamas claims victory while admitting leadership decimated by Isra...	PA slams rival, saying the release of even 2,000 prisoners was not worth the price Gazans paid in deaths, injuries and six times more being arrested by Israel forces. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Hamas claimed victory Sunday after a ceasefire went into effect in the Gaza Strip, while admitting that almost its entire leadership was decimated by the IDF in the last 15 months of war. Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told Hezbollah-owned Al Manar TV that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'thought he was able to end the resistance in Gaza&#8230;. But he failed, and the resistance remained steadfast in the field, and even attained achievements that are recorded for it.' Hamdan’s definition of achieving a win was that Israel 'was forced to negotiate with' Hamas, and 'wanted to recover its prisoners by force, but it could not achieve that except through negotiations, while the resistance remained steadfast on the ground by the will of its people.' He also couched the loss of almost the whole top political and military echelon of both Hamas and Hezbollah to IDF forces as being 'natural for the leaders of the resistance to lead the ranks of the martyrs.' Among the names he listed of his own organization were Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by IDF soldiers in Gaza, deputy leader of Hamas’ political bureau, Saleh Al-Arouri, who was assassinated in an airstrike in Beirut, and Marwan Issa, the deputy head of Hamas's military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, who was considered Hamas’ No. 3 leader, in an airstrike in Gaza. Although both Israel and the U.S. had confirmed Issa’s death last March, this was the first time a Hamas official admitted the fact. Hamdan also hinted that Hamas was not deterred by its losses, saying that 'the battle area was Gaza, but it was not a battle for Gaza alone, but a battle to liberate Palestine and Jerusalem, and it is the beginning of the great liberation process.' Hamdan’s triumphant pose was mocked by its bitter nationalist rival, the Palestinian Authority (PA), whose popularity in the area of Judea and Samaria that it controls is very much eclipsed by Hamas. In an interview with the Saudi al-Arabiya channel, Mahmoud al-Habash, an adviser to PA President Mahmoud Abbas, said that in exchange for the expected release of perhaps 1,500 to 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, more than 50,000 Palestinians had been killed, 120,000 had been injured, and more than 13,000 Palestinians had been arrested by Israel over the course of the war. The arrests al-Habash mentioned were made by the IDF both in the Gaza Strip and the PA, with about a third of the terrorists caught in Judea and Samaria being members of the Islamist Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and most of the rest belonging to the PA’s own Fatah movement. Hamdan then demanded that Hamas acknowledge that it failed, instead of using 'empty slogans about victory.' As he noted in a separate interview with the Saudi Al-Hadath channel, the end result of 15 months of war was a tripling of the number of Palestinians prisoners now held in Israeli jails. 'Have their goals been achieved, or do they see that what happened on October 7 achieved what they wanted when Hamas did what they did?' he also asked, while deliberately obscuring the fact that the terrorists had massacred, raped and burned to death 1,200 people, the vast majority of them civilians, in their surprise invasion of southern Israel. 'Did we win by losing our loved ones?' he asked rhetorically, and went on to accuse Hamas of 'using' the 'sacred cause' of the Palestinians 'just to achieve political gains that may not be yours,' in a veiled reference to Iran, Hamas’ main financial backer and arms supplier. What Iran has long called its 'axis of resistance' against Israel, 'was exposed as an empty axis that has no value or meaning' and is instead 'a trader in the Palestinian people,' who are 'now facing a major catastrophe,' he added.

‘Don’t negotiate with terrorists’ – Republican senator blasts hos...	We didn't' negotiate with Japan' - Republican senator blasts hostage deal with Hamas, blames Joe Biden's pressure on Israel during Gaza war for failure to secure hostages' release early on. By World Israel News Staff Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas condemned the hostage deal and ceasefire reached between Israel and the Hamas terror organization in brokered talks in Doha, Qatar last week, and castigated the Biden administration's handling of the Gaza war. Speaking with Fox News' Mark Levin on Saturday, Cotton said the deal with Hamas created a dangerous precedent of negotiating with terrorist organizations, saying the U.S. should have backed Israel's position throughout the war seeking the unconditional defeat of Hamas and return of the hostages. 'We shouldn't negotiate with terrorists. We shouldn't ask Israel or any other country to negotiate with terrorists. You know we didn't negotiate with Japan after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We said unconditional surrender and release the 40,000 Americans you hold, and that's what they did,' Cotton said. Cotton, a pro-Israel stalwart who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Republican Conference, blamed President Joe Biden for the failure to secure the release of the remaining hostages prior to last week's deal, citing the administration's pressure on Israel and restrictions on arms transfers during the Gaza war. 'We wouldn't be in this position here in January of 2025, if that's the position Joe Biden had taken in October of 2023. If we had simply backed Israel to the hilt, from the beginning of this war, providing Israel the weapons that it needed, when it needed them, and in the quantities that it needed them, and certainly not putting diplomatic and political pressure on Israel to cut bad deals for the last 15 months, and in all of these exit speeches and exit interviews.' 'We should have simply backed Israel from the beginning of the war, provided it with the weapons it needed when it needed them, and not exerted political and diplomatic pressure on Israel to sign bad deals.' Cotton cited Biden's Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, who recently acknowledged that Hamas had responded to foreign pressure on Israel by toughening its position in talks or withdrawing from the negotiations altogether. 'Blinken admitted that every time international pressure was exerted on Israel, it caused Hamas to distance itself from the negotiations or raise more baseless demands.' 'The reason we are in a situation where there are still about 100 hostages left in Gaza is that Joe Biden was a weak and failed president who did not support Israel.' 'Tony Blinken has admitted that every time U.S. or international pressure was brought to bear on Israel, it caused Hamas to walk away from the table or to make more unreasonable demands, because they thought that Joe Biden or European leaders would put the pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu that Hamas couldn't on the battlefield.' 'So the reason we're in this position, where there are still almost a 100 hostages left in Gaza, seven of whom are American, is because Joe Biden has been a weak, failed president, who hasn't backed Israel.'

Yemen’s Houthis signal they’ll now limit their attacks in the Red...	The Houthis have targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023. By The Associated Press Yemen's Houthi rebels have signaled they now will limit their attacks in the Red Sea corridor to only Israeli-affiliated ships, just as a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip entered its second day Monday. The Houthis' announcement, made in an email sent to shippers and others on Sunday, likely won't be enough to encourage global firms to reenter the route that's crucial for cargo and energy shipments moving between Asia and Europe. Their attacks have halved traffic through the region, cutting deeply into revenues for Egypt, which runs the Suez Canal linking the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. 'The ceasefire is considered fragile,' said Jakob P. Larsen, the head of maritime security for BIMCO, the largest international association representing shipowners. 'It is assessed that even minor deviations from the ceasefire agreements could lead to hostilities, which would subsequently prompt the Houthis to again direct threats against a broader range of international shipping.' The Houthis separately planned a military statement on Monday, likely about the decision. The Houthis made the announcement through their Humanitarian Operations Coordination Center, saying it was 'stopping sanctions' on the other vessels it has previously targeted since November 2023. For Israeli ships, those 'sanctions &#8230; will be stopped upon the full implementation of all phases' of the ceasefire, it added. However, the center-left opened resuming attacks against both the United States and the United Kingdom, which have launched airstrikes targeting the rebels over their seaborne assaults. 'In the event of any aggression &#8230; the sanctions will be reinstated against the aggressor state,' the center said. 'You will be promptly informed of such measures should they be implemented.' The Houthis have targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023, after Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. The Iranian-backed Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels. The rebels had maintained that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked had little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The tempo of Houthi attacks has slowed in recent weeks, particularly involving ships at sea. That may be due in part to the U.S. airstrike campaign. The U.S. and its partners alone have struck the Houthis over 260 times, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies. However, the rebels had continued to launch drones and missiles targeting Israel, which has warned it will continue to strike Houthi leadership. Another wild card is President Donald Trump after he is inaugurated Monday. He may reapply a foreign terrorist organization designation on the Houthis that President Joe Biden revoked, which could spark attacks again. 'Uncertainty is further exacerbated by today’s inauguration of Trump,' Larsen said. 'It remains unclear how the Trump administration will act in the conflict with the Houthis and whether potential punitive actions against them will be considered.'

Donald Trump to be sworn in as 47th president	Breaking with diplomatic custom, Trump has extended invitations to several international leaders, including Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, Argentine President Javier Milei, and Chinese President Xi Jinping. By Jewish Breaking News Marking an unprecedented return to the White House after a four-year absence, history will be made today as Donald Trump is sworn in at 12 noon as the 47th President of the United States. In a last-minute change announced Friday, the inauguration ceremony will move inside the Capitol building due to frigid temperatures, as opposed to the traditional West Lawn venue overlooking the National Mall. Despite the change affecting the distribution of over 220,000 public tickets, Trump has assured supporters they can watch via live feed at Washington’s Capital One Arena where he plans to make an appearance later. The guest list includes former presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, though notably, Michelle Obama will be absent. Both Hillary Clinton and Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Trump defeated in different presidential races will both be in attendance. Silicon Valley will be well represented as well, with tech titans Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and TikTok CEO Shou Chew joining as VIP guests. Breaking with diplomatic custom, Trump has extended invitations to several international leaders, including Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, Argentine President Javier Milei, and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Chief Justice John Roberts will administer the oath of office to Trump for the second time, while J.D. Vance will be sworn in as Vice President. Following the constitutional proceedings, Trump will deliver his inaugural address in the Rotunda of the Capitol. The last time a president took the oath of office inside was Ronald Reagan during his second inauguration in 1985, also due to extremely cold weather. Following the indoor ceremony, Trump will participate in the traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. It might be hard to find tickets this late for Trump 2.0, as this year’s inauguration day will feature top celebrity performers. Country music star Carrie Underwood will perform 'America the Beautiful' during tomorrow’s inauguration ceremony, while Lee Greenwood will deliver his patriotic anthem 'God Bless the USA.' Three official inaugural balls will showcase performances by Jason Aldean, Rascal Flatts, Gavin DeGraw, and the Village People. Last night, a pre-inauguration rally featured the Village People performing their classic 'YMCA,' alongside Kid Rock and Billy Ray Cyrus. With Trump’s return to office, Israeli officials are expressing renewed optimism particularly after yesterday’s release of three hostages. U.S. officials warn that Hamas must honor its ceasefire agreement, or face what Trump himself stated, 'all hell will break loose.'

‘Part of them is still in that tunnel’: Freed hostages begin comp...	Six hospitals nationwide are prepared for hostage reception—four in central Israel and two near the border with Gaza—along with a multidisciplinary expert team assembled to conduct the examinations. By Maytal Yasur Beit-Or, JNS Emily Damari (28), Doron Steinbrecher (31) and Romi Gonen (24) have begun their journey back to life at Sheba Medical Center following 471 days in Hamas captivity. Medical teams, having spent months preparing for the hostages’ return, prioritized the family reunions while establishing the foundation for an intricate medical and psychological rehabilitation process. Following the hostages’ return yesterday, Hospital Director Dr. Yael Frankel Nir announced: 'I am deeply moved to report that we have received the three hostages. Their medical condition allows us to focus on family reunification. We will proceed with examinations in the coming days. We had the privilege of meeting them … and we continue this journey until the last hostage returns.' Dr. Sefi Mendlovich, Deputy Director General of the Israeli Health Ministry, stated: 'Today we welcome Emily, Doron, and Romi after 471 days in Hamas captivity. This represents an unimaginable reality. We, as medical authorities within the healthcare system, stand fully prepared to address all medical conditions.' Immediate priority: Nutrition The primary medical concern currently centers on refeeding syndrome. Following 15 months of malnutrition, sudden food reintroduction risks dangerous disruptions to the body’s fluid and electrolyte balance. Previous hostage exchanges revealed weight losses of between 10% to 17% of body mass, translating to 17-33 pounds. Given the three women’s extended period in captivity, the medical team anticipates even more complex challenges. Consequently, they must undergo extensive medical evaluation. The established medical protocol encompasses comprehensive testing: infectious disease screening, thorough nutritional assessment including vitamin levels, potassium, zinc and vitamin B12, pregnancy testing for women of reproductive age, blood clot screening—a condition previously observed in hostages due to prolonged immobility—and detailed examinations of neurological, respiratory and cardiac function. Systematic readiness Six hospitals nationwide are prepared for hostage reception—four in central Israel and two near the border with Gaza. Health Ministry guidelines recommend a minimum four-day hospitalization, allowing for necessary testing and gradual adjustment. A multidisciplinary expert team was assembled to conduct the hostage examinations. The hospital deploys specialists across various fields: ophthalmologists assessing vision after extended darkness exposure, gynecologists performing comprehensive examinations, geriatric specialists evaluating prolonged immobility effects, dentists addressing captivity-related dental issues and mental health professionals providing immediate and long-term psychological support. Specialized psychological care 'We face both emotional and medical complexities,' emphasized Dr. Frankel-Nir. 'The care system we’ve developed is based on past experiences and insights from previous events.' The mental health team is focused on giving the returnees and their families privacy and peace, making sure they’re not overwhelmed by outside stresses or too many visitors. The care system extends beyond hospital discharge, continuing into community care. 'We’ve developed a comprehensive ongoing care program,' Dr. Mendlovich explained. 'Our aim is facilitating smooth transitions from hospitalization to daily life while maintaining thorough medical and psychological monitoring.' ‘Part of them is still in the tunnel’ Professor Hagai Levine, head of Health Services at the Hostages’ Families and Missing Forum, told Israel Hayom on Monday morning that recovery for the released hostages began the moment they were released, but will be a lifelong journey. 'Mentally, part of them is still in that tunnel,' he explained. 'They spent so long with their fellow hostages that they feel guilty about doing anything enjoyable—even though they should be able to. This sense of guilt toward those still in captivity is holding back their recovery.' Professor Levine noted that this extends to the families of those who’ve returned—they remain deeply involved in fighting for the release of those still held captive, driven by the same sense of obligation. 'Even Israeli society as a whole can’t fully move forward—and understandably so—while people are still focused on bringing everyone home.' Both the hostages’ physical and mental health will need to be addressed, said Levine. 'Physically, we check for various medical conditions—in past cases, we’ve found blood clots in leg veins, hormone imbalances and malnutrition. We screen for vitamin and mineral deficiencies, weight loss and skin problems. Some patients need physical therapy. On the psychological side, there’s a long road ahead—rebuilding trust and helping them regain a sense of control over their lives.' After suffering such trauma, a significant social adjustment will be required for the hostages to reintegrate back into their former lives, he explained. 'They need to relearn how to navigate everyday interactions and eventually return to work. It’s a complex, long-term recovery process that affects both the released hostages and their families. But full recovery is particularly challenging while others remain in captivity—they find it impossible to focus entirely on their own healing while knowing others are still held hostage.'

Israel poised to strike Iran’s nuclear program – report	Senior European diplomat claims Israel has already decided to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities, as European powers reach out to incoming Trump administration in bid to pressure Israel to hold off on attack. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli government has settled on a plan to strike Iran's nuclear facilities sometime in the near future, a senior European diplomat claims. On Friday, the Saudi-based Al Arabiya news outlet reported that European powers are growing increasingly concerned that Israel may attempt to bomb Iranian nuclear sites following President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Monday. A number of European governments have, according to the report, reached out to the Trump transition team, hoping to enlist the new administration's support in pressuring Israel not to carry out the planned strikes. One senior European diplomat told the outlet that Israel has already decided on the strikes, following months of deliberations. 'We believe Israel has taken the decision to attack following the developments in the Middle East over the last several months,' the diplomat was quoted as saying. The source did not claim that the Israeli attacks are imminent, but emphasized anxiety among European leaders regarding the prospect of such airstrikes sometime in the near future. Representatives from Germany, France, and Britain held talks with Iran last Monday regarding Tehran's nuclear program, following low-key talks last November. Last month, Britain, France, and Germany expressed 'extreme concern' over Iran's burgeoning uranium enrichment capabilities. Following President-elect Donald Trump's election in November, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan reportedly briefed President Joe Biden on options for American strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, should Tehran attempt a sudden nuclear breakout. Given its current uranium enrichment levels, Iran's nuclear program is estimated to be as little as one week away from achieving the level of uranium enrichment necessary for an atomic bomb.

Izz al-Din Haddad emerges as key figure in Hamas’s rebuilding eff...	Israeli officials view Haddad as the successor to Mohammed Deif, who was killed in an airstrike in July. By Baruch Yedid, TPS Izz al-Din Haddad, commander of Hamas’s Northern Brigade, oversaw Sunday’s transfer of three Israeli hostages to the Red Cross and is viewed as a rising figure as the terror group looks to rebuild itself. Haddad, who helped plan and command the October 7 attacks, is currently tasked with rebuilding Hamas’s civilian governance and military capabilities, opening government offices, recruiting police volunteers, and managing the Netzarim corridor. An estimated 20,000 terrorists from Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other terror groups have been killed in the war. Haddad gained prominence during the seven-week war in Gaza in 2014 following Hamas’s kidnap and murder of three Israeli teens. On July 20, 2014, Haddad led a battle in which Hamas ambushed an Israeli armored personnel carrier in Shejaya killing seven soldiers and capturing the body of Staff Sgt. Oron Shaul. Shaul’s body was recovered by Israeli forces on Sunday. After the battle, Haddad was promoted to commander of Hamas’s Gaza Brigade, and he continued rising through the terror group’s ranks. Haddad was elevated to oversee Gaza’s northern and central regions after Ahmed al-Ghandour was eliminated in a November 2023 airstrike. Israeli officials view Haddad as the successor to Mohammed Deif, who was killed in an airstrike in July. Yahya Sinwar’s brother Mohammed, is Hamas’s de facto leader in Gaza. Following Sunday’s return of hostages Doron Steinbrecher, Romi Gonen and Emily Damari, Israel released 90 imprisoned Palestinian terrorists to their homes in Judea, Samaria and eastern Jerusalem. During the first phase of the ceasefire, Israel will release hundreds of Palestinian terrorists in exchange for 30 captives. The exact number of terrorists released will depend on how many of the hostages are alive.

IDF soldier killed by roadside bomb in northern Samaria	Three more Israeli soldiers sustained injuries of various degrees in the incident, which took place in the Palestinian town of Tammun, northeast of the city of Nablus. By JNS Israel Defense Forces Sgt. 1st class (res.) Eviatar Ben Yehuda, 31, from Nitzan in the country’s south, was killed during 'operational activities' in northern Samaria, the military announced on Monday morning. An officer in Ben Yehuda’s unit, the 8211 Reserve Battalion of the IDF’s Ephraim Brigade, was seriously wounded in the same incident, according to military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari. Three more Israeli soldiers sustained injuries of various degrees in the incident, which took place in the Palestinian town of Tammun, northeast of the city of Nablus (Shechem), according to Ynet. The soldiers had been traveling in a vehicle that hit an explosive device, according to the report. Last week, five members of the IDF’s Nahal Brigade were killed fighting Hamas in northern Gaza, according to the military. A truce with the Palestinian terrorist group went into effect at 11:15 a.m. on Sunday. The death toll among troops since the start of the IDF ground incursion in Gaza on Oct. 27, 2023, currently stands at 408, and at 841 on all fronts since the Hamas-led terrorist attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Additionally, Chief Inspector Arnon Zamora, a member of the Israel Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit, was fatally wounded during a hostage-rescue mission in Gaza in June, and civilian defense contractor Liron Yitzhak was mortally wounded there in May.

Freed hostage who lost two fingers describes being ‘happiest pers...	She and Romi Gonen, who was freed with her, were together the whole time in captivity in Gaza. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Emily Damari, one of the three women released on the first day of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire Sunday, came out of captivity with two fingers missing on her hand. During the Hamas takeover of her kibbutz, Kfar Aza, the dual British-Israeli citizen had attempted to hide under her bed, but the terrorists caught her and at some point in the assault they blew off the two middle fingers of her left hand. The 27-year-old had also had shrapnel in her leg, her mother, Mandy, born in Beckenham, a town south of London, told British Jewish paper The JC Monday. 'I know at the beginning she was treated for her gunshot wound, but very shortly afterwards they just threw bandages at her and told her to treat herself,' she said, and her daughter was not given 'any other medication' by the terrorists who held her. In pictures of the reunion of Damari and her family after she arrived back in Israel, her hand could be seen heavily and professionally bandaged after being taken care of by IDF physicians. Damari already posted a story to Instagram Monday morning, to thank everyone and reveal a bit of her feelings about being free. 'I love, love, love,' she wrote, thanking God, her family, and 'the best friends one could possibly have in this world. I have returned to my beloved life.' 'I’ve managed to see just a tiny part of everything and my heart is bursting from all of the emotion. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I am the happiest person in the world just to be,' she concluded. She then added the emoji of a hand with the thumb, forefinger and pinkie up, which is a shortcut signal in sign language for 'I love you,' and now also symbolizes her own hand. Damari was not only 'the glue' that held all her friends together, as one of her best friends described her, and was an optimistic person, according to her mother, who was told by hostages freed six weeks into the war that Emily tried to help them in their dire circumstances. She was also mentally and physically tough, having done her service in the IDF in the Border Police, and continuing to do reserve duty after her mandatory stint was completed. When her mother traveled the globe in her unending efforts to raise awareness about the hostages and beg for world leaders’ help in releasing them, this aspect of her daughter’s history was deliberately left out in an effort to minimize the harm it could cause her in Hamas’ hands. Damari was not alone in Gaza, as Romi Gonen (24), who had been abducted from the Nova dance festival, was with her during their entire 15-month-long ordeal. It is not yet known if the third hostage released Sunday, Doron Steinbrecher (31), a dual Romanian-Israeli citizen who was also from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, was held with other hostages during any period of her captivity.

Trump responsible for securing hostage deal, most Americans say	New poll shows vast majority of Americans support Israel over Hamas, while a similarly wide majority support the ceasefire deal in the Gaza Strip, with most Americans crediting Trump rather than Biden for the agreement. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A majority of Americans credit President-elect Donald Trump with securing last week's agreement between Israel and Hamas, as opposed to President Joe Biden. According to a poll published on Saturday by Harvard CAPS / HarrisX, which surveyed 2,650 registered voters last Wednesday and Thursday, just 39% of registered voters approve of President Biden's job performance at the end of his single term in office. By contrast, more than half (53%) of registered voters approve of President-elect Donald Trump's performance thus far, before inauguration day. While both Trump and Biden took credit for the hostage deal and Gaza ceasefire, which went into effect on Sunday, 57% of Americans - and 60% of independents - say Hamas agreed to the deal because of the influence of the incoming Trump administration, while 43% said Biden's negotiations had the largest impact. Two-thirds (66%) of voters back Trump's call to end the conflict in the Gaza Strip by 'demanding the full surrender of Hamas and the return of hostages,' while 34% of voters oppose it. A large majority (79%) of Americans say they back Israel over Hamas, with 21% favoring the terror organization. Republicans were slightly more likely to back Israel over Hamas, 81% to 19%, than Democrats, where the margin was 75% to 25%. Independents backed Israel 80% to 20%. Voters over 65 were most likely to back Israel, with 90% saying they supported the Jewish state over Hamas, compared to just 68% of voters between the ages of 25 and 34. However, the youngest cohort of voters, 18-24 year-olds, backed Israel over Hamas by a margin of 79% to 21%. Eighty-two percent of voters say they support the ceasefire deal in Gaza, including 87% of Democrats, 81% of Republicans, and 78% of independents.

Trump: ‘Biden didn’t achieve the hostage deal – my election did’	Hours before being sworn into office, President-elect Donald Trump hails 'epic ceasefire agreement' between Israel and Hamas, claiming it will lead to 'lasting peace in the Middle East.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President-elect Donald Trump lauded the implementation of the hostage deal and Gaza ceasefire on Sunday, while rejecting President Joe Biden's claims that he was responsible for securing the long-sought agreement. Just hours before his inauguration on Monday, Trump addressed a rally in Washington D.C. on Sunday, vowing an end to 'America's decline.' During the event, Trump took credit for the deal reached between Israel and the Hamas terror organization in talks in Doha, Qatar last week, hours after President Biden touted the achievement shortly after three Israeli women - Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari - were transferred from Hamas back to Israel via the Red Cross. The incoming president also hailed the deal as heralding a fundamental shift in the Middle East. 'This week, we achieved an epic ceasefire agreement as a first step toward lasting peace in the Middle East — and this agreement could only have happened as a result of our historic victory in November,' Trump said. 'I’m glad to report that the first hostages have just been released, and who knows what’s going to happen.' 'I know that Biden is saying that he made the deal,' Trump continued, blaming his 2020 election opponent for the October 7th, 2023 invasion. 'First of all, [it] would have never happened if I were President. It would have never happened. There was not even a thought of it. Iran was broke, it had no money for Hezbollah, they had no money for Hamas. They had no money. They were broke. Totally broke.' Trump lauded his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, for his role in pressing Qatar and Israel in the final stages of talks. 'He’s an amazing guy. I said, ‘We have to get a good negotiator.’ A lot of guys are knowledgeable but they can’t negotiate. They don’t have the personality or whatever. And Steve does, and Steve’s a great negotiator…this breakthrough really couldn’t have been done without Steve.' 'Our incoming administration achieved all of this in the Middle East, in less than three months, without being President. We’ve achieved more without being President than they’ve achieved in four years with being President.'

Gazans praise Hamas after ceasefire ‘victory’	Gazans, who took to the streets to celebrate, waved Hamas flags and chanted slogans in support of the terror group. By World Israel News Staff Footage of the transfer of three Israeli hostages from Hamas captivity to the Red Cross revealed a stark reality in the Gaza Strip - after nearly 15 months of war, the Hamas terror group appears to remain firmly in control of the coastal enclave. In video shot from the scene, armed Hamas gunmen can be seen as the sole security force maintaining order, as mobs of Gazans attempted to reach the vehicles carrying released hostages Romi Gonen, Emily Damari, and Doron Steinbrecher. Gazans, who took to the streets to celebrate the ceasefire and prisoner releases, waved Hamas flags and chanted slogans in support of the terror group. As the IDF pulled back from numerous positions throughout the Strip and IDF aircraft ceased to fly overhead, Gazans thanked their leadership - the Hamas terror group - on social media for ending the conflict. 'How beautiful is the sky without planes,' one Gazan commenter wrote, according to a Jerusalem Post report. 'The sound of the drones killed us,' another Gazan responded. An anonymous resident of Gaza told the Post that despite the outward expressions of joy over the ceasefire, he and many others in the territory are furious at Hamas for the destruction they have wrought. 'I am a crushed human being living in Gaza, where I did not choose the war nor did I contribute to its outbreak, but I found myself trapped in a circle of death that haunts me every day. My life here has become dangerous, and all I seek is survival,' he told the Post. Israel 'handed us over to Hamas… May Allah take revenge. Where would we escape from the persecution and threats during the ceasefire?' In a clip that went viral, an older woman was seen scolding a man who was handing out sweets to celebrate Hamas' 'victory.' 'How can you celebrate when so many of our people have been killed?' she asks.

Who are the terrorists freed by Israel in the ceasefire deal?	Released prisoners dropped off near Ramallah, greeted by cheering crowds waving Hamas, Islamic Jihad flags. By World Israel News Staff Terrorists who shot and stabbed Israeli civilians are among the first 90 prisoners released by Israel, in exchange for the return of three Israeli captives kidnapped on October 7th, 2023. Around 90 people convicted of terror offenses, most of them women, were released from Ofer Prison hours after Hamas handed over Romi Gonen, Emily Damari, and Doron Steinbrecher to the Red Cross. The prisoners were bussed from Ofer Prison to the Ramallah area, where most of them reunited with their families and made their way home. 78 of the prisoners are residents of Palestinian Authority-controlled municipalities in Judea and Samaria. 12 prisoners, who are residents of eastern Jerusalem, were later bussed to the city. Hundreds gathered at the drop-off point near Ramallah, cheering on the released prisoners as they arrived during the early hours of Monday morning. Many in the crowd waved the flags of terror groups, including Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Fatah, and Hezbollah. Hebrew and Arabic-language media reports regarding the gender breakdown of the prisoners were contradictory, with some indicating there were 62 women, while others saying there were 69 women among the 90 inmates who were released. Numerous prisoners who attempted to murder Israelis were set free in the exchange. Mahmoud Aliowat, 15, shot two Israelis in the Old City of Jerusalem in 2022. He spent less than three years in prison for the attempted murders. Ibrahim Zamar, who shot two people in the Sheikh Jarrah (Shimon HaTzadik) neighborhood in April 2023 when he was 15, was freed. Nawal Abed Fatiha, who holds Israeli citizenship, stabbed a 70=year-old Jerusalem man in 2020. He was freed after less than five years of incarceration. Khalida Jarrar, 62, a senior member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) terror group, was also freed in the exchange. She is believed to have masterminded a terror bombing which killed Rina Schnerb, 19, in 2019.

‘Allah loves the patient’ – Arab MK in cryptic post	The concept of patience, or steadfastness, is commonly promoted among Palestinian nationalists as a fundamental ideal in their battle to destroy the Jewish State. By World Israel News Staff An anti-Israel Arab lawmaker posted an ominous statement on his Facebook page moments, hours after the Israel-Hamas ceasefire took effect, writing 'Allah loves the patient' in Arabic. MK Ahmad Tibi, a member of the anti-Zionist Ta'al party, has long supported Palestinian terror and justified deadly attacks against Israel. On Sunday evening, Tibi published a short message on his Facebook page, which read 'Allah loves the patient.' The concept of patience, or steadfastness, is commonly promoted among Palestinian nationalists as a fundamental ideal in their battle to destroy the Jewish State. For example, a Hamas spokesman praised Gazans for their 'steadfastness' in a media statement shortly after the ceasefire was declared. Social media users did not ignore the implications of Tibi's tweet, which appeared express support for a long-term struggle against Israel. 'When the Supreme Court is on your side, you feel safe' to post inflammatory statements, wrote one user. Many noted that as a member of the Knesset, Tibi receives a salary which is funded by the Israeli taxpayer. 'We are so lame,' wrote one Israeli user. 'We let them walk all over us, and we're actually funding this!' Tibi's colleague, MK Ayman Odeh, sparked controversy with his own social media post on Sunday evening. Odeh, who has often met with inmates convicted of terrorism offenses, drew a moral equivalency between the release of Israelis kidnapped by Hamas and incarcerated Palestinians. In a tweet, Odeh wrote that he was 'happy for the release of the hostages and prisoners' as part of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. 'Now we must free both peoples from the yoke of occupation. We were all born free,' he added. Otzma Yehudit MK Yitzhak Wasserlauf, who recently resigned from the government over his party's opposition to the ceasefire and hostage deal, responded to Odeh on social media platform X. 'At this time, when the entire Israeli nation — supporters and opponents of the deal alike — are weeping with excitement over the return of Romi, Emily and Doron, terrorist supporter Ayman Odeh is comparing vile murderers to our kidnapped daughters,' Wasserlauf wrote.

Hamas terrorists mock female hostages, release them with ‘goodie ...	The staged ceremony and its accompanying 'souvenirs' reveal the calculated cruelty of Hamas’s tactics. By World Israel News Staff In a disturbing revelation, Israeli media reported that Hamas forced three recently released hostages from Gaza—Emily Damari, Romi Gonen, and Doron Steinbrecher—to participate in a staged propaganda ceremony before their release. The hostages were handed 'gift bags' by their captors, an act that highlights the psychological manipulation employed by the terror group. The gift bags, reportedly handed to the hostages just before they were transferred to the Red Cross, included unsettling items: a photo of Gaza, photographs of the hostages during their captivity, and a so-called 'certificate of release.' According to Hebrew-language reports, these items were designed to leave a lasting psychological imprint on the survivors, embedding memories of their trauma into tangible objects. Emily Damari and Romi Gonen, held together in captivity, were allegedly coerced into posing for photos while smiling and holding their certificates. This grotesque ceremony, described as a 'farewell' by Hamas, forced the hostages to simulate gratitude toward their captors, further compounding their psychological distress. A video released by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) showed the hostages clutching these bags as they were handed over to Israeli troops, a chilling reminder of the torment they endured. Experts have pointed out that such staged acts serve dual purposes for Hamas. On one hand, they aim to perpetuate the group’s narrative of 'humanity' despite the underlying brutality of their actions. On the other, they act as a method of psychological warfare, ensuring that the trauma of captivity lingers long after the hostages have been freed. The staged ceremony and its accompanying 'souvenirs' reveal the calculated cruelty of Hamas’s tactics. For the survivors, these so-called gifts are not tokens of remembrance but haunting symbols of their ordeal, serving as constant reminders of the psychological and emotional scars left by their time in captivity.

Arab List MK Odeh compares hostages to convicted terrorists	MK Avigdor Liberman: 'Ayman Odeh has once again shown that he is acting as a spokesperson for Hamas in the Knesset.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News MK Ayman Odeh (Hadash-Ta'al) compared the three hostages released on Sunday to convicted terrorists freed from Israeli prisons as part of the ceasefire and hostage deal. Odeh wrote on X, 'I am relieved by the release of the hostages and prisoners. Both peoples deserve to be freed from the burden of occupation. We were all born to be free.' Yisrael Beytenu Chairman, Avigdor Liberman criticized Odeh's tweet and responded, 'Ayman Odeh has once again shown that he is acting as a spokesperson for Hamas in the Knesset. Anyone who equates our hostages with brutal terrorists should be sent to Gaza to stand with them.' On Sunday, three female hostages, Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher, and Emily Damari, were released in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners, including 69 women and 21 teenage boys. According to the agreement, in the coming weeks, a total of 33 prisoners, mainly women, men over 50, and ill hostages, will be released in exchange for 737 male and female Palestinian prisoners, many of whom have been convicted of serious crimes. In later phases of the agreement, 98 hostages will be released, both living and dead, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. This isn't the first time Odeh has compared Israeli civilians to Palestinian terrorists. In 2022, following a terrorist shooting spree that left five people dead in Bnei Brak, Odeh blamed the attack on Israel's presence in Judea and Samaria. 'Five civilians were killed today, each of them a world in its entirety. They are added to the 51 Palestinians killed since the beginning of the year, each one a world in its own right. The heart is torn in the face of the bereavement and loss of all families.' In a tweet that followed, he stated: 'I strongly oppose any harm to civilians, Palestinians or Israelis, and any harm to innocent people. It is time to end the source of hatred and that is the damned occupation, and to establish peace that will bring security and a normative life to both peoples.'

A deal that keeps Hamas in power is meaningless	Those who think that the Iran-backed Palestinian terrorist group Hamas will abandon its Jihad to murder more Jews and destroy Israel in the aftermath of the recent ceasefire-hostage agreement are mistaken. By Khaled Abu Toameh, Gatestone Institute The ceasefire-hostage deal does not require Hamas to disarm or cede control over the Gaza Strip. The terrorist group seems to be convinced that the deal will enable it to keep control of the Gaza Strip and prepare for more massacres of Jews. Shortly after the ceasefire-hostage deal was announced on January 15, Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya made it clear that his group intends to pursue its Jihad against Israel. The new US administration, to avoid more violence and bloodshed, must insist that Hamas be removed from power. This can only be accomplished by applying pressure and sanctions on Hamas's Qatari and Iranian sponsors. Those who think that the Iran-backed Palestinian terrorist group Hamas will abandon its Jihad (holy war) to murder more Jews and destroy Israel in the aftermath of the recent ceasefire-hostage agreement are mistaken. Although the agreement may put an end to the current conflict between Israel and Hamas, it does not, in any way, reflect a shift in the radical and dangerous ideology of the Islamist group, as outlined in its 1988 Covenant. The document quotes Hassan al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood organization (of which Hamas is an offshoot), as saying: 'Israel will arise and continue to exist until Islam abolishes it, as it abolished what went before.' The main points of the Hamas Covenant state: The Palestinian issue is a religious-political Muslim problem, and the conflict with Israel is between Muslims and the Jewish 'infidels.' All Palestine is Muslim land and no one has the right to give it up. An uncompromising Jihad must be waged against Israel, and any agreement recognizing its right to exist must be totally opposed. The ceasefire-hostage deal does not require Hamas to disarm or cede control over the Gaza Strip. As far as Hamas is concerned, this is just another deal similar to ceasefire agreements reached with Israel after previous rounds of fighting over the past 20 years. The terrorist group seems to be convinced that the deal will enable it to keep control of the Gaza Strip and prepare for more massacres of Jews. Shortly after the ceasefire-hostage deal was announced on January 15, Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya made it clear that his group intends to pursue its Jihad against Israel. Referring to the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, resulting in the murder of 1,200 Israelis and the wounding of thousands, al-Hayya said: 'The al-Aqsa Flood [the name Hamas uses to describe the October 7 atrocities] constitutes a significant turning point in the history of the Palestinian cause the resistance, and its repercussions won't stop until the liberation of occupied Jerusalem.' He went on to hail the October 7 massacres as 'a military and security achievement that will remain a source of pride for the Palestinian people,' and praised Iran for supporting the Palestinian 'resistance' and firing missiles at Israel during the war. In response to the ceasefire-hostage agreement, a Hamas statement said: 'This is an achievement for our people, our resistance, our nation, and the free people of the world. It is a turning point in the conflict with the [Israeli] enemy, on the path to achieving our people's goals of liberation and return.' 'Liberation' refers to Hamas's declared goal of eliminating Israel and replacing it with an Islamist state. 'Return' refers to the Palestinian demand to flood Israel with millions of 'refugees' so that Jews would become a minority in their own homeland. In yet another sign of Hamas's intention to continue the fight against Israel, supporters of the terrorist group took to the streets of the city of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip to celebrate the ceasefire-hostage deal and chanted: 'We will go to Jerusalem, we will sacrifice millions of martyrs!' Members of Hamas's military wing, Izz a-Din al-Qassam Brigades, also joined the celebration and declared: 'We are on the battlefield and we will remain on the battlefield.' The celebrations spread to the West Bank, where Hamas supporters in Ramallah, the de facto capital of the Palestinian Authority, chanted slogans in support of slain Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif, the masterminds of the October 7 carnage. Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, a former resident of the Gaza Strip and Senior Fellow with the Atlantic Council, wrote on January 14: 'The reality is that the Islamist terrorism of Hamas, masquerading as 'resistance,' has achieved nothing for the Palestinian people except for billions of dollars in wasted resources and tens of thousands of needless deaths, with Gaza in ruins after 20 years following the [Israeli] withdrawal of settlements [from the Gaza Strip] in 2005. Indeed, there will be a reckoning with Hamas after the war is over, and the group must be put on metaphoric, intellectual, and literal trials for its crimes against the Palestinian people's aspirations and national project&#8230;. 'Hamas's propaganda machine, run by Qatari-state media, Aljazeera Arabic, will work overtime to help the terror group turn a catastrophic disaster into a victory akin to the battles of Stalingrad and Leningrad, desperately seeking to promote terrorism and the armed resistance narrative as one that is heroic and valiant when it is cowardly, [and] ineffective&#8230;' A ceasefire-hostage deal that allows Hamas to remain in power means that it is only a matter of time before the terrorist groups attempts to launch another October 7-style attack on Israel. The new US administration, to avoid more violence and bloodshed, must insist that Hamas be removed from power. This can only be accomplished by applying pressure and sanctions on Hamas's Qatari and Iranian sponsors. Hamas must be totally defeated and eliminated, not rewarded for committing the biggest crime against Jews since the Holocaust. Hamas's defiant statements after the ceasefire-hostage agreement was reached, demonstrate the terrorist group's resolve to carry on attacking Israel. The statements also show that Hamas's leadership is willing to sacrifice more of its people to fulfill its objective of destroying Israel. Clearly, it has not learned any lesson from bringing disaster upon the Palestinians. Hamas leaders do not care if tens of thousands of Palestinians are killed as part of its Jihad against Israel. Furthermore, Hamas leaders apparently are not interested in rebuilding the Gaza Strip and providing its residents with safety, stability and prosperity. Rather, their primary goal, evidently, is still to murder as many Jews as possible. The only deal that will actually bring peace is a ceasefire where Hamas ceases to exist.

Female prison guards demand Palestinian prisoner who raped them b...	Terrorist Mahmoud Atallah, who is scheduled to be released in exchange for Israeli hostages sexually assaulted the Gilboa prison guards. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Female guards at Gilboa Prison appealed to the Supreme Court that a prisoner who raped them be released abroad and not within Israel. Terrorist Mahmoud Atallah, who is scheduled to be released in exchange for Israeli hostages, was convicted of serious crimes, including the sexual assault of the Gilboa prison guards. In their appeal, the guards said that the decision to release Atallah within Israel did not take into account the fact that he was a danger to others as well as to the guards themselves. The female guards said that if Atallah is released to Shechem as planned, he may be a danger to them, since he has threatened them directly and told them he has their personal information. The guards urged the court to approve an arrangement that would preserve their safety and not endanger the hostage release deal by sending Atallah abroad. 'The defense echelon has once again failed to protect the safety of female prison guards—this time, however, it is also permitting their blood to be shed,' said the guards' attorneys. 'Exiling the terrorist to Shechem poses a direct and immediate threat to the safety of the female guards. It appears those within the defense echelon view abandoning female guards—essentially IDF soldiers—as an acceptable course of action. We urge the Supreme Court to intervene and insist that the terrorist be sent abroad, in order to ensure the safety of the guards' lives.' A number of the 735 Palestinian prisoners to be released in exchange for 33 hostages in the first phase of the agreement have committed deadly crimes killing hundreds of Israelis. The following are some terrorists slated for release. Zakariya Zubeidi, the commander of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades of Fatah in Jenin, played a central role in orchestrating several terrorist attacks during the Second Intifada. He is responsible for the 2002 Likud branch attack in Beit She'anShe'an, which resulted in the deaths of six people. Zubeidi was also among the prisoners who escaped from Gilboa Prison in September 2021.

Netanyahu’s government shuffles positions as Otzmah Yehudit party...	An insider said Ben Gvir's party's departure is likely to spark a 'big internal fight' within Netanyahu's government and his Likud party over available positions. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News When the Otzma Yehudit Party, headed by National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, resigned on Sunday over its opposition to the hostage release deal, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government prepared for a reshuffle. An insider said Ben Gvir's party's departure is likely to spark a 'big internal fight' within Netanyahu's government and his Likud party over available positions. Otzma Yehudit occupied three government ministries: the National Security Ministry, led by Ben Gvir; the Negev and Galilee Ministry, headed by Yitzhak Wasserlauf; and the Heritage Ministry, led by Amichai Eliyahu. These three ministers are scheduled to vacate their positions by Tuesday, giving Netanyahu little time to fill the roles. An insider indicates that Netanyahu is likely to appoint someone from his own party as National Security Minister, opening the door for Ben Gvir to return to the government if he wishes. One source indicated that Avi Dichter is likely to replace Ben Gvir as minister in charge of the police. Avi Dichter, a veteran of the elite commando unit Sayeret Matkal and former head of Shin Bet, assumed the role previously when it was known as the public security ministry. However, an Israel HaYom report indicated that Dichter may not be interested in the role. The newspaper posited that Eli Cohen may be chosen for the role despite allegations improperly issuing diplomatic passports. Regional Cooperation Minister David Amsalem may be considered for the Negev and Galilee Ministry. The Heritage Ministry, given its small size, may be absorbed into another ministry. In 2023, the Finance Ministry declared that the Heritage Ministry and the Negev and Galilee Ministry were superfluous and considered shelving them. 'Additional committee chair rotations are being planned. I anticipate a full reshuffle within Likud—deputy speakers, junior committee chairs, and possibly a promotion or two to minister,' the source explained. 'There are a lot of different options being considered, and the situation is shifting constantly,' the source added.

‘We’re on high alert’: Israel reinforces security after releasing...	The Israel Defense Forces said it was increasing patrols and checkpoints. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Following the release of three Israeli hostages from 471 days of captivity, Israel released 90 imprisoned Palestinian terrorists on Sunday, prompting the army to reinforce its forces in Judea and Samaria on Sunday. 'We’re on high alert,' a reserve soldier stationed near Hebron told The Press Service of Israel. The reservist said he was originally scheduled to go home for a few days off, but had to stay due to the lockdown. 'We need all available resources right now to deal with the threat, especially considering the volatile situation,' he explained. The Israel Defense Forces said it was increasing patrols and checkpoints. Members of 'The Watchers – Forum of the Wives of the Enlisted' said they were concerned over the implications of the ceasefire, pointing to ongoing violence in Shechem (Nablus), and Jenin, where the Palestinian Authority was recently in the midst of its own crackdown on terror groups. According to Moriya Michaeli, a representative of the forum, the threat of terrorism continues to grow as terror cells receive weapons from Iran smuggled through Jordan. 'This isn’t just a threat to the residents of Judea and Samaria, but to the entire population of Israel, from Ben Gurion Airport to the northern Golan Heights and beyond,' Michaeli told TPS-IL. 'The only solution to halting this escalating threat is a full-scale military operation aimed at dismantling the terror infrastructures in these areas. The situation in Judea and Samaria should be seen as an existential threat to the state of Israel, requiring an immediate and decisive response.' Protesters gathered outside the Ofer Prison, from where the Red Cross transported the freed terrorists to release points around Judea, Samaria and eastern Jerusalem. The demonstrators referred to comments by Ronen Bar, head of the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet), who told government ministers on Friday that 82% of the 1,027 prisoners released in the 2011 Gilad Shalit exchange returned to terror. Yaakov Uri, a resident of Karnei Shomron in Samaria shared his unease. 'The deal threatens the security of many Israeli citizens. Over half of the hostages are not being released in this deal, so it also seems flawed and risky. But we have no fear of terrorists returning to the region; it would not deter us from continuing to defend our homes,' he told TPS-IL. The first phase of the ceasefire will see 33 Israeli hostages freed over several weeks in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. The exact number will depend on how many of the 33 hostages are alive. Israel’s High Court of Justice rejected a legal petition against the release of the Palestinians on Sunday morning. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 94 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead.

A flawed ceasefire, but a chance to stop Iran	The Israeli government believes that removing the distraction in Gaza could be necessary to address the more dangerous threat lurking to the east. By Gregg Roman, Middle East Forum Israel’s ceasefire with Hamas is a bad deal. Jerusalem has agreed to an uneven exchange, freeing thousands of convicted terrorists in return for fewer than a hundred hostages. Some of the released prisoners will revert to violence. Yet a silver lining may outweigh immediate dangers. If the incoming Trump administration remains committed to halting Iran’s nuclear ambitions, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may conclude that acquiescing to Team Trump on Gaza might shift focus from Gaza to Tehran. With its proxies in retreat, Tehran is isolated, its path to the Mediterranean blocked. Israeli strategists argue that a resolution with Hamas, even if unfavorable on its face, allows Jerusalem to redirect military resources toward countering the Iranian nuclear program. Military planners point to secret sites like Fordow that require specialized ordnance to destroy. Only the United States can provide these munitions. Netanyahu has placed his trust in the incoming White House team, which has said repeatedly that it would not tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran. Secretary of State-designee Marco Rubio has defended Israel’s security requirements and called Iran the world’s leading state sponsor of terror. Pete Hegseth, who if confirmed will head the Defense Department, has said Israel should receive support to crush hostile forces and insists that Hamas, Hezbollah, and other Iranian proxies have no rightful place in any government. Incoming National Security Advisor Mike Waltz has argued that the United States must seize the moment caused by the Hezbollah and Syria. Netanyahu’s critics see the hostage swap as capitulation. Many Israelis recall past deals in which freed terrorists perpetrated new attacks. Proponents of the ceasefire accept these risks but claim that ending the war spares Israel from becoming mired in a multi-front conflict. They argue that Hamas’s infrastructure is ravaged, and this pause not only frees hostages, but also enables Jerusalem to address its strategic priority: preventing a nuclear-armed Iran. While Tehran denies intending to build warheads, it enriches uranium to levels and in quantities that have few other purposes beyond weaponization. The International Atomic Energy Agency reports that Iran has enough material to make multiple bombs. The Trump administration’s appointees speak openly of stopping Iran’s program, whether diplomatically or, if necessary, by force. They also assert that a weakened Iranian regime can topple if placed under significant economic and political strain. The potential repercussions from the swift release of hostages may be painful for Israel. Still, Netanyahu believes any damage will be overshadowed if the Iranian regime is denied a nuclear bomb and the region is freed from Tehran’s grip. If the United States shares technology, intelligence, and diplomatic backing for a strike on underground Iranian sites, the price of acquiescing to President-elect Donald Trump’s push for a ceasefire may be worth it. The collapse of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Damascus showed how quickly a long-standing authoritarian state can implode if it loses foreign sponsors and domestic legitimacy. The same could be true for Iran. This effort carries risks. An open conflict with Iran could draw in multiple actors and bring retaliatory strikes on American or Israeli targets. Yet if Washington and Jerusalem do not act, Tehran soon may cross the nuclear threshold and reassert its influence in the region. The Israeli government believes that removing the distraction in Gaza could be necessary to address the more dangerous threat lurking to the east. If Tehran’s nuclear drive can be halted and its rulers deposed, the prisoner exchange with Hamas might be remembered as a short-term sacrifice that opened the door to lasting regional change.

‘The spectrum of feelings is almost paralyzing’: Israelis react a...	The hostages’ recovery from their ordeal will be lengthy, but for 'the waiting families, to know that the hostages are in their loving arms, it’s a wonderful feeling,' said a Tel Aviv resident. By Crystal Jones, TPS As Israelis welcomed the return of the first three hostages from Gaza on Sunday, individuals across the country shared feelings ranging from joy to anger and horror at the terms of the ceasefire deal with The Press Service of Israel. Doron Steinbrecher, Romi Gonen and Emily Damari were reunited with their families in Israel after 471 days in captivity. Shortly after their arrival, 90 imprisoned Palestinian terrorists were released from the Ofer Prison north of Jerusalem. Adele, a resident of Kibbutz Nirim, one of the Gaza border areas devastated by terrorists on October 7, described new-found fear. 'My feelings about the whole situation now is complex,' said the 70-year-old. 'On the one hand we are releasing convicts, convicted terrorists, to freedom. These are people with radical philosophy and blood on their hands. As someone who lives on the border, I also know that the fact that the Hamas are ending this war feeling emboldened, knowing that they can demand whatever they want from Israel, is a very frightening situation.' She went on to add, 'On the other hand, well they are still left standing, I understand that they have paid a very high price, lost their leaders, and Hezbollah has also been hit hard, Syria is a mess and Israel has shown her massive strength.' Shay Dickman also had mixed feelings. Her cousin, Carmel Gat, was one of six Israeli bodies recovered from a tunnel in Rafah in September. She told TPS-IL she was feeling 'great anticipation, great excitement,' then went on to express 'great anxiety, hoping nothing falls through, that nothing goes wrong.' Said Dickman, 'I know what it’s like to lose, the disappointment of a deal that doesn’t happen, of a deal that’s cut short. This shouldn’t happen to another family.' But at Tel Aviv’s Hostage Square, local resident Danny Shek told TPS-IL, 'These are the first [pieces of] good news in many, many months. On the one hand, when looking at the continuation of this process, there are still many tears to cry. But there’s excitement tonight, enormous excitement. These are three [people] who have been part of our lives virtually, for so, so long.' He said the hostages’ recovery from their ordeal will be lengthy, but for 'the waiting families, to know that the hostages are in their loving arms, it’s a wonderful feeling.' Lior Dodi, a 27-year-old from Jerusalem told TPS-IL the ceasefire was a setback for Israel’s war against terror. 'It’s a bad deal, It’s a deal that has to happen, it’s a deal that takes us back 20 years, and there’s nothing to do, they have to come home and we will win afterward,' he said. 'I’m feeling bad about it, I have a lot of friends who died in this war and in 2014,' Dodi added, referring to a seven-week war in Gaza that followed Hamas’s kidnap and murder of three teenagers in Gush Etzion. Another Israeli, Tali Stern, a 41-year-old mother from central Israel, told TPS-IL, 'I have not felt this emotionally drained or on edge since the beginning of the war.' She elaborated, 'I am furious at who we are giving back to these monsters and I think that in the long run this will have disastrous repercussions for our nation and I am waiting with my breath stuck in my throat to see our hostages returned. I am afraid to learn who is no longer alive, and I am afraid to see the physical consequences of more than a year being held by terrorists in horrific conditions.' She added, 'The spectrum of feelings is almost paralyzing and I have been mostly unable to accomplish anything today.' Shoshana Woznica, a 41-year-old resident from Ramat Beit Shemesh told TPS-IL, 'Obviously we all feel strongly that we want the hostages home and safe. We cry and pray for them like they are our own, but putting the rest of the country at risk by releasing dangerous criminals seems extremely wrong and foolhardy. The decision is being driven by strong emotions without logic.' Woznica argued, 'We have made kidnapping extremely worthwhile for them.' At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 94 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead.

Trump’s inauguration will be first attended by foreign leaders	Here is a look at the foreign leaders who are coming to Washington for the 60th inauguration. By The Associated Press For the first time in U.S. history, a president-elect will welcome foreign leaders for one of the most American political traditions — the peaceful transfer of power. President-elect Donald Trump invited Chinese President Xi Jinping and conservative world leaders such as Argentine President Javier Milei and Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni to the inauguration. Xi is sending his vice president as his representative. No heads of state have previously made an official visit to the U.S. for the inauguration. Some of them, such as Milei and Paraguay's President Santiago Peña, were special guests at the Hispanic inaugural ball Saturday night, where several of Trump’s nominees for key Cabinet positions made appearances. That included U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, chosen to lead the State Department, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., tapped to head the Health and Human Services Department. Here is a look at the foreign leaders who are coming to Washington for the 60th inauguration: China Chinese President Xi Jinping was the first foreign leader whose invitation to the inauguration became public in December. Xi will not attend but is sending Vice President Han Zheng. The announcement to dispatch Han was made Friday by the country's foreign ministry, and it comes as the rivalry between the U.S. and China may escalate under Trump. Several of Trump’s Cabinet picks are known China hawks, including Rubio, who has called China 'the most potent, dangerous and near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted.' Trump has vowed to impose tariffs and other measures on China. But the two leaders spoke on the phone on Friday and discussed trade, fentanyl and TikTok. Trump said the call was a 'very good one.' Argentina Milei was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump after the Nov. 5 election, traveling from Buenos Aires to the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago club. Milei was scheduled to attend three inaugural galas over the weekend and one of the official inaugural balls that Trump will attend on Inauguration Day, as well as the swearing-in ceremony. Argentina's leader describes himself as an 'anarcho-capitalist.' He receives praise frequently from billionaire Elon Musk, who has grown closer to Trump since the election, for implementing a series of austerity measures that laid off tens of thousands of government workers, froze public infrastructure projects and imposed wage and pension freezes below inflation. Musk will lead a non-governmental effort to cut federal government spending, regulations and personnel. Milei hopes good relations with the U.S. could help Argentina reach a new deal with the International Monetary Fund. Italy Meloni is another leader who has recently visited Mar-a-Lago. Her weekly agenda says she will attend the swearing-in ceremony. Meloni kept unexpectedly good relations with Democratic President Joe Biden but is likely to form a more natural alliance with Trump. She is considered a key interlocutor between Europe and the U.S. Georgia Pro-Western former Georgia President Salome Zourabichvili will attend the ceremony as a guest of U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C. Georgia has been wracked by protests following a parliamentary election that opposition groups alleged was rigged. She has maintained she is still the legitimate leader of the former Soviet republic after Mikheil Kavelashvili was inaugurated as president late last month from a party that critics have accused of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. Kavelashvili's ruling party has denied those accusations. Zourabichvili told Fox News that Georgia could be 'the big success for America or the big problem for America' in the region because 'Russia is always trying to dominate.' France French President Emmanuel Macron, who met with Trump last month in Paris during the Notre Dame Cathedral reopening, won’t be at Trump’s inauguration. But figures from the country have said they are traveling for the inauguration. Eric Zemmour, a talk show pundit turned conservative politician, and his partner, Sarah Knafo, a member of the European Parliament, said they will attend. Prominent politician Marion Maréchal said in a statement that she would go as well. She is a member of the European Parliament and niece of the leading conservative figure in France eyeing the 2027 presidential election. Who else? The offices of Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa and Paraguayan President Santiago Peña have said they were invited to the inauguration and planned to attend. Taiwan sent legislative speaker Han Kuo-yu and seven others to Washington for Trump’s inauguration, but Taiwan’s foreign ministry said its delegates would not attend the ceremony now that it has been moved indoors because of cold weather. Taiwan’s official Central News Agency, citing Taiwan’s foreign ministry, also reported that the delegates would meet American politicians and think tank scholars to cement Taiwan-U.S. relations. It’s unclear if they will meet Trump. Trump has criticized Taiwan for pulling some of the semiconductor industry from the U.S., but U.S.-Taiwan relations also significantly improved during his first term. On a phone call Friday between Trump and Xi, the Chinese president urged the incoming U.S. leader to approach the Taiwan issue 'with prudence' because it is about China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Beijing claims the self-governed island as Chinese territory and vows to annex it by force if necessary.

On last day in office, Biden takes credit for Israeli military vi...	The Middle East has been fundamentally transformed,' Biden says on eve of Trump's inauguration, touting Israeli victories against Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran, and taking victory lap over implementation of Gaza ceasefire. By World Israel News Staff President Joe Biden hailed the implementation Sunday of the much-anticipated ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas. Speaking shortly after the release of three Israeli women held captive by Hamas and their return to Israel, Biden gave a televised address marking his final day in office, touting Israeli military victories for having helped to reshape the Middle East. Biden noted that the hostage deal was based on the three-phase formula he had first presented last May, and celebrated the release of the first three hostages under the agreement. 'The deal that I first put forward last May for the Middle East has finally come to fruition. The ceasefire has gone into effect in Gaza, and today we’re seeing hostages be released.' 'Three Israeli women, held against their will in dark tunnels for 470 days, and four more women will be released in seven days, and additional hostages every seven days thereafter, including at least two American hostages in this initial phase.' The president expressed optimism that the ceasefire would continue into its second phase, with talks for a permanent end to the war. 'By the 16th day of the deal, talks will begin for the second phase. This phase includes the release of Israeli soldiers and a permanent end to the war, without Hamas in power or able to threaten Israel.' 'Hundreds of trucks are entering Gaza as I speak. They’re carrying assistance for civilians who suffered enormously from the war,' Biden continued. 'Today alone, we anticipate several hundred trucks will enter the Gaza Strip…and after so much pain and destruction and loss of life, today, the guns in Gaza have gone silent. This was the deal that I outlined for the world on May 31st.' 'I developed it in coordination with Egypt, Qatar, and Israel. I’ve worked for foreign policy in decades, and this was one of the toughest negotiations that I’ve been part of.' Biden credited Israel's military pressure on Hamas and the killing of senior Hamas leaders, including Yahya Sinwar, for the successful negotiations in Doha, Qatar, and linked other major defeats for Iran and its proxies in the region to Israeli military accomplishments. 'The road has been not easy and all and a long road. But we’ve reached the point today because of the pressure Israel built on Hamas, backed by the United States.' The Middle East, Biden continued, has been 'fundamentally transformed,' with the collapse of Hezbollah's influence in Lebanon, the ouster of the Assad regime in Syria, and a major weakening of Iran. 'Now the region has been fundamentally transformed. Hamas’ long-time leader Sinwar is dead. Hamas’ sponsors in the Middle East have been badly weakened by Israel, backed by the United States. Hezbollah, one of Hamas’ biggest backers, was significantly weakened on the battlefield and its leadership destroyed.' 'Even as we worked for diplomatic solutions in Lebanon, we provided ongoing assistance to support Israel’s military campaign against Hezbollah.' 'Israel’s campaign was extremely successful, so much so that by the end of November the United States had brokered a ceasefire in Lebanon. Hezbollah did what it had said it would never do…it cut a deal and abandoned Hamas.' 'In Lebanon there is finally a new president and prime minister, both of whom support a sovereign Lebanon without Hezbollah…running the show.' 'The Assad regime next door in Syria is gone.' 'Iran is in the weakest position in decades, after the U.S. military helped to defend Israel from Iranian missiles and supported Israel’s military response inside of Iran.'

Hamas will never rule Gaza, vows US national security advisor des...	If Hamas violates the deal, the United States will not interfere with Israeli moves to punish Hamas, Waltz indicated. By JNS Hamas will 'never govern Gaza,' President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said on Sunday, ahead of the U.S.-mediated ceasefire between the terrorist group and Israel. 'That is completely unacceptable,' Waltz said during an interview with CBS about the prospect of a Hamas-run Gaza. On Oct. 7, 2023, about 6,000 Hamas-led terrorists invaded Israel, murdered some 1,200 people and abducted another 251. Israel launched a campaign whose stated goal was to dismantle Hamas and retrieve the hostages. Earlier this month, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire whose first phase features the release of 33 out of 97 hostages still in Gaza in return for more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners; an Israeli redeployment in the Gaza Strip and a 42-day ceasefire. The remaining hostages are to be released in following phases whose details are yet to be negotiated. If Hamas violates the deal, the United States will not interfere with Israeli moves to punish Hamas, Waltz indicated. 'I want the Israeli people to hear me loud and clear. If Hamas reneges on this deal and Hamas backs out, moves the goalpost, what have you, we will support Israel in doing what it has to do,' he said. Waltz was optimistic when asked about the Trump administration’s chances of brokering a normalization deal between Jerusalem and Riyadh as part of the Abraham Accords. 'I do think we can expand it, and that will be between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which will be tremendous,' Waltz said.

Israeli firefighters welcomed to Los Angeles	The fires so far have burned a total of 40,697 acres, caused 27 fatalities, and destroyed 12,845 structures. By JNS U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) on Saturday welcomed an Israeli firefighting team that had arrived in Los Angeles to help battle the fires that have ravaged the city. 'Great to welcome brave Israeli firefighters to L.A. who have joined the effort to contain the #LosAngelesFires #Israel is not just sending firefighters but absorbing all costs to do so,' he tweeted. Israel’s Fire and Rescue Authority sent a team of five fire protection experts to California on Wednesday in an effort to assist firefighters battling the wildfires still blazing in Los Angeles. The delegation, which will remain in the United States for about a week, includes members who specialize in forest fire prevention, with experience gained from major blazes in Israel in past years. According to the the latest numbers provided by the CalFire website, the Pacific Palisades fire is 49% contained and the Eaton Fire, affecting Pasadena and Altadena, is 73% contained. The fires so far have burned a total of 40,697 acres, caused 27 fatalities and destroyed 12,845 structures. Both Southern California and Israel share similar climates, with hot and dry summer seasons and only limited rain in the winter months. This, coupled with strong winds, contributes to the outbreak of wildfires.

Three Israeli hostages handed over to Red Cross	Three Israeli women said to be in 'good' condition after 471 days in captivity ni the Gaza Strip. By JNS and World Israel News Staff The International Committee of the Red Cross has informed the Israel Defense Forces that the three Israeli hostages slated for release from Hamas captivity in Gaza have been handed over, the military said. 'According to information received from the Red Cross, three Israeli hostages were transferred to the Red Cross and they are on their way toward IDF and Israel Security Agency forces in Gaza,' the army stated. An Israeli official said the three were assessed as being in 'good' condition, Arutz Sheva reported. Footage broadcast on Israeli television appeared to show them alive, surrounded by armed Hamas terrorists in Gaza City’s Saraya Square. Israel’s Channel 12 News had cited the Palestinian Islamist organization as declaring that it would 'soon' hand over the captives, who were taken by terrorists during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border terrorist massacre and were held hostage in the Gaza Strip for 471 days. The Red Cross was expected to hand over the captives to Israeli special forces inside the Netzarim Corridor that splits the northern and southern Strip. Once that happens, it will be another approximately two hours until they arrive at the hospital in Israel, the army estimates. The mothers of the three hostages will first meet them at the reception complex near Kibbutz Re’im. The remaining family members will meet them at the hospital. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz arrived at the reception point near the border community of Kibbutz Re’im, his office said. 'I came here to make sure that the IDF is prepared to receive and escort the hostages who are returning to Israel today. We will not stop the war until all the hostages return home,' Katz said in the published remarks. The Israel Defense Forces shared footage on Sunday afternoon of the initial reception point, from where the released hostages are expected to be taken to hospitals, where they will be reunited with their families. After Hamas delivered to Jerusalem the names of the three female hostages set to be released, the ceasefire took effect at 11:15 a.m. Under the agreement with Hamas, the terrorist group should have provided the names of the hostages at least 24 hours ahead of the release of the three captives expected to be freed on Sunday at 4 p.m. Gonen, 24, was abducted from the Supernova music festival near Kibbutz Re’im after being shot by Hamas terrorists on the morning of Oct. 7, 2023, while Steinbrecher, 31, and Damari, 28, were taken from their homes in the border community of Kfar Aza. Steinbrecher is a dual Israeli-Romanian citizen, while Damari also holds British citizenship. Israel’s Health Ministry has formulated a new protocol for receiving and treating the captives due to be released, based on lessons learned from the November 2023 exchange of hostages for Palestinian terrorists. The protocol has detailed guidelines for medical examinations, mental health care, privacy protection and long-term support for returnees and their families, emphasizing personalized care and respect for dignity. Israel estimates that 25 of the 33 people on the list of hostages to be returned in the first stage of the renewed ceasefire deal are still alive. Ninety-four hostages abducted during the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led massacre are still being held in Gaza, at least one-third of them dead. The 33 captives are considered 'humanitarian' cases—women, children, men over 50, wounded and ill, including two mentally ill Israelis who entered the Strip on their own over a decade ago (Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed).

Itamar Ben-Gvir and his Otzma Yehudit party quit Netanyahu govern...	Protesting the Gaza ceasefire and the release of hundreds of jailed Palestinian terrorists, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and his Otzma Yehudit party bolt Netanyahu's government. By World Israel News Staff Israel's National Security Minister resigned from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition government Sunday, in protest of the Gaza ceasefire deal, which was approved by the cabinet Friday evening. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, chairman of the Otzma Yehudit party, submitted his letter of resignation Sunday morning, after the cabinet voted 24 to 8 in favor of the hostage and ceasefire deal with Hamas that would see the release of several thousand jailed Palestinian terrorists, including hundreds of convicted murderers, in exchange for the freeing of 97 Israeli captives, roughly half of whom are believed to be dead. The entire Otzma Yehudit party followed suit Sunday, with Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu and Minister for the Development of the Periphery, the Negev, and the Galilee Yitzhak Wasserlauf submitting their own letters of resignation from the government. Three Otzma MKs, Zvika Fogel, Limor Son Har-Melech, and Yitzhak Kreuzer, submitted their resignations from Knesset committee, in keeping with the party’s departure from the coalition. In a statement Sunday, the party castigated Prime Minister Netanyahu and the government for the 'approval of the reckless agreement with the terrorist organization Hamas, the release of hundreds of murderers who shed the blood of men, women and children - who are also being released to Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria, while renouncing the IDF's achievements in the war, the withdrawal of IDF forces from the Gaza Strip and the cessation of fighting in Gaza, in an agreement that constitutes a surrender to Hamas.' In his resignation letter, Ben-Gvir castigated the hostage deal, calling it a 'dangerous agreement,' which 'unfortunately constitutes a surrender to terrorism, crossing every ideological red line, and is in total contradiction with everything you laid out in the past.'

Trump’s hostage deal ultimatum was also aimed at Israel – report	The incoming president reportedly messaged Netanyahu that he 'has been a great friend of Israel and now it’s time to be a friend back.' By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News When incoming president Donald Trump warned that there would be 'hell to pay' if a hostage deal was not signed before he came into office, the message was seemingly directed just as much at Israel as Hamas, according to a Wall Street Journal report Saturday. Special Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff reportedly told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last Saturday when he met with him that Trump had said in no uncertain terms, 'Make the deal.' 'The president has been a great friend of Israel and now it’s time to be a friend back,' Witkoff said to Netanyahu, according to the paper’s source. He also told the prime minister that the Israeli negotiators in Qatar needed the power to make decisions on their own and 'If Netanyahu didn’t want to work that way, everyone should just pack their bags and go home.' Just days later, the negotiating team, headed by Mossad chief David Barnea, returned with an agreement that was then authorized by the Cabinet on Friday night. The U.S. has many more sticks it can use against Israel than it does against Hamas, especially as Trump has made it clear that he would not involve the U.S. military in any conflict in the world right now. This can include the threats of withholding weapons as the Biden administration did in part, and declining to back Israel in international bodies such as the UN and International Criminal Court. There is always the possibility that support for a decisive Israeli strike on Iran, the master puppeteer and funder of all the terrorist organizations acting against the Jewish state, could be put on the line as well. While according to surveys, a majority of Israelis support the deal, a solid minority do not, including families of soldiers killed in the war and some families of the hostages themselves, who protested in Jerusalem Saturday night insisting that the long-term security of the state is in danger if the government carries through with the terms, and that this is more important than the fate of their loved ones. In the first phase of the ceasefire, set to last six weeks, 33 hostages – not all of them alive – are to be freed by Hamas in dribs and drabs of three each week, including women, children, men over age 50 and those injured or ill. Fully 14 of the hostages are going to be released only in the very last week, including Avraham Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, two mentally incapacitated Israelis who have been held in Gaza since 2014 and 2015, respectively, after they wandered into the Strip on their own. For its part, Israel will release up to 737 Palestinian security prisoners, including 290 who are serving multiple life sentences, and 1,167 Gazans who had been captured in the 15-month long war but were not part of the Hamas-led invasion force that massacred 1,200 people and abducted over 250 last October, 97 of whom are still in captivity, with perhaps half of them still alive. Since the 'price' for each live hostage returned is higher than the one for those who are dead, the number of prisoners may go down. Hamas has only committed to telling Israel 24 hours ahead of time which three hostages it is releasing in any of the five first weeks. For each live civilian female or child abductee, 30 security prisoners who are female or under age 19 will be released. Female IDF soldiers will exact a higher price, 50 security prisoners for each one. Every live abductee over age 50 returned will garner 30 terrorists who are sick or over the same age. For the nine sick or injured hostages who are not soldiers, 110 security prisoners will be released. The IDF will also withdraw from all population centers to kilometer-wide border zones within the Strip and allow the mass return of Gazans to their homes from the humanitarian safe areas in the southern part of the coastal enclave. Negotiations for the release of the rest of the hostages in phase two will begin in the middle of phase one. Netanyahu tried to spin the Cabinet’s authorization as one for a 'temporary' lull in the effort to destroy Hamas, saying that Trump had agreed that if Israel’s security demands aren’t met in the second phase, the IDF can 'return to the war.' However, in an interview with NBC, Trump said that the ceasefire 'better hold.'

3 of the top 5 NCAA men’s basketball teams are coached by Jews	March Madness should be fun for Jewish fans — and coaches — this year! By Jacob Gurvis, JTA We’re about halfway through the college basketball season, and it couldn’t be going much better for the nation’s top Jewish coaches. The Associated Press released its latest Top 25 Poll on Monday, and three of the top five men’s teams, along with one of the top five women’s teams, are coached by Jews. On the men’s side, Bruce Pearl’s Auburn is ranked No. 1, riding a nine-game winning streak to a 16-1 overall record and the top spot in the Southeastern Conference. Pearl, a former Maccabiah Games coach and the co-founder of the NCAA’s Jewish Coaches Association, is one of the more outspoken Jewish and pro-Israel coaches in all of college sports. Duke, led by coach Jon Scheyer, clocks in at No. 3 on the men’s side, with a 15-2 record and an 11-game winning streak of their own. Scheyer, who played professionally in Israel with Maccabi Tel Aviv after winning the NCAA title as a Duke player in 2010, has drawn support from the university’s Jewish student body. And at No. 5 in the men’s rankings is Florida, coached by Todd Golden. The Gators are also 15-2 and are coming off a tough one-point loss against Missouri on Tuesday. Golden is also an alum of Israel’s pro league, and he played for Pearl on the gold-medal-winning U.S. team at the 2009 Maccabiah Games. (Credit/JTA) On the women’s side, Lindsay Gottlieb’s University of Southern California ranks No. 4 on the AP’s latest list. The Trojans have won 12 straight and at 16-1 are in second place in the Big Ten, behind rival UCLA, which the AP ranked No. 1. Gottlieb, who earned her 300th career coaching win earlier this season, is a member of the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame of Northern California.

Report: Trump mulling temporarily moving some Gazans to Indonesia	Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff reportedly planning regular trips to Gaza and Israel to keep the pressure on both sides to implement the newly-signed ceasefire deal. By World Israel News Staff President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has floated a number of proposals for managing the post-war reconstruction of the Gaza Strip and ensuring full implementation of the ceasefire deal with Israel, according to a report by NBC News, including the possible temporary relocation of part of the Strip's population abroad. Citing an unnamed Trump transition official, the report claimed that the incoming president's Middle East special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is mulling regular trips to the region to ensure both sides remain in compliance with the truce. According to the report, Witkoff is even considering visiting the war-torn Gaza Strip itself. 'You have to be right on top of it, ready to snuff out a problem if it happens,' the official said of Witkoff's plans to frequent the region. The Trump transition official said the administration would need to keep a watchful eye not only on Hamas but also on right-wing Israeli 'radicals' to prevent a collapse of the ceasefire. 'Remember, there’s a lot of people, radicals, fanatics, not just from the Hamas side, from the right wing of the Israeli side, who are absolutely incentivized to blow this whole deal up.' In terms of planning the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip after the war with Israel is over, the official cited by the NBC News report said the incoming administration is considering wide-ranging proposals, including the temporarily relocation of part of Gaza's population to a third-party country. A number of possible destinations have been floated, the official said, including Indonesia. The official did not specify whether the Trump transition team has been in contact with foreign leaders, including Indonesia's, regarding the potential relocation. Nor did the official say if any effort has been made to feel-out support for such a move within the Gaza Strip.

Biden commutes 2,500 sentences, shattering single-day record days...	The outgoing president also received heavy criticism for his sweeping pardon of his son, Hunter Biden, after repeatedly promising not to do so. By The Washington Free Beacon President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of roughly 2,500 non-violent drug offenders Friday, breaking his own record for single-day commutations just days before leaving office. Those receiving clemency were 'serving disproportionately long sentences compared to the sentences they would receive today under current law, policy, and practice,' Biden said in a statement released Friday. 'This action is an important step toward righting historic wrongs, correcting sentencing disparities, and providing deserving individuals the opportunity to return to their families and communities after spending far too much time behind bars.' Biden had previously set the mark for single-day commutations in December, when he reduced the sentences of nearly 1,500 individuals and pardoned another 39. Biden came under fire for these grants of clemency, which included a corrupt Pennsylvania judge who sent juveniles to prison in exchange for kickbacks and a woman who murdered two husbands and an ex-boyfriend for insurance money. The outgoing president also received heavy criticism for his sweeping pardon of his son, Hunter Biden, after repeatedly promising not to do so. 'With this action, I have now issued more individual pardons and commutations than any president in U.S. history,' Biden said Friday. Biden indicated that more commutations might be on the way, saying he 'will continue to review additional commutations and pardons' prior to leaving office next week.

A closer look at the Palestinian prisoners due to be released	The final number of the terrorists to be released in the deal will depend on how many of the 33 hostages are alive. By Pesach Benson, TPS The first phase of a ceasefire agreement that goes into effect on Sunday will see 33 Israeli hostages freed in exchange for hundreds of imprisoned Palestinian terrorists. Israel released a list of 735 prisoners on Saturday to give families of their victims time to file legal petitions. Here is a look at some of the more notable figures on the list. — Mohammed Abu Warda: A Hamas member who sent suicide bombers to blow themselves up on Jerusalem busses in attacks that killed 45 people. Warda was sentenced to 48 life sentences. — Wael Qassem, Wassam Abbasi, and Mohammed Odeh: Members of a Hamas terror cell responsible for bombings that killed 35 people, including a Hebrew University cafeteria, Rishon LeZion’s Shefayim Club and a Jerusalem cafe. — Thabet Mardawi: A Palestinian Islamic Jihad commander serving 21 life terms plus 40 years for organizing suicide bombings in Hadera, Afula, Binyamina and Kiryat Motzkin, shooting attacks, and a car bombing. His attacks during the Second Intifada killed 20 people and injured around 150 more. — Omar al-Zaben: A Hamas commander serving 27 life sentences for attacks that killed 27 Israelis. — Abdullah Sharbati, Majdi Zaatari, and Samer al-Atrash: Members of a cell who masterminded a 2003 suicide bombing that killed 23 people in Jerusalem, including seven children. — Ahmad Barghouti: sentenced to 13 life terms for ordering attacks that killed 12 Israelis during the Second Intifada. Ahmad is a cousin of Marwan Barghouti, the highest profile terrorist who is expected to be deported a later stage. — Sami Jaradat: A Palestinian Islamic Jihad commander from the Jenin area involved in the 2003 bombing of a Haifa restaurant that killed 21 people. — Mohammed Naifeh: Planned attacks on Hermesh and Kibbutz Meter in which eight Israelis were killed. — Zakariya Zubeidi: A former Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades commander in Jenin, responsible for multiple terror attacks. Six people were killed when terrorists ordered by Zubeidi attacked a Likud branch building in Beit Shean with guns and grenades as party members were voting in a primary in 2002. Zubeidi was one of six Gilboa Prison escapees in 2021. — Mohammed Amoudi: Sent a suicide bomber to Tel Aviv who killed 11 people at a food stand in 2006. — Ramadan Mashahra: Was involved in the 2002 suicide bombing aboard a bus in Jerusalem that killed 19 people. — Shadi Amouri: A member of Palestinian Islamic Jihad who helped plan a 2002 car bombing that killed 17 people at the Megiddo Junction. — Ali Safuri: A senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad figure involved in multiple terror attacks which killed nine people and injured more than 100. The final number of the terrorists to be released in the deal will depend on how many of the 33 hostages are alive. The most contentious aspect of the agreement is that the fate of the remaining 65 hostages will be determined by negotiations to begin on the 16th day of the ceasefire. Critics say the phased approach condemns hostages not freed in the beginning to open-ended captivity and undermines Israel’s war gains. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 95 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead.

First three hostages to be released identified	Hamas says it will free three women on Sunday, including a dual British-Israeli citizen, a dual Romanian-Israeli citizen, and a young Israeli woman who was shot and wounded during the Supernova music festival. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization on Sunday revealed the names of the three hostages slated to be released during the first day of the ceasefire with Israel. After hours of delays, Israel announced that the ceasefire went into effect at 11:15 a.m. Sunday, after originally having been slated to begin at 8:30 a.m. The ceasefire was delayed after Hamas failed to handover a list of the first three hostages set to be released. Under the terms of last week's truce agreement, Hamas is required to notify Israel at least 24 hours in advance of the identities of the hostages set for release. With the first three hostages set to be released at 4:30 p.m. Sunday, the list was required by 4:30 p.m. Saturday afternoon. Israel repeatedly warned Saturday night and Sunday morning that it would not implement the ceasefire until the list was received. IDF artillery and warplanes struck Hamas targets across the Gaza Strip Sunday morning, after the 8:30 deadline for beginning the ceasefire. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry claimed that 13 people were killed and dozens more injured in the strikes. At 10:24 a.m., a Hamas spokesman finally published the list of hostages set to be released Sunday. The list includes Emily Damari, 28, Romi Gonen, 24, and Doron Steinbrecher, 31. Gonen was shot and wounded on the morning of October 7th while she attended the Supernova music festival near Kibbutz Re'im. After she was wounded, Gonen was taken captive by Hamas terrorists and carried off into the Gaza Strip. Gonen was on the phone with her mother when she was shot. Steinbrecher and Damari are both residents of the border town of Kfar Azza. The two were seized by Hamas terrorists who overran their town and taken captive into the Gaza Strip. Damaria, a dual British-Israeli citizen, suffered multiple wounds during the terrorist attack on her home, being shot in the hand and suffering shrapnel wounds to one of her legs. Steinbrecher, who carries both Romanian and Israeli citizenship, was hiding under her bed when terrorists broke into her house and took her into captivity.

IDF bombs Hamas positions as ceasefire delayed	Israel delayed Gaza ceasefire for hours and struck multiple terror targets after Hamas refused to handover list of hostages to be released. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Implementation of the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip was delayed Sunday morning, after the Hamas terror organization failed to provide a list of the three Israeli hostages slated for release later in the day. As part of the agreement signed last week, Hamas is obligated to provide Israel with the names of the hostages slated for release at least 24 hours prior to their return to Israel. While Hamas was required to identify the three by 4:30 p.m. Saturday - one full day before their scheduled return Sunday afternoon - the terror group declined to release the hostages' names by the scheduled start of the ceasefire at 8:30 a.m. Sunday. As a result, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office and the IDF announced the beginning of the ceasefire had been delayed. In the interim, IDF forces bombed and shelled Hamas positions across the Gaza Strip. According to Gaza health officials, 13 people were killed and dozens more injured in attacks on Gaza City, Beit Lahia, Khan Yunis, Beit Hanoun, and other sites across the Gaza Strip. At 10:24 a.m., Hamas finally released the names of three Israeli women slated for release Sunday afternoon. The Prime Minister's Office responded to the release of the hostage list, saying Israeli security officials were verifying the details. 'Israel has received the list of the hostages who are due to be released today according to the framework. The security establishment is now checking the details,' the GPO said. 'Coordinator for the Hostages and the Missing Brig.-Gen. (Res.) Gal Hirsch has initially notified the hostages' families via IDF representatives.' Netanyahu's office said that following the publication of the hostage list, the ceasefire went into effect at 11:15 a.m. The post IDF bombs Hamas positions as ceasefire delayed appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/idf-bombs-hamas-positions-as-ceasefire-delayed/	2025-01-19T01:28:00-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gaza.png
Trump and top aide challenge Netanyahu’s claim ceasefire will be ...	Ceasefire deal 'better hold,' says Trump calling for an 'end' to Gaza war, as his incoming National Security Advisor vows to hostage families US will ensure all three phases of ceasefire deal will be implemented. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President-elect Donald Trump and a top aide appeared to contradict claims by senior Israeli leaders over the weekend that Israel may resume its war against Hamas after the first phase of a three-part ceasefire. On Saturday, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had assured him that despite the cabinet ratifying the three-part hostage and ceasefire deal with Hamas Friday night, the IDF would resume its operations against the terror group in Gaza after the first phase of the deal. Netanyahu himself hinted at a renewal of the fighting, saying Saturday night that Israel is still committed to the destruction of Hamas and ensuring that Gaza never again threatens Israel's security. 'We retain the right to return to the war, if necessary, with the backing of the U.S.,' Netanyahu said, claiming that Trump himself had endorsed a return to fighting in Gaza during a call last week with the Israeli premier. Trump 'welcomed the agreement and rightly emphasized that the first stage of the agreement is a temporary ceasefire. That is what he said, ‘a temporary ceasefire’.' That same day, however, Trump appeared to contradict Netanyahu's claim during an interview with NBC News. Trump said that the new ceasefire 'better hold.' 'Well, we’re going to see very soon, and it better hold.' The incoming president recalled his recent telephone conversation with Netanyahu, saying that while he said Israel must do 'what has to be done,' he also emphasized that the war 'has to end.' 'Just keep doing what you have to do. You have to have — this has to end. We want it to end, but to keep doing what has to be done.' Trump said his administration would ensure the ceasefire holds, saying the maintenance of the truce would be a litmus test of American soft power abroad. 'The United States has to get respected again, and it has to get respected fast. But respect is the primary word that I use,' Trump said. 'If they respect us, it will hold. If they don’t respect us, all hell will break out.' Hours after the interview, Axios cited three sources who claimed that Trump's choice for National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz, on Saturday pledged to relatives of hostages in Gaza that the Trump administration would ensure that the full three-stages of the ceasefire will be implemented. Hostage families have feared that the 64 other hostages remaining in Gaza not slated for release during the six-week initial phase will be left in the coastal enclave should Israel resume the war after phase one of the agreement. Waltz assured the families that the White House would push for talks aimed at securing the implementation of the second phase of the deal as soon as possible.

‘No surrender’ – 3 arrested in Jerusalem protests against ceasefi...	The ceasefire 'will plunge Israel into a national tragedy for decades to come,' says father of fallen soldier. By World Israel News Staff Thousands of protesters gathered in Jerusalem on Saturday evening, urging the government not to implement a ceasefire and hostage deal. Many of those participating in the protest are members of the Gvura Forum, an umbrella group advocating for the families of fallen soldiers and terror victims. Protesters held signs demanding the death penalty for terrorists and warning that freed terrorists have killed Israelis after their release. Some demonstrators dressed up as terrorists, painting their hands red to symbolize blood. Mock corpses wrapped in Jewish burial shrouds were carried by protesters, illustrating the potential murders of Israeli citizens following the mass release of terrorists. Yehoshua Shani, whose IDF soldier son was killed battling Hamas terrorists during the October 7th terror invasion, addressed the crowd. 'Hundreds of arch-terrorists will be released into the streets. We have seen in the past how this ended. Freeing hundreds of murderers and leaders of terrorist organizations during a time of war encourages terrorism, and an immediate risk to the security of Israeli citizens,' Shani said. Shani criticized the deal's framework, which see the 98 hostages freed in various phases. Many in Israel have expressed skepticism that the deal will hold for long enough to see the release of hostages included in the second and third stages. The current deal 'will leave behind dozens of new 'Ron Arads',' Shani said, referring to an Israeli pilot taken hostage in Syria in the 1980s, whose body has never been recovered. He added that the ceasefire 'will plunge Israel into a national tragedy for decades to come.' After demonstrators blocked traffic under the Chords Bridge, police worked to disperse the protest. Three demonstrators were arrested, according to a statement from the police.

Remains of IDF soldier killed in 2014 found in Gaza, returned to ...	IDF Staff Sgt. Oron Shaul was killed during fighting between Israel and Hamas in 2014, and his body was seized by terrorists and held in the Gaza Strip for over a decade. By World Israel News Staff The remains of an IDF soldier killed while fighting against Hamas terrorists in 2014 and held captive in the Gaza Strip for over a decade have been located by Israeli forces operating in the coastal enclave, the Israeli military announced Sunday morning. Oron Shaul, a 20-year-old IDF soldier, was fatally wounded after the armored personnel carrier he was riding in was struck by an anti-tank projectile fired by Hamas terrorists in the Shuja'iyya neighborhood of Gaza City. The remains of six other soldiers killed in the attack on the vehicle were later recovered by the IDF. However, terrorists pulled Shaul's remains from the wreckage of the destroyed APC and held them captive, along with the remains of another IDF soldier killed during the fighting - Hadar Goldin. On Sunday, Israeli's military and the Shin Bet internal security agency issued a joint statement announcing that Shaul's remains had been located in the Gaza Strip during a recent operation, adding that the slain soldier's body had been returned to Israel. 'Efforts to retrieve him, including the gathering of information and intelligence by the Prisoners and Missing Persons Headquarters and the Special Operations Division in Military Intelligence, have continued over the past decade, with intensified efforts during the war,' the IDF and Shin Bet said in the joint statement. 'Following an identification process conducted by the Institute of Forensic Medicine and the Military Rabbinate, IDF and Shin Bet representatives informed the family this morning.' 'The IDF and Shin Bet express their condolences to the family and will continue to support them.' Sunday's announcement did not provide details regarding where in Gaza Shaul's body was found, nor when or how the operation was conducted.

Islamic Jihad threatens to murder hostages before ceasefire start...	PIJ claims Israeli bombing is threatening the lives of hostages, hours before ceasefire is due to begin. By World Israel News Staff The Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) terror group threatened the lives of the Israeli hostages it is holding, saying they would be killed unless Israel stopped its military activities in Gaza Strip before the ceasefire is slated to come into effect at 8:30 a.m. on Sunday. PIJ attacked southern Israel alongside Hamas and other, smaller terror organizations on October 7th, taking a significant number of hostages. 'The people of the enemy prisoners must demand that the Zionist army stop the bombardment of the last hours, which is the reason for the killing of your children while the resistance is making the final field arrangements for their release,' PIJ spokesman Abu Hamza said in a statement released on social media platform Telegram. 'The intensity of the Zionist bombardment leads us towards two paths, the first of which is that the families of the Zionist prisoners receive their children in coffins or [safely] in their homes, and the choice of the last hours is in the hands of the Zionist army alone,' the statement concluded. While the text appeared to blame the potential deaths of hostages on IAF bombing, Hamas has murdered numerous captives, then blamed their deaths on the Israeli military. Bodies of some hostages - whom Hamas claimed were killed in airstrikes - were found to have been shot at point-blank range. Dozens of high-profile PIJ terrorists are expected to be released from Israeli prisons during the first phase of the ceasefire. Thabet Mardawi, a senior PIJ member convicted for his role in deadly terror attacks during the Second Intifada that killed 21 Israelis and wounded some 200, will be set free. High-profile attacks planned by Mardawi include a bus bombing near Jerusalem, shooting attack at Hadera's outdoor market, and a suicide bombing at Kibbutz Shluhot.

Netanyahu warns Hamas holding up ceasefire, hints Gaza war will r...	Defending controversial ceasefire plan against criticism from the Right, Prime Minister Netanyahu says hostage deal frozen until Hamas gives details of hostages' condition. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke out Saturday night in defense of his government's decision to ratify the hostage and ceasefire deal with Hamas over the weekend, raising the ire of many on the Israeli Right. In a televised address at 8:10 p.m., Netanyahu emphasized the return of Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip, while adding that his government would not compromise on the two other goals formally adopted by the cabinet following the October 7th invasion of Israel. 'It is this strength that has led us with determination to achieve all of the objectives of the war that we set: Returning all of our hostages, eliminating Hamas' military and governing capabilities and ensuring that Gaza will never again constitute a threat to our country,' Netanyahu said. 'As of today, we have returned home 157 of our hostages, 117 of whom alive. Under the agreement that has now been approved, we will return home another 33 of our brothers and sisters, most of them alive.' Despite the deal's provision for negotiations to make the truce permanent, Netanyahu said the incoming Trump administration supported limiting the ceasefire, making it 'temporary.' Trump 'welcomed the agreement and rightly emphasized that the first stage of the agreement is a temporary ceasefire. That is what he said, 'a temporary ceasefire'.' Netanyahu said that Israel had received explicit U.S. backing to resume the war in Gaza 'if necessary,' denying that the agreement commits Israel to a permanent end to the war. '. For many months, Hamas demanded that we promise in advance to end the war as a condition for its entering a framework for the release of the hostages, and it set all kinds of additional dictated terms.' 'I strongly opposed these dictated terms – and my position was accepted. We retain the right to return to the war, if necessary, with the backing of the U.S.' The agreement, set to go into effect Sunday morning at 8:30, includes a three-stage ceasefire, during which all of the 98 captives - alive and dead - still held in the Gaza Strip are to be returned to Israel. During the first stage, which will last for six weeks, 33 Israeli hostages are slated to be freed, in exchange for hundreds of jailed Palestinian terrorists, with 30 terrorists to be released for each Israeli civilian, and 50 for each female IDF soldier returned to Israel. The 33 hostages slated for return to Israel during the first six weeks include both living and dead captives, with Israeli officials estimating that 25 of the captives on the list are still alive while 8 others are believed to be dead, though Hamas has yet to handover information on the hostages' condition. Hamas has also failed thus far to provide a list of the three hostages who are set to be returned Sunday afternoon, despite the deal requiring 24-hour prior notification. Prior to Netanyahu's address Saturday night, the Prime Minister's Office warned Hamas that the implementation of the hostage deal cannot move forward until Israel receives the list of hostages set to be released Sunday afternoon. 'We will be unable to move forward with the framework until we receive the list of the hostages who will be released, as was agreed. Israel will not tolerate violations of the agreement. Hamas is solely responsible.' In addition, the deal provides for the massive expansion of international aid into the Gaza Strip, guaranteeing at least 600 aid trucks will enter the coastal enclave each day to deliver goods and fuel. The IDF will partially withdraw from key positions in Gaza, including the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza, and allow the return en masse of Gazans to northern Gaza. While a joint team assembled by Qatar and Egypt will be assigned to use X-ray machines to check vehicles for weapons, pedestrians walking north will not be subjected to any security checks. In his Saturday night address, Netanyahu did not mention the planned withdrawal from the Netzarim Corridor, but denied claims that the ceasefire deal required Israel to pullout from the Philadelphi Corridor on the Gaza-Egypt border. 'And the third principle – keeping the Philadelphi Corridor and the security buffer zone. When I say keeping the Philadelphi Corridor, not only will we not reduce our forces there, we will even increase them slightly, and this is contrary to all of the reports that I hear.' 'We promised in the agreement that Israel would keep full control in the Philadelphi Corridor and the security buffer around the entire Gaza Strip. We will not allow war materiel to be smuggled in, nor will we allow our hostages to be smuggled out.'

Supreme Court rejects petition against hostage deal and ceasefire	We call on all Israeli citizens to hug their children tightly and arm themselves,' warns NGO representing terror victims and bereaved families. By World Israel News Staff The Supreme Court rejected a petition on Sunday morning that sought an injunction to prevent the Israeli government from implementing a ceasefire and hostage deal. The justices made the decision without hearing oral arguments, solely based on written arguments submitted to the Court. The petition was filed by Choosing Life, an NGO composed of the family members of fallen soldiers and victims of terror attacks. In its ruling rejecting the petition, the Court wrote that it does not intervene on matters of national security and foreign policy. 'This is one of the cases in which the limits of the law is clear. Our hearts go out to the families of those who have not yet returned, as well as to those who see the murderers of their loved ones leave prison and their eyes are filled with tears. Alongside this, there is still hope that sons and daughters will indeed return to their homeland,' wrote Justice Dafna Barak Erez. 'The values ​​at the heart of the discussion, primarily the sanctity of life and the redemption of captives, are not in dispute; however, there is also a sharp debate regarding the implementation' of a ceasefire deal, she added. Choosing Life also requested that the family members of those murdered in terror attacks would receive an advance phone call warning them that their loved one's killers were being released from prison. The Court rejected the request, calling it 'unnecessary.' Following the ruling, Choosing Life said that the Court often intervenes on security matters, such as how prisoners are treated. 'Apparently, if we had petitioned to improve the conditions of the terrorists, the High Court would at least hold a hearing, but we are just families whose murderers of loved ones are released, so we're not important,' the NGO said in a media statement. 'We explained in the petition that the reckless decision [to release thousands of terrorists] was made, the streets will be filled with murderers, and there is no one to save them. Not the political echelon, not the security echelon, not the legal echelon. We call on all Israeli citizens to hug their children tightly and arm themselves.'

Terrorists to be released in exchange for hostages have killed hu...	Among the terrorists slated for release is Zakariya Zubeidi, who carried out several deadly attacks during the Second Intifada. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A number of the 735 Palestinian prisoners to be released in exchange for 33 hostages in the first phase of the agreement have committed deadly crimes killing hundreds of Israelis. The following are some terrorists slated for release. Zakariya Zubeidi, the commander of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades of Fatah in Jenin, played a central role in orchestrating several terrorist attacks during the Second Intifada. He is responsible for the 2002 Likud branch attack in Beit She'an, which resulted in the deaths of six people. Zubeidi was also among the prisoners who escaped from Gilboa Prison in September 2021. Majdi Za'tari, from East Jerusalem, was sentenced to 23 life sentences and an additional 50 years in prison. He was convicted of orchestrating a suicide bombing on a bus in Jerusalem in August 2003, which resulted in the deaths of 23 people. Ahmed Barghouti, commander of the Fatah military wing in the Ramallah area, is serving 13 life sentences. He was convicted of carrying out a series of suicide attacks during the Second Intifada, which led to the deaths of 12 Israelis. Notably, his actions included the attack on the 'Seafood Market' restaurant in Tel Aviv, as well as bombings in Neve Ya'akov and Jaffa Street in Jerusalem. Thabet Mardawi, a high-ranking member of Islamic Jihad, was responsible for the deaths of 21 Israelis and the injuries of nearly 200 during the Second Intifada. He orchestrated a series of deadly attacks, including a suicide bombing at Kibbutz Shluhot, a shooting spree at a market in Hadera, an assault near Camp 80, and a bus bombing at Moza Junction. Wael Kasem and Wissam Abbasi were responsible for a series of deadly terrorist attacks that killed 35 Israelis. Their attacks included the bombing of Cafe Moment in Jerusalem, the Sheffield Club in Rishon Lezion, and the Frank Sinatra cafeteria at Hebrew University. Osama al-Ashkar, a senior member of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, is serving eight life sentences and an additional 50 years in prison. He was convicted of planning and executing two attacks in 2002—at Kibbutz Metzer and Kibbutz Hermesh—that resulted in the murder of eight Israelis.

Otzma Yehudit party to resign from Israeli government on Sunday	The move comes after Ben Gvir threatened to leave the government over the approval of the hostage release and ceasefire deal. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Otzma Yehudit party, headed by National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, said it will resign from the Israeli government on Sunday. The move comes after Ben Gvir threatened to leave the government over the approval of the hostage release and ceasefire deal which he called 'reckless.' 'The approval of the agreement with the terrorist group Hamas is a reckless decision, involving the release of hundreds of individuals responsible for the deaths of countless civilians,' Otzma Yehudit wrote in a statement. 'This agreement undermines the IDF's hard-won achievements in the war, calls for the withdrawal of IDF forces from Gaza, and effectively halts the ongoing military efforts. It amounts to nothing less than surrender to Hamas,' the statement continued. The Otzma Yehudit ministers who are resigning are: Itamar Ben-Gvir, Yitzhak Wasserlauf, and Amichai Eliyahu, along with committee chairs MKs Zvika Fogel and Limor Son Har-Melech, as well as MK Yitzhak Kreuzer. 'The deal taking shape is reckless,' Ben-Gvir stated in a televised address on Thursday. He insisted that the agreement would 'erase the achievements of the war' by releasing hundreds of Palestinian terrorists and withdrawing from key areas in Gaza, ultimately leaving Hamas functional. 'This deal sends a message to Hamas that they can kidnap Israelis, attack us and in the end, they will get what they want,' he added. Two other ministers, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Diaspora Minister Amichai Chikli, threatened to leave the government over the hostage and ceasefire deal. On Thursday, Smotrich and his party Religious Zionism indicated they would be willing to remain in the government and accept the first phase of the hostage release deal provided that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signs a statement that Israel will resume the war against Hamas immediately after. Although Smotrich and Chikli have not announced their resignation, they voted against the hostage deal on Friday. Smotrich stated that his party did 'everything possible to prevent a harmful deal that would jeopardize Israel's security.' He added, 'Unfortunately, Prime Minister Netanyahu chose to approve a disastrous and harmful deal—one that threatens Israel's national security and reverses many of the war's accomplishments.'

Sotheby’s to auction ‘the most complete Jewish baseball card coll...	Compiled over five decades, this remarkable archive represents every Jewish baseball player of the 191 total as of the 2024 MLB season,' the listing says. By Jacob Gurvis, JTA For many Jewish fans who collect baseball cards, the joy of opening a new pack and finding a Jewish player is second to none. That was Seymour Stoll’s experience years ago when he drew a Sandy Koufax card at 14 years old. Inspired by that sense of pride, Stoll set out to collect the cards of every Jewish player in baseball history — around 200 total. More than 50 years later, his complete collection is going up for auction at Sotheby’s, with an estimated price of $500,000 to $700,000. Touted as 'the most complete Jewish baseball card collection in the world,' Stoll’s archive features over 500 cards representing 191 Jewish players. It claims to contain at least one card for every Jewish player who has appeared in a professional game as of the 2024 season. (A similar but much smaller set of Jewish baseball cards was produced and sold throughout the 2000s.) The players most represented in the collection are Hall of Famers Koufax and Hank Greenberg. Other well-known Jewish stars such as Norm and Larry Sherry, Ron Blomberg and more contemporary players like Ian Kinsler and Ryan Braun are all featured. Lipman Pike, the first Jewish baseball star and one of the sport’s first-ever professional players, is also represented. The most valuable card in the set is an 1867 tintype — an old-fashioned metallic print — of Philadelphia Athletics star Levi Meyerle, one of two Meyerle tintypes in existence. Stoll told Sports Collectors Digest that he bought the card for $750 around 30 years ago and later had it appraised at $250,000 to $300,000. Meyerle’s card stands out for another reason — because some of the most devoted aficionados of Jewish baseball history are certain that he is not Jewish, despite his name. He and several other players mentioned in the Sotheby’s listing are not included in 'The Jewish Baseball Card Book,' published in 2018 by Bob Wechsler. Sotheby’s acknowledged having heard from Neil Keller, a baseball fan and self-described 'national and international speaker on ‘who is Jewish,'' about the listing. It said his concerns were addressed in the online listing, which acknowledges some uncertainty about the included players’ Jewishness. 'Compiled over five decades, this remarkable archive represents every Jewish baseball player of the 191 total as of the 2024 MLB season,' the listing says. 'Of these, 177 players have confirmed Jewish heritage, while the remaining 14 players’ heritage has not been proven.' It does not note that Meyerle is among the 14. Other notable cards include a rare one of 1930s New York Giants star Philip Weintraub and a 1946 Cuban series card of Max Rosenfeld. There’s also a fake card of former Cincinnati Reds player Harry Chozen — a card that Chozen’s family created after the Reds refused to have one made because Chozen was Jewish. (That card holds little value on its own.) 'This collection not only celebrates achievements but also sheds light on the challenges Jewish players faced on and off the field,' reads the Sotheby’s listing, which notes that Koufax and Greenberg both faced antisemitism during their careers. Stoll’s collection has been on display at 11 major museums around the United States — including the National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia and the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles — as well as synagogues, libraries and community centers. 'Everybody loves something whether you’re young, you’re old, and it gives you a sense of pride of what the baseball players did to integrate Jews into society,' Stoll, now a physician in California, said in 2020. 'In the old days, they would be blackballed and had to hide their Jewish heritage. Today, they’re welcomed with open arms. It shows the evolution of the game, the evolution towards the feelings of Jewish players and the country in general.' Bidding in the auction — which includes a broad array of Americana — is open now and ends on Jan. 25. For Shabbat-observant interested parties, Sotheby’s notes, bids can be made in advance or through an agent.

Hamas has not yet released the names of 3 hostages to be freed Su...	According to the agreement, Hamas is required to release the names of hostages to be freed on the following day. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An Israeli official reports that Hamas has not yet released the names of the three hostages to be freed on Sunday. According to the agreement, Hamas is required to release the names of hostages to be freed on the following day. The terror group was supposed to have presented the names by 4pm on Saturday, 24 hours before the Sunday release. Israeli officials appealed to Egyptian and Qatari officials to ensure Hamas complies with the agreement. The official added that the lapse does not signal a breakdown of the hostage deal, but added that such infractions should not be frequent. Although it is not certain which of the 33 hostages will be released on Sunday, the names of the total 33 have been published. The names of the 33 hostages to be released in the first part of the negotiated agreement have been published. There is no indication which of the following hostages are still alive, and the medical condition of most is not yet known. The names are Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Ohad Ben Ami, the four members of the Bibas family, Yarden, Shiri, Ariel, Kfir, Agam Berger, and Romi Gonen. Other names include: Daniella Gilboa, Emily Damari, Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn, Omer Wenkert, Alexander Troufanov, Arbel Yehud, Ohad Yahalomi, Eliya Cohen, Or Levy, Naama Levy, Oded Lifshitz, Gadi Moshe Mozes, Avera Mengistu, Shlomo Mansour, Keith Samuel Siegel, Tsahi Idan, Ofer Calderon, Tal Shoham, Doron Steinbrecher, Omer Shem-Tov, Itzik Elgarat, Hisham al-Sayed, and Eli Sharabi. The first hostages expected to be released are the Bibas children and civilian women followed by IDF female soldiers, men over 50, as well as injured and ill captives. Israeli officials have warned that Hamas has shown itself untrustworthy and has engaged in psychological warfare in the past, therefore, there is no guarantee that Hamas will adhere to any plans to release hostages or that the names on the list will reflect the actual captives who are freed.

Iran, Russia sign strategic cooperation treaty, deepen defense ti...	Pezeshkian, on his first Kremlin visit since winning the presidency last July, hailed the treaty as an important new chapter in bilateral relations, while Putin said Moscow and Tehran shared many views on international affairs. By Reuters and The Algemeiner Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian deepened military ties between their countries on Friday by signing a 20-year strategic partnership that is likely to worry the West. Under the agreement, Russia and Iran will boost cooperation in a range of areas including their security services, military drills, warship port visits, and joint officer training. Neither will allow their territory to be used for any action that threatens the other and will provide no help to an aggressor attacking either nation, according to the text, which also said they would work together to counter military threats. But it did not include a mutual defense clause of the kind included in a treaty between Russia and North Korea, which the West says has seen North Korean troops deployed to fight in Ukraine, something Moscow has neither confirmed nor denied. Nor was there specific mention of arms transfers, a topic of particular concern to the US and its allies, though the two sides said they would develop 'military-technical cooperation.' Pezeshkian, on his first Kremlin visit since winning the presidency last July, hailed the treaty as an important new chapter in bilateral relations, while Putin said Moscow and Tehran shared many views on international affairs. 'This [treaty] creates better conditions for bilateral cooperation in all areas,' said Putin, emphasizing the upside for economic ties and trade, which he said was mostly carried out in the two countries’ own currencies. 'We need less bureaucracy and more concrete action. Whatever difficulties are created by others, we will be able to overcome them and move forward,' Putin added, referring to Western sanctions on both countries. Putin said Russia regularly informed Iran about what was going on in the Ukraine conflict and that they closely consulted on events in the Middle East and the South Caucasus region. Russia and Iran were the main military allies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who fled to Moscow after being toppled last month. The West also accuses Iran of providing missiles and drones for Russian attacks on Ukraine. Moscow and Tehran say their increasingly close ties are not directed against other countries. Putin said work on a potential gas pipeline to carry Russian gas to Iran via Azerbaijan was progressing despite difficulties. He added that, despite delays in building new nuclear reactors for Iran, Moscow was also open to potentially taking on more nuclear projects. JUST IN: Russia and Iran officially sign 20-year Strategic Partnership Agreement that guarantees the security of the two countries. pic.twitter.com/rLw5PkM4Y9 &mdash; BRICS News (@BRICSinfo) January 17, 2025 ‘MULTI-POLAR WORLD’ Pezeshkian, whose words were translated by Russian state TV, said the treaty showed that Moscow and Tehran did not need to heed the opinion of what he called 'countries over the ocean.' 'The agreements we reached today are another stimulus when it comes to the creation of a multi-polar world,' he said, adding that he hoped the war in Ukraine could be ended at the negotiating table. 'War is not a good solution to resolve problems and we would welcome talks and achieving peace between… Russia and Ukraine,' Pezeshkian said. Moscow has cultivated closer ties with Iran and other nations hostile toward the US since the start of the Ukraine war. It already has strategic pacts with North Korea and close ally Belarus, as well as a partnership agreement with China. Moscow has made extensive use of Iranian drones during the war in Ukraine. The United States accused Tehran in September of delivering close-range ballistic missiles to Russia for use against Ukraine. Tehran denies supplying drones or missiles. The Kremlin has declined to confirm it has received Iranian missiles, but has acknowledged that its cooperation with Iran includes 'the most sensitive areas.' Russia has supplied Iran with S-300 air defense missile systems in the past and there have been reports in Iranian media of potential interest in buying more advanced systems such as the S-400 and of acquiring advanced Russian fighter jets. Pezeshkian’s visit to Moscow comes at a time when Iran’s influence across the Middle East is in retreat, with the fall of Assad in Syria and the Israeli pounding of Iran-backed groups Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The fate of two major Russian military facilities in Syria remains uncertain following Assad’s fall.

IDF downs two Houthi missiles fired from Yemen	Iranian-backed terrorist militias in Yemen and Iraq said on Thursday that they would cease their attacks against Israel following the agreement on a ceasefire with Hamas. By JNS The Israeli Air Force on Saturday morning intercepted a missile launched by Houthi terrorists in Yemen at central Israel, the military confirmed. The missile attack set off air-raid sirens in Tel Aviv and the capital Jerusalem, among other places. Hours later, the Israel Defense Forces downed a second Houthi missile that triggered sirens in the southernmost city of Eilat as well as in the Arava. The missile was intercepted before entering Israeli airspace, according to the military. Iranian-backed terrorist militias in Yemen and Iraq said on Thursday that they would cease their attacks against Israel following the agreement on a ceasefire with Hamas. Mohammed Abdul Salam, the Houthi spokesperson, declared the group’s 'battle [is] reaching its conclusion with the declaration of a ceasefire in Gaza.' The Israel-Hamas truce is set come into effect at 8:30 a.m. on Sunday (0630 GMT), the Qatari Foreign Ministry announced on Saturday. A Houthi ballistic missile triggered sirens across central Israel early on Tuesday morning, in the second such attack within hours. The sirens, which sounded just after 3 a.m., startled millions of residents in the Gush Dan, Judean Foothills (Shfela) and Sharon regions. Landings and takeoffs at Ben-Gurion International Airport were briefly suspended. According to the Israel Police, missile debris hit private homes in Moshav Mevo Beitar and Tzur Hadassah in the Jerusalem area. Police released an image of a large cylinder, identified as part of the Houthi missile, embedded in the roof of a home. Bomb disposal experts and other police forces were deployed to the affected sites. A Houthi missile fragment that struck a home in Mevo Beitar, a Jerusalem suburb, on January 14th, 2025 (Screenshot/Telegram) Since Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre, Iran-backed Houthis have launched around 40 surface-to-surface missiles and 320 UAVs toward Israel, according to the IDF. In response, the IAF has hit Houthi targets in Yemen several times, including on Jan. 10. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said thereafter that 'just as we promised, the Houthis are paying, and will continue to pay, a heavy price for their aggression against us.'

Israel-Hamas truce to begin Sunday at 8:30 am	The accord’s first stage is to see the phased release of 33 hostages—alive or dead—over a period of 42 days. By JNS The ceasefire with the Hamas terrorist organization will come into effect at 8:30 a.m. on Sunday, with the first three hostages—women—set to be freed from Gazan captivity sometime after 4 p.m. Israel estimates that 25 of the 33 people on the list of hostages to be returned in the first stage of the ceasefire agreement are alive. According to the Justice Ministry, Israel will release 1,904 Palestinian terrorists in the first stage: 737 prisoners and administrative detainees—among them killers with blood on their hands—and 1,167 residents of the Gaza Strip not involved in the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre. The Israeli Cabinet approved the ceasefire agreement early Saturday following seven hours of deliberation. Twenty-four ministers voted for the agreement and eight voted against, with one absenting himself from the vote. Voting against the measure were Regional Cooperation Minister David Amsalem and Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli of the Likud Party; Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Minister of Settlements and National Missions Orit Strock and Minister of Aliyah and Integration Ofir Sofer of the Religious Zionism Party; and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, Minister of Heritage Amihai Eliyahu and Minister for the Development of the Periphery, the Negev, and the Galilee Yitzhak Wasserlauf of the Otzma Yehudit Party. Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi from the Likud was not present during the vote. Ynet cited ministers who said at the conclusion of the vote that the decision was painful but significant for the sake of returning the hostages. Ministers who voted against the agreement said that 'their heart was torn,' the report added. The IDF spokesperson released a statement saying that Israeli troops have 'been preparing to receive the hostages after their release from Hamas captivity and is operating to provide suitable physical and psychological support, with careful attention to every detail.' The statement added, 'Alongside the agreement and our commitment to bringing home all the hostages, the IDF will continue to operate in order to ensure the security of all Israeli citizens, particularly those in communities near the Gaza Strip.' The Hamas terrorist organization announced on Saturday that starting Sunday morning, it will deploy its forces—mainly members of the Palestinian police—'across the entire Strip.' An anonymous Egyptian source was quoted by Israel’s Channel 12 as saying that Jerusalem changed its stance over the last couple of days and agreed that uniformed Palestinian Authority personnel will be stationed at crossings into the Gaza Strip. P.A. signs will be erected to emphasize the authority’s responsibility at the crossings, alongside European observers who will return to the border points according to terms of the agreement signed between Israel and the P.A. in 2005, two years before Hamas seized power in the Gaza Strip, according to the report. The accord’s first stage is to see the phased release of 33 hostages—alive or dead—over a period of 42 days. Three hostages are expected to be returned on Sunday and four more on the seventh day after the ceasefire goes into effect. Three hostages will be returned every week for the remaining four weeks, with 14 returned on the final, sixth week of the accord’s first stage. It is not known in what order the hostages will be released, although their names are projected to be revealed within the 24 hours before they are freed. The 33 captives are considered 'humanitarian' cases—women, children, men over 50, wounded and ill, including two mentally ill Israelis who entered the Strip on their own over a decade ago (Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed). The list is reportedly as follows: Romi Gonen, 23 Emily Damari, 27 Arbel Yehud, 29 Doron Steinbrecher, 31 Ariel Bibas, 5 Kfir Bibas, 2 Shiri Silberman Bibas, 33 Liri Albag, 19 Karina Ariev, 20 Agam Berger, 21 Danielle Gilboa, 20 Naama Levy, 20 Ohad Ben-Ami, 58 Gadi Moshe Moses, 80 Keith Siegel, 65 Ofer Calderon, 54 Eli Sharabi, 52 Itzik Elgarat, 70 Shlomo Mansour, 86 Ohad Yahalomi, 50 Oded Lifshitz, 84 Tsahi Idan, 50 Hisham al-Sayed, 36 Yarden Bibas, 35 Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36 Yair Horn, 46 Omer Wenkert, 23 Sasha Trufanov, 28 Eliya Cohen, 27 Or Levy, 34 Avera Mengistu, 38 Tal Shoham, 39 Omer Shem-Tov, 22 Ninety-four hostages abducted during the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas-led massacre are still being held in Gaza, at least one-third of them dead. The second phase of the agreement would see the release of the remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian terrorists held in Israeli jails, and an Israeli army withdrawal from almost all of the Gaza Strip. The 15-month long war was triggered by the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, massacre in the northwestern Negev in which terrorists killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted another 251 to the Gaza Strip, in the worst single-day attack against the Jewish people since the Holocaust.

Israeli security cabinet approves hostage deal with Hamas	The ceasefire is expected to go in effect at 12:15 p.m. on Sunday, with the first three hostages, women, to be freed around 4 p.m. By World Israel News and JNS Israel’s Security Cabinet met in Jerusalem on Friday and recommended that the full Cabinet approve the Gaza ceasefire deal with Hamas. The accord’s first stage is to see the phased release of 33 hostages—alive or dead—over a six-week period starting on Sunday, in return for the release of about 1,000 Palestinian terrorists from Israeli prisons. The names of the 33 hostages to be released in the first part of the negotiated agreement have been published. There is no indication which of the following hostages are still alive, and the medical condition of most is not yet known. The names are Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Ohad Ben Ami, the four members of the Bibas family, Yarden, Shiri, Ariel, Kfir, Agam Berger, and Romi Gonen. Other names include: Daniella Gilboa, Emily Damari, Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn, Omer Wenkert, Alexander Troufanov, Arbel Yehud, Ohad Yahalomi, Eliya Cohen, Or Levy, Naama Levy, Oded Lifshitz, Gadi Moshe Mozes, Avera Mengistu, Shlomo Mansour, Keith Samuel Siegel, Tsahi Idan, Ofer Calderon, Tal Shoham, Doron Steinbrecher, Omer Shem-Tov, Itzik Elgarat, Hisham al-Sayed, and Eli Sharabi. The first hostages expected to be released are the Bibas children and civilian women followed by IDF female soldiers, men over 50, as well as injured and ill captives. Israeli officials have warned that Hamas has shown itself untrustworthy and has engaged in psychological warfare in the past, therefore, there is no guarantee that Hamas will adhere to any plans to release hostages or that the names on the list will reflect the actual captives who are freed. The ceasefire is expected to go in effect at 12:15 p.m. on Sunday, with the first three hostages, women, to be freed around 4 p.m. Their names were slated to be revealed Saturday afternoon by Hamas, 24 hours before their release. Ninety-four hostages abducted during the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas-led massacre are still being held in Gaza, at least one-third of them dead. Two mentally ill Israelis who entered the Strip on their own are also being held by the terrorists, as are the bodies of two slain IDF soldiers. The second phase of the agreement would see the release of the remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian terrorists held in Israeli jails, and an Israeli army withdrawal from almost all of the Gaza Strip. The 15-month long war was triggered by the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 massacre in southern Israel which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw another 250 abducted to the Gaza Strip, in the single worst attack against the Jewish people since the Holocaust.

Israeli army initiates ‘proceedings’ against non-enlisted haredi ...	The military is reported to have sent 1,000 warrant notices that would prevent individuals who ignored draft orders from leaving the country. By Pesach Benson, TPS The Israel Defense Forces said on Friday morning it initiated unspecified 'proceedings' against Orthodox Jewish men who have not reported for enlistment. 'An IDF recruit who has not reported for enlistment in accordance with the provisions of the order he received will be considered to have committed an offense of unauthorized absence from service, and is expected to face criminal sanctions,' the army said. 'The IDF is the people’s army and acts professionally and state-wide to recruit all those required to enlist, in accordance with the law and the directives of the political echelon,' the army added. The IDF is investing great efforts to recruit ultra-Orthodox members under conditions that will allow them to maintain their lifestyle and beliefs.' The military is reported to have sent 1,000 warrant notices that would prevent individuals who ignored draft orders from leaving the country. IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi and Defense Minister Israel Katz are scheduled to brief the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively on the principles behind their plans to enlist Haredi men. Katz recently told the committee the rate of Haredim inducted into service should be raised gradually over time. Katz said his target goal was to have 50% of Israel’s draft-eligible Haredim serving in 2032. But committee chairman MK Yuli Edelstein said that Israel 'doesn’t have the time or the luxury to wait any longer. The army needs many fighters.' Said Edelstein, 'The committee I chair will only issue a law for recruitment in high numbers, one that will bring an increase in recruitment and appropriate sanctions' for draft evaders. The military began making plans to draft yeshiva students after Israel’s High Court of Justice ruled in June that exemptions for the Haredi community were illegal. The issue has not been resolved and is contributing to a coalition crisis. Military service is compulsory for all Israeli citizens. However, Israel’s first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, and the country’s leading rabbis agreed to a status quo that deferred military service for Haredi men studying in yeshivot, or religious institutions. At the time, no more than several hundred men were studying in yeshivot. However, the Orthodox community has grown significantly since Israel’s founding. In January 2023, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported that Haredim are Israel’s fastest-growing community and projected it would constitute 16% of the population by the end of the decade. According to the Israel Democracy Institute, the number of yeshiva students exceeded 138,000 in 2021. A recent survey found that the Israeli public is shifting decisively in favor of integrating Orthodox Jews into military service. The Israel Democracy Institute found that only 9% of Israelis support the current arrangement exempting Haredim from military service, a steep decline from 22% ten months earlier.

Ben-Gvir vows to quit coalition over ceasefire, but would rejoin ...	Otzma Yehudit controls six seats in the Knesset. By JNS National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir announced on Thursday that if the hostages deal is approved, the Otzma Yehudit ('Jewish Power') Party he leads would quit Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. He said his party would rejoin the government if the war was renewed. Flanked by members of his party, Ben-Gvir said that the deal means 'the end of the war before Hamas is beaten,' adding that he pleaded with the prime minister in a private meeting to jettison the prospective deal, which gives a 'prize to terror.' Calling it a 'reckless deal,' the Otzma Yehudit leader said the agreement will set free hundreds of murderous terrorists, pull the IDF from the Egypt-Gaza border and return thousands of terrorists to the northern Gaza Strip. 'The deal will, in fact, erase the achievements of the war,' he said. 'Otzma Yehudit, under my leadership, will not overthrow Netanyahu, nor will it act together with the Left and its goals against the government, but it will not be able to be part of a government that will approve a deal that is a huge reward for Hamas, and that may bring upon us the next October 7 disaster,' he said. Otzma Yehudit controls six seats in the Knesset. If Ben-Gvir pulls his party from the coalition, it will not topple the government as opposition leaders Yair Lapid, chairman of the Yesh Atid Party, and Benny Gantz, leader of the National Unity Party, both of whom support the deal, have promised Netanyahu political support if he should need it. Responding to Ben-Gvir, Lapid announced, 'I say to Benjamin Netanyahu, don’t be frightened and don’t be in terror. You will get whatever safety net you need to make the hostages deal. This is more important than any disagreements we have ever had.'

Prime Minister’s Office announces first group of hostages will be...	The PMO said the hostage release deal has been approved by both the security cabinet and the full cabinet. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Israeli Prime Minister's Office (PMO) announced Friday that the first group of hostages will be released on Sunday despite delays in approving the deal. The PMO said the hostage release deal has been approved by both the security cabinet and the full cabinet and added, 'the release of hostages can be carried out according to the planned outline,' which will involve the release of three civilian female hostages on Sunday. The security cabinet was meeting on Friday and the full government will convene and is expected to approve the deal. Following these approvals, the High Court will hear arguments opposing the deal, but it is not expected to interfere with its progress. Israel delayed a Cabinet vote on the hostage release and prisoner exchange agreement on Thursday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attributed the delay to a Hamas attempting to issue last-minute demands, while growing tensions within his government coalition fueled concerns over the agreement's implementation. Netanyahu's office accused Hamas of reneging on parts of the agreement in an attempt to gain further concessions. 'Hamas is backing out of the understandings and creating a last-minute crisis that prevents a settlement,' Netanyahu's office said. In a briefing Thursday, David Mencer, an Israeli government spokesman, said Hamas' new demands dealt with the deployment of Israeli forces in the Philadelphi corridor, the narrow strip bordering Egypt that Israeli troops seized in May. The ceasefire agreement has faced strong opposition from Netanyahu's coalition partners, whose support is crucial for the Israeli prime minister to maintain power. On Thursday, Israel's National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, threatened to resign from the government if the ceasefire is approved. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who had earlier threatened to leave the government, said he would consider supporting the first phase of the deal if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu provides written assurances that the war will continue until Hamas is eliminated, which would be a prerequisite for his party to remain in the coalition.

Hostage-ceasefire deal officially signed by Israel and Hamas	Netanyahu's pre-dawn statement and the anticipated government approval appear to clear the path for implementing the deal. By World Israel News and AP A ceasefire and hostage exchange deal has officially been signed by Israel, Hamas, the United States, and Qatari officials, marking a significant development in the ongoing conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed the agreement early Friday and stated that his political-security cabinet would convene to discuss and approve the terms, followed by a broader government meeting. Netanyahu's office released a statement, translated from Hebrew to English, outlining the next steps: 'The families of the hostages were informed a short while ago of the agreements by the Directorate for Hostages, Missing Persons, and Returnees in the Prime Minister’s Office. Additionally, the Prime Minister instructed the Coordinator for Prisoners and Missing Persons to coordinate preparations for the reception of the hostages upon their return to Israel.' The plan includes a temporary ceasefire in Gaza, the freeing of dozens of hostages held by Hamas, and the release of Palestinian terrorist prisoners held by Israel. It also paves the way for hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to what remains of their homes in the war-torn Gaza Strip. The ceasefire is expected to halt over 15 months of conflict between the two sides. While the Israeli government is set to vote on the measure Saturday, logistical and last-minute issues with Hamas have delayed the planned release of the first three hostages until Monday. Netanyahu emphasized that resolving the hostage situation has been a top priority for his administration. Netanyahu's pre-dawn statement and the anticipated government approval appear to clear the path for implementing the deal, which was mediated with significant involvement from the U.S. and Qatar. If successful, this agreement could serve as a critical step toward de-escalating tensions in the region. Israel had delayed a Cabinet vote Thursday on the long-awaited ceasefire deal that would pause the fighting in the Gaza Strip and release dozens of hostages. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed a last-minute dispute with Hamas for holding up the approval as rising tensions in Netanyahu's government coalition raised concerns about the implementation of the deal just a day after U.S. President Joe Biden and key mediator Qatar announced it was complete. That created a dual reality: War-weary Palestinians in Gaza, the relatives of hostages held in the enclave and world leaders all welcomed the result of months of painstaking diplomacy, even as Netanyahu postponed the Cabinet vote on the agreement that had been scheduled for Thursday until Friday, at the earliest. Netanyahu's office accused Hamas of reneging on parts of the agreement in an attempt to gain further concessions. 'Hamas is backing out of the understandings and creating a last-minute crisis that prevents a settlement,' Netanyahu's office said. In a briefing Thursday, David Mencer, an Israeli government spokesman, said Hamas’ new demands dealt with the deployment of Israeli forces in the Philadelphi corridor, the narrow strip bordering Egypt that Israeli troops seized in May. Hamas denied the claims, with Izzat al-Rishq, a senior Hamas official, saying the militant group 'is committed to the ceasefire agreement, which was announced by the mediators.' It wasn't clear to what extent the holdup in the approval of the deal — originally scheduled to go into effect Sunday — also reflected jockeying to keep Netanyahu's wobbly government together. The ceasefire agreement has drawn fierce resistance from Netanyahu's coalition partners, on whose support the Israeli prime minister depends to remain in power. On Thursday, Israel's national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, threatened to quit the government if Israel approves the ceasefire. The deal announced Wednesday would see scores of hostages held in Gaza released and a pause in fighting with a view to eventually wind down a 15-month war that has destabilized the Middle East and sparked worldwide protests. Hamas terrorists triggered the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border attack into Israel that killed some 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Netanyahu faces great domestic pressure to bring home the hostages, whose families have pleaded with Netanyahu to prioritize the release of their loved ones over politics. But Israeli divisions over the deal were on stark display Thursday, as Ben-Gvir, a key government coalition partner and Cabinet member, threatened to resign, saying the ceasefire was 'reckless' and would 'destroy all of Israel’s achievements.' The departure of Ben-Gvir's Jewish Power party would reduce the number of the ruling coalition’s seats in the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, from 68 to 62 — leaving Netanyahu's government with just the slimmest of majorities. Ben-Gvir said his party would return to the coalition if Israel resumes its war. Ben-Gvir's resignation would not bring down the government or derail the ceasefire deal. But the move destabilizes the Israeli government at a delicate moment and could lead to the government's collapse if Ben-Gvir is joined by other key Netanyahu allies. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, for instance, is vehemently opposed to the agreement and has demanded that Netanyahu promise to resume the war against Hamas after the first phase of the ceasefire as a condition of his party staying in the coalition. Under the deal reached Wednesday, 33 of some 100 hostages who remain in Gaza are set to be released over the next six weeks in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Israeli forces will pull back from many areas, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians would be able to return to what’s left of their homes, and there would be a surge of humanitarian assistance. The remainder of the hostages, including male soldiers, are to be released in a second — and much more difficult — phase that will be negotiated during the first. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal, while Israel has vowed to keep fighting until it dismantles the group and to maintain open-ended security control over the territory. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s Mideast envoy joined the talks in the final weeks, and both the outgoing administration and Trump’s team are taking credit for the breakthrough. Longer-term questions about postwar Gaza remain, including who will rule the territory or oversee the daunting task of reconstruction. Hamas has come under overwhelming pressure from Israel's invasion of Gaza’s largest cities and towns and seizure of the border between Gaza and Egypt. Its top leaders, including Yahya Sinwar, who was believed to have helped mastermind the 2023 attack, have been killed. But its fighters have regrouped in some of the hardest-hit areas after the withdrawal of Israeli forces, raising the prospect of a prolonged insurgency if the war continues.

Hostage mother may see one son return while the other remains in ...	She imagined the agonizing scenario of one of them being released and the other having to stay behind. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The announcement of the hostage release deal still waiting to be finalized was bittersweet for Ruth Strom, as one of her sons is slated for release during the first phase of the agreement while her other son remains a captive in Gaza. 'It is not easy for a mother to hear this,' Strom told Reuters. Her sons Iair (38) and Eitan (46) Horn were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7th. Iair was on the list of 33 hostages who would be released in the first stage of the deal. The fact that the first hostages to be released are women, children, older men, and those who require medical attention implies that Iair is being released because he may be unwell. Although Ruth had not heard updates about her sons, she said she believed they are being held together. She imagined the agonizing scenario of one of them being released and the other having to stay behind. 'But what will happen at the moment when they are separated and told that one is coming out and the other is not?' she said. 'I know that their strength is to be together, to be there for each other,' she told Reuters. Ninety-eight hostages are being held in Gaza, and it is believed that a number of them are no longer alive. Following the release of the initial 33, other hostages will be released through subsequent negotiations, and the details are uncertain. The only information Ruth has received about Iair and Eitan was from hostages who were released during the pause in fighting last November. 'They said that they were not injured,' she recounted. 'At first, they were held in an apartment but were later moved to the tunnels.' Strom said that, for comfort, she speaks to her sons as if they are with her. 'I ask them to wait just a little longer, it will happen and you will be back with us. I ask for their forgiveness, for all the time that has passed in which they are not back here.'

10 soldiers injured during training exercise in the Negev	Three soldiers were moderately wounded, and seven sustained light injuries after a weapon exploded during an exercise at the Engineering Corps Training Base in the Negev. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Ten soldiers were injured during a training exercise in the Negev. Three soldiers were moderately wounded, and seven sustained light injuries after a weapon exploded during an exercise at the Engineering Corps Training Base in the Negev. The soldiers had previously participated in a classroom lesson that included a display of Hezbollah weapons. At 9 am, one of the weapons exploded during a classroom session. The IDF announced that the incident is being investigated. The base commander and other officers evacuated the wounded and conducted a preliminary investigation. There was a 24-hour suspension in training to allow for a thorough investigation of the incident. Three Israeli soldiers were injured, two of them critically, during a counterterrorism operation in Qabatiya, near Jenin in northern Samaria, on Tuesday night, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The soldiers' vehicle was struck by a roadside bomb planted by Palestinian terrorists, the IDF reported. All three soldiers were evacuated to the hospital for treatment, and their families have been informed. In a separate incident, Israel conducted an airstrike in Jenin as part of its ongoing counterterrorism efforts in Judea and Samaria, according to the IDF and the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet). The Palestinian Health Ministry reported that the strike left six people dead and several others injured. Israeli officials have not provided additional details about the target or the results of the operation.

Trump Security Advisor says US will support additional military o...	Waltz: 'If they (Israel) need to go back in, we’re with them.' oven By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Trump's National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said the US would support additional military operations in Gaza if necessary and declared that Hamas must be destroyed. Waltz told Fox News,'We’ve made it very clear to the Israelis, and I want the people of Israel to hear me on this: If they need to go back in, we’re with them,' he said. 'If Hamas doesn’t live up to the terms of this agreement, we are with them.' Waltz praised the hostage release deal currently being finalized and gave the credit for the agreement to Donald Trump. 'Hamas is not going to continue as a military entity and it’s certainly not going to govern Gaza,' Waltz declared. Waltz reported that he heard that about 25 of the initial 33 hostages slated for release in the first phase are alive. 'I’m convinced they all would have died if President Trump didn’t come in and say ‘get them out,'' Waltz said. Waltz discussed the 'Trump Effect' and the President-elect's threat that there would be 'Hell to pay' if the hostages were not released before his inauguration on January 20th. 'Hamas knew… they had no choice and they believed President Trump when he said there would be all hell to pay, and any deal that was on the table would just get worse once he was in office.' On a podcast, Waltz said that Hamas must no longer have a role in Gaza and must be destroyed. 'Hamas cannot have a role. ISIS doesn’t have a role. Al Qaeda doesn’t have a role,' he stated. 'It astounds me that people try to put them in some kind of special category. These are hostage-taking, murderous, rapist torturers that never should ever have any role in governing.' 'We shouldn’t subject the Palestinian people to that either,' he affirmed. 'We’ll never get to a better future; we’ll never get to a truly stable region if we don’t carve up this cancer.'

Defense Secretary hid hospitalization while on medication that ca...	While Austin transferred authority of some of his duties to deputy Kathleen Hicks on January 2, Hicks did not learn Austin was hospitalized until two days later. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s decision last year to keep his hospitalization secret and remain in command while on medication that could affect brain function 'unnecessarily' increased national security risks, according to a Pentagon watchdog report. 'The risks to our national defense, including the command and control of the Defense Department's critical national security operations, were increased unnecessarily,' Inspector General Robert Storch said, though his investigation 'found no adverse consequences to Defense Department operations.' Austin was hospitalized on January 1, 2024, due to complications from a prostate cancer surgery in December and was transferred to the intensive care unit the following day. The defense secretary waited several days before informing his deputy Kathleen Hicks and President Joe Biden, according to the Wednesday report. 'Secretary Austin received several different medications during the morning of January 2 that had the potential to affect cognitive functions,' the inspector general wrote. While Austin transferred authority of some of his duties to Hicks on January 2, Hicks did not learn Austin was hospitalized until two days later. Neither Austin nor Hicks notified the White House or Congress in a 'timely manner' as required by the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, according to the inspector general. Austin also failed to transfer authorities on January 6 and 8 while undergoing medical procedures that required moderate sedation, the report noted. The defense secretary texted his chief of staff, Kelly Magsamen, that he did not want his medical condition to become 'a media circus.' 'I wish [Austin] were a normal person but he’s the [Secretary of Defense],' Magsamen wrote to another aide in a text message reviewed by the inspector general. 'We have a big institutional responsibility. He can't just go totally dark on his staff. … Please pass to him that we can’t keep his hospitalization a secret forever. It's kind of big deal for him to be in the [ICU]. And I'm worried sick.' Austin’s lack of transparency sparked a political uproar at the time, with President-elect Donald Trump calling for Austin to be 'fired immediately for improper professional conduct and dereliction of duty.' The general public was not notified of Austin's hospitalization until January 5.

Israeli Health Ministry publishes medical protocols for returning...	Each returned hostage will be cared for in specialized 'Returnee Wings' with private rooms for the hostages and their families. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel’s Health Ministry on Thursday released a detailed medical protocol for receiving hostages freed from Hamas captivity as the ceasefire agreement itself remained uncertain. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas of backtracking on the ceasefire agreement and has refused to convene the Cabinet to discuss it. 'Israel will not set a date for a cabinet and government meeting until the mediators announce that Hamas has approved all the details of the agreement.' The ceasefire, if approved, would take effect on Sunday. Thirty-three hostages — women, children, the elderly and the sick — would be freed in exchange for Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. The ministry’s plan outlines the stages of care, treatment, and long-term support to address the needs of the returnees. The Ichilov, Beilinson, Sheba, Assaf Harofeh hospitals in central Israel and the Barzilai and Soroka hospitals in the south were selected for their proximity to Gaza and in the south. While the ministry recommends a minimum hospitalization period of four days, the final decision will rest with the returnees and their families. Each returned hostage will be cared for in specialized 'Returnee Wings' with private rooms for the hostages and their families. Military representatives will have designated spaces within these wings. Separate general areas for larger gatherings will be established to avoid overcrowding in the main corridors. The ministry’s plan includes a long-term support framework for each returnee, led by a team of primary care physicians, nurses, specialists, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, dietitians, and forensic physicians. Together, they will devise personalized treatment plans. Social workers and mental health professionals will assess psychological needs with an eye toward reintegrating the returnees into normal life. Forensic physicians will collect and document medical-legal evidence related to the captivity. Outpatient clinics will be established to provide continuous medical and emotional support after the returnees are discharged. In December, a Health Ministry report detailed severe physical and psychological abuse suffered by hostages freed during a November 2023 temporary ceasefire. The report — the first comprehensive account of hostages’ experiences — found that the captives, including children, were subjected to extreme conditions, including sexual assaults, prolonged periods in darkness, physical beatings, and starvation. Many were bound hand and foot and deprived of adequate food and water. Several were burned or branded with heated metal. Medical care was either withheld or administered without pain relief, resulting in excruciating suffering during procedures, including surgeries, the report found. Hostages were also denied basic hygiene and often forced to soil themselves due to prolonged waits for toilet access. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 95 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

NVIDIA to launch $500 million AI data center in Israel	Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden has included Israel in a restrictive category of countries for the export of advanced graphics processors, in a blow to the industry. By JNS American technology giant NVIDIA announced on Wednesday that it is establishing a new artificial intelligence research and engineering data center in Israel. The Santa Clara, California-based corporation said that the $500 million, 10,000 square meter facility will be one of the largest and most advanced data-center labs in Israel. The data center, which is currently under construction near the northern Israeli city of Yokneam, focuses on advancing next generation data technologies, including networking hardware, software, CUP design and AI applications. It is set to begin operations in the first half of the year. The company has a large R&D presence in Israel, where thousands of employees run seven labs. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden has included Israel in a restrictive category of countries for the export of advanced graphics processors, in a blow for the industry. The move, which was taken during the last week of his administration and is due to take effect in 120 days, seeks to balance U.S. national security concerns with economic interests, and could hamper 120 countries, including Israel, from competing in AI. NVIDIA on Monday condemned the move as 'sweeping overreach' by the administration.

Major European carriers to resume Israel flights in February	Hungary-based Wizzair has already resumed flights, while Ireland’s Ryanair is due to renew service this spring, returning to a full schedule in the summer. By JNS The Lufthansa Group of airlines announced Thursday that it will resume service to Israel next month. The move by the global aviation group, which includes Lufthansa, Swiss International Airlines, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, ITA Airways, and Eurowings, comes as an increasing number of foreign airlines are renewing flights to Ben-Gurion International Airport as regional tensions de-escalate. British Airways and Air France are expected to follow suit. The three major U.S. legacy carriers are still not flying to Israel. United and American Airlines suspended flights to Israel indefinitely, while Delta is scheduled to resume flights to Tel Aviv in April. United and Delta sought to restart flights to Israel periodically over the last year, only to extend the suspension of service following flareups in the war, while American Airlines has stayed away entirely. A United spokesperson told JNS on Wednesday that the company had no news to offer yet on the renewal of flights. Lufthansa will operate daily flights between Frankfurt and Munich, and Israel, starting on Feb. 1, Swiss will offer daily flights to Zurich, Austrian Airlines will run daily service to Vienna, Brussels Airlines will have three weekly flights, and Eurowings will fly twice weekly to Düsseldorf. The gradual resumption of flights is expected to accelerate in the spring. Renewed service by major European airlines follows the resumption of service by popular low-cost carriers. Hungary-based Wizzair has already resumed flights, while Ireland’s Ryanair is due to renew service this spring, returning to a full schedule in the summer. January and February are typically the slowest months for travel to Israel. Some 48,000 passengers passed through Ben-Gurion International Airport on Thursday on more than 300 international flights, including 25,600 departing Israel and 22,400 arriving, according to the Israel Airports Authority.

Deri: Israel-Hamas deal back on track	The agreement is still expected to go into effect at 12:15 p.m. on Sunday, the official said. By JNS The hostage deal with Hamas is on, Aryeh Deri, the chairman of Israel’s ultra-Orthodox Shas Party who previously served as an observer on the War Cabinet, announced on Thursday night. 'A few minutes ago, I received the final word that all obstacles have been overcome and that the agreement is underway,' the Sephardic haredi politician declared in a speech at his party’s annual conference in Jerusalem. 'Now they are working on the final technical wording. 'I want to congratulate Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu; he is responsible for the agreement,' Deri told attendees. Minutes after Deri’s announcement, the Axios news outlet cited a U.S. government source as confirming that the final disputes holding up the ceasefire-for-hostages-and-terrorists-release deal were resolved, 'and the agreement is now done.' The Israeli Security Cabinet is now scheduled to meet on Friday morning to green-light the deal with Hamas, followed by a vote in the full Cabinet, an Israeli official told the Kan News public broadcaster. The agreement is still expected to go into effect at 12:15 p.m. on Sunday, the official said. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters during a press conference in Washington that the Biden administration likewise remains 'confident' that the deal will be implemented on Sunday. 'I fully expect that implementation will begin, as we said, on Sunday. Look, it’s not exactly surprising that in a process, in a negotiation, that has been this challenging, this fraught, you may get a loose end,' he said. 'We’re tying up that loose end as we speak; I’ve been on the phone, in one way or another, all morning with [U.S. National Security Council Coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa] Brett McGurk, with our Qatari friends, and I am very confident this is moving forward,' Blinken said. Earlier on Thursday, U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' that the White House was aware of eleventh-hour issues with the Hamas-Israel hostage agreement but remained confident that the ceasefire could still be implemented. The Prime Minister’s Office in Jerusalem had accused the Palestinian terrorist organization of backtracking on parts of the deal signed on Wednesday, 'in an effort to extort last-minute concessions.' 'We’re aware of these issues that the prime minister has raised today, this afternoon, their time, and we’re working through that,' the Biden administration official said of Netanyahu’s earlier announcement that Hamas reneged on parts of the agreement that was reached in Doha. Thirty-three hostages, living and dead, out of the 98 held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 468 days are set to be freed during the first phase of the deal, in exchange for 1,000 Palestinian terrorists jailed by Israel. (The 33 freed captives are to include nine ill and wounded hostages who will be released in exchange for the release of 110 Palestinian terrorists serving life sentences.) The Israel Defense Forces is to withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor along Gaza’s border with Egypt. The withdrawal is to begin on the 42nd day of the first phase, after the release of the final (33rd) hostage for the phase, and is to be completed by the 50th day. Israeli Minister for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism Amichai Chikli, a member of Netanyahu’s Likud Party, announced on Thursday night that he will resign from his position 'if there is a withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor (before the war goals are achieved), or if we do not return to fighting to achieve the war goals.' 'This deal is difficult to digest and involves heavy prices. Therefore, as was the case with the previous vote, I will make my final decision only after the full details of the deal are presented,' Chikli wrote on X. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich’s Religious Zionism Party previously signaled its seven Knesset members would consider exiting the coalition over the ceasefire deal. Smotrich has demanded that Netanyahu commit to resuming the war to dismantle Hamas and secure the release of all hostages following the deal’s first phase. This commitment is a condition for the party’s continued presence in the government and coalition.

Smotrich may back first phase of hostage deal if Israel resumes w...	Smotrich threatened earlier to leave the government over his opposition to the hostage release deal. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has indicated that he may remain in the government and back the first phase of the hostage deal if Israel resumes the war against Hamas immediately after that. Smotrich, who leads the Religious Zionist party, threatened earlier to leave the government over his opposition to the hostage release deal. On Thursday, Smotrich said he would potentially support the first phase if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu provides written assurances that the war will continue until Hamas is eliminated as a prerequisite for his party remaining in the coalition. Although the Prime Minister's Office indicated the guarantees could be provided, Smotrich said key issues have not yet been resolved. In a statement, the Religious Zionist Party said, 'The faction supports the demands of party chairman, Minister Bezalel Smotrich, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ensure Israel resumes its fight against Hamas and secures the release of all hostages.' It continued, 'They call for a revised strategy aimed at achieving a decisive victory, to be implemented immediately after the first phase of the agreement. This is a key condition for the party's continued participation in the government and coalition.' Religious Zionist Party MK Tzvi Succot told public broadcaster Kan Radio on Thursday morning, 'I think the chances are high that we will leave the government.' Last month, Smotrich expressed strong opposition to the potential hostage-for-prisoner deal. Smotrich told Kol Barama radio, 'Hamas is at its weakest point since the war began.' 'This is not the moment to offer it any reprieve. We must continue to apply pressure and defeat it, ensuring that the hostages are returned under terms that demonstrate its surrender, not ours,' he added. Smotrich continued, 'Deals that involve releasing hundreds of terrorist murderers, who will return to killing Jews, or agreements that see us withdrawing from northern Gaza and allowing a million Gazans to come back and undo the hard-earned progress we’ve made with so much bloodshed—those are grave mistakes. 'If we weren’t negotiating with Hamas and instead focused solely on targeting them with our sights, tank fire, airstrikes, and the efforts of our heroic fighters, the hostages would have been freed long ago.'

‘We’re back to October 6’ – IDF is building wall around Sderot	The protective barrier near the Gaza border shows that the old security perception hasn’t changed, angry residents said. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Residents of Gaza envelope communities are enraged over the IDF beginning to build a high stone wall near Sderot, saying that this proves that the army has not changed its old and failed security perceptions, Channel 12 reported Thursday. 'As soon as I saw the wall,’ said a resident of the city whose son was murdered along with 1,200 others during the Hamas invasion last October 7, 'I realized that nothing has changed nor will change here. We’re back to October 6.' Yarin Sultan, a member of the Israel Envelope Forum, also sharply criticized the move to the Hebrew-language media outlet. It is, she said, 'another link in a chain of conceptual failures. The state continues to cling to outdated approaches that are satisfied with cosmetic treatment [of the problem] and do not provide real security to the residents of the south.' 'Walls did not stop the Nukhba terrorists from penetrating through them and slaughtering children, the elderly, and raping women, so why should they succeed this time?' she added. The government must 'act differently and commit to real security,' Sultan said. 'We demand a fundamental solution that will convey strength and determination, not walls that hide the problem and don’t solve it once and for all.' The army said in response that the wall was being built so that train service can recommence to the town. 'The IDF is working on a variety of efforts to enable the return of the train, including tailored military operations and an ongoing situation assessment,' its spokesperson told Channel 12 in a statement. 'This is with the understanding that this is an important strategic national infrastructure and a central factor in the process of restoring the western Negev.' 'Protective work is currently being carried out to strengthen the defense layer in a way that will allow safe travel by train. The IDF is working and will continue to work to return the residents to their homes safely.' All the residents of the Gazan envelope who survived the Hamas onslaught were immediately evacuated as Israel declared war on the terrorist rulers of the Gaza Strip. Many lived for about a year in hotels and other accommodations paid for by the government. Most returned gradually to the area when it was declared safe by the IDF, attempting to rebuild their former lives. These included most of the residents of Sderot, a city of 33,000 that suffered the loss of some three dozen people, 20 of them police officers, on the day of the invasion.

Palestinian Authority: Israel ‘whines about 100 hostages’	Palestinian terrorists held in Israel have excellent prison conditions and regular visits from the International Red Cross. By Palestinian Media Watch The hundreds of families being emotionally tortured by Hamas as they wait the return of their loved ones who were kidnapped over 15 months ago are 'whining,' according to the official Palestinian Authority daily. The PA has defended, glorified, and celebrated the October 7 atrocities. It has now added an additional component to its terror support by disparaging Israel's criticism of Hamas' holding the hostages. And to 'prove' its point, the PA says the ones who are truly suffering are Palestinian prisoners detained under due process for acts of terrorism because they are held in 'camps of barbarous Israel, which are worse than Hitler's fascist Holocaust furnaces.' 'The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs has turned the facts upside down&#8230; It whines about 100 hostages and ignores thousands of Palestinian detainees who have had the most despicable sadistic methods implemented against them in the fortresses and detention camps of barbarous Israel, which are worse than Hitler's fascist Holocaust furnaces in World War II.' [Regular columnist Omar Hilmi Al-Ghoul, Official PA daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, Dec. 25, 2024] This hate-speech, which is a staple of PA propaganda, both completely scoffs at the suffering of the Israeli hostages in Gaza and odiously abuses the Holocaust's memory. There is no equivalence between the horrific conditions of Israeli hostages held in dungeon-like underground tunnels with no light and scarce food who face fear of torture, rape, and even murder on a daily basis. Palestinian terrorists held in Israel have excellent prison conditions and regular visits from the International Red Cross. The suggestion that those Palestinian prisoners endure conditions worse than in Nazi death camps is not only absurd and insulting to the Jewish people, but these dangerous PA libels are now echoed internationally, fueling antisemitism and attacks on Jews worldwide.

JVP, according to federal prosecutors, applied for and received a second-draw loan and loan forgiveness under the Paycheck Protection Program, which was not open to groups primarily engaged in political advocacy. By Alana Goodman, The Washington Free Beacon Jewish Voice for Peace, the prominent anti-Israel group that's organized illegal protests attacking the Jewish state, committed federal loan fraud to obtain a six-figure COVID relief check, the Department of Justice announced. JVP falsely portrayed itself as a non-political group to obtain over $300,000 in federal paycheck protection funding, federal prosecutors said in a press release. It was forced to pay $677,634 to the federal government to settle the allegations under the False Claims Act. The news comes as JVP faces suspensions on college campuses for organizing pro-Hamas rallies. Lawmakers have also called on the IRS to revoke JVP’s tax-exempt status, arguing that the group has supported illegal encampments at universities and 'has a history of sharing antisemitic tropes, expressing support for violence and terrorism, and vilifying Zionism and Zionists.' Just days after Hamas's Oct. 7 terror attack, meanwhile, JVP organized an illegal protest in which activists infiltrated the Capitol and accused Israel of 'genocide.' JVP, according to federal prosecutors, applied for and received a second-draw loan and loan forgiveness under the Paycheck Protection Program, which was not open to groups primarily engaged in political advocacy. As part of the application process, JVP claimed it was 'not a business concern or entity primarily engaged in political or lobbying activities.' However, an 'investigation revealed that [JVP] was primarily engaged in political activities,' according to the DOJ. In response to the allegations, the group told authorities its false claims were 'inadvertent' and agreed to repay double the loan amount to avoid civil charges and additional financial penalties. George Soros's Open Society Foundations has given JVP at least $650,000 since 2017 to fund 'human rights' work in the Middle East. JVP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 'The Paycheck Protection Act Program existed to help businesses survive a devastating global pandemic,' said U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves. 'When business owners unfairly drain those funds—either by not reading the eligibility requirements or disregarding them—they put the entire program at risk.'

Anti-deal protestors block entrance to Jerusalem	Demonstrations are planned for Thursday night at intersections throughout the country as Cabinet vote on deal is delayed. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israelis who feel that the announced hostage deal with Hamas endangers the country and is a death sentence for those not released in the first phase demonstrated Thursday morning at the main entrance to Jerusalem, causing massive traffic jams. The protestors marched on the street to the Bridge of Strings carrying fake coffins draped in Israeli flags and chanting, 'We don’t leave hostages behind.' Hundreds blocked the Bridge of Strings intersection Wednesday night as well, chanting, 'We will not make a deal with the devil.' In the evening protest, clashes broke out with police officers who were trying to clear the road, with protestors shouting at them in anger over being treated differently than those blocking roads in support of hostage deals, whom the police have largely left alone. Both crowds were led by the Heroes Forum and Tikva (Hope) Forum, whose members are families of soldiers who have fallen in the 15-month-long war and families of Hamas hostages, respectively, who have been demanding for months that the government stick to its stated war goal of destroying Hamas as the only way to bring all the hostages home. Bereaved families and their supporters even slept overnight on the street in front of the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem after the hostage deal was announced, to begin the protest against the agreement. In asking in the morning for others to join them, Heroes Forum chairman Yehoshua Shani said, 'We call from here on the Prime Minister, on the entire Cabinet, to stop at the last moment. Don’t sign a deal that means surrender, abandoning the remaining hostages and undermining Israel's security.' Referring to several rows of fake, flag-covered coffins that had been set up on a nearby sidewalk, he said that the result of this deal will mean 'more and more soldiers will be in such coffins.' 'Members of the government,' he added, 'it is up to you to stop the catastrophe.' The Cabinet was supposed to meet at 11AM to vote on the deal, which led to the morning demonstration, but due to last-minute concessions demanded by Hamas, it has been postponed to Thursday evening. The Forums are calling on the public to come in their masses to demonstrations at intersections throughout the country at 7:30 pm to express their opposition to the deal.

Joy, relief, and division: Israel reacts to hostage deal	The Cabinet is due to meet on Thursday morning to approve the agreement. Qatari leaders said the ceasefire would take force on Sunday. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Israel was gripped by a whirlwind of emotions on Wednesday night following the announcement of a deal to release Israeli hostages held by Hamas Political leaders and families of the captives reacted with joy, relief, and some apprehension. Haredi party leader and Minister of Housing and Construction Rabbi Yitzchak Goldknopf of Agudat Israel expressed support for the deal in a tweet framing the issue as a moral imperative. 'With God’s help, I will once again fulfill the mitzvah [religious commandment] of redeeming captives, supporting the Prime Minister’s responsibly led deal while safeguarding Israel’s security interests. We are waiting for you!' MK Benny Gantz, head of the opposition’s Unity Party echoed the sentiment. 'It is simply the only way forward,' Gantz tweeted. Gantz also extended appreciation to outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, crediting the latter with a 'critical role' in finalizing the agreement. 'We must now ensure Gaza never again rebuilds as a terrorist haven,' Gantz added. Another opposition member, Yesh Atid party MK Debbi Biton shared her gratitude, retweeting Trump’s announcement of the deal and adding, 'Thank you, Donald, the son of Fred!' But Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, the leader of the Religious Zionism party called the agreement 'bad and dangerous for Israel’s national security.' While acknowledging the joy bringing captives home, Smotrich warned that the agreement could undo the war’s gains and the sacrifices of soldiers. 'We oppose it with full force,' Smotrich said. He emphasized that resuming the war to destroy Hamas and return the rest of the hostages was a condition for his party’s continued participation in the government. Hope, Anxiety and Protests The Hostages and Missing Families Forum greeted the deal with 'overwhelming joy and relief.' A statement issued by the Forum thanked international mediators and U.S. leaders for their efforts. But the Forum stressed, 'We urgently call for swift arrangements to ensure all phases of the deal are carried out. We will not rest until we see the last hostage back home.' In contrast, the Hope Forum, also representing hostage families, voiced sharp criticism. Labeling the deal as dangerous, it warned agreement would 'abandon dozens of hostages' and pave the way for future attacks. 'This agreement risks those left behind in captivity and threatens the entire nation of Israel,' the Forum said. It called for an alternative agreement to free all the hostages at once. Anger and opposition was most palpable among bereaved families, who staged protests outside the Prime Minister’s Office. Under the leadership of Yehoshua Shani, the Valor Forum set up tents and declared a 'national emergency.' Shani described the deal as 'a disaster in the making' that endangers Israel’s security by leaving 70 hostages behind. 'We demand the government halt this agreement and ensure the safety of the nation,' he stated in a video appeal. The Cabinet is due to meet on Thursday morning to approve the agreement. Qatari leaders said the ceasefire would take force on Sunday. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 95 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Netanyahu faces political crisis as Smotrich weighs coalition exi...	National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir is also threatening to pull his Otzma Yehudit Party from Netanyahu’s coalition over the deal and has called for Smotrich to join him. By Joshua Marks, JNS Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich’s Religious Zionism Party signaled on Thursday it would likely exit Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition over the ceasefire agreement with Hamas. The party convened Thursday morning to deliberate on its role in the governing coalition ahead of a likely cabinet vote on the agreement, according to Hebrew media reports, although the Prime Minister’s Office announced in the morning that the vote had been postponed due to Hamas reneging on parts of the deal. 'The Israeli Cabinet will not convene until the mediators notify Israel that Hamas has accepted all elements of the agreement,' according to the PMO. A party official called the crisis 'serious and real,' according to Channel 12 News. Knesset member Zvi Sukkot earlier told Israel’s Reshet Bet radio that Religious Zionism was likely to leave the government. He emphasized that the party aims to 'transform the DNA of the State of Israel' rather than simply hold positions in the coalition. Smotrich has openly opposed the agreement, which was announced on Wednesday, as a 'surrender deal' and a 'catastrophe' for the Jewish state. He has reportedly set conditions to stay in the government should the agreement be approved, including a government commitment to the dismantling of Hamas and renewing the fighting in Gaza following the ceasefire. He participated in closed-door meetings with Netanyahu on Tuesday and Wednesday. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir is also threatening to pull his Otzma Yehudit Party from Netanyahu’s coalition over the deal and has called for Smotrich to join him. Meanwhile, Israeli leaders from both sides of the political aisle came out in favor of the hostage deal announced on Wednesday. Yair Lapid, leader of the opposition and chairman of the Yesh Atid Party, said: 'An entire country isn’t breathing tonight. We are all waiting, and we are all praying. But we cannot stop now, and the deal cannot end in its first part. I promise as I promised in the past a [political] safety net [for Netanyahu] until the last moment, until the last hostage. Everyone must return home.' Benny Gantz, chairman of the National Unity Party, stated that 'securing the release of the hostages from the arms of the murderous terror organization Hamas is a top moral and strategic imperative. It is simply the only way forward.' He extended thanks to the negotiators in Israel, Egypt and Qatar; to outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden; and to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. 'As President Trump said, we must now ensure Gaza never again rebuilds as a terrorist haven and continues to threaten the State of Israel,' said Gantz.

Simcha and Leah Goldin – Netanyahu has abandoned our son	Soldiers Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul, whose bodies were abducted in 2014’s Operation Protective Edge, are reportedly not included in the hostage deal. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The parents of Lieut. Hadar Goldin have charged the prime minister with abandoning their son 'for good' after reports emerged that his body was not included in the hostage deal with Hamas that was announced Wednesday. 'For ten years, it was made clear to us that the [Palestinian] prisoners released in the Gilad Shalit deal who were returned to prison during Operation Protective Edge would not be released except in exchange for Hadar and Oron,' Simcha and Leah Goldin said. In 2011, Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who had been grabbed five years earlier by Hamas terrorists who attacked his tank near the Gazan border, was released in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners, including the future leader of Hamas and mastermind of last October 7’s terrorist invasion in which 1,200 people were massacred and the current hostages were abducted. Several dozen of the released Palestinians were caught in subsequent years after returning to their terrorist activity. 'Now Netanyahu is releasing the terrorists who were returned to prison and not returning Hadar and Oron. For us, Hadar and Oron have been abandoned for good,' the bereaved parents continued. Sgt. Oron Shaul’s body was abducted on July 20, 2014, shortly after the Operation against Hamas began, when in fighting in Shejaya in northern Gaza, terrorists fired an anti-tank missile at his armored personnel carrier, killing all those inside. Less than two weeks later, Lieut. Goldin was killed while on patrol in the southern Gaza town of Rafah. Hamas terrorists grabbed his body and disappeared into a tunnel with it. The Goldins’ conclusion was stark: 'Hamas cares for its terrorists more than Netanyahu cares for his soldiers. Benjamin, not Yoni.' Yonatan (Yoni) Netanyahu led the famed IDF raid on the Entebbe airport in 1976 to rescue 94 Jewish passengers who were being held hostage by terrorists of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), who had hijacked their Air France plane and diverted it to Uganda. He was the only soldier to die in the operation, which was posthumously named for him. One elderly hostage, who had been taken to the hospital, was murdered in revenge afterward. Two other Israelis, both psychologically impaired, who have been held alive in Gaza for years, are included in the current deal. Avera Mengistu, who is Ethiopian, and Hisham al-Sayed, a Bedouin, were seized by Hamas in 2014 and 2015 respectively after wandering into the coastal enclave on their own. In June 2022 Hamas released a video showing Al-Sayed in a hospital bed with an oxygen mask and an IV drip in his arm. In January 2023, the terrorists released an undated video message that included Mengistu briefly asking how long he would remain a prisoner 'after so many years of pain and suffering.' Likud MK Tsega Melaku told Israel National News Thursday that she had received an excited and emotional phone call from Mengistu’s mother saying that 'official sources' had informed her that her son was to be released along with the other Hamas hostages. The Goldins, who have tirelessly campaigned throughout the years of operations against Hamas that no ceasefire deal should be signed unless the terrorists return their son and Shaul’s bodies, have largely kept out of the media during the current war.

Hamas demanding last-minute changes, deal not yet final	Prime Minister's office says Israeli negotiators told to 'stand firm' in the face of 'last-minute extortion attempts' by Hamas. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror group is demanding last-minute concessions be added to the ceasefire and hostage deal, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a media statement. Despite announcements from U.S. officials and the Qatari government that a deal had been reached, Netanyahu stressed that an agreement has not yet been finalized. 'Prime Minister Netanyahu held a conference call a short while ago with the negotiation team in Doha, who reported to him on last-minute attempts by Hamas to backtrack from the understandings of May 27,' read a statement from his office released in the early hours of Thursday morning. 'Among other things – contrary to a specific clause that grants Israel the veto power over the release of mass murderers who are symbols of terrorism - Hamas is demanding to dictate the identities of these terrorists. The Prime Minister instructed the negotiation team to stand firm on the agreed-upon understandings and to reject outright Hamas's last-minute attempts at extortion,' the statement added. Notably, Netanyahu has not yet invited the war cabinet to a meeting to vote on the deal. That meeting, which was expected to take place on Wednesday morning, appears to have been delayed as negotiators in Qatar continue discussions. Political considerations for the survival of the existing coalition may also be a reason behind the delayed vote. The Religious Zionism party, led by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, has expressed vehement opposition to the deal in its current form. Zvi Sukkot, a Religious Zionism MK, said that the party would likely withdraw from the government if the deal is approved, which would trigger a new round of elections. Opposition parties, including the Islamist Ra'am party, have pledged to vote in favor of the deal, all but guaranteeing it will be passed by the Knesset - even without the Religious Zionism party's votes.

‘End of Gaza genocide’ welcomed by the Squad	Squad members Ilhan Omar and Ayana Pressley welcome ceasefire, blame Israel for humanitarian crisis in Gaza. By World Israel News Staff Far-left, progressive lawmakers welcomed the news of a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal, while slamming Israel for its prosecution of the war. Anti-Israel lawmaker Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) drew a moral equivalency between the plight of Israelis kidnapped from their homes and Palestinian prisoners convicted of serious terror offenses, including murderer. 'I’m relieved to see hostages and Palestinian detainees being released as part of the deal, bringing much-needed comfort to their families who have endured so much,' Omar wrote on X. 'We must permanently end the genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza, humanitarian aid needs to increase exponentially to avoid continued suffering,' she added. 'And work toward a just and lasting peace and self-determination for the Palestinian people.' Notably, Omar ignored the fact that Hamas stole and stockpiled the vast majority of humanitarian aid entering the Strip, then sold the goods to hungry Gazans at exorbitant prices. Rep. Ayana Pressley (D-MA), another member of the Squad, said the ceasefire was the first step to healing for members of her district who had been impacted by the conflict. In a media statement, Pressley expressed sympathy with the families who have been 'grieving for the 1,200 Israelis murdered by Hamas, for the tens of thousands of civilians killed in the genocide in Gaza unleashed by the Israeli military and aided by U.S. dollars, for the hostages yet to be reunited with their loved ones and those who have died in captivity, and for the death and destruction Palestinians have been subjected to for over a year.' Rep. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), a Jewish progressive lawmaker who has long been critical of the Israeli government, released a media statement 'welcoming' the 'long overdue' ceasefire. Sanders added 'there must be accountability for the many war crimes committed by both sides in this terrible conflict.'

Israel expects ‘dozens of corpses’ among first freed hostages	Some of the families of the hostages will be 'surprised' to discover that their loved ones were murdered. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli authorities are expecting 'dozens' of dead bodies to be returned to Israel, during the first phase of a ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas that appears to be imminent. On Wednesday, president-elect Donald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas had okayed an agreement, which would see a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of some of the Israeli hostages held by the terror group for more than 15 months. Notably, the first stage of the deal will see Hamas return 33 hostages to Israel - but it's unclear how many of those captives are still alive. A report from Hebrew-language outlet Walla noted that some of the families of the hostages will be 'surprised' to discover that their loved ones were murdered. 'According to what we understand, dozens of abductees will return as corpses. Alongside the great joy of families who will celebrate with their loved ones after returning from captivity alive, there will be families shattered by this, and we will provide them with the necessary help,' officials told Walla. The officials stressed that being able to give their loved ones a proper burial in Israel would provide much-needed closure to the families of slain hostages. The State of Israel will provide logistical and psychological support to families during the process of finally laying their loved ones to rest, officials said. 'This is our mission, and we will do our duty to the families. We should expect to see difficult scenes with coffins [returned to Israel],' they said. 'It is going to be difficult, but just as we managed on October 7, we will do everything in the most sensitive way and give each kidnapped person the respect they deserve with a dignified burial,' they added. Although the deal has been widely touted by American and Qatari officials, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu still has not officially announced that the deal has been finalized.

‘Gaza is victorious, Israel lost’ – Iran celebrates ceasefire	Gaza ceasefire is a 'defeat for the monstrous Zionist regime,' says IRGC in a media statement. By World Israel News Staff Iran's leadership and military forces celebrated the Gaza ceasefire on Thursday, releasing jubilant messages that describe the end of the fighting as a major blow to Israel. 'It will be written in books that there was a mob who once killed thousands of children &#038; women in Gaza! Everyone will realize it was the patience of the people &#038; steadfastness of Palestinian Resistance &#038; Resistance Front that forced Zionist regime to retreat,' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wrote in English and Hebrew posts on his official X account, alongside the hashtag #GazaIsVictorious.' The IRGC welcomed the ceasefire in a statement published by the state-controlled Tasnim news agency, characterizing the deal as a 'defeat' for Israel. 'The end of the war [marks] a great victory for Palestine, and an even greater defeat for the monstrous Zionist regime,' the statement read. 'It brings joy, vitality, and resilience to the people of Gaza as they return to their homes.' Mohammed Abdusalam, a spokesperson for the Iranian-backed Houthi terror group, congratulated Hamas on the ceasefire. 'We salute Gaza's legendary and historic resilience in the face of Israel's fiercest aggression against the oppressed Palestinian people,' Abdusalam said in a media statement. 'With its continued occupation of Palestine, [Israel] represents a threat to the security and stability of the region.' The Houthis have repeatedly attacked Israel in recent months, claiming that its explosive drone and ballistic missile launches were in solidarity with Gaza. It's unclear if the ceasefire will mean an end to the Houthi aggression against the Jewish State. While world leaders have hailed the ceasefire deal, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stressed that the agreement is not yet final. In a statement, Netanyahu's office said Hamas is attempting 'last-minute' changes to the deal. The Israeli government will not sign off on the agreement until all details are finalized, his office said.

Who are the American hostages kidnapped by Hamas?	Sagui Dekel-Chen and Keith Siegel expected to be released in first round of hostage release and ceasefire agreement. By World Israel News Staff Two Americans are among the first 33 hostages expected to be freed from Hamas captivity after a ceasefire deal comes into effect. There are seven Americans still held by the terror group, with only three of them believed to be alive. Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, and Keith Siegel, 65, are on the list of the hostages Hamas will release as part of the first phase of the agreement. Dekel-Chen was last heard from around 9:30 a.m. on October 7th, after he joined his kibbutz's emergency response team to fight off invading Hamas terrorists. Little is known about Dekel-Chen's physical condition. Notably, as a man under the age of 50, his release in the first phase of the deal indicates that he is sick or wounded. Siegel, who appeared in a recent Hamas propaganda video, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Kfar Aza alongside his wife, Aviva. She was released in a hostage deal in December 2023. 'I just don’t know what kind of Keith that we’re going to get back,' Aviva Siegel told Fox News in December. 'I’m worried about all the hostages, because the conditions that they are in are the worst conditions that any human being could go through,' she said. 'I was there. I touched death. I know what it feels being underneath the ground with no oxygen.' Edan Alexander, 20, a U.S.-born IDF soldier, will not be released until the second phase of the deal. Negotiations over that stage of the agreement are slated to begin two weeks after the ceasefire is implemented. Itay Chen, Omer Neutra, and married couple Gadi and Judi Haggai are all confirmed to have been murdered on October 7th. Chen and Netura were IDF soldiers killed while attempting to stave off the terror onslaught. The Haggais were murdered in their kibbutz by terrorists while out for a Saturday morning walk. All four of their bodies were kidnapped to the Gaza Strip.

Trump’s National Security Advisor: ‘Hamas is a cancer that must b...	Waltz on Hamas: 'We'll never get to a truly stable region if we don't carve up this cancer.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News President-elect Donald Trump's National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz, said that Hamas has no role to play in post-war Gaza and that the terror group must be destroyed to the extent that it can never rebuild. Speaking on the Call Me Back podcast with Dan Senor on Wednesday, Waltz said, 'We've been clear that Gaza has to be fully demilitarized, Hamas has to be destroyed to the point that it cannot reconstitute, and that Israel has every right to fully protect itself.' 'Hamas cannot have a role. ISIS doesn't have a role. Al Qaeda doesn't have a role,' he stated, adding, 'It astounds me that people try to put them in some kind of special category. These are hostage-taking, murderous, rapist, torturers that never should ever have any role in governing,' he added. 'We shouldn't subject the Palestinian people to that either,' he affirmed, further saying, 'We'll never get to a better future; we'll never get to a truly stable region if we don't carve up this cancer.' Waltz emphasized that Hamas shouldn't be 'rewarded' for kidnapping American citizens. 'There are terrorist groups and rogue states that have been taking Americans hostages, and they have only seen upsides,' Waltz said. However, Waltz said that in Trump's case, 'he made it very clear there would only be downsides.' He added that the terror group may find that things will get worse for them with Trump in office. 'After January 20, any deal that they thought was on the table is only going to get worse.' 'This is about imposing consequences for those who would do this type of horrendous act like we saw on October 7 who would take Americans or allies hostages.' 'I don't like any deal with these sick evil sons of whatever, and we should never ever reward the horrendous acts of October 7.' Trump repeatedly warned that there would be 'hell to pay' if Hamas didn't release the hostages by January 20, his inauguration day. As of Wednesday night, a hostage release deal was announced. The first phase will involve the release of 33 hostages.

UN secretary-general calls antisemitic UN official Francesca Alba...	Albanese has blamed the Jewish state for Hamas's Oct. 7 attack and comparedNetanyahu to Hitler. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese was a terrible human being, according to outgoing Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism Deborah Lipstadt, the Jewish Insider reports. Guterres made the remarks to Lipstadt during a Munich Security Conference, saying twice that Albanese was a 'horrible person.' A spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General neither confirmed nor denied that he made the comment, and the Forward emphasized that the UN chief has no authority over special rapporteurs. Albanese has frequently made remarks that were heavily critical of Israel and antisemitic. Even before Hamas's massacre on Oct. 7, Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) President Morton A. Klein and ZOA Director of Research and Special Projects Liz Berney, Esq. wrote letters calling on the UN to remove Albanese from her position due to her vicious anti-Israel bias and refusals to condemn deadly Palestinian Arab terror attacks against innocent Israelis. She has compared Israelis to Nazis and claimed that the US was 'subjugated to the Jewish Lobby.' Albanese has blamed the Jewish state for Hamas's Oct. 7 attack and compared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler. Albanese, the UN special rapporteur for Judea, Samaria, and Gaza, has argued that the Jewish state does not have a right to defend itself against Hamas, and she 'liked' posts on X endorsing the antisemitic trope of the 'Jewish billionaire class.' She likened Netanyahu to Hitler in a July X post, and hours after the Oct. 7 attack, she said the 'violence must be put into context.' Albanese also said that the victims of Oct. 7 'were not killed because of their Judaism but in response to Israel's oppression.' She also accused Israel of committing genocide and advancing a 'settler-colonial project in Palestine.'

Israel and Hamas agree to ceasefire deal to pause Gaza war and re...	Over six weeks, 33 of the nearly 100 hostages are to be reunited with their loved ones after months in captivity with no contact with the outside world, though it’s unclear if all are alive. By The Associated Press Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire deal, mediators announced Wednesday, pausing a devastating 15-month war in the Gaza Strip and raising the possibility of winding down the deadliest and most destructive fighting between the bitter enemies. The deal, coming after weeks of painstaking negotiations in the Qatari capital, promises the release of dozens of hostages held by Hamas in phases, the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israel, and would allow hundreds of thousands of people displaced in Gaza to return to what remains of their homes. It also would flood humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. Three officials from the U.S. and one from Hamas confirmed that a deal had been reached, while a senior Israeli official said details are still being ironed out. All three U.S. officials requested anonymity to discuss the contours of the deal before the official announcement by mediators in Doha. U.S. President Joe Biden was preparing to address the breakthrough agreement later Thursday, officials said. Any agreement still needs to be approved by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Cabinet, but is expected to go into effect in the coming days. The deal is expected to deliver an initial six-week halt to fighting that is to be accompanied by the opening of negotiations on ending the war altogether. Over six weeks, 33 of the nearly 100 hostages are to be reunited with their loved ones after months in captivity with no contact with the outside world, though it’s unclear if all are alive. It remained unclear exactly when and how many displaced Palestinians would be able to return to their homes and whether the agreement would lead to a complete end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza — key Hamas demands for releasing the remaining captives. Many longer-term questions about postwar Gaza remain, including who will rule the territory or oversee the task of reconstruction. Still, the announcement offered the first sign of hope in months that Israel and Hamas may be winding down the most deadly and destructive war they’ve ever fought, a conflict that has destabilized the broader Middle East and sparked worldwide protests.

Fighting fire: Lessons from Israel as Los Angeles battles catastr...	Prevention and community involvement are the cornerstones of Israel’s fire management approach and this multipronged strategy includes strategic tree pruning, firebreaks, and high-tech solutions. By Sveta Listratov, TPS As Los Angeles battles devastating wildfires, Israeli emergency experts shared their insights after tackling hundreds of fires sparked by Hezbollah rocket barrages in the past year. Fires in the Los Angeles area have killed 25 people and destroyed at least 12,000 buildings. Thousands of residents were ordered to evacuate and around 770,000 homes were without electricity as utility companies shut down power in certain areas as a precaution. The fires spread quickly because of high winds and drought conditions. Winds are forecast to increase on Wednesday with gusts reaching as high as 102 km/h. Israel’s Fire and Rescue Authority said on Wednesday it would dispatch a team of five fire protection experts to the U.S. to provide assistance. 'Firefighting methods are largely universal—creating firebreaks and concentrating manpower. But the game-changer is the weather. In California, low humidity and strong winds make firefighting exponentially harder,' Itzik Oz, Southern District Commander of Israel’s Fire and Rescue Services told The Press Service of Israel. The district oversees 67% of Israel’s territory. 'In Israel, we conduct patrols during extreme weather conditions to identify risks and act quickly. The saying is true: if you respond to a fire early, you can handle it with a bucket of water. If you’re late, even a truck won’t suffice,' he explained. Oz led a firefighting delegation to California three years ago. 'We were there to both learn and assist. We participated in the firefighting efforts, so I understand the challenges the U.S. faces,' Oz told TPS-IL. He explained that winds up to 160 km/h spread embers far, creating new fires, a phenomenon known as 'spotting' which he called a 'major challenge.' California’s hot, dry summers that make conditions ripe for wildfires reminded him of massive fires in the Jerusalem forest and in and around Haifa in recent years. Prevention and Community Involvement Prevention and community involvement are the cornerstones of Israel’s fire management approach. Many of the initiatives are done in collaboration with Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael – Jewish National Fund, an Israeli non-profit that focuses on environmental conservation, land reclamation, forestry, and development. This multi-pronged strategy includes strategic tree pruning, firebreaks, and high-tech solutions. Asaf Karavani, Director of Climate Change and Sustainability Division in KKL-JNF emphasizes the importance of 'buffer zones,' areas around communities where vegetation is managed to reduce fire intensity. 'Following the Carmel fire in 2010, Israel made it a priority to establish these zones, and today, 97% of them are complete,' Karavani noted to TPS-IL. The Carmel forest fire of 2010 killed 44 people and forced the evacuation of 17,000 people. The fire was inadvertently started by a teenager with a nargila coal and was followed by a wave of arson. But communities also play a role. Col. Shiran Hashai-Levi, a senior officer in Israel’s Homefront Command and director of the Israel National Resilience Institute, stressed the importance of empowering civilians. 'We are a training center where emergency scenarios are studied with the goal of advancing preparedness on the home front, improving readiness in both civilian and military spaces,' Hashai-Levi explained to TPS-IL. 'We train citizens in local authorities as part of a ‘self-rescue’ framework—providing basic skills in fire suppression, rescue, and first aid until professional forces arrive.' Karavani explained to TPS-IL, 'The people who live closest to forests are the first to notice and respond to unusual activity. Their proximity makes them critical in the early detection of wildfires.' During fire emergencies, community members assist firefighters by clearing pathways, guiding first responders, and evacuating vulnerable populations. Said Hashai-Levi, 'Part of community resilience is also returning to normalcy, reopening the economy, and maintaining functional continuity. This allows parents to send their children to school and society to regain its footing after the emergency is over.' She added, 'It’s easier to go from normalcy to emergency than to return from emergency to normalcy. This is a challenging task, but resilience is a virtuous cycle. The quicker the return to functionality, the greater the sense of resilience.' Hezbollah barrages in 2024 sparked fires that burnt 2,000 acres of protected lands and 42,000 acres of grazing areas. In June, a spokesperson for the Fire Brigade told TPS-IL that firefighters battling blazes near the Lebanese and Gaza borders were forced to take the unusual step of carrying rifles and pistols, along with protection equipment provided by the army and police. Said Karavani, 'Wildfires are a global issue, but sharing knowledge and management techniques can make a difference.'

IDF use of air power increasing in Judea and Samaria amid rising ...	Iran, which has lost most of its strategic assets in the Middle East, is focused on setting Judea and Samaria ablaze with terror financing, know-how and weapons, he cautioned, while smuggling arms into the sector from Jordan. By Yaakov Lappin, JNS The Israel Defense Forces has conducted 110 airstrikes in Judea and Samaria since the beginning of the current conflict in October 2023, according to a statement by the IDF Spokesperson Unit on Jan. 11. These strikes, carried out in cooperation with the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet), have resulted in the elimination of at least 165 armed terrorists who posed an immediate threat to Israeli forces. Lt. Col. (res.) Amit Yagur, former deputy head of the Palestinian arena at the IDF Planning Branch and a former naval intelligence officer, told JNS that air power is just one of multiple tools used by the IDF to boost security operations in Judea and Samaria. Air strikes focus a 'relatively large' amount of firepower in a short period, 'without risking the lives of our forces on the ground,' Yagur stated. This approach is particularly effective due to its speed and precision, he said. 'We have improved greatly over the years, and the Air Force has an incredible ability to carry out pinpoint strikes in combination with intelligence. This allows us to achieve accuracy, inflict significant damage, avoid harm to uninvolved civilians, and, most importantly, avoid danger to our forces,' he said. The use of air power also conveys a broader strategic message, he argued. 'Just as we deal with our enemies outside, where our air force is decisive and prominent, here too [in Judea and Samaria] we gradually begin to do this.' Decision makers had initially been hesitant to employ air power in Judea and Samaria, he said. This was partially motivated by a desire to keep a lower profile in the region, as well as past pressures from Washington, he explained. However, another driver is the changing nature of terrorism in Judea and Samaria, he said, highlighting the development of terror groups into more organized and systematic entities. Iran, which has lost most of its strategic assets in the Middle East, is focused on setting Judea and Samaria ablaze with terror financing, know-how and weapons, he cautioned, while smuggling arms into the sector from Jordan. Yagur referred to this phenomenon as 'the Gaza-ization of Judea and Samaria,' noting that areas like Jenin and Tulkarm have become breeding grounds for larger-scale terror groups, even as so-called lone-wolf attacks remain a challenge. 'What used to be small terror cells or nests of terror has become groups of terror and even battalions of terror in several places,' he told JNS. In response, Yagur said Israel needed to weigh a combination of broader, more aggressive military operations and other civilian-political measures that extend beyond the IDF’s remit. 'Aggressive deterrent actions are essential,' he said, stressing the importance of restricting the movement of terror groups and reintroducing checkpoints in certain areas. 'I do not rule out, in extreme cases, the possibility of temporarily evacuating civilians during military operations to distinguish between the terrorists and the civilian population,' he added. 'Ultimately, terror organizations depend on civilian legitimacy. When they have civilian legitimacy, they thrive.' The Palestinian Authority, he said, must undergo an urgent reform, including a change to its education system that indoctrinates Palestinian children into viewing Israel as their enemy, thereby ensuring a new generation committed to hate and conflict. Such a reality could easily produce a new Oct. 7-style mass murder attack from or in Judea and Samaria, he warned, adding that the military cannot solve all of these problems on its own. Efforts to reform the P.A.’s governance and educational systems are critical to preventing terrorism, he concluded. Col. (ret.) Moshe Elad, one of the founders of security coordination between the IDF and the Palestinian Authority and a lecturer at Western Galilee College in Acre, addressed the P.A.’s involvement in recent counter-terrorism efforts in Jenin. 'The advance of [P.A. General Intelligence Service head Majed] Faraj’s forces is not significant and appears to be more for public relations purposes,' said Eilad. He emphasized that 'the main burden of counter-terrorism remains on Israel.' 'I do not recommend being impressed by the words of praise and flattery that Hamas and Fatah lavish on each other. Beneath the surface, there is deep hostility between them, which has persisted since 2007 [when Hamas carried out a coup in Gaza],' he explained. Despite numerous reconciliation attempts—'over 30, in fact'—Elad noted that none have succeeded, underscoring the deep divisions between the two factions. According to Elad, the P.A.’s security operations are partly motivated by a desire to signal competence to the Trump administration, with the aim of convincing it to grant the P.A. a role in post-war Gaza. 'Abu Mazen [P.A. leader Mahmoud Abbas] wants to present an image of a Palestinian Authority that is capable of overcoming terrorism, including a hint regarding the day after Gaza, as if to say, ‘We are ready to take control of the Gaza Strip.’' However, without Israeli security measures, the P.A. would struggle to maintain any stability in Judea and Samaria, he added. 'It’s absurd: While the P.A. officially criticizes Israel and calls for its withdrawal, it depends on the IDF’s presence in Judea and Samaria, which actually saves it,' said Elad. Ultimately, Elad said, the IDF is utilizing a range of tools to tackle terrorism, ranging from ambushes to airstrikes. 'It is not possible to plan for something that will suit all types of terrorist activities. One must apply a suite to eradicate terror for all scenarios, or series of incidents, individually. Hence, the use of air power, whether it is quadcopters, drones, a helicopter, or plane, is a function of the decision that follows a situation analysis,' he added.

The cameras offer 360-degree and thermal imaging capabilities, and most of the recent IDF casualties were caused by explosive devices triggered by such cameras. By JNS Hamas has been using advanced cameras smuggled into Gaza on board humanitarian aid trucks to target Israeli forces in the Strip, Hebrew media reported on Wednesday. These cameras allow remote detonation of explosives, contributing to high casualties among Israeli soldiers, particularly in northern Gaza, according to Channel 12 News. Since Sunday, nine soldiers have been killed and 14 wounded by explosives in Beit Hanoun. The cameras offer 360-degree and thermal imaging capabilities, and most of the recent IDF casualties were caused by explosive devices triggered by such cameras, according to the report. A senior IDF officer stated that the military should have approached operations in Beit Hanoun differently, suggesting a more cautious and systematic strategy instead of storming the area, as Hamas had prepared with explosives and cameras in strategic locations. 'We left Beit Hanoun in January 2024, and Hamas had a year to prepare for our return. Every alley here is booby-trapped with explosives and rigged with cameras. We had to approach it differently—strike and clear the area from the air or use heavy engineering tools before any further ground entry. We shouldn’t have stormed in—we needed to proceed slowly and systematically. We need to rethink our strategy,' the officer said, according to Channel 12.

Netanyahu denies Hamas accepted deal amid reports of imminent agr...	Israeli officials claim deal will be signed by Thursday, despite Prime Minister denying reports Hamas has approved proposal, and with lingering questions regarding support for deal within Israeli government. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli officials said Wednesday afternoon that a hostage deal and ceasefire agreement will be finalized with Hamas either Wednesday night or on Thursday, according to reports by multiple media outlets. One unnamed Israeli official told the Israeli news site Walla Wednesday that Hamas' Gaza chief Mohammed Sinwar had okayed the current proposal on the table in Doha, Qatar. 'There is a breakthrough in the hostage deal negotiations in Doha. Hamas military leader in Gaza Mohammed Sinwar gave his OK,' the official was quoted as saying. Israel's national broadcaster Kan cited Palestinian sources who also claimed a breakthrough has been reached in the negotiations and that a deal is likely to be presented by Thursday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, downplayed the reports of an impending deal, and rejected claims that Sinwar, brother of the slain former leader of Hamas, had accepted the latest hostage deal proposal. 'Contrary to reports, the Hamas terrorist organization has yet to provide an answer regarding the deal,' the prime minister's office said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. If negotiators in Doha are able to reach an agreement, Netanyahu will face opposition from within his own government in ratifying the deal. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit) has hinted his party will bolt the coalition should the current proposal be accepted, and boasted Tuesday that he had torpedoed previous bids to reach a hostage deal that would end the war in Gaza. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, chairman of the Religious Zionist Party and an erstwhile ally of Ben-Gvir, hinted earlier this week that he would opposed the deal in its current form, but on Wednesday took a more nuanced position. In a video statement released Wednesday morning, Smotrich said that he would insist the war in Gaza not be ended prematurely, but refrained from ruling out support for the hostage deal, which would include a three-stage ceasefire. Israeli media outlets have reported that Netanyahu is pressuring Smotrich to remain in the government, even if it ratifies the current ceasefire plan. The ultra-Orthodox Shas and United Torah Judaism parties have already vowed their support for the deal, while Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar's New Hope party is also expected to vote in favor of the ceasefire agreement. However, seven Likud lawmakers signed onto a letter earlier this week expressing opposition to the deal. Opposition lawmakers, including Opposition Leader and former Prime Minister Yair Lapid, have offered to provide Netanyahu a parliamentary safety net should the deal come up for ratification in the Knesset.

Iran accuses Israel of planting bombs in nuclear equipment	Iranian vice president and former FM claims Israel attempted to sabotage Iran's nuclear program by planting bombs in centrifuges, but adds attempt was foiled. By World Israel News Staff Israel attempted to sabotage Iran's nuclear program recently by planting explosives inside centrifuges ordered by Tehran from abroad, a senior Iranian official claimed Tuesday. A preview of a soon-to-be-released interview given by Iranian Vice President and former Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was released by the anti-regime outlet Iran International, including excerpts regarding the alleged Israeli sabotage plot. Speaking with Iran's Hozour program, Zarif said that Iranian nuclear officials had ordered centrifuges, which were later found to have been embedded with explosive devices apparently planted by Israel. Zarif did not disclose when the alleged incident occurred, nor did he share details on how the explosive devices were detected or how Iran ascertained Israel was behind the attempted sabotage. 'Our colleagues had purchased a centrifuge platform for the Atomic Energy Organization, and it was discovered that explosives had been embedded inside it, which they managed to detect,' Zarif said. Zarif ripped international sanctions imposed on Iran, saying the use of intermediaries for such purchases provided more opportunities for sabotage by hostile powers. 'Instead of being able to order equipment directly from the manufacturer, sanctions force you to rely on multiple intermediaries for such purchases,' Zarif said. 'If the Zionist regime infiltrates even one of the intermediaries, they can do anything and embed anything they want, which is exactly what happened.' Zarif compared the attempted sabotage of Iran's nuclear program with the September, 2024 bombing attacks conducted by Israel's Mossad on Hezbollah terrorists using compact explosive devices planted in pagers and handheld radios. 'The issue with the pagers in Lebanon turned out to be a multi-year process, meticulously orchestrated by the Zionists.'

Over a million Gazans to return to northern Gaza Strip in phase 1...	Limiting almost two million noncombatants to humanitarian zones is what permitted the IDF to fight Hamas effectively. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Allowing the Gazan civilian population to return to their homes is allegedly included in the first stage of the hostage deal whose final details are currently being worked out in Doha, Ma'ariv reported Tuesday. The paper noted that this clause has been 'hidden' from the public, as what has been reported in the media is that in this six-week phase of the ceasefire, some 1,000 Palestinian security prisoners will be released from Israeli jails, the IDF will withdraw from population centers in the coastal enclave, and a massive amount of humanitarian aid will be permitted entry, in exchange for the release of 34 hostages. 'A million men, women and children will move north along the coastal route to Gaza City [and points north] without any restrictions,' the report said, and an additional 300,000 will return to the southern city of Rafah. 'The only Israeli demand is that the returning cars be inspected. There is no restriction on the movement of those returning on foot,' the report added. 'If true,' the paper noted, Hamas will 'receive the big prize' in the beginning of the deal instead of at its end, after all the rest of the hostages are freed, including the more than a third who are dead. This is because the residents’ return effectively means the end of the war, since limiting almost two million noncombatants to humanitarian zones is what permitted the IDF to fight Hamas successfully everywhere else. It also reduced political pressure on Jerusalem to stop, although the international community still pressed Israel unremittingly about the number of civilian casualties being reported, despite the low 2-1 noncombatant-to-combatant ratio being unheard-of in war. Hamas would still hold more than 50 hostages, which would allow it to demand further concessions from Israel, the report noted, such as the release of even more prisoners and more aid, allowing the terrorists to boast that they had achieved a victory over Israel that no other Palestinian or Arab entity had attained. Without mentioning at which stages this would occur, Channel 14 meanwhile reported Tuesday that 'in the deal,' the IDF will maintain a presence along the entire border area that will extend 800 meters into the Strip. This will include a good part of the Philadelphi Corridor that runs along the Gazan border with Egypt and Jerusalem calls Hamas’ 'oxygen pipeline,' as weapons and supplies were smuggled through and under this border area for nearly two decades. The report added that the Netzarim Corridor that cuts Gaza roughly in half, which has become a wide highway dotted with small military bases and watchtowers along its length and occupies 56 square kilometers, will be taken over by an international force that will supervise the return of some one million northern Gaza residents to their homes. Whether they can ensure that no terrorists will be among them is the question, the report concluded.

IDF eliminates 50 terror targets in Gaza, killing Hamas commander	In parallel, there are reports in Arab media of the IDF starting to dismantle its military infrastructure in the Strip. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The IDF eliminated fifty terror targets throughout Gaza overnight Tuesday, including a senior Hamas commander who operated out of an ostensible school building. Guided by precise military and Shin Bet (internal security agency) intelligence, the high-ranking terrorist was hit in an airstrike on the former educational institution, which Hamas had turned into a command-and-control complex. The compound was located in Duraj Tuffah, between Jabalya and Shejaia in the northern part of the Strip that has been the focus of significant IDF ground forces’ operations for weeks to destroy newly-re-formed terror brigades. Other airstrikes took place in Khan Yunis in the south and Deir al-Balah in the center, destroying terrorist cells, weapons depots, underground infrastructure, and Hamas anti-tank positions, the army said. These bombings join the more than 1,400 other airstrikes the IAF conducted in December alone against such targets, either as independent actions or in close support of ground troops, who call in air support as needed. But while the army is continuing to convey a 'business as usual' attitude in conducting its anti-Hamas operations, there are reports that it is preparing for the consequences of the hostage deal whose negotiations are reportedly near the finish line in Doha. Citing Palestinian sources, Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed has reported that the IDF had begun dismantling infrastructure it had built along the Netzarim Corridor that cuts the Gaza Strip roughly in half. According to the report, 'Local eyewitnesses in Gaza said that military transport vehicles entered the Netzarim axis, one of the important strategic points in the Strip, and began the process of dismantling military towers on its western side.' While the IDF will reportedly leave populated areas of the Strip while remaining in its various buffer zones in the first stage of a deal, which is to last six weeks, Hamas has made clear that in order to get the rest of the hostages back, both living and dead, in future stages, Israel will have to completely withdraw from the Gazan enclave and end the war. Many in the Israeli public, including right-wing politicians, military experts and some hostages’ families, believe that Israel cannot afford to leave the most sensitive areas in the Strip, especially the borders, both between Israel and Gaza and Egypt and Gaza, in order to prevent Hamas from regrouping, rearming, and again posing a serious security threat to the country.

Argentina’s president wins ‘Jewish Nobel Prize’	President Javier Milei, known for his staunch support of Israel, becomes the first head of state ever to win the Genesis Prize. By World Israel News Staff On Tuesday, The Genesis Prize announced President of Argentina Javier Milei as the 2025 Genesis Prize Laureate, the first time the award, known as 'The Jewish Nobel Prize,' has been bestowed upon a head of state. Milei was the unanimous choice of the nine judges on the committee, which commended him for his unequivocal support of Israel during one of the most difficult times since the founding of the Jewish State. President Milei recently announced his decision to move the Argentinian embassy to Jerusalem, has reversed years of anti-Israel votes by Argentina in the United Nations, and has pledged to bring culprits responsible for the AMIA and Israeli Embassy bombings in Argentina in 1992 and 1994, respectively, to justice. Just last week, Milei ordered declassification of intelligence regarding the unexplained death of Alberto Nisman, the special prosecutor responsible for the AMIA bombing investigation. Former Argentinian President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner is presently being tried for obstructing that investigation and for her government’s controversial 2013 Memorandum with Iran, which shielded the accused terrorists and lifted Interpol alerts intended to arrest them. The planned relocation of Argentina’s embassy to Jerusalem is in sharp contrast to the actions of several other South American countries, which cut diplomatic relations with Israel and recalled their ambassadors over the war in Gaza. Shortly after the start of hostilities initiated by Hamas on October 7, 2023, Bolivia severed diplomatic ties with Israel, accusing it of carrying out 'crimes against humanity,' while Chile and Colombia recalled their ambassadors as they criticized the Israeli military offensive against Hamas militants. In May 2024, Brazil withdrew its ambassador to Israel after months of tensions between the two countries. 'President Milei is a true hero of the Jewish people,' said Co-Founder and Chairman of The Genesis Prize Foundation Stan Polovets. 'Unlike leaders of many other countries around the world who either remained quiet, pressured and – in some cases – sanctioned Israel, President Milei has unequivocally supported the Jewish people and their state. This award reflects Israel’s heartfelt appreciation for the President and the people of Argentina. A friend in need is a friend indeed.' In addition to Milei’s strong pro-Israel stance, the Genesis Prize Selection Committee praised his achievements in reforming Argentina’s economy, including bringing inflation down from 25% per month to 2.4%, reversing the freefall of the country’s currency, and posting a fiscal surplus for the first time in 15 years. Notably, the 'S&P Merval Index,' which tracks the performance of the largest publicly traded companies listed on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange, has generated a return of 173% in 2024, by far outperforming all other global markets. During the same period, Brazil’s stock market fell 7% and Mexico’s 11%, while S&P 500 rose 'only' 27%. Previous Genesis Prize honorees include Michael Bloomberg, Michael Douglas, Itzhak Perlman, Anish Kapoor, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Natalie Portman, Robert Kraft, Natan Sharansky, Steven Spielberg, Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks, Albert Bourla, and Barbra Streisand. In addition to honoring individual laureates, in 2024 The Genesis Prize Foundation bestowed its prize on Israeli NGOs supporting the released and rescued hostages and their families and helped fund lawsuits against the leadership of Hamas in international jurisdictions. This followed a $1 million award to Jewish activists working to uphold Ukraine’s independence and alleviate the suffering of the people of Ukraine in 2023. Milei has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine’s fight for freedom and independence, and in June 2024 was awarded the Order of Freedom by Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And during the Hanukkah celebrations last month, Zelenskyy used a menorah gifted to him by Milei during the inauguration of Argentina’s president in December 2023. 'I am deeply honored to receive the Genesis Prize,' stated President Javier Milei. 'Of course, I will not keep the monetary prize; I will donate it to causes that support freedom and the fight against antisemitism, both in Argentina and around the world.' 'I have deep admiration for Israel, its history, and its people. The Jewish people have shown throughout their history that resilience and the defense of freedom are essential to overcoming any challenge. This spirit is a cornerstone of the relationship between Argentina and Israel, and I will work to further strengthen our ties.' Although raised Catholic, Milei has increasingly embraced Judaism since taking a sincere interest in 2021, studies Torah regularly, attends prayer services, placed a mezuzah on his office door, and stated his intention to convert to Judaism upon leaving office. His cabinet meetings often start with a discussion of the week’s Torah portion, while one of the most influential government officials, Foreign Minister Gerardo Werthein, took the oath of office on a Chumash, a copy of the Pentateuch or the five books of Moses. Shortly after being inaugurated, President Milei appointed his rabbi and spiritual guide, Axel Wahnish, as Argentina’s Ambassador to Israel. Last year, Milei revealed that his grandfather, a great influence on his life, discovered shortly before he passed away that his mother was Jewish. Milei also has shared that his great-great-grandfather was a rabbi who instilled Jewish education and values in his children and grandchildren.

‘If we go back to fighting, the costs will be heavy,’ security ex...	He also stressed the high operational costs of regaining control over critical areas of Gaza, such as the Netzarim Corridor and the Philadelphi Corridor. By Sveta Listratov, TPS As Israel weighs the merits of an emerging hostage and ceasefire deal, one security expert warned that the agreement has too many parallels with another hostage deal that led to the October 7 attacks. 'Ultimately, the deal is about security. No matter how you spin it, the effects are inherently tied to Israel’s security,' Col. (Res.) Hezi Nechama told The Press Service of Israel. Nechama, a former brigade commander, is one of the founders of the Forum of Reservist Commanders and Fighters. 'By the next morning after the deal, Hamas will begin to recover and rearm faster than we might think. We’ll soon return to a scenario where Hamas operates as a powerful, armed organization,' he told TPS-IL. Nechama drew parallels to the Gilad Shalit deal of 2011, when Israel freed 1,027 security prisoners for Shalit. Many of the terrorists involved in planning Hamas’s October 7 attack, including its mastermind, Yahya Sinwar were among those released in that swap. He also stressed the high operational costs of regaining control over critical areas of Gaza, such as the Netzarim Corridor and the Philadelphi Corridor. The Netzarim Corridor is a roughly eight km road that cuts off northern and southern Gaza. The Philadelphia Corridor is a buffer zone that runs the length of the 14-km Gaza-Egypt border. It was created in 2006 to prevent weapons smuggling after Israel disengaged from the Strip but Hamas violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority the following year. 'Re-conquering these areas will come at the price of many soldiers’ lives and injuries,' Nechama said, adding that abandoning these positions before all the hostages are released could lead to captives being transferred abroad via the Sinai to Yemen, Iran, or Turkey. Another point of the deal, releasing convicted terrorists to Judea, Samaria, and Gaza, poses a direct threat to Israeli citizens, Nechama warned. 'These individuals have blood on their hands, and their motivation to carry out further attacks is often heightened after their release,' he said. Moreover, allowing Gaza’s reconstruction without stringent oversight would lead to massive financial aid flowing into the hands of Hamas. 'Anyone who thinks they can control how these funds are used is turning a blind eye. The money will inevitably strengthen Hamas’s rule and bring in new weaponry that we’ll have to face in the future,' Nechama told TPS-IL. While saving the lives of captives may justify these risks, Nechama stresses that such decisions should be made with full awareness of the price. 'If we go back to fighting, the costs will be heavy, unless we abandon the idea of fighting Hamas altogether, which means conceding our objectives,' he explained. Under the terms of the emerging ceasefire, it is expected that the first 33 hostages to be released will be humanitarian cases — women, children, the elderly, and the sick. Palestinians from northern Gaza who fled to southern areas of the Strip will be allowed to return to their homes. Israeli forces will not withdraw from the Strip until all the hostages are freed. Opponents of the agreement are against any deal that does not bring home all the hostages at once. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 95 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Three IDF soldiers wounded by roadside bomb near Jenin	The IDF also struck a terror cell in Jenin killing six terrorists and causing multiple injuries. By Joshua Marks, JNS Three Israeli soldiers were wounded, two of them seriously, during a counterterrorism operation in Qabatiya near Jenin in northern Samaria overnight Tuesday, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Their vehicle was hit by a roadside explosive device planted by Palestinian terrorists, the IDF said. All three were evacuated to hospital for treatment, and their families were notified. Airstrike in Jenin In a separate development, Israel carried out an airstrike in Jenin as part of ongoing counterterrorism operations in Judea and Samaria, according to the IDF and Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet). According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, the strike resulted in six fatalities and multiple injuries. Israeli authorities have not disclosed further details about the target or the operation’s outcome. The strike follows an unprecedented counter-terror operation by the Palestinian Authority’s security forces in Jenin in recent weeks. These incidents reflect heightened tensions in Judea and Samaria as the IDF has intensified operations in the region, targeting terror hubs in Palestinian camps. Since the start of the war, around 800 terrorists have been killed, and over 6,000 arrested. On Saturday evening, Israeli security forces arrested two Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists who were on their way to carry out a shooting attack in the 'immediate future.' PIJ operatives Ahmad Zaqarna, 21, and Tariq Abu Zayd, 25, from Qabatiya, were arrested in Nablus (Shechem) with two loaded M-16 rifles, ammunition and military gear in their possession. In the wake of the Jan. 6 terrorist shooting that killed three Israelis in the Arab village of Al-Funduq, just west of Nablus, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced that he had approved 'a series of additional offensive and defensive actions in Judea and Samaria.' The terrorists who carried out that attack, killing Rachel Cohen, 73, Aliza Rice, 70, and Israel Police Master Sgt. Elad Yaakov Winkelstein, 35, remain at large. Seven more people were wounded in the attack. On Sunday, an Israeli woman was lightly injured by Palestinian rock-throwers near the village of Hares, located close to Ariel in Samaria. The victim was evacuated to the hospital with minor facial injuries caused by flying shards of glass. Several additional vehicles were damaged in the attack, according to the Israel Defense Forces, which launched a search for the assailants.

Jewish groups condemn ’60 Minutes’ segment criticizing US support...	AJC CEO Ted Deutch said in a statement on X that the '60 Minutes' segment on Sunday night 'relies on the same biased accusations and information that attempt to demonize and delegitimize Israel.' By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner The investigative news television program '60 Minutes' has been widely criticized for airing a 'one-sided' and 'biased' segment on Sunday night that featured former US State Department officials who condemned American support for Israel’s defensive war against Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip. The CBS News show aired a segment titled 'Dissent Within the State Department Over US Role in Israel-Hamas War.' It highlighted interviews with three former US State Department officials who resigned from their positions in protest of US support for Israel’s ongoing military actions in Gaza, which target Hamas terrorists who orchestrated the deadly terrorist attack in southern Israel that took place on Oct. 7, 2023. One of the former State Department officials told '60 Minutes': 'There is a linkage between every single bomb that is dropped in Gaza and the US because every single bomb is dropped from an American-made plane.' The American Jewish Committee (AJC) called the '60 Minutes' segment 'biased and misguided' in a statement released on Monday. The organization detailed a slew of issues with the segment, including its mention of unverified civilian casualty figures and the fact that it barely mentioned the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Oct. 7 that started the ongoing war in Gaza. The segment even described Hamas fighters as 'militants' rather than terrorists. 60 Minutes interviewed every extremist who was too radical for the Biden Admin and had to resign. The show is a parade of Palestinian sycophants. This guy wanted Jews to be content with mere sympathies over October 7 victims and not to fight back. Fck no.pic.twitter.com/MeqN7HTUhN &mdash; Marina Medvin (@MarinaMedvin) January 13, 2025 AJC also denounced the CBS show for promoting the 'outlandish notion' that, after Hamas’s atrocities in southern Israel, the Jewish state should have made efforts to make peace with the Palestinian terrorist group rather than engage in self-defense to rescue the hostages taken to Gaza and target the Hamas terrorists who threatened to perpetrate similar deadly massacres in the future. 'This segment, the latest example of major news outlets recklessly reporting on Israel’s defensive war against Hamas, was shockingly one-sided, lacked factual accuracy, and relied heavily on misguided information,' AJC added. 'In this segment, ‘60 Minutes’ plays directly into the hands of the enemies of the West who aim to show that support for Israel is not in the United States’ best interest. Nothing could be further from the truth,' AJC noted. 'Israel’s actions against Iranian-backed terror groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, as well as its recent direct responses to Iranian attacks, help deter attacks on the US. Each of these terror organizations has American blood on its hands. We share common enemies — the enemies of democracy and freedom.' AJC CEO Ted Deutch said in a separate statement on X that the '60 Minutes' segment on Sunday night 'relies on the same biased accusations and information that attempt to demonize and delegitimize Israel.' 'The one-sided segment plays into the hands of enemies of democracy and freedom who aim to divide the US and Israel,' he added. 'It is shocking to see this kind of irresponsible journalism from a long-running, respected news program like ’60 Minutes.'' Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), said in a post on X he is 'outraged' that '60 Minutes' would 'air such a biased and one-sided piece, villainizing Israel and berating US support for its ally.' 'Where are the counter perspectives to those interviewed? Where is the mention of the nearly 100 hostages — including Americans — STILL in captivity!? What kind of journalism is that?' he wrote. 'According to last night’s piece, Israel should have responded to the mass slaughter, mutilation, rape, and kidnapping of its citizens by asking the perpetrators of these vicious crimes for peace. Newsflash: Rewarding terrorism won’t bring peace. And this sort of biased coverage only serves to fuel hate. It’s like a blood libel in a moment of expanding, intensifying antisemitism.' 'Responsible coverage of the war should not only honor the lives lost, but also accurately describe those responsible for this conflict for what they are — antisemitic terrorists,' he concluded. Honest Reporting, a Jerusalem-based media watchdog that focuses on antisemitism and anti-Israel bias, released a detailed report on Monday of all the 'skewed' and 'imbalanced' reporting included in the '60 Minutes' segment. It revealed that the investigative news program amplified anti-Israel voices in the segment on Sunday night while failing to mention that two of its interviewees have 'a history of anti-Israel activism and associations with anti-Israel organizations,' including the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN). Honest Reporting claimed '60 Minutes' tried to disguise these two former State Department officials — Josh Paul, a former director in the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs; and Hala Rharrit, a former American diplomat who specialized in the Middle East — as 'impartial observers,' when in reality they are anti-Israel activists. US Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) wrote on X that '60 Minutes' aired 'a disgraceful hit job against Israel,' and 'forgot that Hamas started the war, Hamas still holds American hostages, and any damage in Gaza is the sole fault of Hamas.' Others who have condemned the '60 Minutes' segment include Jewish actor Michael Rapaport, who described the segment as a 'smear campaign' against Israel and the show as a 'propaganda machine.' Dozens on social media have called the segment 'despicable,' labeled it as 'a hit piece vilifying Israel,' and accused '60 Minutes' of defending Hamas.

Yeshiva University president, controversial imam to give Trump in...	It is a profound privilege to offer a prayer of unity and hope on behalf of Yeshiva University and for all Americans at this historic moment,' said Rabbi Berman. By Mike Wagenheim, JNS The leader of America’s flagship Jewish university will give a benediction following Donald Trump’s inaugural presidential address on Jan. 20. So, too, will an imam who refused to label Hezbollah a terrorist organization. A program showing the lineup for Trump’s inauguration at the Capitol indicates that Rabbi Ari Berman, president of Yeshiva University in New York City, and Imam Husham Al-Husainy of the Karbalaa Islamic Center in Dearborn, Mich., will take the podium back to back immediately following Trump’s speech. They are two of four religious leaders who have been selected for the honor. 'Working on the benediction for the inauguration,' Berman wrote on X, with a picture of him at a desk, pen in hand, with a pad of paper and a thick book in front of him: 'It is a profound privilege to offer a prayer of unity and hope on behalf of Yeshiva University and for all Americans at this historic moment.' Berman has served as Yeshiva University’s fifth president since 2016, during which time the institution has experienced significant growth in several key categories. Al-Husainy, who was among the Arab and Muslim leaders the Trump campaign leaned on during the 2024 election, has declined to call Hezbollah a terror organization and attended a 2006 pro-Hezbollah rally in Dearborn during Israel’s conflict with the southern Lebanese-based Iranian proxy. The Middle East Forum reported that Al-Husainy held up a photo of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah on the stage at the rally. Nasrallah was eliminated by an Israeli bunker-busting strike near Beirut this past September. Al-Husainy was invited by Democrats the following year to give an invocation at the national committee’s winter meeting, during which he prayed that God would 'help us to stop the war and violence, and oppression and occupation' in Iraq. (JNS sought comment from the Trump transition team.) Critics said Al-Husainy was referring to the United States military as an oppressor. While Al-Husainy denied it, he did not explain who he was referring to during an interview on Fox News that year. When asked during that interview if Hezbollah is a terrorist organization, Al-Husainy said, 'No.' 'Hezbollah is a Lebanese organization,' he said. 'And I’ve got nothing to do with that. But there is a biblical meaning of Hezbollah. It is in Judaism and Christianity and Islam, meaning people of God.'

Days before leaving office, Biden extends sanctions on Israeli se...	With less than a week left in office, President Biden signs order extending sanctions against a list of Israeli Jews living in Judea and Samaria, accusing them of 'extremism' which threatens American foreign policy and the two-state solution. By World Israel News Staff President Joe Biden signed an order Tuesday night extending sanctions against a number of Israeli Jews living in Judea and Samaria deemed 'extremist' by the Biden administration. The move comes less than a week before President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration and the end of Biden's four years in office. Biden first signed an executive order enabling federal authorities to freeze the assets of and bar transactions on behalf of individuals flagged by the administration as 'extremist Israeli settlers' on February 1st, 2024. The executive order was issued in response to claims by left-wing NGOs in Israel and reports by the United Nations accusing Israeli residents of Judea and Samaria of violence and harassment against Palestinian Arabs after October 7th. On Tuesday, Biden issued a statement announcing that he had signed an order extending the sanctions for another year, calling the alleged actions of the sanctioned settlers as a 'unusual and extraordinary threat' to American national security and foreign policy. 'The situation in the West Bank — in particular high levels of extremist settler violence, forced displacement of people and villages, and property destruction — has reached intolerable levels and constitutes a serious threat to the peace, security, and stability of the West Bank and Gaza, Israel, and the broader Middle East region,' Biden argued. 'These actions undermine the foreign policy objectives of the United States, including the viability of a two-state solution and ensuring Israelis and Palestinians can attain equal measures of security, prosperity, and freedom.' 'They also undermine the security of Israel and have the potential to lead to broader regional destabilization across the Middle East, threatening United States personnel and interests.' 'The situation in the West Bank continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.'

Ahead of inauguration, Trump gets high marks from Israeli Jews	Two-thirds of Israeli Jews pleased Trump will be taking office next week, with moderately high levels of confidence he will properly handle key issues including Iran, the Israeli-Arab conflict, and US-Israel relations. By World Israel News Staff Over two-thirds of Israeli Jews are looking forward to President-elect Donald Trump taking office next week, according to a new poll published on Tuesday. Ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration as President of the United States next Tuesday, and in light of reports that he is exerting significant pressure to broker a deal to end the war in Israel and secure the release of hostages, the 'Israeli Society Index' survey, conducted by the Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI), examined what the Israeli public thinks about the incoming president. The data shows that the majority of all Israelis (61%) are pleased that Donald Trump will be returning to the White House. By contrast, 28% of Israelis expressed dissatisfaction with Trump's return to office. When broken down by political orientation, the survey reveals that among those who identify as right-wing, 96% are satisfied, while among those who identify as left-wing, 76% are dissatisfied. Among Jewish citizens of Israel, 68% are satisfied, and 24% are dissatisfied. In contrast, among Arab citizens of Israel, 32% are satisfied, while 43% are dissatisfied. The survey also examined respondents' confidence in Trump’s ability to 'do the right thing' regarding U.S.-Israel relations: 32% of Israelis expressed high confidence, 40% reported moderate confidence, and 21% stated they do not believe Trump will act appropriately. The research included a comparison with the opinions of American Jews about Trump, as measured by JPPI’s 'Voice of the People' panel. The study found that Israeli Jews place more trust in Trump than American Jews do: 77% of Israeli Jews expressed confidence (high or moderate) in Trump’s handling of U.S.-Israel relations, compared to only 54% of American Jews. Respondents were also asked whether they believe Trump will handle Iran effectively. Only 20% of Israelis expressed 'high confidence' in Trump’s ability to act appropriately, 44% reported 'moderate confidence,' and roughly a quarter (27%) said they do not trust him to act properly in dealing with Iran. In contrast to other issues, American Jews expressed greater confidence in Trump on Iran policy than Israeli Jews. On the Israeli-Palestinian issue, one-third (34%) of Israelis indicated they lack confidence that Trump will do the right thing, 43% expressed moderate confidence, and only 13% reported high confidence in Trump regarding this issue.

Families of fallen soldiers, hostages protest ‘surrender’ deal	We won’t forget, we won’t forgive. You don’t have a mandate to surrender to Hamas,' says protest organizer. By World Israel News Staff Hundreds of demonstrators gathered near the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem on Tuesday night, calling on the Israeli government to reject the potential ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas. The agreement would see thousands of terrorists freed, including those serving life sentences for murdering Israelis, and a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, in exchange for the release of 34 hostages, an unknown number of whom are alive. The protesters, many of whom are the family members of fallen soldiers and hostages, say that the current deal abandons the vast majority of captives, including all healthy young men under the age of 50. The first stage of the deal would see the release of all women currently held, along with men over the age of 50 and those with critical medical conditions. Under the terms of the deal, the return of men under 50 and dead bodies are matters to be negotiated later. 'We demand that agreements to be made now promising everyone's return, not in the future,' said Lishay Lavi Miran, whose husband Omri was kidnapped on October 7h. 'Time has not been on our side for a long while.' 'We are calling on the prime minister not to give into this deal… a deal that will free thousands of terrorists with blood on their hands,' a representative from the Gvura Forum, which organized the protest, said over a loudspeaker. 'We won’t forget, we won’t forgive. You don’t have a mandate to surrender to Hamas.' Rabbi Shlomo Yosef Weitzen, whose IDF soldier son was killed battling Hamas terrorists on October 7th, urged Israel to continue the fight against Hamas. 'When you have an enemy who is evil to you, you lay siege to it. You don’t need to do anything aside from that. To lay siege, to fight, to stop the electricity,' he said. 'Then, maybe the evil will understand, and get down on its knees and beg to return us hostages back to us.' Weitzen referred to the fight against Hamas a 'struggle between good and evil.' Amitai Wiesel, whose brother Elkana fell in combat in the Strip in January 2024, referenced a speech made by Netanyahu that categorized the war in similar terms. 'I remember, as if it were today, one of your first [press conferences] at the start of the war. You called this war a war between the children of light and children of darkness,' Wiesel said, in remarks aimed at Netanyahu. 'I ask you today, Mr. Prime Minister, what happened to the children of light and the children of darkness? Did something change so that you started to talk with the children of darkness?'

Blinken: Hamas regrouping, losses offset by new recruits	Washington believes that Hamas has 'recruited almost as many new' terrorists as it has lost in the ongoing war, Blinken said. By World Israel News Staff Outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned that Israel would not be able to maintain its military achievements in Gaza without supporting a new governing body for the Strip, claiming that the Hamas terror group has recruited enough new terrorists to replace nearly all of its operatives killed during the war. In a two-hour long speech at the Atlantic Council on Tuesday, Blinken said that the Biden Administration had pushed Israel to embrace a post-war vision for Gaza that included alternative leadership, including the Palestinian Authority. Blinken charged that Israel's hesitancy to promote new governance in the coastal enclave had created a power vacuum, which served Hamas' interests. 'Each time Israel completes its military operations and pulls back, Hamas militants regroup and reemerge because there’s nothing else to fill the void,' Blinken said. 'Indeed, we assess that Hamas has recruited almost as many new militants as it has lost,' he added. 'That is a recipe for an enduring insurgency and perpetual war.' While Blinken touched on Hamas' crimes against its own people, pointing to a Wall Street Journal interview in which Yahya Sinwar called the deaths of Gazans 'necessary sacrifices,' the diplomat turned his attention to slamming Israel's policies in Judea and Samaria. 'Israelis must abandon the myth that they can carry out de facto annexation [of Judea and Samaria without cost and consequence to Israel’s democracy, to its standing and to its security,' Blinken said. 'Israel is expanding official settlements and nationalizing land at a faster clip than any time in the last decade, while turning a blind eye to unprecedented growth in illegal outposts. Violent attacks by extremist settlers against Palestinian civilians have reached record levels,' he claimed. Blinken concluded his remarks by alleging that there is a lack of sufficient media coverage in Israel about the humanitarian crisis in the Strip, drawing a moral equivalency to the widespread celebration of the October 7th terror attacks in the Islamic world. 'Throughout the Arab and Muslim worlds, large majorities believe that October 7 didn’t happen — or if it did, that it was a legitimate attack on Israel’s military,' Blinken said. 'In Israel, there is almost no reporting on the conditions in Gaza and what people there endure every day,' he said. 'This dehumanization is one of the greatest tragedies of the conflict.'

Will ICC warrants be dismissed due to bureaucratic errors?	Israel argued that Khan had not given the country formal notice of the ICC investigation, nor sufficient time to respond to the probe. By World Israel News Staff International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Karim Khan expressed his objection on Tuesday to an appeal of the warrants issued against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, but numerous bureaucratic issues may render the warrants invalid. In November 2024, the ICC approved the warrants, sparking condemnation from Israel and its ally, the United States. With incoming president-elect Donald Trump and Congress signaling that they will take punitive action against the ICC and its staff, along with several European countries stating they will reject the warrants, the ICC may be considering dropping the warrants. But international pressure from numerous pro-Palestinian groups may prevent the Court from formally cancelling the warrants. Bureaucratic issues raised by Israel in its appeal of the warrants could potentially provide an off-ramp for the ICC, allowing them to withdraw the warrants while saving face. In the appeal, Israel argued that Khan had not given the country formal notice of the ICC investigation, nor sufficient time to respond to the probe. Khan's objection to that claim, which was published on Tuesday, was that he had warned Israel several times in public statements over the years that he was looking into the possibility that Jerusalem was committing war crimes. A 2021 notice, issued shortly after the Guardian of the Walls conflict, constitutes adequate warning, Khan contended. Because Khan accused Israel of 'starvation' in Gaza, Jerusalem argued, he needed to officially inform Israel of that accusation and give the government enough time to prepare a response. Another issued raised by Israel is that Jerusalem, like the U.S., is not a signatory of the Rome statute. Therefore, Israel argued, the court does not have jurisdiction over the Jewish State. A lower court within the ICC could re-examine the issues raised by Israel and Khan, which would delay a potential criminal case against Netanyahu and Gallant, or possibly lead to the expiration of the warrants.

On Tuesday, Netanyahu offered the ministers, among other things, tightened security and increased construction in Judea and Samaria. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has offered a deal to cabinet members who oppose the hostage deal, provided that they remain in the government, according to Kan news reports. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich threatened to leave the government over their disagreement with the current hostage release plan. On Tuesday, Netanyahu offered the ministers, among other things, tightened security and increased construction in Judea and Samaria. Ben Gvir had threatened to leave the government over his opposition to the hostage deal and invited Smotrich to do the same. Although Ben Gvir boasted that he was able to use his political influence to 'repeatedly prevent this deal from being implemented,' he added that 'others have aligned with the government and, by supporting the deal, we are no longer a decisive factor.' Therefore, he approached Smotrich and said, 'I am urging you, my friend, to join me in opposing the surrender deal with Hamas. The Religious Zionism party alone cannot stop this agreement. I propose that we approach the Prime Minister together and make it clear that if he pushes forward with the deal, we will withdraw from the government.' Ben Gvir and Smotrich feel that the hostage release deal threatens Israel's security and would mean that 'hundreds of soldiers died in vain.' Ben Gvir said, 'The emerging deal is catastrophic. I know the details all too well: the release of hundreds of murderous terrorists from prison, the return of Gazans to Gaza—among them, thousands of terrorists to the northern part of the strip—the withdrawal of the IDF from the Netzarim Corridor, and the re-establishment of the threat to the residents of the Gaza Envelope.' He added, 'This deal would erase the hard-earned gains of the war, bought at the high cost of our soldiers' blood.

Many of those present were critical of the phased release of hostages and wanted assurances that all of the captives would be freed. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Family members of hostages interrupted a presentation by Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz at the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee (FADC) on Tuesday, and many were angrily critical of the current hostage deal that may be finalized within days. The hostage family members spoke, interrupting the meeting for 30 minutes as Katz and Likud MK Yuli Edelstein sat in silence. Many of those present were critical of the phased release of hostages and wanted assurances that all of the captives would be freed. Chana Cohen, The aunt of one of the hostages whose daughter died in Hamas captivity, exclaimed, 'Where is my daughter? Why is she not on the list?' She added, 'I want to bury my daughter in a Jewish cemetery.' Cohen continued, 'You cannot continue to live here. I will not let you speak today. Go from here, and instead of speaking about money, bring me my daughter.' she added, '&#8230;it is all according to a pre-negotiated list.' Many of the family members kept saying, 'You have selected some hostages to live and some to die.' One person yelled, 'At Auschwitz, there was selection off the train' of who would live and who would die.' Katz emphasized that although 33 hostages will be released in the first phase of the deal, he is committed to releasing all of the hostage according to the agreement. Cohen responded, 'Committed? How many more years? Why are you making a Schindler's List?' Danny Elgarat, brother of hostage Itzik Elgarat, had harsh words for the Defense Minister. 'Here sits a man accountable for selecting the hostages, responsible for the abandonment of 70 hostages in Gaza. He is the defense minister—but where is the defense? In truth, he is the minister of abandonment,' Elgarat said. The hearing ended half an hour earlier than scheduled, after which Katz embraced the family members even as they continued to criticize him.

Turkish chief rabbi dead at 84	According to local media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan called leaders of the Jewish community to convey his condolences. By JNS Turkish Chief Rabbi Ishak Haleva died on Tuesday at the age of 84 after serving for 23 years in the position, the country’s Chief Rabbinate said. 'We mourn the departure of our hakham bashi [chief rabbi], Ishak Haleva, who always believed in unity, peace, and love. He led our community with this belief for many years,' the body stated. Haleva became the chief rabbi of the Muslim-majority nation in 2002, succeeding Chief Rabbi David Asseo. During his tenure, Haleva also served on the Presidium Council of the Alliance of Rabbis in Islamic States and taught Jewish history and Hebrew at Turkish universities. The Istanbul-based Alliance of Rabbis in Islamic States mourned Haleva as 'our rabbi and teacher, member and president of the Alliance of Rabbis in Islamic States, the leader of Turkish Jewry, the chief rabbi.' Israeli President Isaac Herzog said the rabbi would be remembered as 'a great leader and educator, a man who not only led the historic Jewish community in Turkey, but was a champion of dialogue and friendship between peoples of all faiths, especially between Jews and Muslims.' The legacy of Haleva, who was born in Istanbul in 1940 and received his education at Jerusalem’s Sephardic Porat Yosef Yeshivah, 'will serve as a guiding light for many generations to come,' he added. 'I will never forget the moving moments of prayer we shared together with the community at the synagogue in Istanbul when they hosted me there a few years ago,' stated Herzog in a social media post. According to local media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan called leaders of the Jewish community to convey his condolences. Though the vast majority of Turkish Jews have immigrated to Israel in recent decades, the country still has a Jewish population estimated at 15,000 to 20,000 people, the vast majority of whom live in Istanbul. Non-Muslim citizens of Turkey, including Jews, suffer from institutional violations of their freedom of religion, according to a 2022 report. Erdoğan has become more hostile toward Israel and closer to Hamas since the terrorist group’s assault on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. In May, the Turkish leader called Netanyahu a 'vampire who feeds on blood,' and urged Muslims to fight the Jewish state. Two months later, Erdoğan told Newsweek that Palestinian terrorists from the Gaza Strip were 'simply defending their homes, streets and homeland' on Oct. 7.

Israeli lawmakers split on ceasefire deal, hostage release terms	Under the terms of the emerging ceasefire, it is expected that the first 33 hostages to be released will be humanitarian cases — women, children, elderly and sick. By Sveta Listratov, TPSUnder the terms of the emerging ceasefire, it is expected that the first 33 hostages to be released will be humanitarian cases — women, children, elderly and sick. Knesset members were divided over an emerging ceasefire and hostage agreement with Hamas on Tuesday. Supporters insisted it was necessary to bring the captives home as soon as possible while critics said the deal threatened Israeli security. 'All our hostages must be returned in one operation,' Likud MK Tali Gottlieb insisted to The Press Service of Israel. 'I’m not debating the cost, and as long as Herzi Halevi remains Chief of Staff [of the Israel Defense Forces], he won’t allow Hamas to be defeated. Instead, he continues with raids rather than conquest and control of enemy territory,' she added. 'So, it has to be all or nothing. No phased releases, no steps. Either everyone returns, or no one does. Hamas can wait for Trump’s presidency, when we will impose such a heavy siege on them that they will beg to return our hostages.' Opposition Whip MK Merav Ben Ari of Yesh Atid told TPS-IL she supported the agreement. 'The State of Israel must bring all the hostages home, whether for rehabilitation or burial in Israel. The hostages don’t have time. Every day is critical. We must bring them back and end the war in Gaza,' she said. But fellow opposition MK Yulia Malinovsky of the Israel Beitinenu party told TPS-IL she opposed the agreement. 'Months ago, a comprehensive deal could have been reached to bring all the hostages home, both the living and the dead,' Malinovsky said. 'But the Prime Minister, due to political weakness and personal interests, prevented this. Now we’re talking about a phased deal, with no guarantee that everyone will return. I still believe it’s possible to find a formula that brings everyone back in one operation. I’m crossing my fingers and hope that all our brothers and sisters return home as soon as possible, whether for recovery or burial.' Coalition MK Ohad Tal of the Religious Zionism party told TPS-IL, 'We say no to a deal that leaves most hostages in Gaza, no to a deal that frees murderous terrorists, and no to a deal that rolls back the war achievements for which soldiers gave their lives. But yes to military pressure that will force Hamas into a good deal. Yes to a deal that includes all the hostages, allows Israel to maintain its presence in Gaza, and doesn’t compromise Israel’s security.' MK Tzvi Sukkot of Otzma Yehudit said the deal 'means abandoning hostages who aren’t included in the agreement.' He was referring to reports that 33 hostages — women, children, elderly and sick — will be released while the freeing of other captives will be subject to further negotiations. 'It’s a betrayal of Israel’s security and erases the war’s achievements, paid for with the lives of many soldiers. For every hostage released, we’ll be freeing dozens of terrorists just like Yahya Sinwar, taking Israel back to October 6,' Sukkot insisted. 'This must not happen. If we cut Hamas off from humanitarian aid, implement the Generals’ Plan to clear Gaza of terrorists, and begin annexing Gaza territories, Hamas will beg for a deal and return the hostages without undermining our security or war gains.' The Generals’ Plan advocates evacuating all civilians from northern Gaza, designating the area as a closed military zone, and forcing the remaining terrorists to capitulate by cutting off all aid, including food and water. Yesh Atid lawmaker Debbie Biton insisted to TPS-IL, 'No excuses, no delays — the hostages must come home. Their lives are more important than any politics or other considerations. Yesh Atid is here to provide a safety net for any deal that saves them. Netanyahu needs to find the courage to finalize the deal he agreed to seven months ago. This is the time to restore hope to the families and act without fear.' Talks in Qatar aimed at reaching a ceasefire and hostage release agreement between Israel and Hamas are progressing with an Arab source telling The Press Service of Israel on Tuesday there is a 'high likelihood of success.' According to the source, discussions focus on the release of Palestinian prisoners, with Israel seeking to have those serving life sentences deported to countries such as Turkey, Qatar, and Egypt. Under the terms of the emerging ceasefire, it is expected that the first 33 hostages to be released will be humanitarian cases — women, children, elderly and sick. Palestinians from northern Gaza who fled to southern areas of the Strip will be allowed to return to their homes. Israeli forces will not withdraw from the Strip until all the hostages are freed. Opponents of the agreement are against any deal that does not bring home all the hostages at once. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 95 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Major shift at ICJ as pro-Israel judge poised for presidency	Her appointment to the ICJ in February 2012 broke new ground as she became the first woman from Africa to serve on the court. By Israel Hayom Judge Julia Sebutinde is set to assume the presidency of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), marking another milestone in her groundbreaking career as well as a significant shift for the court. The Ugandan jurist, who recently made headlines for her robust defense of Israel against South Africa’s genocide allegations, will take the helm following current President Nawaf Salam’s departure to form Lebanon’s next government. Born Julia Semusso in February 1954 in Uganda’s Central Province to a civil servant father and homemaker mother, Sebutinde’s journey to The Hague reflects a remarkable career. Her ascent began with her 1996 appointment to Uganda’s Supreme Court, where she distinguished herself by leading three pivotal anti-corruption investigations in her homeland. The judge’s international prominence grew with her 2005 appointment to the Special Court for Sierra Leone war crimes tribunal, where she played a crucial role in the landmark trial of Liberian President Charles Taylor. Her appointment to the ICJ in February 2012 broke new ground as she became the first woman from Africa to serve on the court. Sebutinde’s recent ruling on the Israel-Hamas war has particularly resonated in international legal circles. She dismissed South Africa’s requests for temporary injunctions to halt the Gaza war, asserting that the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people is fundamentally political rather than legal in both its nature and historical context, and therefore falls outside the court’s purview. Her stance, however, has created diplomatic ripples. Uganda’s U.N. Ambassador Adonia Ayebare publicly distanced his government from her position, emphasizing that her ICJ decision does not reflect Uganda’s official stance. The transition in leadership comes at a crucial juncture, with Israel scheduled to present its defense brief against South Africa’s case in July. According to the court’s statutory framework, the president – elected every three years through a panel member vote – oversees the institution’s administrative affairs and chairs its panels, wielding a decisive vote in cases of judicial deadlock. The Lebanese parliament’s recent acceptance of newly elected President Joseph Aoun’s request to task Salam with government formation has necessitated this change in ICJ leadership. As Salam steps down, the United Nations faces the additional task of selecting a new judge to represent the Asia region on the court. Sebutinde and Salam were both elected to their ICJ positions in February 2024, making this rapid transition particularly noteworthy in the court’s history. Her elevation to the presidency not only marks a personal achievement but also comes at a critical time for international justice and Middle East diplomacy.

Report: Hamas has agreed to terms of hostage deal	Hamas terror organization has reportedly accepted a proposed hostage deal and Gaza ceasefire, while Israel mulls the latest draft. By World Israel News Staff The politburo of the Hamas terror organization has accepted the latest draft of a proposed ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, during which Israeli hostages would be freed in exchange for the release of hundreds of jailed Palestinian terrorists, The Associated Press reported Tuesday afternoon. According to the report, which cited two officials involved in the negotiations, the efforts to secure a deal are now nearly completion, and could be determined by Israel's response to the latest proposal. 'Today, we are at the closest point ever to having a deal,' said Majed al-Ansari, a spokesman for the Qatari Foreign Ministry, saying the two sides have 'overcome the major differences.' 'We have handed over drafts of the ceasefire agreement to both sides, and talks are now ongoing on the final detail.' Hamas said in a statement Tuesday that talks were now in their 'final stage.' An Israeli official who spoke with AP, however, downplayed the claim, saying only that progress had been made, while adding that the details of a final agreement had yet to be hammered out. AP claimed to have obtained a copy of the tentative agreement, which was verified by an Egyptian official and a member of Hamas. Multiple sources who spoke with The Jerusalem Post said a deal could be announced in the next 24 hours, barring any last minute surprises. 'The next 24 hours will be pivotal to reaching the deal,' one official said. According to a report by the BBC Tuesday, if the current proposal is adopted, Hamas will release three Israeli hostages on the first day of the ceasefire, with another four slated to be released in the following week. In total, 33-34 Israeli hostages are expected to be freed during the first phase of a ceasefire, in exchange for the release of over 1,000 jailed Palestinian terrorists, including 190 serving life sentences.

Hamas has accepted a draft agreement for a Gaza ceasefire and the...	Today, we are at the closest point ever to having a deal,' Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said at a weekly briefing Tuesday. By The Associated Press Hamas has accepted a draft agreement for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the release of dozens of hostages, two officials involved in the talks said Tuesday. Mediator Qatar said the negotiations were at the 'closest point' yet to sealing a deal. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the proposed agreement, and an Egyptian official and a Hamas official confirmed its authenticity. An Israeli official said progress has been made, but the details are being finalized. The plan would need to be submitted to the Israeli Cabinet for final approval. All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks. The United States, Egypt and Qatar have spent the past year trying to mediate an end the 15-month war and secure the release of dozens of hostages captured in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered it. Some 100 Israelis are still captive inside Gaza, and the military believes at least a third them are dead. Officials have expressed mounting optimism that they can conclude an agreement ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, whose Mideast envoy has joined the negotiations. Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said at a weekly briefing Tuesday that the ongoing negotiations are positive and productive, while declining to get into the details of the sensitive talks. 'Today, we are at the closest point ever to having a deal,' he said. Hamas, meanwhile, said in a statement that the ongoing negotiations had reached their 'final stage.' A three-phase agreement The three-phase agreement — based on a framework laid out by U.S. President Joe Biden and endorsed by the U.N. Security Council — would begin with the gradual release of 33 hostages over a six-week period, including women, children, older adults and wounded civilians in exchange for potentially hundreds of Palestinian women and children imprisoned by Israel. Among the 33 would be five female Israeli soldiers, each of whom would be released in exchange for 50 Palestinian prisoners, including 30 convicted terrorists who are serving life sentences. By the end of the first phase, all civilian captives — living or dead — will have been released. During this first, 42-day phase, Israeli forces would withdraw from population centers, Palestinians would be allowed to start returning to their homes in northern Gaza and there would be a surge of humanitarian aid, with some 600 trucks entering each day. Details of the second phase still must be negotiated during the first. Those details remain difficult to resolve — and the deal does not include written guarantees that the ceasefire will continue until a deal is reached. That leaves the potential for Israel to resume its military campaign after the first phase ends. The three mediators, however, have given Hamas verbal guarantees that negotiations will continue as planned and that they will press for a deal to implement the second and third phases before the end of the first, the Egyptian official said. The deal would allow Israel throughout the first phase to remain in control of the Philadelphi Corridor, the band of territory along Gaza’s border with Egypt, which Hamas had initially demanded Israel withdraw from. But Israel would pull out from the Netzarim Corridor, a belt across central Gaza where it had sought a mechanism for searching Palestinians for arms when they return to the territory's north. In the second phase, Hamas would release the remaining living captives, mainly male soldiers, in exchange for more prisoners and the 'complete withdrawal' of Israeli forces from Gaza, according to the draft agreement. But Hamas has said it will not free the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a complete Israeli withdrawal, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has in the past vowed to resume fighting unless Hamas’s military and governing capabilities are eliminated. Unless an alternative government for Gaza is worked out in those talks, it could leave Hamas in charge of the territory. In a third phase, the bodies of remaining hostages would be returned in exchange for a three- to five-year reconstruction plan to be carried out in Gaza under international supervision. Growing pressure ahead of Trump's inauguration Israel and Hamas have come under renewed pressure to halt the conflict in the lead-up to Trump's inauguration next week. His Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, recently joined U.S., Egyptian and Qatari mediators in the Gulf country’s capital, Doha. Trump said late Monday that a ceasefire was 'very close.' 'I understand &#8230; there’s been a handshake and they are getting it finished — and maybe by the end of the week,' he told the American cable channel Newsmax. Israel and its close ally the United States have blamed setbacks on Hamas. Hamas-led terrorists killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted another 250. Around half those hostages were freed during a brief ceasefire in November 2023.

Seven hostages to be released in first week of ceasefire – report	Meanwhile the PA is reportedly insisting on ruling Gaza without Hamas on the 'day after.' By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Three hostages are to be released on the first day an Israel-Hamas deal goes into effect, the BBC reported Tuesday, citing a Palestinian official with knowledge of the negotiations. Immediately afterwards, the IDF will begin withdrawing from populated areas of Gaza, said the official. Another four people will be freed the following week, in exchange for which residents of northern Gaza will be allowed to start returning to their homes. A massive number of Palestinian security prisoners will be freed from Israeli jails as Hamas releases a total of 34 hostages in the first stage. Out of 1,000 prisoners, fully 190 will be hardened terrorists who have already served over 15 years of their sentences, said the official. Hamas has allegedly agreed to the IDF staying for some six weeks in an 800-meter-wide zone in the Philadelphi Corridor between Gaza and Egypt, which Israel considers the terrorists’ weapons pipeline. According to Ynet, the first hostages to be released will be women and children, then older men and some younger ones. There are some younger men who have chronic illnesses and can be considered 'humanitarian' cases, as the others are. While all of these hostages are supposedly alive, the report said that Israel is prepared to receive bodies as well. This would leave alive in captivity at least 22 Israelis, all young men, among them four soldiers, two pairs of brothers of seven in total forcibly taken from their kibbutz homes, and 11 who were kidnapped from the Nova festival. Several foreign workers, including eight Thais and one from Nepal, are also still considered to be alive, although Hamas has never released any evidence of this. Negotiations for their return, as well as for the 36 hostages already known to be dead, is to start on Day 16 of the first stage. In parallel to the hostage negotiations, inter-Arab discussions are being held about the 'day after' Israel pulls out from the Gaza Strip, if such a final stage of an agreement can be reached. An Egyptian source who is involved in talks being held in Egypt with the Palestinian Authority (PA) told Kan News that Cairo had tried to convince the PA to establish a joint committee with Hamas to oversee civilian affairs. However, the PA is insisting on running Gaza alone, without any Hamas participation, the source said, because Ramallah does not trust the Islamists, who are trying to destabilize the Authority in Judea and Samaria 'and introduce an Iranian agenda there,' the report said. Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar has reported that Egypt and Qatar have given guarantees that Hamas will not rule the Gaza Strip again. Jerusalem has so far held firm against the PA being in charge of Gaza, considering the nationalist Palestinians just as pro-terror as their Islamic brothers in Gaza.

Assad torture chief gunned down in Syrian street	We will not hesitate to hold accountable the criminals, murderers, security and army officers involved in torturing the Syrian people,' the new Syrian leader Al-Sharaa said. By Jewish Breaking News Syria’s fallen dictator Bashar Al Assad didn’t slaughter his people on his own. His brutal reign was enforced through a vast network of local officials and informants thirsting for innocent blood. One of those men was Mazen Kneneh. Described by the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights as 'one of the best-known loyalists of the former regime,' Kneneh was the Mayor of the Syrian city of Dummar. He was responsible for the torture of thousands of young men in Assad’s notorious prison system. On Friday, his life came to an abrupt end when fighters linked to Syria’s new Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) administration shot him in the head on a public street. Kneneh’s bloodied body was left tied to a tree trunk for onlookers to see, AFP reports. While HTS leader Ahmed Al-Sharaa has offered amnesty to military conscripts, he’s also promised to pursue Assad’s most notorious henchmen. 'We will not hesitate to hold accountable the criminals, murderers, security and army officers involved in torturing the Syrian people,' Al-Sharaa said. 'We will offer rewards to anyone who provides information about senior army and security officers involved in war crimes.' He has already made high-profile arrests, including former military official Mohammed Kanjo Hassan, who was responsible for issuing death sentences in Syria’s notorious Sednaya prison. Situated roughly 20 miles to the north of Damascus, Sednaya prison has since emerged as a powerful emblem of Assad’s savagery. According to Amnesty International estimates, the facility held up to 20,000 people at its peak, comprising of two distinct buildings – the 'red building' primarily housed civilian prisoners while the 'white building' generally reserved for Syrian military officers and soldiers. Former inmates describe to Amnesty being kept in complete darkness, with floors covered in blood and perspiration. Guards would seize blankets and clothing if prisoners dared to speak or rest 'without permission,' and family members were forced to torture one another under threat of execution. The Association of Detainees and Missing Persons in Syria estimates that over 30,000 individuals died there through execution, torture, inadequate medical care, and starvation.

Trump’s Israel agenda: Immediate critical decisions await	The incoming administration’s approach encompasses multiple strategies: stringent American sanctions, enhanced Israeli-American military collaboration and the potential formation of a broader international coalition. By Ariel Kahana, JNS As Donald Trump prepares to reclaim the White House in seven days, an extensive portfolio of international and domestic challenges awaits—with Israel’s security concerns commanding significant attention. Unlike his first term, Trump enters office on Jan. 20 following methodical preparation and with a clear grasp of both priorities and implementation strategies. The Iranian nuclear threat stands as the foremost security concern. Having withdrawn from the nuclear agreement in 2018 during his previous term, Trump demonstrates acute awareness of the immediate danger Tehran represents. Two assassination attempts by the ayatollah’s regime have only reinforced his determination for a swift resolution. The incoming administration’s approach encompasses multiple strategies: stringent American sanctions, enhanced Israeli-American military collaboration and the potential formation of a broader international coalition. Operational and military support The ammunition shortage crisis, stemming from the Biden administration’s restrictions on certain munitions, heads Israel’s immediate requirements. Trump’s transition team has indicated plans for comprehensive removal of these restrictions and expedited military shipments to the Israel Defense Forces within the first 48 hours after his inauguration. The Gaza war presents another urgent priority. The incoming president has articulated a more definitive stance on concluding the war—following an Israeli victory—than has the current Israeli leadership. While an immediate cessation is not expected, Trump’s team anticipates resolution within months. The administration plans to request that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu provide a detailed strategic roadmap for bringing the campaign to its conclusion. Diplomatic and legal initiatives In what would be a significant move against international legal pressure targeting Israel, Trump plans immediate action regarding the International Criminal Court in The Hague (ICC). As reported by Israel Hayom, comprehensive sanctions will target the institution and its personnel, including economic restrictions and U.S. entry bans. This executive action parallels congressional initiatives for stringent legislation against the court and its collaborators. The administration also plans to swiftly address the Biden-era sanctions affecting Israeli citizens, particularly those targeting Jewish residents of Judea and Samaria and Tzav 9 movement leaders who opposed Hamas supply transfers. Trump’s team has committed to removing these restrictions during their initial days in office. Regional dynamics and strategic relationships The completion of the Abraham Accords through Israeli-Saudi normalization remains a shared objective, though significant challenges persist. Saudi Arabia’s nuclear development aspirations conflict with Israeli security principles, while their expectation of Israeli acknowledgment regarding a future Palestinian state faces increased resistance following the Oct. 7 massacre. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, US President Donald Trump, United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Abdullatif bin Rashid Al-Zayani, Foreign Minister of Bahrain, attend the Abraham Accords Signing Ceremony at the White House in Washington, D.C., Sept. 15, 2020. (Photo by Avi Ohayon/GPO.) Israel’s strategic concerns extend to the growing influence of Muslim Brotherhood-aligned states. This includes Turkey’s expanding regional role, its Syrian protectorate and Qatar’s mounting influence in the West through sophisticated diplomacy and economic leverage. While unaddressed in initial discussions between the incoming administration and Netanyahu, these developments demand increasing attention. The Palestinian question, central to Trump’s first-term 'Deal of the Century,' now occupies a markedly lower priority. While his national security appointees largely align with Israeli right-wing positions, the president’s current stance remains undefined. Looking forward Additional bilateral matters await discussion, including Israel’s potential support for various American global initiatives. The United States also maintains its reservations about Chinese involvement in Israeli strategic investments. These issues are considerably interconnected: Addressing Iran’s nuclear program could influence Saudi nuclear ambitions, while expedited military support could accelerate conflict resolution in Gaza. Two fundamental principles warrant consideration. First, contemporary leadership typically dedicates 80% of its attention to emerging challenges rather than planned initiatives. Second, Trump—historically considered Israel’s strongest presidential ally—employs unconventional approaches and strategic surprises to achieve breakthrough results. While such behavior may emerge, it is unlikely to disadvantage Israeli interests.

National Security Council warns Israelis of escalating Iranian ki...	In November, Israeli-Moldovan Rabbi Zvi Kogan was abducted and killed in the United Arab Emirates. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel’s National Security Council warned citizens of escalating Iranian efforts to harm Israelis abroad on Tuesday. This follows an incident in which Iranian operatives attempted to lure an Israeli businessman to the United Arab Emirates for a potential kidnapping. According to the NSC, Iranian agents posing as representatives of Al-Arabiya Farsi, the Persian-language branch of a Saudi media outlet, contacted the businessman via Telegram. Claiming they sought an interview about the Iranian regime, they invited the Israeli to a meeting in Dubai. The agents also sent malicious files designed to access his mobile phone. But the businessman became suspicious and reported the contact to the National Intelligence Service, whose investigation confirmed the plot. In December, The Press Service of Israel reported on an Iranian plot to kidnap Israeli journalist Babak Itzhaki by luring him to a Turkish city near the Iranian border. In November, Israeli-Moldovan Rabbi Zvi Kogan was abducted and killed in the United Arab Emirates. Three Uzbek nationals were arrested and Israeli officials believe they were working on behalf of Iran. The NSC cautioned Israelis against sharing sensitive personal details, such as phone numbers, travel plans, or real-time locations, through social media or messaging platforms. When contacted by unknown individuals, the NSC recommended verifying the identity of their contacts through direct communication, such as audio or video calls. The NSC also warned against downloading unsolicited files or links.

Hostages’ relatives warn against ‘dangerous’ deal with Hamas	Hundreds of opponents of the emerging ceasefire deal staged a protest in Jerusalem on Monday night, blocking the entrance to the capital for about an hour. By Canaan Lidor, JNS Relatives of hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza on Monday urged right-wing politicians to leave the government if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agrees to a deal with the terror group that leaves some abducted Israelis in captivity. 'Unless the deal includes all the hostages unconditionally, living and dead, in one go, we call on the Religious Zionist and Otzma Yehudit parties, along with the Likud Knesset lawmakers who have so far only supported a full deal, to immediately announce that they are pulling out of the government,' the Tikva Forum of hostages’ relatives wrote. 'Any partial deal with Hamas will turn the hostages into [even more] valuable assets, and will endanger the lives of soldiers and other hostages,' the statement continued. Hundreds of opponents of the emerging ceasefire deal staged a protest in Jerusalem on Monday night, blocking the entrance to the capital for about an hour. Some protesters carried signs that read: 'No to a deal with the devil.' Among the protesters was National Missions Minister Orit Strock of the Religious Zionism Party, which along with Otzma Yehudit had previously announced its opposition to the published terms of the deal. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a different group of relatives, also wrote that it seeks a deal that would ensure the return of all the hostages. But that statement stopped short of calling on the government to reject a partial deal. The Families Forum has expressed harsher criticism of the government than Tikva and called for making greater concessions to get hostages back. The calls of both groups followed reports of a breakthrough in ceasefire talks with Hamas. The final terms of the agreement have not yet been officially announced, but reports about it, including by Israel’s Kan public broadcaster on Monday, speak of a two-phase deal that would begin with the release of 33 out of about 100 hostages believed to be in Hamas’s hands over a 42-day ceasefire. Israel would free 1,300 Palestinian terrorists and prisoners, including hundreds serving life sentences. The 33 hostages would include female soldiers, women and men over the age of 50, as well as ill and wounded hostages. How many of the 33 are still alive is unknown. The second phase of the deal would include the release of the remaining hostages and talks about a permanent ceasefire, according to Kan. The report did not include a timeframe for the second phase. According to Kan, the Israel Defense Forces would withdraw from the Philadelphia Corridor—the border separating the Gaza Strip from Egypt—at the end of the first phase. Before it attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas smuggled hundreds of tons of weapons through the corridor, which Netanyahu in August vowed would remain under Israeli control.

Gaza building collapse that killed 5 soldiers likely result of ac...	Hamas meanwhile took credit for collapsing the building. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The five soldiers from the Nahal Brigade’s Reconnaissance Battalion who were killed Monday in northern Gaza may have been victims of their own explosives, according to the initial findings of an IDF investigation. The troops were preparing to detonate a building in Beit Hanoun when a chain of charges exploded, causing the structure to collapse on them. Eight other soldiers in the battalion were seriously wounded in the explosion. While the army said that its probe is still ongoing, Hamas was quick to take credit for their deaths. Saying that the IDF has 'has hidden the true extent of its losses,' Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades spokesman Abu Obeida posted to Telegram Monday that the terrorist forces had killed 'more than' ten soldiers over the last three days. 'Our members are still dealing it harsh blows,' he said. On Saturday three other Nahal soldiers and a heavy-equipment driver of the Armored Brigade were killed and six wounded, two very seriously, in a Hamas ambush of their open jeeps traveling in a convoy through the same city. In this case, the army’s preliminary investigation showed that the terrorists set off a remote- controlled explosive device near one of the vehicles and then perhaps opened fire on the troops. Of the five killed, team leader Capt. Yair Yaakov Shushan of Ma’alot-Tarshiha was the oldest, at 23. Upon completion of his officer’s course last summer, he had received a certificate of excellence from the prime minister and the chief of staff. A close friend since early childhood, Oz Weizman, told Kan Reshet Bet that Shushan had 'lived with startling intensity,' while his high school principal called him 'brilliant and determined with a lot of humility. He knew how to connect with everyone quickly.' Staff Sgt. Guy Karmiel, 20, from Gedera, loved sports and diving and was 'a very brave boy' who had been 'extremely happy to be accepted to the Reconnaissance group, to see the most combat possible,' said his uncle, Tal Rivan. Staff Sgt. Yahav Hadar, 20, from Kfar Tavor had graduated the Nahal course with honors, said his mother, Sharon, but 'was very modest and made sure not to talk about himself. He always helped others, it was important to him to take care of his sisters and he was always concerned about their well-being.' Staff Sgt. Yoav Feffer, 19, from Herzliya, was friends with Itay Regev, a Hamas hostage who was freed in November 2023 along with 85 other Israeli minors and women. Regev said he loved Feffer 'with all his heart,' eulogizing him as one who 'would bring light into every place he entered,' and vowing to memorialize him 'in every possible way.' Staff Sgt. Aviel Wiseman, 20, was from the small village of Poria Illit near the Kinneret. Jordan Valley Regional Council head Idan Grinbaum mourned him as 'the fourth generation of a fighting family' and the 'salt of the earth.' The IDF has been fighting for weeks to clear Beit Hanoun and other areas in the northern part of Gaza of the Hamas forces that have been rebuilt there in the last several months.

Study by Israel Antiquities Authority excavator suggests recently discovered complex found in the City of David was used for ritual purposes, competing with King Solomon's Temple - until King Hezekiah banned the cultic practice. By World Israel News Staff An ancient complex discovered outside the Old City of Jerusalem was likely used as a center for religious rituals during the First Temple period, according to a new study, competing with the Temple of King Solomon. The unique structure, uncovered by the Israel Antiquities Authority on the eastern slope of the City of David, within the Jerusalem Walls National Park, features eight rock-hewn rooms containing an altar, a standing stone (masseba), an oil press, and a winepress. In a new article published in the scientific journal ‘Atiqot, excavation director Eli Shukron suggests that the structure was used by the residents of Judah for cultic, religious practice. This exceptional structure, dating to the First Temple period, was revealed during excavations conducted by the Israel Antiquities Authority in the City of David. The newly published article in ‘Atiqot proposes that the unique structure, comprising a series of eight rock-hewn rooms, was used for ritual purposes while the Temple still stood on the Temple Mount, just a few hundred meters away. It is the only known ritual structure from this period discovered in Jerusalem and one of the very few found in the land of Israel. The uncovered structure covers an area of approximately 220 square meters and contains eight rock-hewn rooms, each with different installations: An oil press for producing oil, a winepress for making wine, a carved installation with a drainage channel, identified by researchers as an altar, and a large standing stone (masseba), next to which ritual activity was likely practiced. One room’s floor displayed mysterious V-shaped carving marks, the purpose of which remains unclear. Reconstruction of ritual structure in the City of David. (Shalom Kveller, City of David) According to Eli Shukron, the excavator of the site, these carvings may have served as a base for a tripod—an installation with three legs used for ritual activities. In a small cave carved on the edge of the structure, a cache of objects dating to the eighth century BCE was uncovered, including cooking pots, jars bearing fragments of ancient Hebrew inscriptions, loom weights, scarabs, stamped seals with decorative motifs, and grinding stones used for crushing grains. The authors of the article from the Center for Research on Ancient Jerusalem, led by archaeologist Eli Shukron, who directed the excavation on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority, believe that the structure was in use until the 8th century BCE, the middle of the period when the Kings of Judah ruled. 'The structure ceased to function during the 8th century BCE, possibly as part of King Hezekiah’s religious reform,' Shukron said. 'According to the Bible, Hezekiah sought to centralize worship at the Temple in Jerusalem, abolishing the ritual sites scattered across the kingdom. The Bible describes how, during the First Temple period, additional ritual sites operated outside the Temple, and two kings of Judah—Hezekiah and Josiah—implemented reforms to eliminate these sites and concentrate worship at the Temple.' 'When we began excavating the City of David in 2010, we discovered that the site had been sealed with fill from the 8th century BCE, indicating it had fallen out of use during that time,' says Shukron. 'The standing stone we uncovered remained upright in its original place, and the other rooms in the structure were also well-preserved.' Although the current excavation began in 2010, the northern part of the structure was first uncovered in 1909 by Montague Parker, a British adventurer who came to Jerusalem in search of the Ark of the Covenant and the Temple treasures. Shukron’s excavation continued over several excavation seasons. 'This unique structure uncovered in the City of David is an exciting testimony to Jerusalem's rich past,' said Amichai Eliyahu, Israel's Minister of Heritage. 'Such discoveries make our connection and historic roots – going back thousands of years – tangible, in Jerusalem and other sites where the Jewish culture and belief system emerged.'

Houthi missile targets central Israel; 11 injured running to shel...	Missile fragment damages home in Jerusalem suburb, comes after previous Houthi missile attack hours earlier. By World Israel News Staff A ballistic missile launched by the Houthis at central Israel in the early hours of Tuesday morning sent millions of Israelis scrambling for shelter, with 11 people sustaining injuries while running to protected areas. Sirens sounded in the major cities of Tel Aviv, Modi'in, and Lod, as well as the Jerusalem area and Ben-Gurion Airport, at around 3 a.m. The Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency response organization reported that 11 people throughout the country had been hurt while making their way to bomb shelters. Another four people were treated by MDA paramedics for acute anxiety. Images circulating on social media showed missile fragments that struck the roof of a home in Mevo Beitar, a Jerusalem suburb, causing damage. 'When we went out for our usual morning walk we saw broken tiles, it was only when we looked up did we see a missile on our roof,' Michal Wexler, the owner of the home, told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet.. 'It’s not the smallest part [of the missile] but we did not hear anything really unusual in the night,' she added. Wexler and her family were not injured in the incident. The IDF said it had made several attempts to intercept the missile as it reached Israeli airspace. Hours earlier, on Monday evening, the Houthis launched a ballistic missile that caused sirens to sound in northern Israel's Afula area and throughout the Samaria region. No one was reported to be injured in that launch, which was intercepted by the IDF. In recent weeks, the Houthis have stepped up their attacks against Israel, lobbing dozens of explosive drones and missiles at the Jewish State. The Houthis have claimed that they will continue attacking Israel as long as the IDF is fighting Hamas in the Gaza Strip. It's unclear if a ceasefire between Israel and the Hamas terror group would end the Houthis' attacks on the Jewish State.

Will the government collapse after Hamas hostage deal?	Families of fallen soldiers and terror victims urge Smotrich, Ben-Gvir to fight against 'surrender to Hamas.' By World Israel News Staff A ceasefire and hostage deal with the Hamas terror group appears imminent, raising questions about whether the agreement may spell the end of the current Israeli government coalition. The Religious Zionism party, led by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who is the head of Otzma Yehudit faction, have both expressed their opposition to the deal. Smotrich said that his party will not support the agreement, which he deemed a 'catastrophe for Israel's national security.' In a media statement, Smotrich described the truce as a 'a surrender deal that would include releasing terrorists, stopping the war and dissolving the achievements that were bought with much blood, and abandoning many hostages.' The current outline for the hostage deal would see 33 hostages - an unknown number of them alive - released in the first stage. Those hostages include all women and men over the age of 50. In exchange, thousands of Palestinian terrorists, including those serving life sentences for murdering Israelis in terror attacks, would be freed from Israeli prisons. Healthy men under the age of 50, including soldiers, would be left in Hamas captivity, pending further negotiations for the next stage of the deal. 'The emerging deal is a security and moral bankruptcy. It is a complete surrender to Hamas, which will lead to the strengthening of terrorism and endanger the security of Israeli civilians. A government that approves such a deal is unworthy of continuing to rule,' the families of fallen soldiers and victims of terror attacks wrote to Smotrich and Ben-Gvir in an open letter. The families, who are part of the Choosing Life advocacy group, demanded that the lawmakers vote against the deal and threaten to bring down the government if it moves forward. 'This is a moment of truth – you must lead this fight, even if it means leaving the government,' the families wrote. 'This is a moral, ethical, and national call – we must not surrender to terrorism. The responsibility is on you.' According to a report from Hebrew-language outlet Walla, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has met with both Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, in the hopes of persuading them to vote against the agreement while remaining in the coalition.

‘On the brink’ – Biden touts impending Gaza deal, pushes Palestin...	President Biden makes his final foreign policy address a week before leaving office, calling for Palestinian self-determination, the reconstruction of Gaza, and the return of Israeli hostages. By World Israel News Staff President Joe Biden on Monday urged negotiators in Doha, Qatar to complete hostage deal and ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, expressing optimism a final agreement can be reached in the near future. Speaking at a State Department event Monday evening, Biden gave his final foreign policy address before leaving office next week, highlighting the Arab-Israeli conflict and the weakening of the Iranian government over the past year. Ceasefire talks, Biden said, now appear to be 'finally coming to fruition,' with negotiators 'on the brink' of a permanent Gaza truce which would secure the release of the 98 Israeli hostages still held in the Gaza Strip. 'The deal we've structured would free the hostages, halt the fighting, provide security to Israel and allow us to significantly surge humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians who have suffered terribly in this war that Hamas started,' Biden said. 'I have learned in many years in public service to never, never, never, ever give up,' Biden continued. 'I spoke to the Prime Minister of Israel yesterday. I spoke to the Emir of Qatar today. I look forward to speaking with President Sisi soon. We're pressing hard to close this.' Biden reiterated his support for Palestinian statehood, saying Palestinian Arabs deserve 'the right to determine their own future,' without explicitly mentioning the establishment of a Palestinian state. 'The Palestinian people deserve peace and the right to determine their own futures, Israel deserves peace and real security. And the hostages and their families deserve to be reunited. And so we're working urgently to close this deal.' The president lamented the impact of the ongoing war on Gaza's population, calling for the area's reconstruction and rehabilitation after a truce is reached. Gazans have 'been through hell,' Biden said, 'so many innocent people have been killed, so many communities have been destroyed.' Turning to Iran, Biden highlighted the pro-U.S. coalition which helped Israel repel two large-scale attacks by Iran, and said that 15 months after the October 7th invasion and proxy warfare against Israel via Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, Iran is its weakest point in decades. 'Did you ever think we’d be where we are with Iran?' Biden asked. 'Twice they failed because the United States organized a coalition of countries to stop them and I ordered US aircraft to come to the defense of Israel.' 'All told, Iran is weaker than it has been in decades.'

Anti-Israel NGO demands arrest of Israeli general in Rome	The Hind Rajab Foundation asks Italian authorities to arrest IDF general, who heads unit that facilitates the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff An anti-Israel organization targeted an Israeli general traveling in Italy on Monday, demanding that local police arrest him on war crimes charges. The Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) is a pro-Hamas, anti-Israel advocacy group dedicated to stalking members of the Israeli military and requesting that local authorities to detain them when they travel abroad. The HRF attempted to orchestrate the arrest of IDF Major General Ghassan Alian, who was in Rome for a meeting. Alian, a Druze-Israeli, is the head of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), which helps facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid and infrastructural support to Gaza and PA-controlled areas in Judea and Samaria. 'We have filed a case against him in the International Criminal Court asking them to activate any arrest warrant that they have against him, or if not issue a new one, and we have also informed the Italian authorities,' HRF chairman Dyab Abou Jahjah told the far-left YouTube channel Democracy Now. Notably, Abou Jahjah is a former member of Hezbollah who admitted to receiving 'some military training' from the terror organization. In a post on their X account, HRF accused Alian of being complicit in 'genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.' Alian 'supervised and enforced a total siege on Gaza, cutting off essential resources such as food, water, electricity, and medical supplies,' the HRF claimed, without providing evidence to support that allegation. In an October 2023 speech, Alian referred to Hamas' acts of brutality during the October 7th terror onslaught - including rape, beheadings, and the murder of children and the elderly - as being 'inhuman.' In the same speech, Alian called the Hamas perpetrators who carried out the attack 'human animals.' Those statements, HRF claim, prove that Alian has 'genocidal intent' towards Gazans.

‘A lot of trouble’ if no hostage deal reached, Trump warns	A week before his inauguration, President-elect Donald Trump speaks out on apparent breakthrough in hostage deal talks, says an agreement 'must get done,' warning of 'trouble like they have never seen before' if negotiations fail. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President-elect Donald Trump warned of unprecedented repercussions should negotiators in Doha, Qatar fail to secure a hostage deal and ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. Speaking with Newsmax on Monday night a week before his inauguration, the former president and president-elect confirmed reports from earlier in the day which claimed the Doha talks were closer than ever to achieving a deal. 'We're very close to getting it done - and they have to get it done,' Trump said. Echoing his previous warnings regarding the failure to free the remaining 98 hostages, the incoming president hinted at 'trouble' if the two sides do not achieve an agreement. 'If they don't get it done, there's going to be a lot of trouble out there - a lot of trouble like they have never seen before,' Trump warned. But the president-elect also expressed optimism at the prospects of an agreement being inked in the near future, saying that there had been a 'handshake' between the two sides. 'They will get it done. I understand there’s been a handshake and they’re getting it finished and maybe by the end of the week. But it has to take place.' Multiple Israeli media outlets, along with Reuters and The Associated Press, reported Monday that a breakthrough had been achieved in the talks, and that the Qatari mediators had penned a final draft of a potential agreement. The draft, officials cited by the reports said, has been sent to Israeli leaders and the Hamas politburo for final approval, with Hamas' leadership reportedly the deciding factor. According to Israeli reports, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been pressuring Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and his Religious Zionist Party not to bolt the government should a deal be reached. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir is expected to resign, taking his Otzma Yehudit out of the government if the deal now under consideration is ratified, leaving the government with a slim majority of 62 seats.

Danon urges UNSC not to repeat mistakes in previous Lebanon cease...	Danon demanded that the UNSC ensure that UNIFIL 'work in a much more robust and effective way to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and the recent ceasefire understandings.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, wrote a letter to the UN Security Council urging them not to repeat past mistakes by allowing Hezbollah to violate the ceasefire agreement. Danon called on the UNSC to monitor The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which previously failed to enforce the ceasefire in Lebanon and permitted Hezbollah to commit multiple violations. Danon wrote, 'Israel alerted this esteemed Council for years on the severe breaches of Resolution 1701 and the ensuing risks posed to regional security' long before October 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began firing missiles into Israel. He continued, 'Israel has sounded the alarm bells in consistent letters and briefings, alerting that Hezbollah is building a massive military infrastructure south of the Litani River and beyond, that advanced weapon systems are being smuggled from Iran into Lebanon in flagrant breach of UNSCR 1701, but unfortunately no action was taken.' Danon pointed out that the consequence of ignoring Israel's warnings was that Hezbollah that '22,000 rockets, over 1,500 anti-tank missiles and over 700 drones were fired by Hezbollah at Israeli communities throughout the war, forcing over 63,000 Israeli civilians to evacuate their homes for more than a year, up till today.' Danon demanded that the UNSC ensure that UNIFIL 'work in a much more robust and effective way to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and the recent ceasefire understandings…and to insist that all terrorist infrastructure present in Lebanon is removed and to make sure any attempt to smuggle arms to Hezbollah is thwarted.' He concluded, 'Israel will not compromise on the security of its citizens. We will not return to the years before October 8, 2023, and we will not tolerate Hezbollah's violations of the ceasefire agreement.' Captured Hezbollah terrorists taken to Israel for questioning told interrogators that the Iran-backed terror group paid peacekeepers to use UNIFIL positions in southern Lebanon. The report added that the terrorists also admitted that Hezbollah took control of the force's security cameras.

Nukhba terrorists will not be released as part of hostage deal	The source reported that none of the 33 hostages selected for release in the first phase are confirmed dead. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A diplomatic source told The Jerusalem Post. that Nukhba terrorists who took part in the October 7th massacre will not be released in exchange for hostages. Although some of Palestinian prisoners slated for release in the hostage deal are serving life sentences for serious crimes, they are not part of the Nukhba terrorist forces. The diplomatic source also confirmed that none of the 33 hostages selected for release in the first phase of the deal are confirmed dead. Israel is expected to remain in 'territorial assets' including the Philadelphi corridor and a security perimeter. However, there are conflicting reports regarding how long the IDF will remain in these areas. Israel's senior delegation in Doha, including Shin Bet head Ronen Bar and Mossad Director David Barnea are currently in Qatar until an agreement is reached. An agreement to release 33 hostages in the initial phase has reportedly been approved by Israel and Hamas and may be announced Monday night or Tuesday morning. Sources have reported that after the initial release of captives, further releases would be discussed on the 16th day of the agreement. There are mixed accounts of the timing of the IDF withdrawal from Gaza with some sources saying that troops would be gradually reduced with the military remaining in the Philadelphi corridor until the last day of the agreement Some sources indicate the first phase of the agreement will last 42 days. There is some indication the agreement could be announced within hours, days or it could fall apart. A cabinet vote and a High Court of Justice ruling on petitions opposing the deal will also be required. If the deal is approved, some sources say the first group of hostages will be released promptly after the announcement. Although the list of hostages to be released in phase one originally included 34 names, the number now is 33 after the discovery of the body of Yousef Ziadne by the IDF.

JFLA usually requires applicants to have a qualified guarantor but is waving that necessity for those affected by the wildfires and offering them a fire relief loan of up to $2,000 for people of all faiths and backgrounds. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner The Jewish Free Loan Association (JFLA) is offering families and individuals affected by the Los Angeles wildfires, regardless of their race or religion, zero-interest and zero-fee loans up to $15,000. The loans can cover temporary housing, including short-term rentals and hotels, clothing, medication, the purchase of a used car, and other needs and supplies. JFLA is also offering assistance to small businesses and nonprofits by helping with the purchase of inventory, relocation costs, marketing, and the replacement of equipment. Small business and nonprofit loans are available for up to $36,000. The nonprofit organization offers zero-interest, zero-fee personal and business loans with no collateral. JFLA usually requires applicants to have a qualified guarantor but is waving that necessity for those affected by the wildfires and offering them a fire relief loan of up to $2,000 for people of all faiths and backgrounds. The organization has a limited number of loans up to $2,000 without guarantors that are available on a first-come, first serve basis. The organization has been helping the Los Angeles community since it was founded in 1904, assisting thousands of families who immigrated to the US during World War II and supporting hundreds of Iranian Jewish refugee immigrants who relocated to the US in the late 1970s and 1980s after the Iranian revolution. It is the only interest-free lending agency in the greater Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties, and has provided $18 million of interest-free loan dollars throughout the region. Wildfires have been burning throughout the Los Angeles area since Jan. 7 and at least 24 people have died. Officials said at least 12,300 structures have been damaged or destroyed, and more 100,000 people have been forced to evacuate their homes since Sunday, according to Reuters. California Gov.

Don’t be fooled by the Palestinian Authority, observers warn	Despite its current operations against terrorism in Judea and Samaria, their real reasons are not as honorable as one might think. By Israel Kasnett, JNS A casual observer might look at the Palestinian Authority today and believe it has reformed by cracking down on terror groups that seek to attack Israel, but experts who spoke with JNS warned against being taken in by appearances. 'Everything the P.A. is doing right now is part of the Trump effect. The P.A. remembers [President-elect Donald] Trump’s steps against them in the previous term and wants to show that they are capable of change,' said Shaul Bartal of the Begin Sadat Center for Strategic Research at Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan. 'In practice, this is a big show,' he added. 'To the extent that there is change, it needs to be tested in action, and right now it is not visible,' Bartal said. Even the Palestinians don’t believe the P.A. has changed, he added. 'The majority of the Palestinian public in the West Bank is not satisfied with the P.A. and there is almost no Palestinian factor that believes that this is a real change within the P.A.' The race to succeed Abbas Case in point: Jibril Rajoub, secretary-general of the Fatah Central Committee, called for continued terrorism in an interview on the official P.A. TV channel earlier this month. During the interview, as reported by the Israeli NGO Regavim, Rajoub called on Palestinian armed factions to coordinate their efforts with Fatah and not to undermine the P.A. 'From the first moment, what we need is a meeting of factions to affirm the conformity of the Authority, the conformity and legitimacy of weapons, and also the legitimacy of the resistance,' he said. Rajoub, the former head of the P.A.’s preventive security forces and current president of the Palestinian Football Association, directly encouraged terrorism, adding, 'The battle in the 1967 occupied lands is open in all means … but not at the expense of the Palestinian Authority.' In response, Israel’s Culture and Sports Minister Miki Zohar called on FIFA to dismiss Rajoub, citing his support for the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre and incitement to terrorism. According to Bartal, at the moment the entire P.A. is engaged in a 'succession battle' over who will replace P.A. chief Mahmoud Abbas, 89. He noted that in the ’90s, Rajoub 'was one of the factors who helped Israel the most to suppress Hamas.' According to Bartal, 'Hassan Salama from Khan Yunis, [the late Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar’s good friend who was responsible for the revenge attacks in 1996 after the death of [Hamas bomb mastermind] Yahya Ayyash, explicitly writes in his book that Rajoub handed him over to Israeli intelligence.' For this reason, in Bartal’s view Rajoub’s statements 'are intended for a Palestinian audience that remembers the Oslo period in his role as head of Preventive Security in the West Bank.' Amid the war against Hamas in Gaza, Palestinian public opinion strongly supports terrorist activity against Israel, according to Bartal. In light of this, Rajoub seems to believe that the way to stand out from his current role as the P.A.’s Sports Minister 'is only if he highlights a stubborn stance and support for the Palestinian armed resistance,' he said. The other candidates to replace Abbas are Mahmoud al-Aloul, vice chairman of Fatah, who also expresses tough positions against Israel, although he is less well-known to the general public; Majed Faraj, the head of the Palestinian General Intelligence Service, and several others. 'Unfortunately, in Palestinian society, the way to achieve recognition and a very important status is through extremist statements and support for terrorist attacks,' said Bartal. The P.A. is losing control There is another reason the P.A. appears to be taking action against armed groups in the areas it controls. Bartal told JNS that in northern Samaria and especially in the Jenin area, 'the P.A. has begun to lose control.' It 'wants to show Israel, and especially Trump, that it is capable of enforcing government order and dealing with militants,' he explained. 'If it succeeds in the operation that has been going on for over a month, it will first of all prove its relevance in Judea and Samaria, also in Israeli eyes, and secondly, its ability to impose future order in the Gaza Strip and perhaps deal with militants from Hamas there,' he said. Yet there is still more to the story. 'Outlaws' vs 'legitimate resistance' Khaled Abu Toameh, an award winning Arab and Palestinian Affairs journalist and a Senior Distinguished Fellow at the Gatestone Institute and a Fellow of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, told JNS that the P.A. is more worried about its honor than it is about actually fighting terror groups. 'This is not a strategic decision by Abbas or the Palestinian leadership to dismantle all the Iran-backed battalion groups. This is just something specific that is taking place,' he told JNS. 'We’ve seen clashes like this in the past,' he noted, adding that this time it appears to be on a larger scale since the armed groups have 'never before challenged the P.A. in such a way.' He warned against misinterpreting what the P.A. is doing and why. First, Abu Toameh said, 'They could be presenting it as ‘Yes, we are combating terrorism.’' But if so, 'where were you all these years?' he said. Second, Abu Toameh asked, 'Why can’t the P.A. say openly in Arabic, ‘No more battalions, no more armed groups and no such thing as resistance’? Why don’t we hear that message? I don’t hear it in Arabic.' Instead, Abu Toameh said he hears Palestinian officials saying that while some armed men '‘are outlaws,’ they also say ‘we are not against the weapons of the resistance.’' According to Abu Toameh, the P.A. presents these outlaws as contrasting against the armed groups that engage in the real resistance against Israel. For the P.A., the weapons of 'the resistance' are honorable, he said. 'They don’t come out against the whole idea of resistance against Israel.' Furthermore, he added, 'We know there is no strategic decision to dismantle these groups because we don’t see it in other places like Tulkarem and Nablus.' With Trump’s inauguration just days away, the timing for the P.A. is perfect, according to Abu Toameh. 'If you hear the messaging of the P.A. in English and Arabic, it is different,' he said. 'In English they are saying the right things.' Unfortunately, foreign diplomats keep falling for it, he added. 'But in Arabic, the P.A. says, ‘We are not against the resistance. We understand the weapons of the resistance are honorable weapons.'' The P.A. uses the term 'sharif,' he explained, 'which in Arabic means ‘honorable.’' 'We have seen this in the past when the Palestinians put on a show. They are very good at manipulation,' he said.

Outrage grows as Israel’s living costs soar 38% above developed n...	Electricity costs are also surging 3.5%, while water rates rise 2%, and property taxes ostensibly charged to the renter are climbing too. By Jewish Breaking News Israeli bureaucrats faced harsh criticism Monday during a contentious State Control Committee hearing that exposed the government’s struggle to address skyrocketing living costs. The National Economic Council presented a sobering assessment revealing that prices in Israel are a whopping 38% higher than in other developed nations, with some sectors reaching an eye-watering 52% premium. While Council Chair Prof. Avi Simhon acknowledged the 'reality is not good,' his defense leaned heavily on excuses such as 'government policy' and 'very high taxation.' Bank of Israel representative Dr. Sigal Ribon argued inflation would have normalized if not for the war. Although Israel’s inflation has dropped from its 5.4% peak to 3.4% in recent months, the government’s new tax measures for 2025 could reverse this progress and keep interest rates high. Value-added tax (VAT) has been increased from 17% to 18%, which even Ministry of Finance official Uriel Shem Tov admitted nobody wanted but claimed was necessary due to war costs. 'Professionally speaking, the Ministry of Finance does not support raising income tax. I can’t say that raising VAT is a good measure, but that was the alternative that was chosen,' he said. 'We raised the tax on one-person companies and holding companies in such a way that the company owners will feel it. This represents revenue of about NIS 10 million for the state treasury in 2025.' Electricity costs are also surging 3.5%, while water rates rise 2%, and property taxes ostensibly charged to the renter are climbing too. Most cities are hiking rates by 5.2%, with Jerusalem going even further by targeting newer buildings constructed since 2020 with additional increases. 'The tax hikes will create a social wall that will prevent all disadvantaged populations from overcoming the crisis. The entire economic approach needs to be changed,' Latet Director Gilles Darmon said. After hours of bureaucratic back-and-forth, the committee’s solution followed a familiar pattern Israelis are too used to seeing: form another task force, commission more studies, and reconvene in six months. With over 1 million children living in poverty, that timeline offers little hope as they go to bed hungry tonight.

Quiet revolution: Petah Tikva deploys noise sensors in public par...	Noise-capturing cameras were set up one and a half years ago to identify and fine 'drivers who honk for no apparent reason.' By Pesach Benson, TPS To combat noise pollution, Petah Tikva became the first Israeli municipality to begin installing sound sensors in parks on Monday as part of a pilot project to collect data and provide real-time alerts for excessive noise. 'As part of the municipality’s activities to maintain order in the public space and prevent noise pollution, this year the innovative system for enforcing noise on the road began operating in Petah Tikva – for the first time in the country,' said Petah Tikva Mayor Rami Greenberg. The first sensors were placed in the city’s Neve Gan Park. More than 250,000 people live in Petah Tikva, east of Tel Aviv. Dganit Tal, head of the municipality’s environment department, explained to The Press Service of Israel that the initiative builds on a pilot project to reduce excessive honking by motorists. 'We have several major roads inside the city, with traffic at any time of the day, with multi-story residential buildings on both sides. It is hard for the residents to have this amount of noise coming from the windows,' Tal told TPS-IL. Noise-capturing cameras were set up one and a half years ago to identify and fine 'drivers who honk for no apparent reason.' Tal told TPS-IL, 'Since the start of the project, some 1,400 drivers have been penalized. We don’t do this to get some extra money to the city budget, we want to educate the people, and we see it works.' According to Tal, the number of tickets issued has dropped by 40 percent since the traffic pilot’s launch. She explained that the sensors installed in the Neve Gan Park will send info to the municipal center. 'Once the system identifies large gatherings, especially of young people, a city patrol will be able to arrive at the place and warn against making too much noise even before this happens,' Tal said. Noise pollution refers to excessive or disruptive sounds that negatively impact the health, well-being, or comfort of humans and wildlife. It is typically caused by human activities, such as traffic, industrial operations, construction, loud music, and machinery. Prolonged exposure to noises 70 decibels or louder — such as a vacuum cleaner at close range — can harm hearing or health. Noise pollution has been associated with hearing loss, stress, sleep disturbances, cardiovascular issues, and reduced productivity. For wildlife, researchers have found it can disrupt communication, navigation and even breeding.

Deal to release 33 hostages in first phase may be finalized soon	After the initial release of captives, further releases will be discussed on the 16th day of the agreement. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An agreement to release 33 hostages in the initial phase has reportedly been approved by Israel and Hamas and may be announced Monday night or Tuesday morning. Sources have reported that after the initial release of captives, further releases would be discussed on the 16th day of the agreement. There are mixed accounts of the timing of the IDF withdrawal from Gaza with some sources saying that troops would be gradually reduced with the military remaining in the Philadelphi corridor until the last day of the agreement Some sources indicate the first phase of the agreement will last 42 days. There is some indication the agreement could be announced within hours, days or it could fall apart. A cabinet vote and a High Court of Justice ruling on petitions opposing the deal will also be required. If the deal is approved, some sources say the first group of hostages will be released promptly after the announcement. Although the list of hostages to be released in phase one originally included 34 names, the number now is 33 after the discovery of the body of Yousef Ziadne by the IDF. Some sources have indicated that not all of the 33 hostages on the list are alive. Regarding the release of Palestinian prisoners, diplomatic sources said the prisoners who have murdered Israelis would not be released to Judea and Samaria and did not comment on whether they would be sent to Turkey. They also indicated that the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released would be revised downwards if some of the 33 hostages are no longer alive. Several coalition lawmakers came out Monday against the proposed hostage deal and Gaza ceasefire currently under consideration in Doha, Qatar, highlighting the challenges Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could face in securing backing for a agreement with Hamas. On Monday, two groups jointly penned a letter to Netanyahu expressing their opposition to the deal currently on the table and urged him to reject any proposal that requires Israel to surrender control over strategic areas in the Gaza Strip, including the Philadephi Corridor separating Gaza from Egypt. 'The alarming reports about a potential agreement with Hamas during these critical times raise severe concerns for Israel’s security,' the letter reads.

Five IDF soldiers slain in Gaza, bringing IDF wartime toll to 840	On Sunday, four IDF soldiers were killed, and six others were wounded when they were likewise struck by an explosive in the Beit Hanoun area. By JNS Five members of the Israel Defense Forces’ Nahal Brigade were killed in action fighting Hamas terrorists in the northern Gaza Strip, the military announced on Monday night. The troops killed on Monday were identified by the IDF as Capt. Yair Yaakov Shushani, 23, from Ma’alot-Tarshiha; 1st Sgt. Yahav Hadar, 20, from Kfar Tavor; 1st Sgt. Guy Karmiel, 20, from Gedera; 1st Sgt. Yoav Feffer, 19, from Herzliya; and 1st Sgt. Aviel Wiseman, 20, from Poria Illit. All five served in Sayeret Nahal, the special forces unit of the brigade. Eight more Nahal soldiers were seriously wounded in the incident. According to Israel’s Ynet news outlet, they were killed when terrorists activated explosives in a structure in northern Gaza’s Beit Hanoun. On Sunday, four IDF soldiers were killed and six others were wounded when they were likewise struck by an explosive in the Beit Hanoun area. The death toll among troops since the start of the ground incursion in Gaza on Oct. 27, 2023, now stands at 408, and at 840 on all fronts since the Hamas-led terrorist attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Additionally, Chief Inspector Arnon Zamora, a member of the Israel Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit, was fatally wounded during a hostage-rescue mission in Gaza in June, and civilian defense contractor Liron Yitzhak was mortally wounded there in May.

Netanyahu faces opposition within Likud over hostage deal	10 coalition lawmakers, including 7 Likud MKs, sign onto petition rejecting the current hostage deal and ceasefire proposal under consideration, following news of breakthrough in talks. By World Israel News Staff A number of coalition lawmakers came out Monday against the proposed hostage deal and Gaza ceasefire currently under consideration in Doha, Qatar, highlighting the challenges Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could face in securing backing for a agreement with Hamas. On Monday, two groups jointly penned a letter to Netanyahu expressing their opposition to the deal currently on the table, and urged him to reject any proposal which requires Israel surrender control over strategic areas in the Gaza Strip, including the Philadephi Corridor separating Gaza from Egypt. 'The alarming reports about a potential agreement with Hamas during these critical times raise severe concerns for Israel's security,' the letter reads. 'Amidst overwhelming internal and external pressures, we reiterate that under no circumstances should three moral red lines be crossed in any agreement with the murderous terrorist organization Hamas.' 'We cannot rely on others when it comes to Israel's security. No one can replace IDF soldiers—whether at the Rafah Crossing, the Netzarim Corridor, or anywhere else.' The letter also demanded that any hostage release be conducted in a single step, rather than over multiple phases, and warned against allowing the return en masse of Gazans to the northern Gaza Strip. 'There must be no return of the enemy to the northern Gaza Strip.' 'This area is filled with weapons stockpiles and rockets and poses a direct threat to the residents of Sderot and the surrounding areas. Allowing mass return to this region will inevitably lead to renewed rocket fire against our citizens.' 'Such a step would squander the significant achievements of the war and render the sacrifices of those who fell in battle meaningless. It is an immoral move that will demand the lives of hundreds more soldiers to clear the area of the neo-Nazi enemy we are facing.' The letter was penned by two right-leaning groups including the Tikva Forum, one of two organizations lobbying on behalf of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, and the Gvura Forum, representing the families of soldiers killed on October 7th or during the ensuing war. Ten Knesset Members from the Coalition signed on to the letter, including seven members of Netanyahu's own Likud party: MKs Amit Halevi, Hanoch Milwidsky, Moshe Sa'ada, Tsega Melaku, Moshe Passal, Avichai Boaron, and Dan Iluz. Two MKs from Otzma Yehudit - Limor Son Har-Melech and Yitzhak Kroizer - also signed the letter, along with MK Simcha Rothman from the Religious Zionist Party. Earlier on Monday, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, chairman of the Religious Zionist Party, signaled that his faction would oppose the current hostage deal proposal, calling it a 'catastrophe' for Israeli national security.

Hamas confirms breakthrough in hostage talks	Freedom is near' for our prisoners, Hamas says, amid reports of impending hostage deal and ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization on Monday confirmed reports of a major breakthrough in hostage deal talks in Doha, Qatar, and claims of an impending ceasefire deal with Israel. Overnight, President-elect Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff conducted multiple rounds of talks with officials in Doha, including members of the Israeli delegation and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, Reuters reported. Following the talks, Arab mediators reportedly issued a final draft of a proposed ceasefire and hostage deal to the Israeli and Hamas teams, after brokering agreements on the hostage releases, the pacing of the three-phase ceasefire, the dimensions of an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and the approximate number of jailed Palestinian terrorists to be released. Multiple outlets, including the Associated Press, Jerusalem Post, Israel's Channel 12 and Channel 13 all reported that mediators were waiting on Hamas to respond to the latest draft of the proposed agreement. In a statement released Monday afternoon, Hamas confirmed that progress had been made overnight towards a deal, and appeared to signal its approval of the deal, without overtly accepting it. 'We renew our pledge with our steadfast and patient people and with our heroic prisoners in the prisons, and we affirm that their freedom is near,' Hamas said. Under the proposed agreement, Hamas will free 33-34 Israeli hostages during the first phase of a ceasefire, which is set to last for 45 days. During this period, Israel will release approximately 1,100-1,200 jailed Palestinian terrorists, including 150-200 serving life sentences and 48 who were previously jailed, freed during the 2011 Gilad Shalit deal, and then rearrested for additional offenses. In addition, during the first phase of the ceasefire, some 90 female terrorists would be released, along with 350 jailed terrorists under the age of 19, and 560 elderly or ill terrorists.

‘Catastrophe’ – Senior Israeli minister blasts emerging deal with...	Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich says his party will oppose proposed hostage deal plan, amid reports of breakthrough in talks in Qatar. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A senior Israeli government minister castigated the emerging hostage deal in Qatar, threatening to oppose ratification of the agreement if it is brought to a vote. On Monday, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, chairman of the Religious Zionist Party, took to X/Twitter to condemn the latest ceasefire proposal now under consideration in talks in Doha, Qatar. Smotrich lambasted the deal, which would be implemented over three phases, as a 'catastrophe' for Israel's security. 'The emerging deal is a catastrophe for the national security of the State of Israel,' Smotrich wrote. 'We will not be part of a surrender deal that would include releasing arch-terrorists, ending the war, and erasing the achievements that cost us so much.' Smotrich also claimed the proposed agreement would 'abandon many hostages,' a reference to the plans to release just 34 of the remaining 98 Israeli hostages during the first phase of a potential ceasefire, leaving the fate of the remaining hostages uncertain, and linked to Hamas' compliance with the truce. 'This is the time to continue with all our might, to occupy and cleanse the entire [Gaza] Strip, to finally take control of humanitarian aid from Hamas, and to open the gates of hell on Gaza until Hamas surrenders completely and all the hostages are returned.' According to multiple Hebrew reports this week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sought to win Smotrich's support - or at the very least his acquiescence - for a deal with Hamas, reportedly warning Smotrich that outright opposition to a deal would risk the ire of the incoming Trump administration and lessen the likelihood the new president would support Israeli plans to apply sovereignty in Judea and Samaria. An Israeli official told Walla Sunday that Netanyahu fears National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit) will bolt the coalition if the deal currently under consideration is ratified. Netanyahu, according to the official, has made overtures to Smotrich to gauge his willingness to at least remain in the government in such a scenario, even if Smotrich and the Religious Zionist Party vote against the ceasefire deal.

Behind the screens: When AI trains Israel’s top guns	Simulators used to train Israeli Air Force pilots prepare them for long-range missions, stealth reconnaissance, and providing air support to ground troops. By Adi Rubinstein, JNS Entering the Israeli Air Force’s Hatzor Base, near Ashdod, one might think nothing has changed in recent years. But as you proceed into the heart of the facility, it becomes clear that what was will never be the same again. The base is busier than ever, and encounters with younger and older airmen alike testify that we are in the midst of war. This young generation has been busy protecting the homeland for 15 months now. A decade ago, this writer was here for an Independence Day story, trying out the simulator that pilots use to maintain operational readiness in case they need to respond quickly. Since then, our world has been turned upside down, and suddenly, alongside training and long hours in the simulator, it seems our pilots are logging the same hours in the real thing, in the skies of the Middle East. Along with the change in spirit, the base will soon see a material change as well. A facility being built these days will allow for more simulator work and diversify pilots’ training, enabling them to work in larger formations and accommodate more aircrew members. Its construction will be completed in the coming years, and the new generation will be using this simulator, further widening the gap between the blue and white Air Force and air forces across much of the Western world, certainly in the Middle East. An F-15 simulator At the entrance to the MTC (Mission Training Center), its commander, Maj. T., awaits us. A kippah on his head, a smile on his face, and above all, much patience for a reporter who is about to climb into an F-15 simulator for the second time in his life and, as usual, embarrass himself. Israeli Air Force commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar attends the 'Spark' UAV inauguration ceremony at Hatzor Airbase, Sept. 10, 2023. Credit: IDF. From T.’s words, who participated in the strike on Iran, one can understand that with each such strike, pilots improve in the simulator as well, as it allows them to better understand the topography of each location, including places where no one imagined we would be (Sanaa in Yemen, for example). This is exactly the discussion that will accompany us during our visit to the Mission Training Center: How much can the simulator, especially in the AI era, simulate that real feeling of war. 'Look, there are many advantages to the simulator, and over the years it really keeps improving,' T. explains. 'I’ll clarify—in fact, in the simulator you can reach extreme situations that the chance of them happening in real training or combat is very small, but you can turn the simulator into one that constantly puts you in these extreme situations. Indeed, it happened more than once in the past year that soldiers returned from distant and near operations and the first thing they said was, ‘Wow, it’s just like in the simulator,’ or alternatively presented us with things related to improving the simulator.' Squadron commander Lt. Col. A., who participated in a strike on Yemen, joins the conversation as we begin walking toward the simulator: 'Besides the clear advantages of training, beyond what the simulator can provide 24 hours a day, first we must remember the financial costs as well. In the end, there’s savings of hundreds of millions for the army of course, especially in the period we’re in now. You can’t train at any moment and in any situation, but in the simulator it’s possible.' ‘Oct. 7 wasn’t in the simulator’ I ask A. how much the simulator really simulates what’s been happening here in the past year. 'First of all, true, October 7 was something that didn’t appear in any simulator,' he says. 'I think all of us, like the entire army, understood and learned from what happened there, and since then the situation has completely changed, and from what happened there we’re all trying to learn. 'Another thing, physiologically the simulator can’t simulate of course the feeling of encountering g-force—that’s something you can only experience when you’re in the air. Perhaps in the future these are the dramatic changes that will be in the simulator, in my opinion, if they manage to incorporate them, that physical experience.' When I get on the simulator, the commanders won’t let me 'fly' in other countries’ territory, and I have to take off from Israel and stay within the country’s boundaries. They’ll make sure foreign aircraft 'infiltrate here' and attack me, although after what happened here in the past year, what enemy aircraft can still attack me? In the simulator there are no Gazans on donkeys wearing flip-flops, but still I’m 'attacked by foreign forces,' and as usual finish the simulator at a level that A. defines as 'barely flight school material.' I don’t know, I feel I was excellent, especially in the turns I took and the exercises I did, but T. explains that I took a turn like a 'transport plane and not a fighter jet.' I explain to him that like parking in Tel Aviv, I entered carefully so as not to hit the cars in front and behind. They almost laugh. Fortunately, I finish the essay without vertigo, and I also manage to drop fragments over the sea and not hit civilian population. You can continue sleeping peacefully, there are those who are watching over you. Another thing that isn’t in the simulator, or at least wasn’t shown to me, is the drone threat. The different sizes, different confrontations that the Air Force faces since Hezbollah and the Houthis entered the fight, force the entire security system to respond quickly. 'We know how to bring the data to Elbit [Haifa-based Elbit Systems Ltd., the primary provider of the military’s land-based equipment and unmanned aerial vehicles], and during the war we learned how quickly they know how to write code that will deal with the threat of drones in different sizes,' explains T. 'This allows the entire system, including the simulator, to deal with things differently and more efficiently, and of course together with the data that pilots bring from the field we know how to improve during the war.' The aftermath of an Israeli strike on Houthi targets in Yemen. Source: Arab social media. Following progress With AI entering our world, the question arises where this field is going regarding the battlefield, especially when we’re talking about simulators. When we meet female soldiers who can recite by heart the entire structure of the aircraft and its capabilities, we ask where this knowledge will go as technology develops: 'That’s the question,' says T., 'I assume we don’t know how to answer that yet.' A. argues that 'there is and will be no substitute for human experience, with all due respect to the simulator, when you’re in the sky physically, bodily, mentally—everything looks different. 'True, the simulator prepares you for extreme situations, and then even in mentally difficult situations when you’re in the air you know how to react calmly, because you trained in the simulator, but there are still events that occur in the battlefield and the simulator doesn’t simulate them, for example if God forbid you need to make a decision related to ejecting from the aircraft, in the end in the simulator it’s not like the real thing, because when you’re there alone the decisions made are different.' U.S. and U.K. forces struck Yemen’s Houthis on Jan. 22, 2024. Source: Social media. I don’t know whether this public relations tour was meant to strengthen the confidence we all have in the excellent people who shake our houses every evening ('Really sorry, we’re rushing to the target,' A. laughs at me), or to restore our lost faith in everything related to the state and army in the past year. Either way, cynicism aside, at Hatzor you meet the best men and women Israel has to offer.

How anti-Israeli activists are pushing denial of Hamas rapes on O...	Former prosecutor says they are distorting her statements that indictments are hard to file when so many of those raped were murdered and survivors are too traumatized to testify. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Anti-Israel activists around the world have renewed propaganda efforts denying that Hamas terrorists raped Israelis during their surprise invasion of southern Israel last October 7th, by distorting recent statements of a former prosecutor who investigated many of the cases, Ynet reported Monday. Moran Gez, one of the original four prosecutors assigned to analyze evidence of the massive number of heinous acts committed by the thousands of terrorists and civilians who crossed the border from Gaza, had told Yedioth Ahronoth Friday, 'Unfortunately, it will be very difficult to prove these crimes,' because of the simple fact that 'we don’t have complainants.' Either the victims were murdered, she noted, or rape survivors are not willing to attest to what happened to them. 'In this area, I would temper expectations. I know the public is expecting action and understands the need to address the horrific sexual offenses and assaults that occurred, but the vast majority of these cases won’t meet the evidentiary threshold in court, and the criticism will ultimately fall on the prosecution—unjustly so,' Gez said. Palestinian apologists soon began twisting her words on social media to mean that the rape accusations were false. The Middle East Monitor, a London-based anti-Israel outlet, said outright that 'Gaz' had 'stated that her department has found no evidence of sexual violence.' It also claimed a 'March 2023' report by the UN – seven months before the war – 'debunked similar allegations' whereas in reality the body’s Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Pramila Patten, had actually officially verified in March 2024 that Hamas fighters had committed mass rapes during the invasion. A different journalist, one with hundreds of thousands of followers, also used the fact that no indictments had been filed to post that this was 'proof' that the crimes did not occur. Gez was astounded by the lies. 'I am amazed,' she said. 'The fact that there were no complaints was due to two reasons - the Hamas terrorists who raped the young Israeli women murdered them, even during the rape. [And] due to the trauma, women who were raped by members of the terrorist organization and Gaza residents who infiltrated Israel did not muster the courage to file a complaint.' 'Any other interpretation of my words is nothing more than cheap propaganda and ignores the fact that the Hamas terrorists committed war crimes,' she continued. 'In my opinion, the only punishment for them is death.' Gez did admit that the legal proceedings were moving along too slowly, for two main reasons. Linking a specific person to a specific act is required for a normal kind of trial, but when there are dozens of crime scenes, hundreds of suspects and thousands of crimes committed, she said, this becomes almost impossible. 'Standard rules of evidence don’t fit this situation,' she explained, and therefore 'What’s needed is a comprehensive legislative reform' so that 'Israeli law is adapted to the atrocities that occurred that day' and indictments can be filed. She didn’t know if such a reform process was even underway 15 months after the mass attack, but she did know that there are far too few prosecutors, perhaps twenty in all, examining the mountains of evidence already provided by first responders, the police, and forensic pathologists, among others. The best solution is a confession, she noted, but 'surprisingly, in the interrogations of these terrorists, they try to downplay the nationalist aspect,' she said. 'From my experience with security cases, most terrorists are very proud of what they’ve done and don’t hide it&#8230;. Yet, in practice, most of the terrorists from October 7 turned out to be cowards' and are not admitting what they had done.

‘Dramatic’ breakthrough in hostage deal talks as Qatar waits on H...	Israel and Hamas on verge of signing a long-awaited hostage deal and ceasefire agreement, multiple reports claim, with mediators waiting on terror group's response to final draft of proposed agreement. By World Israel News Staff Hostage deal talks underway in Doha, Qatar achieved a major breakthrough overnight, according to multiple reports Monday morning. The breakthrough came sometime after midnight early Monday morning, following discussions between President-elect Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, the Israeli negotiating team, and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, Reuters reported Monday, citing an official familiar with the talks. The source claimed that Qatari mediators have issued a final draft of a proposed ceasefire and hostage deal to the Israeli and Hamas delegations. Reports by several Israeli outlets claimed that the negotiations are on the verge of achieving a deal, and that the ball is now in Hamas’ court; suggesting that Israel has already signaled its agreement to the final draft. According to Israel’s Channel 12, the two sides have reach compromises on the key issues, and Qatari mediators are now waiting for formal approval by Hamas’ politburo. A source cited by The Jerusalem Post echoed this claim, stating that a deal has already been reached and that negotiators are merely waiting for Hamas to officially sign off on the agreement. 'The hostage deal outline is clear, and Israel has come a long, long way,' an Israeli official said. 'We are moving forward slowly and carefully. We hope that Hamas will stop with its refusals.' The Associated Press reported that significant progress was made overnight by the U.S. delegation and Arab brokers, but cited officials who said that no deal had yet been reached. One source cited in the AP report confirmed that a breakthrough had been made, but that both the Israeli and Hamas delegations would need to relay the latest draft to their respective leaders for consideration. An Israeli official who spoke with Channel 13 expressed optimism that a deal could be reached in a matter of days. 'If Hamas responds soon, all the details can be finalized with days.'

Nahariya grandmother dies of injuries from previous Hezbollah roc...	Edri’s apartment was hit by a terrorist rocket fired from Lebanon around 11:30 p.m. on Nov. 26, mere hours before the ceasefire deal between the IDF and Hezbollah began. By JNS The Nahariya Municipality announced on Sunday night that a 75-year-old resident of the northern city died of wounds sustained in a Nov. 26 Hezbollah rocket attack on her home. 'With great sorrow, we were informed tonight of the death of Tamar Edri, a resident of the city, who was critically wounded when a rocket hit her home on Jabotinsky Street, in a barrage fired at the city during the Swords of Iron war some two months ago, and had been fighting for her life in the hospital ever since,' the municipality said in a statement. Edri’s apartment was hit by a terrorist rocket fired from Lebanon around 11:30 p.m. on Nov. 26, mere hours before the ceasefire deal between the Israel Defense Forces and Iranian-backed Hezbollah went into effect. In addition to Edri, three other people were lightly wounded in the attack. Edri was a mother of four daughters and nine grandchildren, Ynet said. Nachum Rosenberg, Edri’s son-in-law, told the Israeli news outlet on Sunday evening that while she had not regained consciousness since Nov. 26, the family had expected her to recover from her wounds. 'We knew that her injury was not simple, but we expected that she would recover and we did not lose hope. Unfortunately, that did not happen,' Rosenberg told Ynet. According to data released last week by the National Public Diplomacy Directorate in the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, Hezbollah terrorists fired at least 15,400 rockets and missiles at the Jewish state in 2024. At the same time, terrorists sent at least 399 drones toward Israeli territory last year, the vast majority of which came from Lebanon. A ceasefire was signed on Nov. 26 and took effect the following day, ending hostilities nearly 14 months after Hezbollah started attacking Israel in support of Hamas the day after the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre.

Muslims raped more women in Europe than Rwanda or Yugoslavia	In European country after country, governments have covered up, dismissed, silenced, and ignored these numbers. By Daniel Greenfield, Frontpage Magazine Sweden has the highest sexual assault rates in the EU. When researchers tried to unravel the cause of the sexual assault epidemic in the country they discovered that 'first- and second-generation immigrants constituted the majority of the rape offenders'. Over half of immigrant sex offenders came from the Middle East and Africa. In Malmo, the largest ‘Muslim city’ in Sweden and Europe, where a quarter of the population is Muslim, the study found that 71% of the convicted rapists were immigrants. Swedish authorities tried to prosecute the female lead researcher for releasing those numbers. Sweden’s sexual assault numbers rose sharply after the Muslim migrant crisis, going from around 16,000 in 2015 to over 23,000 in 2023. A previous survey by Sweden’s SVT television after the migrant crisis found that 58% of convicted rapists were immigrants and that 80% of the rapists who attacked women whom they did not know were immigrants. Assuming that these numbers hold for the general population, Muslims have been responsible for some 40,000 sexual assaults in a country of only 10 million. Those are equivalent to the number of rapes that allegedly took place during the fighting in the former Yugoslavia. A EU parliamentarian noted that 'Sweden has the second-highest Muslim immigration rate and the second-highest sexual assault rate in Europe.' In one survey, over 1 in 10 Swedish women reported that they had been raped. In the UK, rapes more than doubled from over 16,000 to over 36,000 during the Muslim migrant crisis. Today they stand at over 67,000 for an increase of over 50,000 or over 300%. One in 10 women in the UK reported that they were raped. During this same period, the Muslim population rose by over 1 million. In Ireland, sexual assaults rose by 50% from 2012 to 2022. During this same time, the Muslim population in Ireland rose by 60%. The EU’s own statistics report admits that the trend in sexual assaults has 'been on the increase since 2015' across the European Union. But not all European Union countries are created equal. Western European countries have some of the highest sexual assault rates and Eastern European countries have some of the lowest rates. In Germany, 8% of women reported they had been raped while in neighboring Poland, only 3% had. Germany has millions of Muslims while Poland has tens of thousands. In 2021, Germany was forced to grapple with the fact that the migrant invaders were responsible for over 13% of sexual assaults despite making up over 2% of the population. At the peak of the migrant crisis, 1,200 women were assaulted in Cologne over New Year’s Eve. The vast majority of those arrested were Arab Muslim male migrants from North Africa. Before the migrant crisis, Germany recorded around 7,000 sexual assaults. By 2023, the numbers had risen to over 12,000. Cultural stereotypes about Europeans have little to do with the defining numbers. In ‘hot-blooded’ Greece, less than 4% of women reported being raped, but in the ‘colder’ Netherlands nearly 14% of women did. The one determining factor is Islam. The Netherlands have a 5% Muslim population while Greece holds a less than 2% Muslim population. To understand the scale of the problem, Western European nations invaded the former Yugoslavia over reports of tens of thousands of rapes, and considered that to be ethnic cleansing. In those same countries, Muslims have carried out far more rapes than that. The UK’s Pakistani Muslim grooming gang scandals alone exceed over 1,000 girls victimized in the town of Telford with a population of 153,000. In Rotherham, the estimated number has been set at 1,400 in a population of a quarter of a million. And these are only pieces of a larger crisis. The UK’s annual rapes have increased by 50,000 from before the Muslim migrant crisis. Since then there have been an excess 330,000 rapes. While it’s difficult to estimate what the numbers might have been if not for Muslim settler colonialism, the UK’s population increased by 6% since then and 60% of that growth was due to migrants. The native population has not grown in any kind of numbers that would account for even a small percentage of an increase in rapes. Indeed, the native population actually statistically shrank. A 300% increase in rapes cannot be accounted for by the native population. And that 300% adds up to hundreds of thousands of women raped in the UK in less than a decade. That’s over ten times the rapes reportedly at issue in the former Yugoslavia. They exceed even the UN’s estimates of 100,000 to 250,000 rapes in Rwanda. And that’s in the UK alone. In Germany, excess sexual assaults since the Muslim migrant crisis amounted to around 27,000. And with migrants accounting for at least 10% of overall assaults, that is over 1,000 annual sexual assaults by migrants. The New Year’s assaults in Cologne, Germany resulted in over 500 sexual assault complaints alone. Rape rates in Germany have doubled since the late 1990s and with negative native population growth that increase is most likely due to the migrant population. That would amount to tens of thousands of sexual assaults attributable due to changing demographics from the Muslim world. These case studies from only a few European countries show the severe scale of the crisis. In European country after country, governments have covered up, dismissed, silenced and ignored these numbers. Researchers, activists and journalists have faced prosecution for merely mentioning what is not simply a crime wave, but a campaign of ethnic cleansing. Muslim perpetrators have repeatedly justified their actions by asserting cultural differences. Imams and community leaders made excuses for them while claiming the stories were ‘Islamophobic' lies. The perpetrators taunted their victims in racial and religious terms similar to those that were at issue in the war crimes trials out of Yugoslavia, but instead of war crimes trials, Europe surrendered and began to appease the perpetrators and cover up their crime. After a series of rapes, Norway tried to ‘educate’ Muslim migrants about acceptable behavior toward women, but the number of assaults since then have only grown worse. The UK police responded to Muslim grooming gangs by threatening victims and their parents to fight ‘Islamophobia’. Sweden threatened to prosecute researchers exposing the scale of immigrant sexual assaults because this was considered ‘sensitive’ data that should not be published. Europe has been subjected to ethnic cleansing by Muslim migrants and their political apologists on a scale greater than Yugoslavia or Rwanda. The crime is horrific and the cover-up is even worse. When there were rapes in Yugoslavia, Europe went to war, but when there is ethnic cleansing across the UK, France, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, and Germany, there is silence.

‘The most violent day’: Palestinian Authority crackdown on Jenin ...	Casualty reports indicate at least 15 people have been killed in the now 40 days of fighting, including six members of the PA and Islamic Jihad commander in the camp, Yazid Ja’aysa. By Baruch Yedid, TPS Fighting between Palestinian Authority security forces and local terror groups in the Jenin refugee camp stretched into its fifth week. Eyewitnesses told The Press Service of Israel on Sunday of intense clashes in the Damaj neighborhood where a PA heavy vehicle was struck, forcing PA forces to fire at least one rocket propelled grenade. 'This is the most violent day,' a local resident told TPS-IL. 'The use of RPGs was last seen in the early days of the conflict.' The ongoing operation has taken a heavy toll on the camp’s infrastructure. Water, electricity, and internet lines have been cut off for most of the day in large parts of Jenin. Residents tell of children distributing bread, water, and milk between houses under curfew. 'Dozens of houses have been completely burned, deliberately set on fire by PA soldiers,' another resident told TPS-IL. Palestinian officials in Jenin confirmed that PA forces faced heavy resistance from Palestinian Islamic Jihad gunmen, leading some personnel to retreat. 'This is without a doubt the peak in the battles since they broke out,' a Palestinian official told TPS-IL. 'The Palestinian Authority forces fired RPGs, burned houses, and even Qurans, after repeatedly laying siege to alleys, neighborhoods, houses, and hospitals.' Casualty reports indicate at least 15 people have been killed in the now 40 days of fighting, including six members of the PA and Islamic Jihad commander in the camp, Yazid Ja’aysa. 'Seventy to eighty names remain on the Palestinian Authority’s wanted list after nearly 300 arrests,' a Palestinian source told TPS-IL. PA forces have also uncovered weapons caches including items reportedly stolen from Israeli military bases. Abbas’s ‘Do-Or-Die Campaign’ Publicly, the Palestinian Authority explains the operation as a fight against 'lawbreakers' and against Iranian and Islamic State influence, while one spokesperson stressed that Ramallah 'is not fighting the ‘resistance,’' but against militias who have made life 'unbearable' for Jenin residents. But a senior PA official explained to TPS-IL during the initial raids that the crackdown was part of a broader strategy to demonstrate PA authority’s ability to maintain governance as Ramallah eyes eventually administering the Gaza Strip. One senior Fatah official described the crackdown to TPS-IL in December as a 'do-or-die campaign' for Abbas, who is determined to dismantle what he calls 'resistance nests' in the refugee camp. Previous Israeli counterterror operations in 2023 and 2024 in the Jenin camp uncovered a tunnel shaft, a rocket launcher, large amounts of weapons and bomb-making laboratories. As of 2023, just over 24,000 registered refugees were living in the camp that Palestinians have dubbed 'The Martyr’s Capital.' An Arab diplomat later told TPS-IL that the PA’s raids were insufficient and that Arab leaders are urging US President-elect Donald Trump to replace Abbas. Palestinians have not held national elections since 2005 and Abbas is now in the 19th year of what was supposed to be a four-year term. Since then, Abbas, 89, has cancelled several attempted elections amid Fatah-Hamas disagreements, most recently in 2021. A public opinion survey released in mid-December, found 71% of Palestinians were dissatisfied with the leadership of PA President Mahmoud Abbas.

IAF helicopter intercepts Houthi drone over southern Israel	Since the start of the war on Oct. 7, 2023, Iran-backed Houthi rebels have launched around 40 surface-to-surface missiles and 320 UAVs toward Israel, according to the IDF. By JNS An Israeli Air Force helicopter on Monday morning intercepted an armed drone over southern Israel that had been launched from Yemen, according to the Israel Defense Forces. According to protocol, no sirens were activated, the military said. On Wednesday night, Israeli air-defense systems shot down three Houthi drones launched from Yemen, with the military publishing video of one of the interceptions over the Mediterranean Sea. Another UAV was intercepted over the Mediterranean earlier in the day, and a drone was shot down by IAF helicopters, triggering air-raid sirens in Gvulot, a kibbutz in the northwestern Negev. Since the start of the war on Oct. 7, 2023, Iran-backed Houthi rebels have launched around 40 surface-to-surface missiles and 320 UAVs toward Israel, according to the IDF. Israeli defenses intercepted most missiles and over 100 drones. Two missile fragments and two UAV hits were identified, while the rest caused no significant damage or failed to reach Israeli territory. 'In recent months, the Houthi terrorist regime in Yemen has conducted scores of aerial attacks against the State of Israel, including with surface-to-surface missiles and UAVs. The Houthi regime serves as a key proxy of the Iranian axis in the Middle East that is responsible for destabilizing the region and disrupting global shipping routes,' the IDF said. On Friday, Israeli fighter jets hit Houthi targets on Yemen’s western coast and inland, the IDF stated. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated on Friday afternoon that 'just as we promised, the Houthis are paying, and will continue to pay, a heavy price for their aggression against us,' according to an English translation of his remarks provided by his office. It was the third time that the IDF had directly attacked Houthi targets in Yemen in the past month. CENTCOM commander visits USS Harry S. Truman Gen.

Israel pushes to retain 1-mile buffer zone in Gaza under ceasefir...	Qatari media outlet claims Israel is pushing for ceasefire deal to recognize Israeli control of a one-mile buffer zone along the Gaza frontier even after IDF forces are withdrawn from most of the Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff Israel is looking to cement its control over an expanded buffer zone inside the Gaza Strip as part of a proposed ceasefire deal and hostage release, according to an Arabic news report Monday. On Monday morning, the London-based, Qatar-owned Al-Quds Al-Arabi outlet reported that Israel's negotiating team in Doha, Qatar has informed the Egyptian and Qatari brokers mediating talks between Jerusalem and Hamas that the IDF intends to retain long-term control over an expanded buffer zone running along the Israel-Gaza frontier, on the Gazan side of the border. Prior to the Hamas invasion of October 7th, 2023, the IDF had declared a 300-meter (0.186 mile) no-man's land along the border. While the IDF maintained no permanent presence in the buffer zone, it warned Gazans that entering the no-man's land would be treated as a hostile move and could result in live fire from Israeli forces. Following the invasion, Israel began work on an expanded buffer zone, demolishing buildings along the Gaza-side of the border, creating a roughly 1.5-kilometer (0.93 mile) sterile zone. According to Monday's report, Israel has informed meditators it intends to maintain an armed presence in the new buffer zone. The report also claimed that the two sides have largely agreed upon the dimensions of Israel's withdrawal from parts of the Gaza Strip during the first and second phases of a three-phase ceasefire. The United States has expressed cautious optimism regarding the prospects for a deal in the near future, though Hamas has yet to disclose how many hostages are still alive - a key figure necessary for determining the final number of jailed Palestinian terrorists Israel will release as part of an agreement. The two sides also have yet to agree upon which terrorists will be permitted to return home, and which will be required to live in exile abroad. The IDF's control over key strategic areas inside the Gaza Strip after the third and final phase of a ceasefire is another contested issue yet to be resolved.

IAF bombs Hezbollah terror targets in Lebanon	Israel launches biggest strikes since truce was implemented, citing Hezbollah's repeated violations of the ceasefire. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli Air Force carried out extensive airstrikes against Hezbollah terror infrastructure and operatives in Lebanon during the early hours of Monday morning, as a truce between Israel and the terror group is set to expire in just two weeks. In a statement, the IDF confirmed it had struck a rocket launching site, unspecified Hezbollah assets, and smuggling routes on the Lebanon-Syria border used by the terror group to obtain weapons. The attacks came after Israel repeatedly complained about Hezbollah's continuing activity in southern Lebanon, which is a clear violation of the truce. The international group responsible for monitoring Hezbollah and ensuring the ceasefire is upheld 'did not address' the threats to Israel, Jerusalem said. بالفيديو | الغارة الاسرائيلية التي استهدفت أطراف دير الزهراني pic.twitter.com/A2VmEL3CAJ &mdash; قناة المنار (@TVManar1) January 12, 2025 'The IDF continues to act to remove any threat to the State of Israel and will operate to prevent any attempt by Hezbollah to rebuild its forces in accordance with the ceasefire understandings,' the military added. According to Arabic-language media, the strikes occurred in the villages of Deir El Zahrani and Houmine El Faouqa in the Nabatiya region of southern Lebanon, as well as in the Bekaa Valley. In late November, Hezbollah and Israel signed a 60-day ceasefire agreement, which is set to expire on January 27th, shortly after president-elect Donald Trump takes office. There have been conflicting media reports regarding Israel's post-ceasefire plans, including whether it will resume widespread strikes against Hezbollah targets. Defense Minister Israel Katz hinted that the IDF could maintain a troop presence in the country - despite pledging to withdraw all of its soldiers by the end of the ceasefire - should the Lebanese army fail to clear southern Lebanon of Hezbollah operatives. However, Biden administration envoy Amos Hochstein was reported to have recently promised Lebanese government officials that Israel would fully withdraw from the country by the time the ceasefire comes to an end.

Vance explains what Trump means by ‘hell breaking loose’ if hosta...	The IDF has said that only two out of twenty-four Hamas battalions remain in Gaza. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News President-elect Donald Trump's Vice President J.D. Vance explained on Fox News what Trump meant when he said, 'All hell would break loose' if the hostages in Gaza aren't freed by his inauguration on January 20. Vance said, 'It means enabling the Israelis to knock out the final couple of battalions of Hamas and their leadership. It means very aggressive sanctions and financial penalties on those who are supporting terrorist organizations in the Middle East. It means doing the job of American leadership,' Vance said. The IDF has said that only two out of twenty-four Hamas battalions remain, but the delay in dismantling them is due to intelligence indicating that they are holding most of the remaining hostages, and the IDF is concerned that operations may harm the captives. Vance did not elaborate on the financial sanctions his administration would impose, but it may resemble similar financial penalties the US has placed on terror groups. Vance said, 'We're hopeful there's going to be a deal that struck toward the very end of Biden's administration — maybe the last day or two,' Vance says. 'But regardless of when that deal is struck, it will be because people are terrified that there are going to be consequences for Hamas.' During a high-level security meeting last week, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz urged the IDF to draft a plan to completely destroy Hamas if the hostages are not released by the time Donald Trump takes office as US President. Also attending the meeting were IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Defense Ministry Director-General Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir and senior military commanders. Katz also cautioned the IDF to consider what issues may create obstacles, such as the humanitarian aspect, and encouraged them to make the plan flexible enough to allow the political echelon to make necessary decisions. The Defense Minister added that considerations of post-war governance in Gaza were irrelevant with Hamas still standing, since no nation or group, whether Arab or not, is interested in taking responsibility for running Gaza while the terror group still has a strong presence there.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News With just eight days left in office, US President Joe Biden, in a phone call on Sunday, insisted that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agree to a ceasefire in Gaza. Biden said there was an immediate need for a ceasefire in Gaza so the hostages could be released and more humanitarian aid could be delivered. In previous negotiations, Netanyahu has insisted that after a pause in fighting to release hostages, the war would resume until Israel achieved its military goals. In the most recent negotiated agreement, Hamas has reportedly relaxed its demand for an immediate withdrawal of IDF troops before the release of the hostages, and Israel's military may be able to remain in the Philadelphi corridor until the final phase. President Biden also described how the situation in the region is 'fundamentally changed' after the ceasefire with Hezbollah and the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, weakening Iran's power. 'Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked President Biden and President-elect Donald Trump for cooperating in this sacred mission,' the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement. In an interview aired by CNN on Sunday, Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan expressed cautious optimism regarding the chances of a deal being signed before Biden leaves office. 'Can we get it done before the 20th? It is possible, but I certainly can't make any predictions,' Sullivan said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has approved sending an Israeli delegation to Doha to negotiate a hostage deal. The decision follows a meeting between Netanyahu and US President-elect Donald Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff on Saturday. In addition, Netanyahu held a situational assessment on the issue of hostages with Defense Minister Israel Katz, Israel's top security officials, and representatives from the Biden administration and the incoming Trump administration. Following the meeting, Netanyahu sent Mossad chief David Barnea, Shin Bet director Ron Bar, IDF hostage point man Maj. Gen. (res.) Nitzan Alon, and political advisor Ophir Falk to Doha to negotiate the hostage deal.

Israel seizes $1.1 billion Palestinian Authority funds to cover i...	The money that Israel had intended to transfer to the Palestinian Authority after the war will instead go to pay the PA's debts to Israel. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel has recovered funds that will pay for a decade-old $1.1 billion Palestinian Authority electricity debt while diverting money from the Norwegian Fund where money for PA has been deposited since the beginning of the war, Israel HaYom reports. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told the Diplomatic-Security Cabinet Sunday about the process of collecting on the decade-old debt. The Finance Ministry issued an order to the Norwegian Fund, into which Israel had been paying 275 million shekels monthly deducted from PA funds. The money from the Norwegian Fund will pay for outstanding debts the PA has owed to Israel for over 10 years. Half of the funds will be paid to companies that provided fuel to the PA, and the other half will go to Israel's electric company. Last spring, when Norway announced that it recognized a Palestinian State, Smotrich stopped sending money to the Norwegian Fund and accumulated the money separately. The money that Israel had intended to transfer to the Palestinian Authority after the war will instead go to pay the PA's debts to Israel. The process, which is being carried out in coordination with the US, is succeeding in securing the debt payment in full without reducing interest. Last May, Smotrich refused to extend a waiver to allow Israel's banks to work with Palestinian banks, citing their close association with terror groups. Smotrich stated he had no intention to extend the waiver to Palestinian banks, saying that 'The PA's financial system is up to its neck in terror,' and wrote on X, 'They back and fund terror.' The Norwegian Fund was created as a way to transfer money between Israel and the Palestinian Authority without forcing Israel to work directly with Palestinian banks. However, when Norway declared a Palestinian State unilaterally, Smotrich refused to transfer the funds. Smotrich wrote, 'There's urgency for an immediate response that will impose a significant cost on the Palestinian Authority for its actions and deter it and other countries,' Smotrich concluded.

Fatah and Palestinian Authority issue unprecedented condemnation ...	The statement criticized Hamas for 'using civilians as shields, resulting in catastrophic casualties and the collapse of essential services such as healthcare and education in Gaza.' By Jewish Breaking News The Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah) released a strong statement condemning Hamas for its actions leading up to and following the October 7, 2023, attacks, describing them as 'disastrous for the Palestinian people.' Fatah accused Hamas of 'aligning itself with Iran and other regional forces, gambling with Palestinian interests, and triggering the largest destruction Gaza has faced in recent history.' The statement criticized Hamas for 'using civilians as shields, resulting in catastrophic casualties and the collapse of essential services such as healthcare and education in Gaza.' Fatah further rejected Hamas’s attempts to extend its influence to the 'West Bank,' accusing the group of 'inciting chaos, treason, and supporting outlaws.' The statement condemned Hamas’s long-standing practices, including 'alleged executions, kidnappings, and misappropriation of humanitarian aid.' Reaffirming their 'commitment to the Palestinian national project,' Fatah emphasized the sacrifices made by Palestinian security forces to maintain independence from external manipulation, particularly Iranian influence. They vowed to protect Palestinian sovereignty against any party seeking to exploit it. This marks a very rare and pointed denunciation of Hamas by Palestinian leadership.

Ryanair to resume full schedule to Israel this summer	The three major U.S. legacy carriers are still not flying to and from Israel as the war against Hamas in Gaza continues. By JNS Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair plans to operate a full flight schedule to Israel this summer, when it expects travel to and from Tel Aviv to return to normal, an airline executive said this week. Europe’s biggest budget airline, which has not flown to Israel for nearly a year, was previously expected to resume service to Israel this spring. 'We rely on EASA [European Union Aviation Safety Agency] guidance …, but our view is that we will be back,' Eddie Wilson, chief executive of Ryanair DAC, the largest of five subsidiary airlines operated by the Ryanair Group told Reuters. 'We’ve got a full schedule I think for Tel Aviv …, so we will be back in there for the summer as I think most of the other airlines will be.' Low-cost rival Hungarian-based Wizz Air restarted service from Ben-Gurion International Airport last month, and is expanding service to seven more destinations this week: Abu Dhabi, Budapest, Krakow, London, Milan, Rome and Warsaw. Several foreign airlines have resumed flights to Israel since the Nov. 27 ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, with the major European carriers including Air France, British Airways and the Lufthansa group expected to restart service next month. The three major U.S. legacy carriers are still not flying to and from Israel as the war against Hamas in Gaza continues. United and American Airlines have suspended flights to Israel indefinitely, while Delta is scheduled to resume flights to Tel Aviv in April. United and Delta sought to restart flights to Israel periodically over the last year, only to extend the suspension of service following flareups in the war, while American has stayed away entirely. January and February are typically the slowest months for travel to Israel. About one-third of the 80 airlines that serviced Tel Aviv before the outbreak of the war have since resumed service, an Israel Airport Authority spokeswoman told JNS this week. Last month, the Knesset gave preliminary approval to an amendment to the law requiring airlines to compensate passengers for canceled flights, easing the requirements during wartime. The initial parliamentary vote, which the foreign airlines had lobbied for last year, did not lead them to rush back to Israel. Israel shuttered its low-cost Terminal 1 at Ben-Gurion International Airport during the war, which offers lower ground operating costs to the carriers, but is likely to reopen it with the budget airlines’ resumption of service. Meanwhile, the five most popular destinations for Israelis traveling abroad last year were Greece with more than 1.8 million passengers, the U.S. with about 1.4 million passengers, Cyprus with about 1 million passengers, the United Arab Emirates with about 890,000 passengers, and France with about 850,000 passengers, according to the Israel Airport Authority 2024 annual report. In a year when most foreign airlines suspended service to Tel Aviv, El Al had a near-monopoly on flights out of Israel, flying about 6.5 million passengers, followed by Israel’s budget carriers Israir with about 1.4 million passengers, and Arkia with about 1 million passengers. Fly Dubai, which has flown throughout the war, and the Greece-based Blue Bird served about half a million passengers each.

3,000 terrorists to be freed in hostage deal – report	Palestinian report claims current hostage deal on the table would include the release of some 3,000 jailed terrorists - including hundreds now serving life sentences. By World Israel News Staff Israel could potentially release as many as 3,000 jailed Palestinian terrorists as part of a hostage deal now on the table in ceasefire talks in Doha, Qatar, a Palestinian source claimed Sunday. According to a report published by the Bethlehem-based Ma'an News Agency, the latest draft of a possible hostage deal under consideration would during the first phase of a ceasefire, provide for the freeing of 25 Israeli hostages currently being held in the Gaza Strip, in exchange for the freeing of approximately 1,050 jailed terrorists. The report cited Qadura Fares, the Palestinian Authority's Minister for Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs, who claimed that during the first phase of a three-phase ceasefire, 48 Palestinian terrorists freed as part of the 2011 Shalit deal and subsequently rearrested for new terror activities would be released again, along with 1,000 other terrorists. The 1,000 terrorists to be included in the first phase of the deal will be drawn from a list of female terrorists, terrorists under the age of 18, and terrorists with serious medical conditions. During the second and third phases of the deal now under consideration, Fares continued, Israel would release an additional 2,000 jailed terrorists, in exchange for the release of all remaining hostages - alive and dead. Some 200 of the terrorists to be released during the first phase of the ceasefire will be those serving life sentences, Fares said - referring to terrorists convicted of murder. While most of the terrorists freed under a potential deal would be allowed to return home, Fares said, those convicted of the most serious offenses would be expelled from the country and forced to live in exile in either Qatar, Turkey, or Egypt. Israel's top negotiator, Mossad chief David Barnea, is slated to depart for Doha to lead the latest round of talks, Netanyahu said Saturday, after his trip to Qatar was delayed last week.

Trump’s incoming Ukraine envoy urges ‘maximum pressure’ on Iran	Kellogg stressed that the opportunity to improve Iran is fleeting and must be seized. By JNS Keith Kellogg, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming Ukraine and Russia special envoy, called for a return to a 'maximum pressure' policy against Iran on Saturday, aiming to push the country toward democracy. Speaking at a Paris-based Iranian opposition event, he emphasized that pressure should be both economic and diplomatic, not just military, according to Reuters. Kellogg stressed that the opportunity to improve Iran is fleeting and must be seized. 'We must exploit the weakness we now see. The hope is there, so must too be the action,' he told the audience at the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) event at the group’s headquarters in Auvers-sur-Oise on the northwestern outskirts of the French capital. NCRI President-elect Maryam Rajavi also called for Western governments to support the Iranian people and abandon outdated policies, citing regional shifts against Iran’s leadership. Trump has pledged to reinstate the policy from his previous term, which aimed to devastate Iran’s economy to compel the country to negotiate on its nuclear program, ballistic missile development and regional actions.

Los Angeles wildfires death toll rises as crews fight heavy winds...	Crews from California and nine other states are part of the ongoing response that includes 1,354 fire engines, 84 aircraft and more than 14,000 personnel, including newly arrived firefighters from Mexico. By Associated Press The death toll from the wildfires ravaging the Los Angeles area rose to 16 as crews battled to cut off the spreading blazes before potentially strong winds return that could push the flames toward some of the city’s most famous landmarks. Five of the deaths were attributed to the Palisades Fire and 11 resulted from the Eaton Fire, the Los Angeles County coroner’s office said in a statement Saturday evening. The previous number of confirmed fatalities before Saturday was 11, but officials said they expected that figure to rise as teams with cadaver dogs conduct systematic grid searches in leveled neighborhoods. Authorities have established a center where people can report the missing. There were fears that winds could move the fires toward the J. Paul Getty Museum and the University of California, Los Angeles, while new evacuation warnings left more homeowners on edge. By Saturday evening, Cal Fire reported the Palisades, Eaton, Kenneth and Hurst fires had consumed about 62 square miles (160 square kilometers), an area larger than San Francisco. The Palisades and Eaton fires accounted for 59 square miles (nearly 153 square kilometers). In a briefing posted online Saturday evening, Michael Traum of the California Office of Emergency Services said 150,000 people in Los Angeles County were under evacuation orders, with more than 700 people taking refuge in nine shelters. Crews from California and nine other states are part of the ongoing response that includes 1,354 fire engines, 84 aircraft and more than 14,000 personnel, including newly arrived firefighters from Mexico, he said. With Cal Fire reporting containment of the Palisades Fire at 11% and the Eaton Fire at 15% on Saturday night, the fight is set to continue. 'Weather conditions are still critical and another round of strong winds is expected starting Monday,' Traum said. Fighting to save public and private areas A fierce battle occurred Saturday in Mandeville Canyon, home to Arnold Schwarzenegger and other celebrities not far from the Pacific coast, where swooping helicopters dumped water as the blaze charged downhill. Firefighters on the ground used hoses in an attempt to beat back leaping flames as thick smoke blanketed the chaparral-covered hillside. CalFire Operations Chief Christian Litz said Saturday that a main focus was the Palisades Fire burning in the canyon area, not far from the UCLA campus. New evacuations were ordered Friday evening after a flare up on the eastern side of the Palisades Fire. The National Weather Service warned that strong Santa Ana winds could soon return. Those winds have been largely blamed for turning the wildfires into infernos that leveled entire neighborhoods around to city where there has been no significant rainfall in more than eight months. The fire also threatened to jump over Interstate 405 and into densely populated areas in the Hollywood Hills and San Fernando Valley. Historical cost The fires that began Tuesday just north of downtown LA have burned more than 12,000 structures. Firefighters for the first time made progress Friday afternoon on the Eaton Fire north of Pasadena, which has burned more than 7,000 structures, a term that includes homes, apartment buildings, businesses, outbuildings and vehicles. Most evacuation orders for the area were lifted, officials said. No cause has been determined for the largest fires and early estimates indicate the wildfires could be the nation's costliest ever. A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. Overflowing kindness Volunteers overflowed donation centers and some had to be turned away at locations including the Santa Anita Park horse racing track, where people who lost their homes sifted through stacks of donated shirts, blankets and other household goods. Altadena resident Jose Luis Godinez said three homes occupied by more than a dozen of his family members were destroyed. 'Everything is gone,' he said, speaking in Spanish. 'All my family lived in those three houses and now we have nothing.' Officials warn against returning Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna warned residents against venturing back to destroyed homes to sift through rubble for keepsakes. 'We have people driving up and around trying to get in just to look. Stay away,' Luna said, urging people to abide by curfews. Officials on Saturday warned the ash can contain lead, arsenic, asbestos and other harmful materials. 'If you’re kicking that stuff up, you’re breathing it in,' said Chris Thomas, a spokesman for the unified incident command at the Palisades Fire who warned the material was 'toxic.' Residents will be allowed to return with protective gear after damage teams evaluate their properties, Thomas said. Leadership accused of skimping LA Mayor Karen Bass faces a critical test of her leadership during the city's greatest crisis in decades, but allegations of leadership failures, political blame and investigations have begun. Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday ordered state officials to determine why a 117 million-gallon (440 million-liter) reservoir was out of service and some hydrants had run dry. Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said city leadership failed her department by not providing enough money for firefighting. She also criticized the lack of water. 'When a firefighter comes up to a hydrant, we expect there’s going to be water,' Crowley said. The level of devastation is jarring even in a state that regularly confronts massive wildfires. Traum of the state Office of Emergency Services said those impacted by the fires can apply online for immediate government assistance.

Pope Francis slams Israel over ‘shameful’ humanitarian situation ...	The 88-year-old pontiff accused Israel of 'bombing civilians' and leaving Gazan children to 'freeze to death,' slamming the Jewish state over what he called the 'shameful' situation in Gaza. By World Israel News Staff Pope Francis blasted Israel in an address last week, castigating the Jewish state over what he described as the 'shameful' humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip during the ongoing war against Hamas. On Thursday, an aide to the pontiff delivered Pope Francis' 2025 State of the World speech, after a cold left the pope unable to give the address personally. In the address, Pope Francis called for a 'diplomacy of home' and a 'diplomacy of freedom,' to replace what he termed the 'horrid commerce' of war. Lamenting the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, the pope touched on other high-profile conflicts around the world, calling for international efforts to end the fighting. Pope Francis advocated for the release of Israeli hostages held by terrorists in the Gaza Strip, while demanding more international aid for Gazans and the establishment of a Palestinian state. 'I renew my appeal for a ceasefire and the release of the Israeli hostages in Gaza, where there is a very serious and shameful humanitarian situation, and I ask that the Palestinian population receive all the aid it needs.' 'My prayerful hope is that Israelis and Palestinians can rebuild the bridges of dialogue and mutual trust, starting with the smallest, so that future generations can live side by side in the two States, in peace and security, and that Jerusalem can be the 'city of encounter', where Christians, Jews and Muslims live together in harmony and respect.' The 88-year-old Catholic cleric also reiterated his support for the negotiating of a new nuclear deal with Tehran. 'More recently, I think of the positive signs of a resumption of negotiations to return to the framework of the Iran nuclear deal, with the aim of ensuring a safer world for all.' Last year, Pope Francis repeatedly criticized Israel's handling of the war in Gaza, and suggested that the IDF may be guilty of genocide in the coastal enclave. 'This is cruelty, this is not war,' Pope Francis declared during a speech on December 21st, drawing sharp criticism not only from Israel but from Jewish and Christian groups abroad.

New Israeli study reveals how terrorists are weaponizing AI	The study outlines the most likely risks associated with terrorists’ access to AI technology: By Jewish Breaking News Artificial intelligence technology could be exploited by terrorist groups around the globe in a number of ways, a new study has found, while governmental regulatory agencies and tech companies appear to be woefully unprepared to deal with the growing threat. The 'Generative AI and Terrorism' study, conducted by the University of Haifa’s Prof. Gabriel Weimann, will be published in his forthcoming book, AI in Society. Weimann unmasks the real and pertinent threats associated with the growing interest in AI-based tools among terrorists and extremists. From online manuals on how to use generative AI to bolster propaganda and disinformation tactics to an Al-Qaeda-affiliated group announcing it would start holding AI workshops online to Islamic State’s tech support guide on how to use generative AI tools such as chatbots like ChatGPT securely. 'We are in the midst of a rapid technological revolution, no less significant than the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries – the artificial intelligence revolution,' Weimann writes. 'This multi-dimensional dramatic revolution is raising the concern that human society is unprepared for the rise of artificial intelligence.' The study outlines the most likely risks associated with terrorists’ access to AI technology: Effective propaganda, where AI can be used to produce and distribute influential content to various target populations, faster and more efficiently than ever before and disseminate hate speech, radical and violent ideologies for recruitment purposes. Spreading disinformation which can serve terrorists in their fear-inducing campaigns, and AI models can be a powerful weapon in modern disinformation wars by utilizing technology like deep fakes which can quickly reach huge audiences in an extremely short period of time. Interactive recruitment where AI-based chatbots can facilitate and enhance the recruitment of individuals for terrorist plots by automating virtual interactions with targeted individuals and can improve the reach of the virtual interactivity of targeted individuals and groups. Enhancing attack capabilities, where deep-learning models such as ChatGPT have the potential to enable terrorists to learn, plan, and coordinate their activities with greater efficiency, accuracy, and impact than ever before.

Actress Jamie Lee Curtis compares fire-ravaged LA to Gaza Strip	Lamenting Los Angeles wildfires, Southern California native Jamie Lee Curtis compares damage to Palisades neighborhood to war in the Gaza Strip, drawing criticism on social media. By World Israel News Staff A Hollywood A-lister came under fire last week, after she compared fire-ravaged neighborhoods in Los Angeles to the war-torn Gaza Strip. Jamie Lee Curtis, the 66-year-old actress and former 'scream queen' who starred in the Halloween film series and A Fish Called Wanda, spoke out Thursday at an event marking the debut of her latest film, The Last Showgirl. During a question and answer session, Curtis commented on the four ongoing wildfires raging in the Los Angeles area, including the massive Pacific Palisades fire. 'I'm born and raised in the City of Angels,' Curtis said, 'and the entire City of Angels is on fire everywhere. The entire city. The Pacific Palisades is gone.' 'My house tonight is still there, but I live in a different canyon,' Curtis continued, before comparing the damage in Los Angeles to the Gaza war. 'But the entire Pacific Palisades looks like, unfortunately, Gaza or one of these war-torn countries where awful things have happened. And there are now fires breaking out everywhere. It feels totally bizarre to be talking about a movie. But it is a piece of art, and art will save us - no matter what.' Social media users quicky pounced on Curtis' comments, with some denouncing the comparison as insensitive, while others blasted Curtis over her support for Israel after the October 7th invasion. 'This is a completely atrocious comparison considering this is the same woman who advocated for Israel’s genocide in Gaza,' wrote one user. Another, under the handle @lizziesjuul, wrote: 'i live in california and you would never find me comparing these fires to gaza…both tragedies but not comparable AT ALL.'

Iran holding war games as it faces Israel tensions, Trump’s retur...	In these exercises, … defense systems will practice the fight against air, missile, and electronic warfare threats in real battlefield conditions… to protect the country’s skies and sensitive and vital areas,' Iranian state television said. By The Algemeiner and Reuters Iran was holding air defense exercises on Saturday, state media reported, as the country braces for more friction with arch-enemy Israel and the United States under incoming US president Donald Trump. The war games take place as Iranian leaders face the risk that Trump could empower Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to attack Iran’s nuclear sites, while further tightening US sanctions on its oil industry through his 'maximum pressure' policy. 'In these exercises, … defense systems will practice the fight against air, missile and electronic warfare threats in real battlefield conditions… to protect the country’s skies and sensitive and vital areas,' Iranian state television said. Saturday’s drills are part of two-months-long exercises launched on Jan. 4 which have already included war games in which the elite Revolutionary Guards defended key nuclear installations in Natanz against mock attacks by missiles and drones, state media said. Iran’s military has said it was using new drones and missiles in the exercises and released footage of a new underground 'missile city' being visited by Guards Commander-in-Chief Major General Hossein Salami. Iran has recently suffered setbacks in Lebanon after Israeli attacks against Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the toppling of Tehran’s ally President Bashar Al-Assad in Syria last month. But Salami warned, in a speech carried by state TV about a 'false sense of delight' among Iran’s enemies, saying Iran and particularly its missile forces were stronger than ever. While Iranian officials have downplayed Iran’s setbacks, an Iranian general, Behrouz Esbati, who was reportedly based in Syria, said in a speech circulated on social media that Iran had 'badly lost' in Syria. Reuters could not verify the recording. Trump in 2018 withdrew from a deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 in which Iran agreed to curb uranium enrichment, which can yield material for nuclear weapons, in return for the relaxation of US and U.N. economic sanctions.

Israel mulling new security zone in Syria to protect Golan – repo...	It is 'incredible' that the West is rushing to help the new regime when it is led by Muslim extremists, Israeli official says. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Senior Israeli officials said Thursday that Israel will need to maintain an operational presence 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) wide inside Syrian territory to ensure the safety of Golan Heights residents. Moreover, they said that a full 60-km radius of influence under the control of Israeli intelligence is also required to prevent potential threats such as missile launchings from emerging from the surrounding areas. 'We’re building an operational concept for this new reality,' said one official, who expressed amazement that Western countries, including the U.S., are rushing to have a relationship with the Muslim extremist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group that felled the decades-long Ba’athist regime last month. These democracies were purposefully 'choosing to be blind' when dealing with 'some of the most dangerous people in the world,' who hail from ISIS and al-Qaida, groups whose stated goal is to brutally install a Muslim caliphate wherever they gain power. Notably, the Biden administration has already reduced some sanctions and removed a $10 million bounty that had been placed on the head of HTS chief and de facto Syrian leader Ahmad al-Sharaa ten years ago. 'It’s incredible how the world has fallen into this trap again,' the official said, noting that 'The Arab world surrounding us understands the threat and is warning the West but they refuse to listen.' Germany, France, the U.S. and others have sent representatives to meet with Syria’s new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, who has talked as if he is no longer a Muslim fanatic, saying that his regime will protect minorities and is not interested in fighting Israel, among other things that are music to Western ears. At the same time, he has requested both massive financial aid to reconstruct Syria, and that Israel’s allies pressure Jerusalem into withdrawing the forces it rushed to the demilitarized zone between the two countries when the lightning takeover took place, and has maintained there ever since. The IDF has also bombed and destroyed much of Syria’s most dangerous weapons and air defense, its entire navy and a vital missile-producing facility, and continues operations as needed, which the new regime says should stop immediately. Israel cannot afford to be as gullible as the West, the official indicated. The new regime’s détente with Israel 'might hold true for a year, two years, maybe even 10 or 20,' the official said. 'But no one can guarantee that eventually, they won’t turn against us – and these are highly dangerous people.' The official noted other potential threats as well, including al-Sharaa allowing safe residency to fellow Sunni Jihadist organizations such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), whose forces are still battling the IDF in the Gaza Strip since their invasion of Israel and slaughter of 1,200 people last October 7. 'We won’t allow their establishment in Syria just as we prevented Iran’s foothold there,' the official said. 'We estimate that al-Sharaa prefers to keep them there so they can act against Israel, giving him plausible deniability.' Israel is at least not too worried about Iran itself regaining influence in Syria, considering that as Shiite Muslims who propped up the former Assad regime, the mullahs and their chief terror proxy, Hezbollah, are persona non grata in the country.

Lawmaker bolts Yesh Atid party, forms new Knesset faction	Former Deputy Foreign Minister Idan Roll announces his departure from the Yesh Atid party and the formation of a new party, dubbed the National Majority. By World Israel News Staff A Knesset member from the center-left Yesh Atid faction announced Sunday morning that he has resigned from the party and plans to establish a new faction in the Knesset. MK Idan Roll, 40, took to X/Twitter to reveal that he has informed Opposition Leader and Yesh Atid chairman Yair Lapid that he has decided to leave the party, reducing its Knesset delegation from 24 seats to 23. Roll, who previously served as Deputy Foreign Minister, said that he will retain his Knesset seat and establish a new political movement, tentatively dubbed the 'National Majority.' 'The October 7th was a double wake-up call for us,' Roll tweeted. 'For the first time, we awoke to a war of survival, which revealed in our people tremendous strength and a willingness to sacrifice and give in defense of our common home. For the second time, we awoke to the recognition of the common identity that binds us together, and that our common interest in the existence of the state is stronger than anything that separated us.' 'The large and courageous public that rose up on October 7 to fight for the country and restore it must also take its place in the national leadership. But for this to happen, we must open the closed club of the Knesset and ensure that the State of Israel does not miss a historic opportunity for change.' 'This morning, I informed the chairman of the Yesh Atid faction, MK Yair Lapid, of my resignation from the party and my departure for an independent path.' 'I will continue to serve the public as a constructive opposition and work to open the gates of the Knesset for political and ideological renewal. I thank Lapid for the shared path and the privilege of serving the country alongside him as Deputy Foreign Minister and as a member of Knesset. Yesh Atid was a political home for me and I am full of appreciation for my members of the faction, the party leadership, and the dedicated activists.' A former male model who initially joined the Likud party as a member of the liberal 'New Likudniks' movement, Roll first entered the Knesset on the Blue and White ticket in 2019, after joining the Yesh Atid party.

IDF probe finds kibbutz members likely killed by friendly fire on...	Dikla Arava was shot in her car while being kidnapped, son Tomer was hiding in bushes in Nahal Oz. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A mother and son in Kibbutz Nahal Oz were likely killed accidentally by IDF forces battling Hamas terrorists there on October 7, the army said on Friday. While saying that 'It is not possible to determine with complete certainty what caused' the deaths of Dikla Arava and her son, Tomer Eliaz Arava, the IDF presented as full a picture as it could based on 'various sources' as well as eyewitness testimony of soldiers, commanders and members of the kibbutz who were there at the time. According to the report, which was presented to the family on Thursday, the chronology of events showed that on the morning of the mass invasion from Gaza, after dozens of terrorists overran the kibbutz, several broke into the Arava-Elyakim family home and shot at the door of the safe room where the family was hiding and took the family captive. As a result of this shooting, the head of the family, Noam Elyakim, was wounded badly in the leg. The terrorists then used Dikla’s cell phone to broadcast a live video feed on Facebook of forcing Tomer, 17, at gunpoint, to walk around the nearby houses in the kibbutz and call on the neighbors to come out of their homes. 'After about an hour and a half,' the report said, 'Tomer managed to escape from the terrorists and hide. A few minutes later, a combat force, which had been engaged in intense fighting for six hours in the kibbutz' against the numerous infiltrators, 'identified a suspicious figure' and shot at him several times. The investigation concluded that this person was most likely Tomer, who was killed by this tragic case of mistaken identification. As for his mother, the report said that terrorists put her in the family’s car along with her partner, Noam, and his two daughters, Ela (8) and Dafna (15), and started driving towards the Gaza border to take them hostage. The analysis of events concluded that 'amid fierce combat with numerous terrorists,' IDF soldiers shot at the fleeing car, hitting it in the back, and that it was 'a reasonable possibility' that at least one of the bullets killed Dikla. 'After the shooting, the terrorists abandoned the vehicle within the kibbutz, leaving behind' her body, the report stated. Noam’s body was also found later. The two girls were eventually released among others from the kibbutz and more than 80 other Israeli women and children in the only hostage deal to date, in late November 2023. The team leading the investigation was headed by Col. (res.) Yaron Sitbon, who is also in charge of the parallel inquiry into the entire 12-hour battle for Nachal Oz, which has yet to be completed, the army said. Twelve other kibbutz members were murdered by the terrorists on the kibbutz, as well as a student from Tanzania whose body was stolen into Gaza, and a Border Police officer who was killed in the battles. Two members of the kibbutz, Tsachi Idan and Omri Miran, are still being held hostage in the Gaza Strip. The IDF expressed its 'deep condolences to the Arava-Eliaz-Elyakim family and the Nahal Oz community' upon presenting the report. The kibbutz published a statement calling the investigation 'unbearably difficult and heartbreaking.'

Israel, Hamas want hostage deal before Trump inaugurated: Report	Hamas has still not provided Israel with a list of living hostages, as reports indicate progress made in talks. By World Israel News Staff Israel and the Hamas terror group are aiming to secure a hostage and ceasefire deal before incoming president-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20th, an Israeli official told Hebrew-language outlet Mako. On Saturday, Trump's envoy to the Middle East Steven Witkoff traveled to Israel from Doha, Qatar, where the ongoing talks are being held. Witkoff met with Prime Minister Benjamín Netanyahu and other senior officials. According to a Mako report, Witkoff conveyed that Trump 'wants to see a deal' before his inauguration. A source involved in the Doha talks told Mako that 'there is a desire on all sides to try and reach an agreement before January 20th.' An Israeli delegation, including Mossad head David Barnea and Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, departed for Doha, Qatar late Saturday evening, signaling that the negotiations may be reaching a critical stage. 'If there wasn’t real progress, Netanyahu wouldn’t have decided to send a delegation to Doha for the hostage deal talks,' an official told the Jerusalem Post. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a media statement that they welcomed the decision to send the Israel delegation to Qatar. 'We call on the delegation: This is a historic opportunity to secure the release of all our loved ones,' the Forum said. Notably, Hamas has still not provided Israel with a list of living hostages, which Jerusalem has maintained as a basic condition before negotiations can progress. A rough outline of the potential deal, widely reported by international media, involves three stages focused on the Philadelphia Corridor. In the first phase of the deal, Israel would pull back its troop presence along the corridor. In the second phase, the IDF will remain at a limited number of sites near the corridor. The third phase would see Israel completely withdraw from the Philadelphia corridor, despite previous insistence that such a condition is a non-starter.

By World Israel News Staff A delegation representing Israeli towns and cities in Judea and Samaria will attend President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Monday, January 20th, an organization aligned with the settlement announced over the weekend. The Yesha Council, an umbrella organization representing the Israeli municipal bodies across Judea and Samaria, said Saturday night that it will be dispatching a delegation next week, after the Trump transition team invited settlement leaders to attend the incoming president's inauguration. 'Next week, a delegation from the Yesha Council will participate in the inauguration ceremony of President Trump,' the council wrote on its Facebook account. The delegation is slated to include several prominent leaders from the Yesha Council, including council chairman Israel Ganz, who also serves as mayor of the Binyamin Regional Council, Samaria Regional Council mayor Yossi Dagan, and Oranit Mayor Or Peron-Zumer. 'We are leaving on behalf of Judea and Samaria residents to stand alongside our friend and President Trump at the inauguration,' Ganz said, according to Arutz Sheva. 'The invitation we received from the administration reflects shared values between Israel, the settlements, and the U.S. rooted in biblical principles.' 'We share a common value struggle against the global axis of evil, with the settlements being the spearhead protecting Israel, the U.S., and the free world. We believe significant achievements can bring stability to the world order, and we wish Trump success in this endeavor. We continue to strengthen ties with top administration officials for this purpose.' During their visit, the delegation will present the new president with a letter thanking him for his recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and the relocation of the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Last month, the Trump transition team issued invitations to the Yesha Council leaders. In 2017, a smaller delegation representing the Yesha Council was invited to Trump's first presidential inauguration. The Trump transition team has also invited to the inauguration ceremony the families of seven American hostages held captive in the Gaza Strip.

‘Make the UK Khamenei-free,’ says anti-nuclear Iran campaign	Iranian influence centers throughout Europe disseminate radical Islamic ideology pushed by the Ayatollah, says watchdog group. By World Israel News Staff A group campaigning to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is raising awareness about Tehran's networks within the United Kingdom, urging Brits to root out centers of influence controlled by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), a non-partisan group based in the U.S., is raising awareness about Iran-backed Islamic extremism centers in Great Britain. In a video kicking off the #KhameneiFreeZone campaign, UANI's head of IRGC research, Kasra Aarabi, explained how deeply Iran has infiltrated Europe. 'I'm outside the office of Ayatollah Khamenei. but I'm not in Tehran. I'm in London, in the heart of Europe,' Aarabi said, as the Islamic Centre England (ICE) is seen in the background. According to UANI, ICE functions as Khamenei's headquarters in the UK, with speakers and events at the center supporting his agenda. As UANI’s 2025 campaign gains momentum, it will start in the United Kingdom this month and move on to additional major European capitals this year. View the #KhameneiFreeZone Campaign video below and visit the resource here: pic.twitter.com/SLdF20pDMo &mdash; UANI (@UANI) January 8, 2025 On its website, UANI points to a number of incidents at ICE, including a video filmed at the center which saw British children singing a song in which they 'pledge their allegiance to Khamenei and their willingness to join an apocalyptic army to kill Jews and infidels.' 'Khamenei has bult a network of infiltration centers across Europe which target our communities, support terrorism, promote extreme antisemitism, and even seek to recruit and radicalize European nationals,' Hiva Wallace, a senior advisor to UANI. 'Shockingly&#8230;some of the IRGC's most violent and extreme commanders were hosted by Khamenei's London-based Islamic Students Association,' continued Wallace. UANI listed a number of regime-backed speakers hosted by the ISA, including Saeed Ghasemi, who previously 'boasted about training al-Qaeda operatives in Europe.' Hossein Yetka, another speaker, claimed that 'Jews created homosexuality.' Despite being subject to UK sanctions for 'gross human rights violations,' senior IRGC Ali Fazli was permitted to lecture British students. The goal of the UANI is to ensure that European governments take the threat of Iranian influence seriously, and shutter Islamic centers and associations where radical ideology pushed by Tehran is disseminated.

Hamas, PA clash over Jenin anti-terror operation	PA accuses Hamas of sacrificing Gaza for Iranian interests. By World Israel News Staff The Palestinian Authority and Hamas are trading barbs, as the PA conducts an extensive anti-terror operation in Jenin, which has long been a haven for Hamas and its affiliated groups. Hamas official Abdul Rahman Shadid blasted the PA in a media statement, claiming that the entity's security forces were given 'shoot-to-kill' orders and told to target Hamas terrorists. Referencing an incident last week, which saw PA forces shoot three Hamas operatives in a vehicle, critically wounding one, Shadid said that the PA 'issued instructions to liquidate and kill resistance fighters in the West Bank.' Shadid added that the PA is 'increasingly willing to shed Palestinian blood, as evidenced by the events in Jenin refugee camp over the past 38 days, during which nine Palestinians, including women and children, have been killed.' The PA's ruling Fatah party responded by warning Hamas that it will not allow the terror group to usurp power in any of its territory within Judea and Samaria. In a media statement, Fatah stressed that 'Hamas, which has jeopardized the interests and resources of the Palestinian people in favor of Iran and caused the destruction of Gaza' will never be permitted to 'reproduce its activities in the West Bank.' Notably, Fatah also emphasized that Hamas regularly uses civilians 'as human shields, instead of protecting them and their homes.' Fatah pointed the finger at Iran, saying that they would not lend a hand to Tehran's 'expansionist ambitions to turn Palestine into an area of influence, even at the cost of the blood of Palestinian children.' The media back-and-forth comes as the PA's security forces have been carrying out a massive raid in Jenin, aimed at rooting out terror groups from the city. The clashes have seen gun battles in the streets of the city, between armed terrorists and PA police.

US envoy Hochstein: ‘Israel will withdraw from Lebanon in two wee...	Hochstein reportedly said he had consulted with Israeli officials and had obtained 'a detailed timeline for the withdrawal.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News US special envoy Amos Hochstein has reportedly told Lebanese officials that the IDF will withdraw from Lebanon by January 26, before the end of the six-week ceasefire deal, Lebanon's Hezbollah-affiliated Al Akhbar reports. According to the news outlet, Hochstein delivered this assurance during meetings with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, Prime Minister Najib Mikati, and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. Hochstein reportedly said he had consulted with Israeli officials and had obtained 'a detailed timeline for the withdrawal,' adding that 'January 26 will be the final date for Israeli forces in Lebanon.' Hochstein also urged the Lebanese army to 'fill the void' that will be left by the departure of Israeli forces. He emphasized the requirement to transfer all weapons south of the Litani River from Hezbollah to the Lebanese army. Lebanese military forces reportedly told Hochstein that the transition 'will unfold naturally.' Last month, Israeli leaders warned Beirut that if the current ceasefire with Hezbollah fails due to Lebanon's failure to enforce the truce in its territory, Israel will hold the Lebanese government responsible. Following a serious breach of the ceasefire agreement when Hezbollah shelled Mount Dov in Israeli territory, Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a stern warning that should the truce continue to be violated and the ceasefire agreement collapse, Israel will not limit its retaliatory strikes to Hezbollah itself, but will instead hold the Lebanese government responsible. 'There will no longer be an exemption for the state of Lebanon,' Katz said while visiting Israel's northern border Tuesday. 'We will work with all our might to enforce all the understandings of the ceasefire agreement, and we show maximum response and zero tolerance.' 'Yesterday was the first test, the shooting at Mount Dov. We reacted strongly, and this is exactly what we will do, and we will not allow Hezbollah to return to the old methods they had, such as the [Hezbollah] tent that was set up and not attacked.' Katz demanded that Beirut 'authorize the Lebanese army to enforce their part, to keep Hezbollah away beyond the Litani and to dismantle all the infrastructure.'

IDF reveals names of four soldiers who fell in Gaza	The soldiers were Sgt.-Maj. (res.) Alexander Fedorenko, St.-Sgt. Danila Diakov, Sgt. Yahav Maayan, and Sgt. Eliav Astuker. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Saturday, the IDF released the names of four soldiers who were killed in Gaza. The soldiers were Sgt.-Maj. (res.) Alexander Fedorenko, St.-Sgt. Danila Diakov, Sgt. Yahav Maayan, and Sgt. Eliav Astuker. Fedorenko, 37, was a resident of Bat Yam and served as a truck driver in the IDF's 79th Battalion of the 14th Brigade. The other three soldiers were significantly younger, and all served in the 931st Battalion of the Nahal Brigade. Diakov, 21, was from Ma'ale Adumim; Maayan, 19, was from Modi'in; and Astuker, 19, was from Ashdod. The IDF also reported that a reservist officer in the Nahal Brigade and a soldier from the 931st Battalion were severely injured on Saturday. Both were evacuated to a hospital for medical treatment. The soldiers were killed when they were ambushed by terrorists while traveling in a convoy in Beit Hanoun in Gaza. Regarding the death of Danila Diakov, Maaleh Adumim Mayor Guy Yifrach announced, 'Dear residents, it is with deep sorrow and profound grief that I announce the death in battle in Gaza of a beloved city resident, Nahal Brigade soldier, and Israeli hero, Staff Sergeant Danila Diakov. May his blood be avenged by G-d.' 'Our hearts are with his cherished family—his parents, Alexander and Natalia, and his sisters, Alina and Maya—who today received the most heartbreaking news. Details regarding the procession and funeral will be shared separately.' 'The family of Amit Yud School in Ashdod is deeply pained and mourning the loss of our graduate, Eliav Astuker, may G-d avenge his blood,' said the school's principal, Yaron Carmi. 'Eliav was a young man beloved by his friends and teachers alike.' 'His decision to enlist in a combat unit was natural, driven by his desire to serve his people and his country. His loss is an immense tragedy, and our hearts go out to his dear parents and the entire family. We will honor Eliav's memory and continue to educate in his spirit.'

Netanyahu sends Israeli delegation to negotiate hostage deal in D...	Channel 13 cited two sources who said there was 'cautious progress' in the hostage deal. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has approved sending an Israeli delegation to Doha to negotiate a hostage deal. The decision follows a meeting between Netanyahu and US President-elect Donald Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff on Saturday. In addition, Netanyahu held a situational assessment on the issue of hostages with Defense Minister Israel Katz, Israel's top security officials, and representatives from the Biden administration and the incoming Trump administration. Following the meeting, Netanyahu sent Mossad chief David Barnea, Shin Bet director Ron Bar, IDF hostage point man Maj. Gen. (res.) Nitzan Alon, and political advisor Ophir Falk to Doha to negotiate the hostage deal. Channel 13 cited two sources who said there was 'cautious progress' in the hostage deal. A Hamas source told the Qatari news outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that the proposal was complete and required only Netanyahu's approval. Although previously Hamas had demanded a full IDF withdrawal from Gaza before hostages could be released, the current agreement has allowed Israel's military to remain in Gaza, including the Philadelphi corridor, until the last day of the plan. Hamas and Egypt have reportedly agreed to postpone the discussion of several issues until later phases of the agreement. The source told Channel 13 that negotiators were 'at the closest point [yet] to completing the agreement.' Netanyahu had previously insisted that he would not accept a proposal that would force Israel to end the war in Gaza; the current deal on the table requires the IDF to leave the Philadelphi corridor in the final phase. Arab media reports that Hamas will soon provide a list of living hostages that it is prepared to release. Foreign sources note that Israel has made significant concessions, including withdrawing a number of troops in the initial 'humanitarian' phase of the deal. al-Araby al-Jadeed reports that this is the 'closest' the two sides have gotten to a hostage release agreement.

Assad refused Iran’s plea to attack Israel after Oct. 7	The Syrian dictator refused, citing strained relations with the Islamic Republic. By Jewish Breaking News Syria’s Bashar al-Assad rebuffed multiple Iranian requests to attack a vulnerable Israel in the aftermath of Hamas’ October 7 massacre. Under Assad’s rule, Syria had served as Iran’s regional terror hub, having facilitated weapons transfers to terror proxy groups like Hezbollah and Hamas for decades. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) also controlled airports, and warehouses, and operated missile and drone manufacturing bases in Syria. However, a leaked recording of a speech given by IRGC Behrouz Esbati at a mosque in Tehran last week reveals that Assad had been presented with comprehensive military plans to leverage Iranian assets in Syria for strikes against Israel. But in spite of his thirst for innocent blood, the Syrian dictator refused, citing strained relations with the Islamic Republic. 'I don’t consider losing Syria something to be proud of,' Esbati said in the recording obtained by the New York Times. 'We were defeated, and defeated very badly, we took a very big blow and it’s been very difficult.' Serving as an IRCG commander in Syria, Esbati also accused ally Russia of actively undermining operations in the war-torn country. According to his account, Russian forces deliberately misled Iran by claiming to bomb Syrian rebel positions while actually dropping ordnance on empty fields. More damaging still, he alleged that Russia had turned off Tehran’s alert radars during Israel’s retaliatory strikes in October. While Esbati outlined plans to maintain influence through insurgent networks in post-Assad Syria, experts question the regime’s ability to effectively operate given the new political landscape and Israeli warnings of swift retaliation against any detected Iranian presence. Yet perhaps most revealing was his frank confession about future strikes against Israel. Dropping the usual bravado that typically characterizes Iranian official statements, Esbati admitted that there were 'operational limitations' and pointed to last fall’s missile barrage against Israel as the IRGC’s sole response for the time being.

Houthis paying ‘heavy price,’ Netanyahu says after Israeli strike...	The Israeli military said that 'military infrastructure sites' in the Hizaz power station were among the targets it struck. By JNS Israeli fighter jets hit Houthi terror targets on Yemen’s western coast and inland in the country on Friday, the Israel Defense Forces stated. 'The Houthi terrorist regime has repeatedly attacked the State of Israel, its citizens and civilian infrastructure in Israel,' including using drones and surface-to-surface missiles, the Israeli military stated. 'The State of Israel has the right and obligation to defend itself.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated on Friday afternoon that 'just as we promised, the Houthis are paying, and will continue to pay, a heavy price for their aggression against us,' according to an English translation of his remarks provided by his office. 'Today, we attacked terrorist targets of the Houthi terrorist regime along the western coastal strip and deep in Yemen. The Houthis are a proxy of Iran, and they serve the terrorist objectives of the Iranian axis in the Middle East,' he stated. 'They constitute a danger to Israel and the entire region, including global freedom of navigation.' The Israeli prime minister added that the Jewish state won’t abide attacks on the country and its citizens. 'We will take determined and forceful action against anyone who threatens the State of Israel wherever and whenever necessary,' Netanyahu stated. The Israeli military said that 'military infrastructure sites' in the Hizaz power station were among the targets it struck. That site 'serves as a central source of energy for the Houthi terrorist regime in its military activities,' the IDF stated. Israel also hit 'military infrastructure' in the ports of Al Hudaydah and Ras Isa on Yemen’s western coast. 'The targets struck are examples of the Houthis’ exploitation of civilian infrastructure for its terrorist activities,' the IDF said. The Israeli military stated that Houthi 'attacks on international shipping vessels and routes continue to destabilize the region and the wider world.' 'While the Houthi terrorist regime operates as an independent terrorist organization, it relies on Iranian cooperation and funding to attack the State of Israel and its citizens,' it added. 'The IDF will continue to operate at any distance against any threat to the State of Israel and its citizens.' On Jan. 8, U.S. Central Command stated that its forces hit 'two Iranian-backed Houthi underground advanced conventional weapon storage facilities within Houthi-controlled territories of Yemen.' 'The Houthis used these facilities to conduct attacks against U.S. Navy warships and merchant vessels in the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden,' CENTCOM stated, noting no U.S. troops were hurt nor equipment damaged. 'The strikes are part of CENTCOM’s effort to degrade Iranian-backed Houthi attempts to threaten regional partners and military and merchant vessels in the region,' it added. Also on Wednesday, Israeli air-defense systems shot down three Houthi drones launched from Yemen. Since Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Houthis have launched about 40 ballistic missiles and about 320 drones at the Jewish state, per the Israeli military.

The hostage release deal will include three phases, and Israel will gradually withdraw troops from Gaza beginning in the first phase until it leaves the Philadelphi corridor on the last day of the agreement.

Forged in fire: Gaza war showcases women’s integration into the I...	More than a year of war has opened new opportunities for female soldiers across a wide range of fields and units. By Amelie Botbol, JNS 'It’s amazing how, in this war, you see female doctors, paramedics and pilots. You hear them on the radio and you see them on the ground. Gradually the barrier was broken,' Lt. Col. Shani Kisri, medical chief of the Israel Defense Forces’ 162nd Division, told JNS on Friday. The integration of women into front-line positions, Kisri said, started approximately in the beginning of the ’90s. By 1996, there were female paramedics embedded in various battalions, with the Golani Brigade being the pioneer. After her return to service in 2010 after graduating from medical school, Kisri became the first-ever battalion doctor for an Israeli infantry brigade. During 2014’s 'Operation Protective Edge,' Kisri noted, she was likely the only female doctor in the Gaza Strip.

'I was in a special unit back then. The female paramedics were less present on the battlefield. Now you see them everywhere. There are more female pilots, paramedics, doctors and females in special operations units. This war gave us a chance to prove that it works,' she said. 'They proved they can do the job, handle the rough conditions and the long fighting period. ‘Protective Edge’ was a few weeks and it was hard. This war has lasted over a year now. I have paramedics who have been in the field for months. It’s not easy and they handled it perfectly,' she added. 'Gradually we will see that more and more females are integrated into more battlefield positions because at the end of the day, the army needs good people with motivation to serve and whether it’s a male or female, today, we know it doesn’t really matter,' she told JNS. IDF Armored Corps soldiers at a staging area near the Gaza Strip on Jan. 1, 2024. Photo by Tomer Neuberg/Flash90. There are a few difficulties, Kisri noted, especially for female medical corps soldiers. 'Usually, you’re the only female around, especially if you’re a doctor or paramedic at the platoon level. You might be the only female among a few dozens of men,' she said. 'You might find yourself, especially in this war, serving for weeks on the battlefield with no interactions with other females, no private quarters, no showers and everything that comes with joint service,' she continued. Still, 'I think we are getting better at understanding the difficulties and supporting the female paramedics and doctors,' she said. 'They are very highly motivated, very qualified and there is a big demand for female doctors and paramedics in the battalions now. So it’s working.' An all-female IDF tank crew that fought on Oct. 7, 2023. Source: Channel 12 News/screenshot. The reason for females often finding themselves alone in a battalion is that they have not yet been integrated into the infantry the way they have been into the medical corps, she said. 'The medical corps is more progressive in this aspect. When the medical corps puts a paramedic in a position, it does not take into account whether the person is male or female, it’s based on experience and qualifications,' she said. 'Being a medical corps personnel in a battalion, coming from a different place, can feel a bit isolating compared to soldiers who went through the entire service together. You have to find your place. Most paramedics integrate quite well,' she continued. The IAF’s five new women UAV operators, Dec. 9, 2020. Credit: IDF Spokesperson’s Unit. 'They get a lot of respect, they tell everybody what to do, they are very assertive and the soldiers take care of them. It’s not easy in battlefield conditions, but the male and female soldiers find solutions,' she added. Kisri told JNS she has more than 40 paramedics in her division and does find women to have more issues than men. 'You sometimes see a paramedic, she is half the size of most of the male soldiers, carrying a bag twice her bodyweight. She won’t stop because she wants to prove that she can do it so that nobody says she can’t because she is a female or because she’s a paramedic,' she said.

'This motivation is highly appreciated by the male soldiers, who usually trust the trial by fire. Once you’ve proven yourself to be equipped to carry your gear and especially once you take care of the first wounded soldiers and have to perform under battlefield conditions, even the most skeptical are convinced,' she added. With regard to the hostages kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, Kisri said the big difference wasn’t between female and male soldiers but rather between soldiers and civilians. 'When you’re a soldier, you go into the army knowing what you’re getting yourself into and the risks you are willing to take, as a male or a female. I don’t think society should tell women that because of their gender the risk is higher. If somebody is willing to take the risk it’s their decision,' she said. Soldiers from the IDF’s 99th Division during operational activities in the central Gaza Strip in an undated photo from November or December, 2024. Credit: IDF. Ensuring that women are treated as equals, Kisri said, falls under the responsibility of the commander, who monitors that the right values are upheld and that soldiers behave in an appropriate manner. 'I do have a lot of females in the field, and I see it as my personal responsibility to make sure that my paramedics and doctors are treated with respect and appropriately. I don’t have many examples to give you of bad incidents,' she said. 'We talk to commanders about it. We don’t just wait for something to happen, we create boundaries, specific orders and rules and enforce them strictly,' she added. While 86% of units in the army are open to women, Kisri said the number of women within these units is also increasing. When she was in the field, 'We were maybe three female doctors in infantry battalions,' she said. 'Today it’s more than 50%. It’s not only about the type of positions that are open, it’s also about the number of women that fill those positions,' she said. 'If you open your mind to the female soldiers, you’ll do so with other minorities. There were other minorities being integrated even before females. Everything is intertwined,' she said. 'I think the army is one of the most progressive places. Sometimes Israeli society should aspire to be more like the army,' she added.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News During a high-level security meeting, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz urged the IDF to draft a plan to completely destroy Hamas if the hostages are not released by the time Donald Trump takes office as US President. Also attending the meeting were IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Defense Ministry Director-General Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir and senior military commanders. Katz also cautioned the IDF to consider what issues may create obstacles, such as the humanitarian aspect and encouraged them to make the plan flexible enough to allow the political echelon to make necessary decisions. The Defense Minister added that considerations of post-war governance in Gaza were irrelevant with Hamas still standing, since no nation or group, whether Arab or not, is interested in taking responsibility for running Gaza while the terror group still has a strong presence there. Katz said a plan that signaled a change of direction and decisive action against Hamas was needed to avoid the conflict from becoming a quagmire and a war of attrition with no progress on the release of hostages. Katz said, 'We must not let ourselves be dragged into a drawn-out war of attrition while hostages remain trapped in Hamas tunnels, their lives at risk and suffering greatly.' He added, 'The commanders and soldiers of the IDF, both active and reserve, are performing heroically and achieving remarkable success. However, alongside these efforts, we must adjust our strategy to ensure the elimination of Hamas and bring the war to an end. We cannot afford to be drawn into a costly war of attrition that would prevent us from achieving a decisive victory—one that delivers a total strategic defeat of Hamas and brings the conflict in Gaza to a close.' The plan focused on a total defeat of Hamas is likely to be focused in part on destroying the terror group's military capabilities and infrastructure in Nuseirat and Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, where many of the hostages are held. One of the reasons the IDF has held back is the fear of harming hostages during these operations.

Nearly half of college students sympathize more with accused murd...	The Generation Lab findings highlight a sharp divide in attitudes toward the gunning-down of Thompson, with younger individuals more likely to view it favorably and sympathize with Mangione. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon Nearly half of college students in America view the accused murderer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson favorably, while more than 8 in 10 hold a negative opinion of Thompson, according to a new Generation Lab poll. When asked to choose between the two, 45 percent of students said they side with accused killer Luigi Mangione, 17 percent with Thompson, and 37 percent with neither, the poll found. Forty-eight percent said they believe the murder was totally or somewhat justified, and 81 percent reported having an extremely or somewhat negative view of the victim. Mangione, 26, is accused of murdering the UnitedHealthcare CEO outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel on December 4. He has pleaded not guilty to murder and other state charges. He is also facing federal charges, including stalking and using a firearm to commit murder, with the death penalty on the table. The Generation Lab findings highlight a sharp divide in attitudes toward the gunning-down of Thompson, with younger individuals more likely to view it favorably and sympathize with Mangione. A similar trend appeared in an Emerson poll last month, in which 41 percent of voters under 30 described the killing as 'acceptable,' far more than any other age group. Social media users, meanwhile, have lionized the accused murderer, with Axios reporting that 'the Internet' is cheering him as a 'folk hero.' Mangione is scheduled to make his next court appearance on February 17.

Fake news and psychological warfare: ‘An unbelievable success of ...	We’ve learned with the time to filter the messages and not to believe anything that Hamas, or whoever, says, until there is an official confirmation,' said Talik Gvili, whose son's body is being held in Gaza. By Pesach Benson and Anna Epshtein, TPS Monday’s headlines claimed Hamas had approved a list of 34 Israeli hostages to be released in a potential ceasefire agreement, raising both hopes of a breakthrough and fears that some hostages would be condemned to possibly never return. The following day, Israeli officials said they never received such a list from Hamas. 'The report in the Arab media about a pause of a number of weeks in the war in exchange for a list of hostages’ names is absolutely false and an additional part of the psychological warfare that Hamas is trying to use on the hostages’ families and the citizens of Israel,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. Relatives of the captives told The Press Service of Israel that Hamas’s fake news and hostage videos take a toll. Learning to ‘Filter the Messages’ 'We’ve learned with the time to filter the messages and not to believe anything that Hamas, or whoever, says, until there is an official confirmation,' said Talik Gvili. Her son, Police Sgt. First Class Ran Gvili, 24, was killed in the area of Kibbutz Alumim on October 7 and his body taken to Gaza. 'I can’t say it doesn’t shake us at all, it does. But we understand it’s psychological warfare against us, and we try to keep calm. It’s a pity to see that the media help Hamas with their goal and print all kinds of rumors before they are confirmed,' she said. The psychological warfare has taken a particular toll on the Bibas family. Terrorists kidnapped Yarden Bibas, his wife Shiri, and their children, Ariel, then four, and Kfir, then seven months, the youngest hostage. Shiri and the children were supposed to be released along with 105 other women and children during the temporary ceasefire of November 2023. On November 29, Hamas claimed the three had been killed in an Israeli airstrike. But the terror group provided no evidence. Israel accused Hamas of psychological warfare and said the terror group was responsible for the safety of the hostages. 'It’s really hard for us when another half-true or entirely false report about the possible deal gets out, and then we are bombarded with questions, and it’s not pleasant in any situation, but especially in a one like this,' Eylon Keshet, a cousin of the Israeli-Argentine/Peruvian Yarden Bibas told TPS-IL. 'It doesn’t really give us hope, rather it confuses us. And it hurts us to think about the families that are not on the list. How should they feel?! We know that when there is anything true people from the army get in touch with us. Last time, it was several months ago when they let us know about a sign of life from Yarden.' Keshet added, 'We want to really ask the media and the public not to take part in this psychological warfare of Hamas and not to publish unconfirmed information.' ‘An Unbelievable Success of Hamas’ Dr. Ron Schleifer, who teaches communications at Ariel University, told TPS-IL, 'Everything that comes out of Hamas’s mouth in the context of the hostages should be treated through the lens of a psychological war. Every video clip, every message.' According to Schleifer, a hostage deal is not a means but a goal for Hamas. 'They understand they are defeated in the field, so they go to psychological warfare. They act according to the plan. The hostages are the second stage, the first was the rapes and murders of the October 7 that were meant to shock the Israelis and successfully managed to do so. The second step is a long war. The goal is to exhaust the Israelis.' Schleifer explained that Hamas sought to 'give hope and then blow it up' with Sunday’s hostage list. 'When you build up the hopes and then blow them up, it’s a much bigger breakdown. It influences the families, and then friends, and then the media, and then the security system and eventually the political system,' he said. 'It’s an unbelievable success of Hamas that they managed to shift the blame for the hostages still in Gaza to the Israeli government and made people forget that Hamas kidnapped them to Gaza, not Netanyahu,' Schleifer added. Asked how Israel could counter Hamas’s psychological warfare, Schleifer said Israel need only return the blame to Hamas. 'And we don’t do this. We have so much intelligence from Hamas members that we have arrested during this war about the tortures of Hamas against Gazans, not Israelis,' Schleifer insisted. 'Israel must use the Gazan’s disappointment against Hamas, must lead it. And Hamas should always be afraid. Hamas members surrender each day, we just do not speak about this in the media enough.' At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 96 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Domestic defense contracts a major step in Israeli self-sufficien...	Defense officials have stated in recent months that achieving a higher level of defense production autonomy allows Israel to choose its partnerships and take part in valuable strategic alliances—especially with Washington—from a position of strength, rather than dependency. By Yaakov Lappin, JNS The Israeli Defense Ministry’s announcement on Jan. 7 of two major contracts with Israeli defense contractor Elbit Systems, valued jointly at approximately NIS 1 billion, constitutes one of the strongest signals yet that Israel is decreasing its reliance on defense imports wherever it can. The agreements, signed by Defense Ministry Director General Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir and Elbit Systems President & CEO Bezhalel ('Butzi') Machlis, are aimed at leveraging domestic Israeli industry to boost the IDF’s operational independence and force buildup capabilities. This strategic initiative marks a critical shift as part of Israel’s Blue and White Independence Program, which seeks to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers while boosting local manufacturing capabilities, according to a Defense Ministry statement. The first agreement, led by the Defense Procurement Directorate (DPD), involves the production of thousands of heavy air munitions for the IDF. The second agreement, overseen by the Planning Department and the Directorate of Defense Research & Development (DDR&D), entails the establishment of a national raw materials plant. This facility will feature advanced production lines for materials critical to the manufacturing of weapons, which were previously sourced primarily from abroad. According to Zamir, these agreements will ensure an Israeli sovereign ability to make bombs and munitions 'of all types,' adding, 'This is a central lesson from the war that will enable the IDF to continue operating powerfully in all theaters.' The Nagel Commission report The necessity for domestic production was also highlighted by the Nagel Commission, which was set up to examine how the IDF could better build up its forces after the Oct. 7 mass terror attack. The commission, headed by the former head of Israel’s National Security Council Brig. Gen. Prof. Jacob Nagel, submitted a report to the government on Jan. 6 highlighting the vulnerabilities exposed during the current conflict with Hamas and Hezbollah, including heavy reliance on imports for critical defense materials. The report stated: 'The war significantly challenged many long-held assumptions regarding dependence on imports (mainly from the United States, but not only). [Munition] consumption rates outpaced local production, and imports (of both products and raw material) couldn’t keep up for a range of reasons, mainly: the global arms race (especially the Russia-Ukraine war) and a higher bar for exports to Israel, due to political decisions, public pressure, and the interests of [international] decision-makers.' The report elsewhere noted that incidents 'like an embargo, a shortage in various types of weapons (especially land and air munitions), and fierce global competition over every available resource' mean Israel must become more independent when it comes to arms. The report recommended an aggressive push for self-reliance in defense manufacturing, emphasizing hybrid strategies to maintain rapid access to critical munitions and raw materials. It called for the creation of a robust Israeli Defense Industrial Base (DIB) that integrates both civilian and military manufacturing capabilities. An old-new approach Israel’s pivot toward domestic defense production is not a new concept. Historically, the country began focusing on self-sufficiency after France’s 1967 arms embargo. However, the scale and urgency of the current shift are unprecedented, driven by global uncertainties and heightened Israeli military demands on multiple fronts. Defense officials have stated in recent months that achieving a higher level of defense production autonomy allows Israel to choose its partnerships and take part in valuable strategic alliances—especially with Washington—from a position of strength, rather than dependency. The Blue and White Independence Program was initiated in the fallout of the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks, when Israel found itself needing to receive hundreds of American cargo aircraft carrying ammunition, as well as resupply ships. Alongside a focus on manufacturing, the program also prioritizes research and development of dual-purpose technologies that benefit both civilian and military applications. Examples include advanced laser systems like Rafael’s Iron Beam and quantum technologies for secure communications and rapid intelligence processing. Challenges and benefits The agreements with Elbit Systems are expected to provide highly significant operational benefits to the IDF. For example, the heavy air munitions deal will enhance Israel’s ability to sustain operations across multiple theaters, such as in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as to deal with threats from Iran. Meanwhile, the new raw materials plant will reduce vulnerabilities in the supply chain, ensuring a steady flow of critical components. However, challenges remain. Israel’s dependence on U.S. Foreign Military Financing (FMF) casts a shadow on broader self-sufficiency, as FMF funds must be spent on American-made equipment. Additionally, scaling up domestic production requires significant government investments in infrastructure, automation and workforce training. The agreements also have broader implications for Israel’s economy. By expanding local production lines and fostering innovation, the defense sector will create jobs and stimulate economic growth. Machlis, Elbit’s president, noted this during the Jan. 7 signing with the Defense Ministry, stating, 'This partnership contributes not only to security, but also to economic development and employment, creating livelihoods for thousands of households in Israel.' At least one lesson from the past year and a half of war appears to have resulted in consensus among the Israeli defense establishment: Israel can never again afford to have only a small stockpile of weapons at its disposal, at any time.

Israel confirms Hamza Ziyadne killed in Hamas captivity	The remains of Ziyadne and his father, Youssef, were recovered by the IDF from a tunnel in Rafah, southern Gaza. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces and Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) confirmed on Friday morning that Israeli civilian Hamza Ziyadne, 22, was killed in Hamas captivity. His family was notified following the identification process by National Institute of Forensic Medicine and the Israel Police. The IDF recovered the remains of Ziyadne and his father, Youssef, 53, from a tunnel in Rafah, southern Gaza, on Tuesday night. The IDF and Shin Bet confirmed on Wednesday that Youssef’s remains were found. The statement did not immediately confirm Hamza’s death, though it said that the findings in the tunnel raised 'serious concerns' for his life. They were taken hostage alive during the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, along with two of Youssef’s other children, Bilal, 18, and Aisha, 17. Palestinian terrorists abducted the residents of the Israeli Bedouin community of Rahat while they were working in Kibbutz Holit near the border with Gaza. Bilal and Aisha were released as part of the November 2023 ceasefire agreement between Jerusalem and Hamas after 55 days in captivity. On Oct. 7, 2023, some 25 residents of Rahat, the largest Muslim Bedouin city in Israel, headed to Gaza border Kibbutzim Holit and Sufa to work and did not return. They were among some 1,200 people killed by terrorists during the invasion of of the northwestern Negev. Thousands more were wounded, and 251 were taken back to the Strip as hostages, including six Bedouin. According to Israeli estimates, there are 98 hostages still in Hamas captivity in Gaza, including 94 abducted during the Oct. 7 attacks. Of the 251 hostages taken on Oct. 7, 157 have been returned or rescued, and Hamas is believed to be holding 36 bodies, 34 of them taken on Oct. 7 and the remaining two being IDF soldiers Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul, who were kidnapped in 2014. 'The IDF and Shin Bet send their heartfelt condolences to the families,' the statement said, adding that they are 'continuing to operate in order to bring home all the hostages as soon as possible.'

Netanyahu calls meeting to discuss possible third Iran strike	Israeli support for a harsh response against Iran cuts across political lines. By David Isaac, JNS Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a discussion on Thursday to evaluate the Israeli military’s preparedness for the possibility of a third attack on Iran. Also on the agenda: a more aggressive U.S. policy expected from the incoming Trump administration regarding Iran. Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, after a Nov. 10 meeting with Donald Trump, reportedly left with the impression that the president-elect would support an Israeli Air Force strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities, or possibly send in a U.S. strike, according to news site Axios, citing unnamed sources. On Tuesday, Trump, replying to a question from reporters about a U.S. strike on Iran, said, 'It’s a military strategy and I’m not answering a question on our military strategy. Only a stupid person would answer.' Iran fears a direct Israeli attack against its strategic sites in the near future, having interpreted Israel’s ceasefire with Hezbollah as intended to free up IDF assets to concentrate on the Islamic Republic directly, Channel 12 reported on Dec. 22. It is not clear whether Iran’s weakened position after the fall of the Assad regime in Syria will push it into diplomatic talks to de-escalate matters or drive it to pursue a nuclear bomb with greater energy, as the country’s leaders have sent mixed messages. Ali Abdolalizadeh, an aid to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, said on Dec. 31, 'We must negotiate with Mr. Trump. The country’s issues cannot be left unresolved, and the entire establishment has also reached the conclusion that direct negotiations are necessary,' Iran International reported. However, others in the Islamic Republic are calling to ramp up its nuclear program. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan warned on Dec. 22 that voices in Iran are saying publicly that it should construct a nuclear bomb. 'If you’re Iran right now and you’re looking around at the fact that your conventional capability has been reduced, your proxies have been reduced, your main client state has been eliminated, Assad has fallen, it’s no wonder there are voices saying: ‘Hey, maybe we need to go for a nuclear weapon right now,’' Sullivan told reporters. In Israel, senior officials have called to again attack Iran. On Dec. 22, Ynet reported that Mossad Director David Barnea advocated for such a strike in response to attacks on Israel by the Houthis, a Yemen-based proxy of Tehran. 'Go for the head, Iran,' Barnea argued, officials said. Israeli support for a harsh response against Iran cuts across political lines. Benny Gantz, leader of the opposition National Unity Party, told JNS on Dec. 23 that Israel should take 'all the necessary means' to defend itself against the Iranian threat. Israel struck Iran twice last year, on Oct. 26 and April 19, both times in retaliation for Iranian attacks. Iran’s initial attack on April 13 marked the first time the Islamic Republic had struck Israeli territory directly. Israel’s second attack was more devastating than the first in April. It targeted 20 sites in Iran in multiple waves, destroying Iran’s remaining Russian-built, S-300 surface-to-air missile defense systems. Israel’s strikes left Iran vulnerable to future attacks, Fox News reported at the time, quoting Biden administration adviser Amos Hochstein, who said, 'Iran is essentially naked.' Analysts told JNS last month that Iran’s Islamic dictatorship is ripe for regime change and an Israeli military strike could help push it over the edge. 'This is a golden opportunity,' Janatan Sayeh, a research analyst with the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), told JNS, outlining the possibility of a one-two punch, with the U.S. imposing economic sanctions and Israel delivering military blows.

Government presents softened judicial reform plan	The proposal seeks reforms to the way judges are appointed and Basic Laws function. By JNS Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar presented a pared-down judicial reform proposal on Thursday, reaction to which generally adhered to party lines. Their proposal addresses two issues: 1) the way judges are selected, and 2) Basic Laws, which are quasi-constitutional in nature. The proposal would not go into effect until after a national election is held. Coalition members generally praised the Sa’ar-Levin initiative. By finding agreement with Sa’ar, who brought four additional Knesset seats into the coalition when he joined the government in September, Levin sought to assure the deal would have full coalition support—68 Knesset seats out of 120. MK Boaz Bismuth of the Likud Party said, 'I congratulate Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar on the draft proposal they presented, which brings true good news to the people of Israel.' 'This is an important step toward strengthening the Israeli state and society in the midst of a period of war, when the unity of the people is the key to victory.' 'Even a journey of a thousand miles begins with a small step,' tweeted Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich of the Religious Zionism Party. 'I welcome any progress that will repair and rebuild public trust in the justice system, even if it is a first step. Broad national consensus is important for the unity and strength of the people and justifies compromises,' he said. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir of the Otzma Yehudit Party echoed the sentiment, saying, 'Reform with broad consensus is the right compromise, even when it is not perfect, and therefore I support the draft proposal and the change is welcome.' Opposition parties, on the other hand, expressed disapproval. Opposition leader Yair Lapid of the Yesh Atid Party dismissed the plan, tweeting, 'I will respond to Yariv Levin immediately after he complies with the court order and appoints a president of the High Court of Justice by January 16.' Lapid referred to the court’s order that Levin convene the Judicial Selection Committee and enable it to appoint a president of the Supreme Court. Levin had held up the convening of the committee as he opposed the candidacy of the acting court president, Justice Isaac Amit, who is known for his judicial activism. (As part of the compromise proposal, Levin will remove his opposition to Amit.) Yisrael Beytenu Party head MK Avigdor Liberman treated the outline as at best a partial fix. 'The only solution to the constitutional crisis is the establishment of a constitution for the State of Israel. Everything else is just patch upon patch.' Yair Golan, chairman of the far-left The Democrats, a merger of the Meretz and Labor parties, said his party would not discuss or agree to any proposal until all legislation put forward by the coalition is halted, 'including the attempt to take over the media, the Bar Association, the dismissal of the attorney general, the subordination of the DIP [Department of Internal Police Investigations] to the minister of justice, etc.' The head of the Israel Bar Association, Amit Becher, sharply criticized the deal, calling it a 'deceptive and dangerous proposal for the implementation of the principles of the coup d’état, the main one of which is politicizing the election of Supreme Court justices and increasing the government’s power over the judiciary.' The proposal’s main innovation is to replace the two representatives of the Israel Bar Association on the nine-member Judicial Selection Committee with two attorneys selected by the Knesset—one by the opposition and one by the coalition. Following media inquiries, the judiciary said it could not comment 'for obvious reasons.' At least one exception to the opposition’s rejection was MK Matan Kahana, a member of Benny Gantz’s National Unity Party, who declared his willingness to support the agreement. 'If this is the deal, it does seem like a good proposal around which a broad consensus can be formed,' Kahana said. 'All this on the condition that the minister of justice upholds the High Court’s ruling and appoints a permanent president before next Thursday.' The deal seeks to end the Supreme Court’s control over the selection of judges, one of the main planks of judicial reform, which was derailed by year-long protests in 2023. In the current framework, the Judicial Selection Committee is made up of three Supreme Court judges, two government ministers, two Knesset members and two lawyers from the Israel Bar Association. As seven of the nine members are needed to approve a candidate, and the three judges vote as a bloc, they have veto power over nominees. Given that the Bar Association lawyers typically vote with the judges (because they don’t want to anger the judges who will hear their cases, critics say), the judges also end up with a majority. Supporters of judicial reform argue that the judges’ majority leads to homogeneity—judges who think alike. In addition, the proposal will establish principles for Basic Laws, determining how they are enacted and what topics they can cover, including issues related to national identity and human rights. The proposal also limits judicial review of Basic Laws, requiring a special majority of Supreme Court judges to override them, and includes the passing of a new Basic Law enshrining civil rights in criminal procedures.

Bernie Sanders receives a vote for president of Lebanon as army c...	Vermont senator receives a vote for president in Lebanon's parliament, as Joseph Aoun elected following two year deadlock. By Ben Sales, JTA Lebanon has elected a new president after two years of political indecision, but not before some unexpected characters received votes — including Sen. Bernie Sanders, an American Jew. Lebanon’s president is elected by the parliament for a six-year term and, under the country’s system, must be a Maronite Christian. The eventual victor was the country’s military chief, Joseph Aoun, whose win on Thursday ended two years of political crisis in which 12 successive votes failed to reach the requisite majority. The vote also took place less than two months into the ceasefire that ended a devastating war between Israel and the Lebanese terror group Hezbollah. But on the road to Aoun’s triumph in the second round of voting, some lawmakers cast protest votes. At one point, according to video shared by Al Jazeera English’s news editor, Saad Abedine, a legislator put in a vote for Sanders, the 83-year-old Vermont independent who is the unofficial dean of progressives on Capitol Hill. Sanders won another term in the Senate last November but, for multiple reasons, is ineligible to lead Lebanon. The video shows multiple men in the parliamentary chamber saying Sanders’ name, followed moments later by a loudspeaker enunciating 'Bernie Sanders!' across the room. The next vote appears to be for Aoun. Aoun (no relation to the previous president, Michel Aoun) has led Lebanon’s military since 2017. His victory is a sign of Hezbollah’s weakness, according to The New York Times, after the terror group was heavily battered in its war with Israel. Hezbollah, which also has a political arm, had blocked previous attempts to elect a president. This time, its candidate dropped out. In his remarks after his election, Aoun drew applause for saying the state would be the only force to carry weapons, a reference to an agreement that the Lebanese military would reassert control of southern Lebanon, which had been controlled by Hezbollah. He also vowed that Israel would withdraw its remaining troops from Lebanon, as it is slated to do, and said, 'My pledge is to rebuild what Israel destroyed.'

Bill sanctioning ICC over Netanyahu arrest warrant passes in US H...	The US Senate, now controlled by the GOP, will take up the Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act, after it passed 243-140 in the House of Representatives. By World Israel News Staff The United States House of Representatives voted Thursday in favor of a measure protesting the International Criminal Court over the arrest warrants it issued by ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan last November against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and ex-Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant (Likud). The lower chamber of Congress voted 243 to 140, with 198 Republicans joined by 45 Democrats backing the Republican-sponsored bill, to pass the measure, which will now go to the Senate. The bill was reintroduced this week, after the House passed a similar piece of legislation last summer. However, the Senate, then featuring a Democratic majority and led by New York Democrat Chuck Schumer, did not bring the measure up for a vote before the end of the session. Dubbed the 'Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act,' the bill would impose sanctions on any non-citizen who investigates, arrests, detains, or prosecutes an American citizen or citizens of an allied country - such as Israel - which is not a party to the Rome Statute and are therefore not under the ICC's jurisdiction. The sanctions ICC officials face include being refused visas to the United States, the loss of existing visas, and barring of property transactions in the U.S. Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune has vowed to pass the bill later this month, sending it to President-elect Donald Trump's desk for signing shortly after his inauguration on January 20th. However, Senate Republicans, who now hold 53-seats in the 100-member chamber, will need the acquiescence of at least 7 Democrats to ward off a potential filibuster and ensure the law's passage. The Coalition for Jewish Values, an alliance of over 2,500 Orthodox Jewish rabbis in the United States, lauded the House's vote Thursday. 'The ICC’s abhorrent equivalence between the genocidal terrorists of Hamas, and Jewish leaders working to end the explicit threat of another Holocaust, can only be seen as antisemitic bigotry,' said CJV President Rabbi Yoel Schonfeld. 'It negates trust in international legal institutions and undermines efforts to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East. To sanction the members of the ICC for their conduct is a moral imperative, and we commend all those working to pass this important legislation.'

Biden blasts Hamas for blocking hostage deal	President Biden optimistic hostage deal can be reached amid 'real progress,' while blaming Hamas for lack of a breakthrough, saying the terror group is 'getting in the way' of an agreement. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Joe Biden expressed optimism a breakthrough could be in the offing in hostage deal talks in Doha, Qatar, even as he slammed the Hamas terror organization for stymying efforts to reach an agreement to secure a Gaza ceasefire and the release of the nearly 100 hostages held in the Gaza Strip. Speaking out during a press conference Thursday focused primarily on the federal government's response to the ongoing firestorm in Los Angeles County, Biden said that there had been some 'real progress' lately in hostage deal talks. 'We’re making some real progress,' Biden told reporters, saying he had spoken earlier that day with American mediators involved in the talks. 'I met with negotiators today,' Biden added. 'I think we’re seeing some progress.' 'I know hope springs eternal, but I’m still hopeful that we’ll be able to have a prisoner exchange.' Biden blamed Hamas for the failure thus far to reach an agreement, but nevertheless hinted that the terror group might be willing to compromise. 'Hamas is the one getting in the way of that exchange, right now, but I think we may be able to get that done. We need to get it done.' A day earlier, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the two sides were 'very close' to a ceasefire, while adding that a final agreement may not be reached until President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20th. 'In the Middle East, we're very close to a ceasefire and hostage agreement,' Blinken said Wednesday. 'I hope that we can get it over the line in the time that we have left. But if we don't, then the plan that President Biden put forward for a ceasefire/hostage deal will be handed over to the incoming administration. And I believe that when we get that deal - and we'll get it - it will be on the basis of the plan that President Biden put before the world back in May.'

Pasadena synagogue burns down as fires rage across Southern Calif...	I feel numb to this. It’s like a bad, bad horrific dream. To see that it’s not going to be here tomorrow,' said a former congregant. By Philissa Cramer, JTA A synagogue with more than 100 years of history in Pasadena, California, burned down overnight as fires swept across parts of Southern California. The fate of a Chabad center about 40 miles away near the coast was unclear as a major fire flared in the Pacific Palisades, one of three different blazes destroying structures and threatening lives in multiple pockets of the greater Los Angeles area. Additional Jewish institutions lay in evacuation zones, while others took preparations in case of further spread. The Pasadena Jewish Center and Temple burned for hours as fire spilled out of the Eaton Canyon, fueled by strong winds. The 434-family congregation had operated from the Mission-style building, which had a wooden Torah ark carved by the Jewish artist Peter Krasnow, and three outbuildings since the 1940s. 'It’s a massive center, it’s just crumbling with the intensity of the heat,' a KTLA reporter said while broadcasting from the scene. She added, as flames shot through the synagogue’s roof, 'It looks like the concrete and the metal is just melting. … It’s just a total loss.' Added a neighborhood man whom the newscaster said used to go to the synagogue, 'I feel numb to this. It’s like a bad bad horrific dream. To see that it’s not going to be here tomorrow … ' His voice broke. The newscaster, Tracy Leong, showed fire trucks driving past the synagogue but said she had not seen any attempt to quell its burning while she was on the scene. 'It’s really hard to get a handle on this fire,' she said. 'There are so many structures burning and they’re doing what they can, and there’s just not enough of them right now.' The congregation’s executive director told The New York Times overnight that everyone employed by the synagogue was safe. 'We are devastated, but our staff are safe and we managed to get our Torahs out safely as well, while ash was coming down in our parking lot,' said Melissa Levy, who said she had been evacuated from her own home. Southern California has long been vulnerable to devastating fires, but climate change has altered weather patterns that in the past largely limited fire season to only parts of the year. Earlier in the night, the Pasadena fire was not the major one on the radar for residents of the region. A larger fire in the Pacific Palisades, located on the Pacific coast north of Santa Monica, was under an evacuation order as strong winds spread a fire there. A third fire later erupted several miles north. Zibby Owens, the publisher and bookseller who recently put out an anthology titled 'On Being Jewish Now,' posted footage on Instagram showing that her family’s home in the area had been lapped by flames before losing its camera feed. Kehillat Israel, a Reconstructionist synagogue in Pacific Palisades, was also under an evacuation order and closed starting on Tuesday. And the Chabad of Pacific Palisades evacuated 100 children from its preschool on Tuesday as fire neared the property, Rabbi Zushe Cunin told local TV news. He and other rabbis posed with the community’s Torahs as they removed them from the fire’s path on Tuesday evening. 'The night is still a very long one, and the winds are still raging,' the center said on Instagram. 'We need all of your prayers to overcome this dangerous fire.' The center is located squarely inside the evacuation zone for the Palisades Fire. None of the three fires was contained on Wednesday morning, with continued strong winds expected to fuel them throughout the day. On the other side of Topanga State Park from Pacific Palisades in Calabasas, the Reform synagogue Congregation Or Ami was taking precautions in case conditions changed. 'We have removed Torah scrolls and other sacred/business-critical items from Congregation Or Ami. It’s without power now. We have people whose homes are endangered, people who have friends/relatives who lost homes. In a holding pattern for the moment,' Rabbi Paul Kipnes wrote on Facebook, noting that the Palisades fire was just 17 miles away with winds gusting up to 100 miles per hour at times. 'Distances here feel large yet small.'

Top Israeli broadcaster says Trump should agree to Israel annexin...	Annexing parts of Gaza would be an effective means of achieving the military goal of destroying Hamas, Segal explained. By World Israel News Staff Chief political correspondent Amit Segal in a Wall Street Journal op-ed urged Trump to agree to Israel annexing parts of Gaza. He also insisted that Israel take the distribution of humanitarian aid out of the hands of Hamas as a means of enfeebling the terror group. Annexing parts of Gaza would be an effective means of achieving the military goal of destroying Hamas, Segal explained. He noted that in the Palestinian dialect of Arabic, 'soumod,' or 'standing strong,' is related to the concept of having a claim to land. If Israel were to claim parts of Gaza, Hamas would feel the pangs of utter defeat. Segal argued that the worst case scenario for Hamas would be to have less land at the end of the war than it had at the beginning. In addition, Segal said the IDF gaining control of distributing humanitarian aid in Gaza would prevent Hamas from stealing it and using aid to power its own operations. Losing control of the humanitarian aid, argued Segal, would cause Hamas to collapse 'within weeks.' Israeli forces will remain in the Gaza Strip after the current war with the Hamas terror organization ends, Israel’s defense chief announced emphasizing that the IDF will be responsible for the long-term security control of the coastal enclave. Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) took to X/Twitter a few years later the friends get into some trouble what of minor thing a police case one of to respond to Hebrew media reports earlier in the day claiming he had vowed to U.S. officials that Israel had no interest in controlling post-war Gaza and downplayed calls within the Israeli government to resettle the Gaza Strip. 'Israel does not want either military control or civilian governance over the residents. There are no decisions regarding settlement in Gaza,' Israel’s Channel 12 quoted Katz as telling American officials, adding that the Netanyahu government was working to strengthen the Palestinian Authority against Iranian influence and Hamas encroachment.

Former Israeli military officials float audacious plan to strike ...	For the next week or so, there is basically no administration in Washington to say no to us. So we must use this time to our advantage,' said Benny Sabati, an Iranian-born Iran researcher at INSS. By Andrew Tobin, The Washington Free Beacon Two prominent Israeli national security analysts have proposed that the Jewish state go it alone with major attack on Iran in the final days of Joe Biden's presidency. Kobi Michael and Gabi Siboni, both former senior Israeli military officials, argued in a policy paper published last month that only a series of airstrikes on Iran's nuclear, military, economic, and government infrastructure can prevent the regime from rebuilding its regional terrorist network, which Israel has degraded over 15 months of war. Israel should start the attack just ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, according to the analysts—thereby minimizing the risk of diplomatic retaliation by Biden and forcing the hand of the president-elect. 'With this attack, Israel will demonstrate to the United States … its absolute refusal to accept the continuation of the Iranian nuclear program and its unwillingness to risk Iran’s breakout to a bomb,' Michael and Siboni wrote for the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy, a think tank in Jerusalem where they are researchers. 'As several rounds of attacks on Iran will be required, [the subsequent rounds] will take place after Trump takes office and under a U.S. administration that is more sympathetic than Biden's.' Few Israeli politicians would contemplate such a move in public, and even in the think tank world, Michael and Siboni's proposal stands out as audacious. But their paper, which has been discussed in Hebrew media, comes as Israeli leaders signal new willingness to go it alone against Iran if necessary. When prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushed for a strike on Iran's nuclear program more than a decade ago, he was repeatedly blocked by his powerful security chiefs and criticized by his political rivals. Today, Israel's security establishment has reportedly advocated such a strike, as have leading politicians across the Zionist political spectrum. In recent months, the Israeli military has smashed Iran's missile and aerial defense capabilities and its terrorist affiliates Hamas and Hezbollah, leaving Iran exposed. Netanyahu has said that Israel's war with Iran and its terrorists affiliates must end in a decisive confrontation with Tehran. But he and his associates have projected confidence that Trump's America will stand with Israel in the fight. 'Iran has one option left, arming itself with a nuclear weapon, and it is striving to achieve this,' Netanyahu said in remarks to the Knesset following Trump's election in November. 'We will be tested by our ability to thwart the nuclear program. We held Iran back by a decade, but it advanced. The test rests upon us, on the government of Israel and on our friend the United States.' Amir Avivi, a former senior Israeli military official who has advised Netanyahu during the war and met with members of Trump's team at the Mar-a-Lago, Florida, headquarters last month, put the odds of a 'massive' joint U.S.-Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear program at 80 percent. 'I don't see any scenario where Trump ties our hands,' Avivi told the Washington Free Beacon. 'So the question is: Will Trump lead the attack or will we do it alone, and maybe he will provide us with additional capabilities?' But Michael and Siboni assessed that Trump will not want to start his presidency with escalation in the Middle East and will instead 'try to make a deal' with Iran. 'And the Iranians will do what they do best and manipulate the Western negotiators and then subvert any deal they agree to,' Siboni, who is also a researcher at the Jerusalem Institute for National Security Studies, told the Free Beacon. 'Israel cannot allow this to happen. We have to strike Iran now.' Michael and Siboni anticipated that Iran would retaliate against Israel, potentially causing significant damage, at which point Trump would step in to provide U.S. military and diplomatic support. In the best case scenario, Trump would also help Israel to finish off Iran. Michael, who is also a researcher at Tel Aviv's Institute for National Security Studies, said that Trump might even appreciate an Israeli strike on Iran before he takes office since it would position him to deliver on his campaign promises to bring peace through strength. 'The idea is to hit the Iranians in a very severe manner that will paralyze them and create the conditions for a new nuclear deal on Trump's terms, which will be very close to the terms sought by Israel,' Michael told the Free Beacon. 'Iran will have to roll back its nuclear program and end its support for terrorism and all the other things it does as the bully of the neighborhood.' Benny Sabati, a Iranian-born Iran researcher at INSS, agreed that Israel should attack Iran before Jan. 20. He said it reminded him of something the Iranians themselves would do. 'When they see a power vacuum, they fill it,' Sabati told the Free Beacon, citing Iran's support for a network of anti-Israel terror groups in failed Middle Eastern states, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. 'For the next week or so, there is basically no administration in Washington to say no to us. So we must use this time to our advantage.' Sima Shine, a former senior official in the Mossad, Israel's foreign intelligence service, and the head of Iran research at INSS, shared her colleagues' assessment that Israel is unlikely to get another shot at Iran under Trump. But she said it was already too late for Israel to attack, noting that Britain, France, and Germany started nuclear talks with Iran in November. 'Anyway, you don't surprise the new president before he takes office,' Shine told the Free Beacon. 'It's just not done.' Asked about the possibility that Trump would not take kindly to being nudged into a military conflict with Iran, Siboni said he preferred an angry Trump to a nuclear Iran. 'At the end of the day, we have to do what we have to do,' he said. Trump has repeatedly declined to say whether he plans to attack Iran. 'It's not really [a legitimate question] because only a stupid person would answer it,' he told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday. 'Look, it's a military strategy, and I'm not answering your questions on military strategy.' The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Trump and members of his transition team were in 'the early stages' of deliberations over 'options for stopping Iran from being able to build a nuclear weapon, including the possibility of preventive airstrikes.' Trump wanted to stop Iran but also to avoid 'igniting a new war, particularly one that could pull in the U.S. military,' according to the report. The Israeli prime minister's office declined to comment.

IDF halts Palestinian workers’ entry into Judea and Samaria commu...	A survey taken last year in Eli, a town of some 4,500 inhabitants in the Binyamin region of southern Samaria, showed that 82% of residents were opposed to readmitting Palestinian workers, regardless of added security measures. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS The Israeli military has suspended the entry of Palestinian workers into Jewish communities throughout Judea and Samaria following Monday morning’s deadly shooting near Kedumim, the Israel Defense Forces Spokesperson’s Unit told JNS on Thursday. The suspension, which the army said came following a 'situational assessment,' will remain in place for an unspecified period. In a message to residents on Wednesday, the Samaria city of Ariel said that a military directive issued after the shooting in al-Funduq that left three Israelis dead, the military had prohibited 'the entry of Palestinian workers into all communities in Samaria, with the exception of industrial areas.' On Thursday, Mayor Yair Chetboun updated residents that following discussions with the commander of the IDF’s Ephraim Regional Brigade, it had been agreed that P.A. workers would be allowed to enter Ariel’s southern neighborhood only, 'starting today.' 'The entry will be allowed while adhering to security procedures,' said Chetboun, whose central Samaria city counts some 21,500 residents. The terrorists who carried out Monday’s shooting, killing Rachel Cohen, 73, Aliza Rice, 70, and Israel Police Master Sgt. Elad Yaakov Winkelstein, 35, remain at large. Seven more people were wounded in the attack. In the wake of the murders, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced on Monday that the premier had approved 'a series of additional offensive and defensive actions in Judea and Samaria.' The shooting took place some six miles northwest of Ariel, the region’s capital, near the northern Samaria Jewish community of Kedumim. While the military banned Palestinians from working in Jewish towns throughout Judea and Samaria in the initial months following Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre, Maj. Gen. Yehuda Fox, the then head of IDF Central Command, in late 2023 lifted most of the access restrictions. Before the war, some 200,000 Palestinian workers were employed throughout the Jewish state, including 30,000 in Judea and Samaria. Proposals to readmit P.A. workers to Jewish communities were met with dismay by many. A survey taken last year in Eli, a town of some 4,500 inhabitants in the Binyamin region of southern Samaria, showed that 82% of residents were opposed, regardless of added security measures. However, Israeli courts confirmed in a series of cases that elected local officials do not have the legal right to block Palestinian laborers from entering their communities if the military allows their employment. Two polls last year found that some two-thirds of Palestinians in Judea and Samaria support the Oct. 7 attacks, in which around 6,000 Hamas-led terrorists broke through the Gaza border, murdered some 1,200 people, wounded thousands more and took more than 250 captive.

Lebanon’s parliament elects army commander Joseph Aoun as preside...	In a speech to parliament, Aoun pledged to carry out reforms to the judicial system, fight corruption and work to consolidate the state’s right to 'monopolise the carrying of weapons,' in an apparent allusion to the arms of Hezbollah. By The Associated Press Lebanon’s parliament voted Thursday to elect army commander Joseph Aoun as head of state, filling a more than two-year-long presidential vacuum. The vote came weeks after a tenuous ceasefire agreement halted a 14-month conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and at a time when Lebanon’s leaders are seeking international assistance for reconstruction. Aoun, no relation to former president Michel Aoun, was widely seen as the preferred candidate of the United States and Saudi Arabia, whose assistance Lebanon will need as it seeks to rebuild. The session was the legislature’s 13th attempt to elect a successor to Michel Aoun, whose term ended in October 2022. Hezbollah previously backed another candidate, Suleiman Frangieh, the leader of a small Christian party in northern Lebanon with close ties to former Syrian President Bashar Assad. However, on Wednesday, Frangieh announced he had withdrawn from the race and endorsed Aoun, clearing the way for the army chief. Randa Slim, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Middle East Institute, said that the military and political weakening of Hezbollah following its war with Israel and the fall of its ally, Assad, in Syria, along with international pressure to elect a president paved the way for Thursday’s result. In a first round of voting Thursday, Aoun received 71 out of 128 votes but fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to win outright. Of the rest, 37 lawmakers cast blank ballots and 14 voted for 'sovereignty and the constitution.' In the second round, he received 99 votes. The head of Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc, Mohammed Raad, implied that the group's legislators had withheld their votes from Aoun in the first round but voted for him in the second in bid to show that Hezbollah - even in its diminished state - cannot be politically sidelined. 'We postponed our vote because we wanted to send a message that just as we are protectors of Lebanon’s sovereignty, we are protectors of the national accord,' Raad said after the election. Aoun was escorted by a marching band into the parliament building in downtown Beirut where he took the oath of office. Some streets erupted in celebratory fireworks and gunshots. In Aoun’s hometown of Aichiye in Jezzine province, southern Lebanon, people waved the Lebanese flag and distributed traditional sweets, while local media showed the slaughter of a sheep in celebration. In a speech to parliament, Aoun pledged to carry out reforms to the judicial system, fight corruption and work to consolidate the state’s right to 'monopolise the carrying of weapons,' in an apparent allusion to the arms of Hezbollah. He also promised to control the country’s borders and 'ensure the activation of the security services and to discuss a strategic defense policy that will enable the Lebanese state to remove the Israeli occupation from all Lebanese territories' in southern Lebanon, where the Israeli military has not yet withdrawn from dozens of villages. He also vowed to reconstruct 'what the Israeli army destroyed in the south, east and (Beirut’s southern) suburbs.' Lebanon’s fractious sectarian power-sharing system is prone to deadlock, both for political and procedural reasons. The small, crisis-battered Mediterranean country has been through several extended presidential vacancies, with the longest lasting nearly 2 1/2 years between May 2014 and October 2016. It ended when former President Michel Aoun was elected. The president's role in Lebanon is limited under the power-sharing system in which the president is always a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of parliament Shiite. However, only the president has the power to appoint or remove a prime minister and cabinet. The caretaker government that has run Lebanon for the last two years has reduced powers because it was not appointed by a sitting president. Joseph Aoun is the fifth former army commander to ascend to Lebanon’s presidency, despite the fact that the country's constitution prohibits high-ranking public servants, including army commanders, from assuming the presidency during their term or within two years of stepping down. Under normal circumstances, a presidential candidate in Lebanon can be elected by a two-thirds majority of the 128-member house in the first round of voting, or by a simple majority in a subsequent round. But because of the constitutional issues surrounding his election, Aoun needed a two-thirds majority in the second round to clinch the election. Aoun, 60, was appointed army chief in March 2017 and had been set to retire in January 2024, but his term was extended twice during the Israel-Hezbollah conflict. He kept a low profile and avoided media appearances and never formally announced his candidacy. Other contenders included Jihad Azour, a former finance minister who is now the director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department at the International Monetary Fund; and Elias al-Baysari, the acting head of Lebanon’s General Security agency. Al-Baisary announced Thursday that he was pulling out of the race. The next government will face daunting challenges apart from implementing the ceasefire agreement that ended the Israel-Hezbollah war and seeking funds for reconstruction. Lebanon is in its sixth year of an economic and financial crisis that decimated the country's currency and wiped out the savings of many Lebanese. The cash-strapped state electricity company provides only a few hours of power a day. The country's leaders reached a preliminary agreement with the IMF for a bail-out package in 2022 but have made limited progress on reforms required to clinch the deal. Slim, the analyst, said that 'the fact that (Aoun) has the backing of Saudi Arabia, the U.S. and the Europeans give him a big boost in terms of being able to get things done,' Slim said. But he will still have to 'navigate the contradiction that are inherent in domestic Lebanese politics,' she said, including relations with Hezbollah, which is not only a militant group but a political party with a strong base of support. Aoun 'has never had a conflictual relationship with Hezbollah, but he has also never acquiesced to Hezbollah,' Slim said. The army commander’s relative lack of experience with economic matters means he will likely lean heavily on his advisors.

US ‘very close’ to securing hostage deal, Gaza ceasefire, says Bl...	US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and a Hamas spokesman both say a hostage deal is 'not far' off, even as both signal agreement may not be reached before Trump's inauguration this month. By World Israel News Staff Israel and Hamas are close to reaching a breakthrough in hostage deal and ceasefire talks in Doha, Qatar U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and a Hamas spokesperson both claimed Wednesday, even as they acknowledged a deal may not be struck before President Joe Biden leaves office on January 20th. Speaking at a press conference in Paris on Wednesday alongside his French counterpart, Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, Blinken said that brokers were 'very close' to achieving an agreement between the two sides. While a deal may not be reached by January 20th, Blinken admitted, the incoming Trump administration will be left well-positioned to complete the talks, he argued, crediting President Joe Biden's proposal for a three-phase deal. 'I hope that we can get it over the line in the time that we have left, but if we don’t, then the plan that President Biden put forward for a ceasefire-hostage deal will be handed over to the incoming administration, and I believe that when we get that deal — and we’ll get it — it’ll be based on the plan that President Biden put before the world back in May.' Blinken expressed hope that the administration's work to prepare post-war arrangements for the governance of the Gaza Strip will be adopted by the Trump White House. 'There too, we’re ready to hand that over to the administration so it can work on it and run with it when the opportunity is there.' The Biden administration has pushed for the transfer of Israeli control over the post-war Gaza Strip to a reformed Palestinian Authority, preventing Hamas from reasserting itself in the coastal enclave while removing the need for long-term Israeli civil control of Gaza - a key condition for bringing Saudi Arabia into the Abraham Accords. Also on Wednesday, Hamas spokesman Taher al-Nunu spoke with Saudi Arabia's Al-Resalah television network, claiming that the terror group is 'not far from an agreement' - assuming Israel 'responds positively' to Hamas' demands. On Tuesday, Hamas politburo member Osama Hamdan told reporters at a press conference in Algeria that the terror group would not agree to any deal with Israel that does not include a full withdrawal of the IDF From the Gaza Strip, and a full and permanent end to the war.

More than 18,000 terror attacks were carried out in Israel during 2024, killing 134 people and injuring 1,277 more, Israeli government reported. By World Israel News Staff More than 18,000 terror attacks targeting Israelis were reported in 2024, according to an Israeli government report released on Thursday. The National Public Diplomacy Directorate, a part of the Prime Minister's Office published the statistics in its 'Summary Report on Terrorism Against Israel for 2024,' revealing that a total of 18,365 terrorist attacks were reported during last year, leaving 134 dead and 1,277 more injured. The report drew upon data collected by the IDF, Israel Police, the Israeli Security Agency (ISA), and the emergency and rescue authorities. During 2024, Israel was attacked on seven separate fronts, including Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, Iraq, Yemen and from within Israel itself. According to the report, in 2024, about 16,400 rockets were fired and crossed into Israel, of which some 15,400 were launched from Lebanon and some 700 from Gaza. October 2024 had the greatest number of rockets fired at Israel, with more than 6,900 launches. A total of 399 hostile UAVs crossed into Israeli territory during 2024. Rocket fire and UAVs caused significant damage last year, with 71 people killed, 14 of whom were minors, and 892 people injured. In addition, the attacks sparked close to 610 fires, which burned 92,417 acres of land belonging to the Nature and Parks Authority, and more than 42,749 acres of grazing land. An additional 1,900 other terrorist incidents were carried out in 2024, including stone throwing, Molotov cocktails, vehicle rammings, shootings, stabbings, assaults, explosive devices and throwing objects. July had the highest number of incidents—191 attacks. November was the quietest month with 109 attacks. October was the most violent month, in which 37 people were murdered and 394 injured. The most common type of terrorist attack was stone throwing, with 1,248 incidents. April had the most stone throwings, with 130 incidents and November was the quietest with 76 incidents. The next most common attacks were throwing objects, arson and tire burning (162), throwing Molotov cocktails (140), shootings (132) and explosive devices (89).

Trump will enable Israel to open ‘the gates of hell’ against Hama...	Senior Israeli minister pushes for Israel to govern Gaza 'for a very long time,' says Israeli control can't be limited to security. By World Israel News Staff Israel will unleash the 'gates of hell' against the Hamas terror organization after President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20th, a senior Israeli government minister said Wednesday. Speaking during a question and answer session on Facebook Live, Finance Minister and Religious Zionist Party chairman Bezalel Smotrich said Israel would dramatically ratchet up pressure on Hamas and significantly reduce the flow of aid into the Gaza Strip, if an when Trump gives Jerusalem backing to do so. Smotrich predicted that Trump, who has repeatedly warned Hamas that the terror group will have 'hell to pay' if it fails to release the remaining hostages by inauguration day this month, will give his blessing to Israeli measures cutting the entry of aid into the Gaza Strip down to a bare minimum. Once Trump takes office, Israel is prepared to 'open the gates of hell on Hamas,' Smotrich said. The minister added that Israel is preparing to take long-term control over the Gaza Strip. 'We’re readying for a new approach to conquering the Gaza Strip, of holding onto it, of dividing it into regional brigades,' Smotrich continued, saying Israel should remain in Gaza 'for a very long time.' 'The military pressure will be stronger, not entering and exiting but capturing territory.' Smotrich, a long-time backer of the settlement movement, has advocated since October 7th for the resettlement of the Gaza Strip, and steps to encourage the voluntary emigration of the coastal enclave's Arab population. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit), who also advocates the resettlement of the Gaza Strip and policies designed to encourage mass Arab emigration from the area, claimed last year that despite his statements against such plans earlier in the war, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is quietly warming to the proposals.

Poland’s president offers to shield Netanyahu from ICC arrest war...	Ahead of event marking the 80th anniversary of liberation of Auschwitz, Polish President Andrzej Duda calls on the government to ensure Israeli Prime Minister will be able to attend the ceremony without fear of arrest over ICC warrant. By World Israel News Staff Poland's president called on his country's government to take steps to enable Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be able to visit the country during the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. On January 27th, the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum will hold a ceremony marking 80 years since the concentration camp was liberated by Allied forces. In December, Polish media outlets reported that Netanyahu had declined to attend the event, fearing his arrest over the International Criminal Court's warrant, issued last year in connection with the Gaza war. On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that Polish President Andrzej Duda has penned a letter to Prime Minister Donald Tusk, urging him to take steps to ensure that Netanyahu will not face ICC prosecution if he visits Poland for the event. Duda said the Polish government should guarantee that the Israeli premier can visit Poland and take part in the ceremony 'unhindered,' calling on Tusk's government to find an 'adequate formula' to this end. Hours after the Bloomberg report was published Thursday, an aide to Prime Minister Netanyahu told The Times of Israel that the Israeli premier currently has no plans to attend the Auschwitz memorial event, but added that the prime minister's office would consider his attendance should Israel receive an invitation. We’ll look into [coming] if we receive an invitation. For now it’s not in the program,' the aide said. The source added, however, that Poland would also have to 'solve' the issue of the ICC arrest warrant before Netanyahu could commit to attending. 'First of all, they’ll have to solve the ICC issue.'

Arab-Israeli arrested over bombing plot	37-year-old Arab-Israeli man from northern Israel prepared bomb belt and pipe bombs for bombing attacks against Israelis. By World Israel News Staff An Arab man with Israeli citizenship was arrested recently, after he plotted to carry out bombing attacks against Israeli targets. In a joint operation by the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) and the Northern District Central Unit of the Israel Police, Mahmoud Hassan Mohammed Boushkar, a 37-year-old resident of Kabul (a town in northern Israel), was arrested by the Border Police undercover unit. Boushkar, whose father is originally from Judea and Samaria, is accused of planning and preparing for terror attacks in Israel. According to the investigation by Shin Bet and the police, Boushkar consumed materials related to the production of explosives and purchased equipment and substances to conduct experiments. These included the production of TATP explosives and the creation of a pipe bomb. He allegedly planned to construct an explosive belt for potential attacks within Israel. Further findings revealed that Boushkar attempted to recruit two individuals to assist him in advancing his activities, though these efforts were unsuccessful. The investigation highlighted that Boushkar was inspired by the 'Guardian of the Walls' conflict in May 2021 and the ongoing war, which motivated him to pursue terrorist activities. During the investigation, authorities seized a firearm, ammunition, and various materials and tools used for bomb-making. On January 9, 2025, the Haifa District Attorney's Office filed an indictment against Boushkar in the Haifa District Court. The Shin Bet and Israel Police emphasized their commitment to preventing any involvement of Israeli citizens in activities that threaten national security. They vowed to use all available means to neutralize such threats and ensure that those involved face the full weight of the law.

Terrorist attempted Jerusalem attack in order to die ‘as a martyr...	The eastern Jerusalem resident told his interrogators that he had wanted to die as a 'martyr.' By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The Jerusalem District Attorney's Office filed Thursday its official declaration of intent to indict a terrorist who attempted to stab a soldier in the capital last month. According to the details of the investigation, the man, a resident of eastern Jerusalem in his early thirties, had expressed his desire to die as a 'martyr.' He bought a knife in a home improvement store three days before his attack. In the early afternoon of December 23, he drove to the neighborhood of Pisgat Ze’ev, and when he saw a soldier walking down the street, he exited his vehicle. He approached his intended victim, waving the knife in the air and shouting, 'Allahu Akbar [God is great], I will kill you and stab you in the head.' Keeping his cool, the soldier first tried shouting and warning the terrorist off, but when he continued advancing, both he and a civilian bystander who was witnessing the incident shot and seriously wounded the attacker. According to a Channel 10 report, even while lying on the ground the terrorist kept trying to reach for his weapon. Large numbers of police forces descended on the scene, as did medical personnel, who treated the wounded suspect and took him to the hospital for treatment. Jerusalem Police Chief Ronen Ovadia praised both men for taking quick action, saying, 'The vigilance and alertness of the security officer, along with the vigilance of citizens, prevented harm to life and the source of danger was quickly neutralized.' The prosecutor's statement is a tool in Israeli law that allows a suspect to be kept in custody for a period of up to five more days after the end of the police investigation so that a lawyer can prepare the list of charges. Police are not allowed to re-interrogate detainees during this time unless they request and receive from a judge an extension of their detention. The prosecutor must declare that, based on a personal examination of the evidence, there is prima facie reason to file an indictment in the case, and request that the suspect now be arrested and considered a defendant in an upcoming case. Usually in nationalist-motivated crimes, defendants are held in custody until the end of the legal proceedings against them.

NY Times rejects ad accusing Israel of ‘genocide’; blasted for ‘s...	The Quakers organization blasted the paper for its 'outrageous attempt to sidestep the truth.' By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The New York Times has enraged a potential advertiser by rejecting its ad calling Israel’s war against Hamas a 'genocide.' The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), known colloquially as the Quakers, said Monday that it had submitted a digital ad asking people to tell Congress to 'stop arming Israel’s genocide in Gaza now.' They said that a representative of the paper's advertising department responded by suggesting they use the word 'war' instead. When they vetoed the suggestion since it had 'an entirely different meaning both colloquially and under international law,' they received an email stating that their ad could not be accepted as is. AFSC General Secretary Joyce Ajlouny called the paper’s refusal 'an outrageous attempt to sidestep the truth.' She defended the peace organization’s wording by pointing out that groups such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have made the same charge against the Jewish state, as have 'UN bodies,' and noting that the International Court of Justice is allowing a case to go forward against Israel on the subject. These international organizations are well known for their anti-Israel bias, which the Quakers share. Ajlouny also described NYT’s refusal as being hypocritical, as she noted that the paper 'regularly looks to several of these organizations as sources for its own reporting.' She also accused the media in general of 'choos[ing] silence over accountability' in 'silencing' and 'marginalizing' Palestinians and their allies 'for decades.' According to AFSC, the paper’s email had said in part, 'Various international bodies, human rights organizations, and governments have differing views on the situation. In line with our commitment to factual accuracy and adherence to legal standards, we must ensure that all advertising content complies with these widely applied definitions.' Israel and many of its allies have repeatedly pointed out that the IDF always warns Gazan civilians to move out of harm’s way before its forces enter areas to clear them of Hamas fighters as well as look for the 98 hostages left in captivity since the October 7th, 2023 terrorist invasion and massacre of 1,200 sparked the ongoing war. Instead of indiscriminately killing everyone in a war zone, the IDF first sets up guarded, humanitarian corridors to facilitate civilians’ escape, thereby losing the element of surprise against its foes. Israel has also allowed into Gaza hundreds of thousands of tons of food, fuel, shelter equipment and medical supplies over the last 15 months. AFSC said that since they couldn’t use the wording they desired, they pulled the ad.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also expected to attend the inauguration, though Wednesday’s announcement did not mention any plans for the relatives of the hostages to meet with him. By Ben Sales, JTA Relatives of the seven American hostages held in Gaza will attend Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, representatives of the families announced. The announcement Wednesday comes as Trump and outgoing President Joe Biden are both working to close a ceasefire deal in Gaza that would free some of the nearly 100 hostages, dead and alive, who have been held there since Hamas abducted them in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Deputies for both Trump and Biden are saying that a deal is close, though the sides have appeared optimistic in the past only for talks to falter. At a press conference on Tuesday, Trump threatened that 'if they’re not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East and it will not be good for Hamas, and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone.' Representatives for the families of the American hostages also said that the relatives will meet with Trump administration officials when they are in Washington, D.C. for three days surrounding the inauguration. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also expected to attend the inauguration, though Wednesday’s announcement did not mention any plans for the relatives of the hostages to meet with him. Israeli officials have confirmed that four of the seven U.S. citizens held in Gaza have been killed and that Hamas is holding their bodies in Gaza. They are Omer Neutra, Itay Chen, and husband and wife Gad Haggai and Judith Weinstein. Americans Keith Siegel, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Edan Alexander are also being held captive. The relatives in attendance will be either parents, children, siblings or the spouse of a hostage. Two sets of parents who spoke at last summer’s political conventions — those of Neutra and of hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was murdered in captivity — will be among the attendees.

Israeli army issues new social media guidelines as soldiers face ...	In recent weeks, soldiers traveling in Britain, Cyprus, Brazil and Thailand were forced to return to Israel early after being notified they were at risk of being arrested. By Pesach Benson, TPS Due to the threat of arrest warrants for low-ranking soldiers traveling abroad, the Israel Defense Forces issued new social media guidelines. Personnel ranked colonel and below were advised not to expose their names or faces on social media. Troops should only post photos taken from behind or with faces blurred. And soldiers with foreign citizenship were ordered not to reveal their names or faces, even outside a combat zone. Israeli media was also instructed not to link specific soldiers to particular operational incidents they were involved in. In recent weeks, soldiers traveling in Britain, Cyprus, Brazil and Thailand were forced to return to Israel early after being notified they were at risk of being arrested. The Hind Rajab Foundation, a non-governmental organization based in Belgium has been filing requests for arrest warrants for Israeli soldiers traveling abroad. The Press Service of Israel recently reported that the NGO, founded in September 2024, is linked to Hezbollah. Its chairman, Dyab Abou Jahjah, is a known supporter of Hezbollah, according to the NGO Monitor, a Jerusalem-based organization that monitors the activities and funding of NGOs. Jahjah boasted of his membership in the terror group when he told The New York Times in 2003, 'I had some military training, I’m still very proud of this.' The foundation has filed similar legal complaints against Israeli soldiers traveling in other countries, including the Netherlands and Ecuador. It also petitioned the International Criminal Court to issue Interpol arrest warrants against 1,000 Israeli soldiers in eight different countries, including France, Ireland, and South Africa, according to the foundation’s website. Alon Elgali, a civilian contractor who works for the army in Gaza told The Press Service of Israel on Sunday that Hind Rajab recently forced him to leave London early. 'They knew I was at a wedding in London and its whereabouts. They followed my every step,' he told TPS-IL. 'If you ask me if I’m scared to fly, yes I am very scared.' Asked for a comment, London’s Metropolitan Police told TPS-IL, 'As with any crime reported to police, we would not comment on the identity of those making a report or referral to police, so I’m afraid we are not able to comment as to whether or not the particular NGO referenced below has made a referral or not.' The police added, 'More broadly, in relation to the ongoing Israel/Hamas conflict, we have received a large number of referrals since October 2023, but to-date, none have resulted in us opening a UK-based investigation. Referrals into us have related to parties on both sides of the conflict, although we are not providing any further breakdown of the nature of referrals.' Legal expert Maurisce Hirsch told TPS-IL that countries that do not recognize the International Criminal Court’s jurisdiction, such as the US, India and China, are relatively safe for soldiers to travel to. Hirsch –a senior legal analyst at Human Rights Voices, who served previously as Director of the Military Prosecution in Judea and Samaria — added that regarding complaints filed by anti-Israeli NGOs, the situation differs from country to country. 'Many countries have legislation that allows them to prosecute war criminals, even if they are not citizens of the country. It is the so-called ‘universal authority,’ Hirsch said. 'And every country has its own rules regarding this. In the UK, for example, they changed the legislation a few years ago, and now only the government can file a complaint like this, but not an NGO or a private person. In Belgium the situation is different.'

Trend reversal: Poll shows most Israelis oppose Palestinian state	The degree of confidence in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stayed steady, with 33% among the Jewish public and 8% among Arabs. By Canaan Lindor, JNS For the first time in nearly 18 years, a majority of Israeli Jews now oppose the establishment of any Palestinian state, according to an opinion poll published on Monday. Of the 804 Jews polled in the 'Swords of Iron Survey Results—December 2024' survey by Tel Aviv University’s Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), 64% opposed the creation of a Palestinian state 'under any condition,' compared to 23% who said they supported it 'under certain conditions.' The remaining 13% said they didn’t know. Among the 205 Arabs polled, the distribution was 59%, 12% and 29% respectively. Within the total sample of 1,009 Jewish and Arab respondents, 52% opposed the creation of any Palestinian state compared to 30% who supported it. Respondents were polled on a host of issues, including their degree of trust in various institutions. Among Jews, 85% indicated 'great confidence' in the Israel Defense Forces, versus 34% among Arabs. Confidence in the government remained stable with 25% among the Jewish public and 9% among Arabs. Confidence in the government was at 27% in an INSS poll from December 2022. The degree of confidence in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also stayed steady, INSS wrote, with 33% among the Jewish public and 8% among Arabs. Asked whether the terms of the ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon allow a return of evacuees, 48.5% of Jews said no, compared to 38% who said yes. Still, 50% of Jews supported the ceasefire compared to 27% who opposed it. The remaining 23% said they were neutral or did not know. Regarding the war with Hamas, 51% of Jews said the war objectives will be achieved either in full (10%) or to a large degree. Among Jews, 38% were more pessimistic, predicting none or very few of the objectives would be met. Arab respondents were even more skeptical, with 22% predicting total or meaningful achievements for Israel and 52% expecting no or few achievements. A third of Jewish respondents supported Israeli annexation of the Gaza Strip, and out of that third more than half indicated that they favored the reestablishment of Israeli settlements there. Just over half of Jews favored transferring Gaza to the control of either a Palestinian 'moderate party' or a regional or international entity. A tenth of Jews said they didn’t know. Among Arabs, Israeli annexation had an 8% approval rating; 54% supported regional or Palestinian rule and 38% said they didn’t know. In the years 2006-2019, support among Jews for a Palestinian state under certain conditions fell from 71% to 55%, according to an INSS overview from 2020. In 2022 support among Jews was 50% and support in the overall population was 52%. The survey released on Monday had a reported 3.5% error margin.

With Hezbollah weakened, Lebanon to hold presidential vote	Candidates in focus include army commander General Joseph Aoun — said by Lebanese politicians to enjoy US approval — Jihad Azour, a senior International Monetary Fund official who formerly served as finance minister, and Major-General Elias al-Baysari — head of General Security, a state security agency. By The Algemeiner and Reuters Lebanon‘s parliament will try to elect a president on Thursday, with officials seeing better chances of success in a political landscape shaken by Israel’s war with Hezbollah and the toppling of the Lebanese terrorist group’s ally Bashar al-Assad in neighboring Syria. The post, reserved for a Maronite Christian in the country’s sectarian power-sharing system, has been vacant since Michel Aoun’s term ended in October, 2022. None of the political groups in the 128-seat parliament have enough seats to impose their choice, and they have so far been unable to agree on a consensus candidate. The vote marks the first test of Lebanon‘s power balance since the Iran-backed Shi’ite terrorist group Hezbollah — which propelled its then Christian ally Aoun to the presidency in 2016 ‚ emerged badly pummeled from the war with Israel. It takes place against a backdrop of historic change in the wider Middle East, where the Assad-led Syrian state exercised sway over Lebanon for decades, both directly and through allies such as Hezbollah. Reflecting the shifts, Hezbollah and its ally the Shi’ite Amal Movement led by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri have dropped their insistence on Suleiman Frangieh, their declared candidate for the last two years, and are ready to go with a less divisive figure, three senior sources familiar with their thinking said. Candidates in focus include army commander General Joseph Aoun — said by Lebanese politicians to enjoy US approval — Jihad Azour, a senior International Monetary Fund official who formerly served as finance minister, and Major-General Elias al-Baysari — head of General Security, a state security agency. Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said he felt happy because 'God willing, tomorrow we will have a new president,' according to a statement from his office. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot also expressed hope in comments to France Inter radio, saying the election was 'a prerequisite for the continuation of this dynamic of peace' and also for Lebanon‘s economic and social recovery. However, two of the sources and an analyst cautioned that it was not yet certain any candidate would be elected. To win, a candidate must secure 86 votes in a first round, or 65 in a second round. Reflecting Western and regional interest in the vote, French and Saudi envoys met Lebanese politicians in Beirut on Wednesday. Four Lebanese political sources who met the Saudi envoy, Prince Yazid bin Farhan, last week said he spelt out preferred qualifications which signal Saudi support for Aoun. Saudi Arabia was once a big player in Lebanon, vying with Tehran for influence in Beirut, before seeing its role eclipsed by Iran and Hezbollah. HEZBOLLAH STILL SEEN WITH SWAY Aoun, head of Lebanon‘s US-backed army, would still need 86 votes because his election requires a constitutional amendment, as he is a still-serving state employee, Berri has said. A State Department spokesperson said it was 'up to Lebanon to choose its next president, not the United States or any external actor.' 'We have been consistent in our efforts to press Lebanon to elect a new president, which we see as important to strengthening Lebanon’s political institutions,' the spokesperson said. Hezbollah official Wafiq Safa said last week there was 'no veto' on Aoun. But the sources said Hezbollah, designated a terrorist group by the United States and other countries, will not support Aoun. Aoun has a key role in shoring up the ceasefire brokered by Washington and Paris in November. The terms require the Lebanese military to deploy into south Lebanon as Israeli troops and Hezbollah withdraw forces. Still reeling from a financial collapse in 2019, Lebanon desperately needs foreign aid to rebuild. Much of the damage is in Shi’ite majority areas. Hezbollah, its supply line to Iran severed by Assad’s ousting, has urged Arab and international support for Lebanon. Lebanon‘s Maronite Bishops called on lawmakers to elect a president, urging a 'national awakening.' Nabil Boumonsef, deputy editor-in-chief of Annahar newspaper, was not certain anyone would be elected, even after the major shift in the balance of power in Lebanon, where Hezbollah‘s weapons have long been a source of division. Underlining the influence Hezbollah and Amal still wield, he said the only way a president could be elected would be if they agreed on Aoun or Azour. But if they tried to install their preferred candidate, this would 'sever the oxygen from Lebanon.' Saudi Minister Faisal bin Farhan said last October that Riyadh had never fully disengaged from Lebanon and that outside countries should not tell Lebanese what to do.

Golani Druze view of Jewish state changing after Assad’s fall, Is...	Under the new Syrian leader Abu Mohammad al-Julani, there is an opportunity for engagement, according to Tarif. By Andrew Bernard, JNS The fall of Bashar Assad in Syria is opening new doors for the Druze community in the Israeli Golan Heights, Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif, the spiritual leader of the Druze community in Israel, told JNS on Wednesday. Speaking in Arabic via a translator at a Hudson Institute event in Washington, Tarif said fear of the Assads had limited the hand of the Druze in their four villages in the Golan. Under the new Syrian leader Abu Mohammad al-Julani, there is an opportunity for engagement, according to Tarif. 'We cannot forget that the previous regime was merciless,' he said. 'When the 1973 war started, the first thing they struck was the Druze. Before they even struck the army.' Israel captured the Golan Heights in June 1967, and with it, four predominantly Druze towns that maintain close relations with the Druze community across the border in Syria. Unlike the Druze communities that became part of Israel in 1948 and are integrated into Israeli society as citizens and often as volunteer soldiers, most of the Druze in the Golan Heights, in towns like Majdal Shams, rejected Israeli citizenship. A Hezbollah rocket launched from Lebanon in July that fell in Majdal Shams, striking a soccer field and killing 12 Druze children, coupled with Assad’s fall in December, has raised the question of whether Druze in the Golan might be open to a new relationship with the Jewish state. 'The people of Majdal Shams were scared to normalize or become citizens of Israel because of the Assad regime,' Tarif said. 'Now the situation is different.' 'The barriers are broken. There are no more barriers,' he said. 'Some of them I used to talk to in secret. Now they’re talking to me in public.' 'They’re saying ‘When are you coming to visit?’ and ‘When are we going to go visit?’ You didn’t hear that before,' Tarif added. 'Julani has a golden opportunity to show the world that he is capable of change.' ‘Islam is different’ The status of minorities, including Druze, Christians and Alawites, in Julani’s Syria is one of the most pressing questions after the fall of Assad. Syria’s approximately 700,000 Druze make up about 3% of the nation’s population, with most living in the southeastern province of Suwayda, where they are a majority of the population, or around the capital Damascus. They have long faced oppression as an ethno-religious minority, which is usually described as a distinct Abrahamic religion separate from Islam. In recent years, they have faced persecution—ranging from forced conversion to massacres—from Sunni Islamist groups. In 2018, ISIS carried out a string of suicide bombings and other attacks in Suwayda that killed more than 250 Druze, and the terrorist group kidnapped more than 30 Druze women and children. In 2015, members of the Nusrah Front, which was Syria’s al-Qaeda branch and the predecessor to Julani’s Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, shot 20 Druze in the northwest province of Idlib after accusing them of being infidels. Officials from the new government have said that they 'guarantee' the religious rights of all Syrians, but many remain skeptical. Tarif told JNS that after the fall of Assad, the Druze of Syria want a society that respects minority rights and is free from religious compulsion. 'Islam is different. For example, for us Druze, we don’t allow polygamy, but Julani calls for it,' Tarif said. 'They’re going around telling people to wear scarves, and not everybody is religious. I have two other brothers. One brother is not religious.' 'The important thing that the Druze practice is that nothing is to be done by force,' he added. 'You do not force anyone into a belief or a practice.'

Iran was ‘defeated very badly’ in Syria, general admits	Iranian general admits in leaked audio recording that he is 'not proud' of overthrow of long-time ally Bashar Assad in Syria, calls his ouster a 'very big blow' to Tehran. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A senior Iranian officer admitted that the Islamic republic suffered a stinging defeat with the loss of the Assad regime in Syria last month, blaming deposed President Bashar Assad and his Russian allies for the rebel takeover. According to a report published by The New York Times on Wednesday, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Brig. Gen. Behrouz Esbati - commander of Iranian forces in Syria prior to the ouster of Assad on December 8th - spoke candidly at a Tehran mosque last week regarding Iran's 'defeat' in Syria. A recording of his speech was leaked to Iranian media and dissident outlets, the Times reported, revealing both Esbati's harsh criticism of Iran's allies including the Assad regime and the Russian military, and the impact of the loss of a key long-time ally of Tehran. 'I don’t consider losing Syria something to be proud of,' Esbati said. 'We were defeated, and defeated very badly, we took a very big blow and it’s been very difficult.' Esbati argued that former President Bashar Assad was himself partially to blame for his ouster, claiming the Syrian leader had declined Iranian offers of assistance. Assad's defeat came following a months-long period of strained ties with Iran, after the Syrian president rebuffed multiple requests by Tehran to launch a large-scale attack on Israel from Syrian territory using local pro-Iranian militias. The IRGC officer also accused Russia's military of misleading Iran, claiming that Moscow had told Tehran that its air force was carrying out an aggressive air campaign against Syrian rebel forces, while Russian planes were in fact dropping their ordinance in open fields, Esbati claimed. While Iran has ostensibly reached out to the new Syrian leadership - led by Sunni fundamentalists who have long advocated for the termination of Iranian influence in their country - Esbati hinted at a possible campaign to overthrow the provisional government. 'We can activate all the networks we have worked with over the years,' he said. 'We can activate the social layers that our guys lived among for years; we can be active in social media and we can form resistance cells.'

Israel nearly bombed Beirut Airport to stop Iran money transfers	An Iranian diplomat aboard the plane refused to allow a search of his bag, which was later confiscated by Lebanese security. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli military was prepared to bomb Beirut Airport, but held off on the attack after a transfer of millions of dollars in funding from Iran to Hezbollah did not occur. According to a report from Saudi outlet Al Arabiya, a recent flight from Iran to Lebanon raised suspicions among Israel's intelligence agencies. Israeli officials believed that Iran was planning to use the flight to smuggle millions of dollars to the Hezbollah terror organization. That suspicion was supported by a separate report from Al-Hadith, which said that Western officials also speculated that the flight was be leveraged to support Hezbollah. Upon landing, Iranian officials attempted to prevent airport officials from searching the plane, sparking further concerns about what was carried onboard. An Iranian diplomat aboard the plane refused to allow a search of his bag, which was later confiscated by Lebanese security. A search of the plane and the bags of the passengers did not turn up the funds, so Israel did not attack the airport. According to an October 2024 report from JBN, Hezbollah's main sources of funding have been seriously impacted by the fighting with Israel. Many of Lebanon's biggest commercial banks are wary that providing funds to Hezbollah could place them in Israel's crosshairs. 'I’m hearing from Lebanese bankers, including Hezbollah financiers, that Lebanon’s wealthiest bankers who can afford to fly have fled to Europe and the Gulf, fearing they could be targeted next by Israel for helping Hezbollah,' former State Department official David Asher told JBN. 'These Lebanese bankers, most of them billionaires, see the wind is blowing against Hezbollah, so they are not going to let it take millions of dollars out of their banks, which still have cash despite being bankrupt on paper,' he added. 'They know that if they do, Israel probably will eliminate them, too.'

3 soldiers KIA in Gaza fighting, bringing death toll to 401	The soldiers were killed by a large explosive fired at their tank, in the northern Strip city of Beit Hanoun./Strong> By World Israel News Staff Three Israeli soldiers were killed in battle in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, bringing the IDF death toll for the ground invasion of the coastal enclave to 401. The late troops were identified as Staff Sgt. Matityahu Ya’akov Perel, 22, from Beit El, Staff Sgt. Kanaoo Kasa, 22, from Beit Shemesh, and Staff Sgt. Nevo Fisher, 20, from Bruchin. All of the men served in the 401st Armored Brigade’s 46th Battalion, and were operating in Beit Hanoun, in the northern Strip. Initial findings from an IDF probe into the incident, which wounded three others, that the soldiers' tank was stuck by a 'large explosive device.' Perel was moderately wounded in battle several months ago, but insisted upon returning to his unit and continuing to fight against Hamas. According to a statement eulogizing Perel by a local community leader, Matanya Shnerb, two of his relatives fell in battle during the War of Independence and the First Lebanon War. He is survived by his parents and several siblings. Kasa was from 'a family of immigrants from Ethiopia, a 22-year-old in mandatory service who fought on the front lines from the beginning of the war,' read a statement from the Beit Shemesh municipality. The 18th soldier from Beit Shemesh to be killed in action, Kasa is survived by his parents and five brothers and sisters. Fisher's parents were among the founders of Bruchin, the town where he was born and raised. He is survived by his parents and three siblings. Since the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip began in late October 2023, 401 soldiers have been killed. Counting deaths that occurred on October 7th and in the battles before the ground invasion, a total of 830 soldiers have been killed since the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.

Hezbollah’s pick for president of Lebanon backs out of race	The presidency, which, according to Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system, must go to a Maronite Christian, has been vacant since 2022, when Michel Aoun's term ended. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hezbollah's favored candidate for the presidency of Lebanon announced on Wednesday that he was dropping out of the race. The Lebanese terror group had backed Marada Movement leader Suleiman Frangieh, who said he was backing out of the election and instead endorsed Lebanese army commander General Joseph Aoun. Frangieh said, 'Given that the conditions for electing a president of the republic are now in place and in light of the current circumstances, I hereby announce the withdrawal of my candidacy, which has never been an obstacle to the electoral process.' He added, 'I would like to express my gratitude to everyone who supported me. As I have previously stated, I fully endorse General Joseph Aoun, who possesses the qualifications necessary to safeguard the presidency. I wish the Parliament success in the election process, and I hope the nation navigates this critical phase with unity, awareness, and responsibility.' The presidency, which, according to Lebanon's power-sharing system, must go to a Maronite Christian, has been vacant since 2022, when Michel Aoun's term ended. No political party in Lebanon's 128-seat parliament has been able to impose its choice, and there is a lack of consensus on whether a candidate should fill the position. Hezbollah rescinded its support for Frangieh and is apparently willing to compromise with a less extreme candidate. As the 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon nears its end, Israeli officials are expressing doubts about Beirut's ability to uphold the agreement in the long term. 'With January 27th still some time away, a lot can change in this region,' a senior Israeli political source told The Press Service of Israel. 'The decision to fully withdraw from Lebanon could be made as late as 24 hours before the ceasefire ends. Additionally, Lebanon still faces a prolonged process of electing a president, and further developments in Syria are expected. For all intents and purposes, we are keeping the option of extending the [IDF's] presence on the table.'

‘We love and support you’: NFL legends pay solidarity visit to Is...	The trip was made possible with the support of Athletes for Israel, an organization committed to combating antisemitism and racism while promoting a positive narrative about Israel. By Rolene Marks, JNS NFL legends Nick Lowery and Tony Richardson touched down in Israel last week on a solidarity visit. Their itinerary included visits to the Nova Festival memorial, kibbutzim affected by the Hamas massacre on Oct. 7, 2023, and the Druze village of Majdal Shams, where 12 children lost their lives on a soccer pitch to Hezbollah attacks. Lowery, who played 18 seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs and New York Jets, and Richardson, who played 17 seasons for the Dallas Cowboys, Kansas City Chiefs, Minnesota Vikings, and New York Jets, are both ambassadors of Project Max. Bringing together professional athletes from around the world, Project Max is committed to combating intolerance through sports. The trip was made possible with the support of Athletes for Israel, an organization committed to combating antisemitism and racism while promoting a positive narrative about Israel. The two spent time with family members of hostages currently held in Gaza, including Yoni and Amit Levy, the father and brother of Na’ama Levy. They also met with IDF soldiers and Israeli officials, including President Isaac Herzog. Lowery told the president about his experience meeting with hostage families, saying, 'We’re here to say we love and support you—no matter what.' Richardson emphasized the importance of being a voice for those who do not have one. During a meeting with Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana the delegation discussed the importance of Israeli resilience and of the visitors’ steadfast support for Israel. Eric Rubin, a member of the Athletes for Israel advisory board and the CEO of Project Max, told JNS about the importance of the visit to Majdal Shams. 'During former NBA Champion Josh Powell’s visit to Israel, we met some of the survivors of the Majdal Shams attack in Ichilov hospital. During that visit, we heard the horror stories, but also saw the resilience of the children and their families. I committed to them that I would do what I could to make sure the world didn’t forget what happened to the 12 angels and all the survivors,' he said. Bringing Lowery and Richardson to Majdal Shams was Rubin’s way to keep that promise. 'But at the same time, it was extremely important to meet with the families, hear the dreams and aspirations of these children who were brutally murdered, and do what we could to try and bring some hope, positivity, love, support and smiles to our beautiful Druze cousins,' Rubin added. Lowery and Robinson also toured the holy sites of Jerusalem, including the Western Wall and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. 'Nick and Tony both told me this was the most meaningful trip of their lives,' Rubin said. 'They feel a strong bond to the people of Israel. They are amazed by the bravery, the number of heroes, and very importantly, Israeli resilience. They cannot believe how determined Israelis are to wake up each day and not let anything get us down or break our spirit. They now know why we can’t be defeated.'

Biden pulls military aid from Israel to boost Hezbollah-infiltrat...	While the dollar amounts may seem modest, the timing of these last-minute moves by the administration has raised eyebrows in Washington. By Jewish Breaking News The Biden administration is pulling over $100 million in military support from Israel and Egypt to pump up Lebanon’s armed forces. A State Department memo obtained by the Associated Press reveals the White House quietly notified Congress on January 3 of its plans to divert $95 million in Egyptian military assistance and $7.5 million earmarked for Israel to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF). It’s a move the administration claims will help cement a shaky ceasefire deal hammered out last November between Hezbollah and Israel. 'U.S. security assistance to the LAF increases its capacity as the country’s only legitimate military force and defender of Lebanon’s territorial integrity, enables the LAF to prevent potential destabilization from ISIS and other terrorist groups, and enables the LAF to provide security both for the Lebanese people and for U.S. personnel,' the State Department’s memorandum reads. Under the terms of the 60-day ceasefire agreement, the IDF will gradually withdraw from southern Lebanon while Hezbollah forces pull back and dismantle their terror infrastructure in the region. In the interim, the LAF is to deploy roughly 6,000 troops to the area south of the Litani River. However, intelligence reports revealing Hezbollah’s lingering presence and the LAF’s failure to deploy adequate forces have prompted Israel to reconsider its withdrawal plans. While the dollar amounts may seem modest, the timing of these last-minute moves by the administration has raised eyebrows in Washington. Critics have long warned that Hezbollah’s tentacles reach deep into Lebanon’s military ranks. Reports have been surfacing that some LAF commanders are providing intelligence to Hezbollah. That doesn’t seem to bother Biden’s State Department, who insist the LAF serves as a 'counterweight' to the Iranian-backed terrorist group. 'U.S. support to the LAF reinforces the LAF as an important institutional counterweight to Hezbollah, which receives weapons, training, and financial support from Iran. 'The LAF continues to be an independent, non-sectarian institution in Lebanon and is respected across all sectors.' With Hezbollah’s influence looming large and tensions still simmering, Biden seems intent on undermining Israel’s security until his final day in office.

Lung cancer rates in Israel: Smoking remains top risk despite dec...	The average age of lung cancer diagnosis in 2021 was 70.8 years for Jewish men, 66.9 years for Arab men, 70.3 years for Jewish women, and 63.4 years for Arab women. By Pesach Benson, TPS A long-term study of lung cancer in Israel released on Wednesday by the Health Ministry found that smoking — both active and passive — remains the primary risk factor. 'The link between smoking and lung cancer is unequivocal. While trends in recent years suggest a decrease in mortality rates, continued efforts are needed to reduce smoking rates and prevent further lung cancer cases,' said Professor Lital Keinan-Boker, Director of the ministry’s National Center for Disease Control. The comprehensive report on lung cancer diagnoses and mortality by the ministry’s National Center for Disease Control, covered the years 1996-2021. In 2021, Israel saw 2,907 new cases of lung cancer, with a significant disparity between men and women. Men accounted for 60.3% of the diagnoses, while women made up 39.7%. Lung cancer claimed the lives of 1,875 patients that year. Of those cases, 80-90% were linked to tobacco use. Lung cancer rates are highest among individuals aged 55 and over, with only 8.3% of new diagnoses occurring in those under 55. Among various demographic groups, lung cancer diagnoses show stark variations in age and incidence. The data also revealed a steady decline in lung cancer incidence among Jewish men, with a 3.5% decrease in rates from 2016 to 2021. However, the incidence rate among Jewish women has remained relatively stable, staying low since 2014. In contrast, lung cancer rates among Arab men have remained stable over the same period, with the highest incidence observed in this group, while rates for Arab women remain the lowest across all population groups. The average age of lung cancer diagnosis in 2021 was 70.8 years for Jewish men, 66.9 years for Arab men, 70.3 years for Jewish women, and 63.4 years for Arab women. These figures illustrate the earlier onset of lung cancer among Arab populations, particularly Arab women, who have the lowest average age at diagnosis. In terms of survival rates, there has been some improvement over the years. The survival rate for Jewish men increased from 15.3% in 1996-2002 to 25.7% in 2010-2017. Similarly, survival rates for Jewish women rose from 23.3% to 38.1% in the same periods. For Arab men, the survival rate increased from 14.4% to 20.5%, while for Arab women, it went from 19.7% to 33.9%. Mortality rates have also shown signs of improvement, particularly among Jewish men, where mortality rates have decreased by 3.4% since 2011. Arab men saw a more significant decrease of 7.3%, while mortality rates among Jewish women dropped by 2% since 2016. Conversely, mortality rates for Arab women have remained stable. In an international context, Israel ranks 55th in lung cancer incidence and 78th in mortality rates compared to other countries, based on data from 185 regional and national cancer registries reported to the World Health Organization.

Israeli army reports surge in Haredi soldiers, 338 recruited in p...	In tandem with the recruitment push, the IDF completed the issuance of approximately 7,000 recruitment orders to non-commissioned officers from the Haredi sector, targeting future enlistment cycles. By Pesach Benson, TPS As draft exemptions for Israel’s Orthodox or Haredi community continue to create rifts in the governing coalition, the Israel Defense Forces said on Tuesday that 338 Haredim joined the military’s various service tracks in the past week. 'The IDF is working to integrate members of the Haredi sector into the various tracks, while expanding recruitment options by establishing new tracks and placement targets, while also refining and adapting existing tracks to recruits while maintaining their conditions and lifestyle,' the army said. Of the 338 new recruits, 211 enlisted as combat soldiers, while 127 took on roles as combat supporters. Among the highlights, the IDF successfully inducted the inaugural cohort of the 'Hashomonaim' Brigade and the maintenance system in northern Israel, as well as a second cohort for the Border Guard. Additionally, the 'Hashomonaim' Brigade’s combat track was extended to reservists in Phase B of its development. In tandem with the recruitment push, the IDF completed the issuance of approximately 7,000 recruitment orders to non-commissioned officers from the Haredi sector, targeting future enlistment cycles. This achievement fulfills the recruitment order objectives set by the Minister of Defense for this phase of the year, complementing 3,000 recruitment orders issued earlier in 2024. The latest recruitment figures for Haredi combat roles included 70 recruits for the Netzah Yehuda Battalion, 19 recruits for the 'Tomer' Company, 19 recruits for the 'Arrow' Company, 11 recruits for the Air Force’s 'Negev' Company, 35 recruits for the Border Police, and 57 recruits for the 'Hashomonaim' Brigade. Recruitment drives are set to continue throughout the month, with additional Haredi enlistments expected. The military began making plans to draft yeshiva students after Israel’s High Court of Justice ruled in June that exemptions for the Haredi community were illegal. The issue has not been resolved and is contributing to a coalition crisis that forced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to leave the hospital over the advice of his doctors to cast his vote on government legislation on Tuesday. Military service is compulsory for all Israeli citizens. However, Israel’s first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, and the country’s leading rabbis agreed to a status quo that deferred military service for Haredi men studying in yeshivot, or religious institutions. At the time, no more than several hundred men were studying in yeshivot. However, the Orthodox community has grown significantly since Israel’s founding. In January 2023, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported that Haredim are Israel’s fastest-growing community and projected it would constitute 16% of the population by the end of the decade. According to the Israel Democracy Institute, the number of yeshiva students exceeded 138,000 in 2021. A recent survey found that the Israeli public is shifting decisively in favor of integrating Orthodox Jews into military service. The Israel Democracy Institute found that only 9% of Israelis support the current arrangement exempting Haredim from military service, a steep decline from 22% ten months earlier.

Bodies of hostages Youssef and Hamza Ziyadne retrieved from Gaza	The IDF and Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) confirmed that Youssef’s remains were found in a tunnel in the Rafah area of southern Gaza. By JNS Israel Defense Forces troops located the bodies of hostages Youssef and Hamza Ziyadne during military operations in the Gaza Strip, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz confirmed on Wednesday evening. In a statement shared by the Defense Ministry, Katz expressed his 'deep condolences to the Ziyadne family upon the discovery of the bodies of Youssef and Hamza, who were kidnapped by Hamas murderers on Oct. 7 and were rescued in a heroic operation by our heroic soldiers. 'We continue to do everything to fulfill our supreme moral obligation—the return of all the hostages, living and dead, to Israeli soil,' he added. The IDF and Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) confirmed that Youssef’s remains were found in a tunnel in the Rafah area of southern Gaza. The statement did not immediately confirm Hamza’s death, though it said that the findings in the tunnel raised 'serious concerns' for his life. Yesterday, the IDF and ISA located and recovered the body of the hostage Youssef Ziyadne from an underground tunnel in the area of Rafah in Gaza, and returned his body to Israel. Youssef, 53, was the father of 19 children and lived in Rahat. Youssef was abducted on Oct. 7, 2023… pic.twitter.com/0WK6kl80Ks &mdash; Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) January 8, 2025 'Our hearts ache,' Ali Ziyadne, Youssef’s brother, told Israel’s Ynet news outlet. He added, 'We wanted them to return to our family alive, but unfortunately they returned dead. Aisha and her brother Bilal were waiting to embrace them. This is a difficult and shocking disaster.' Youssef Ziyadne, 53, and his children Hamza, 22, Bilal, 18, and Aisha, 17, residents of the Israeli Bedouin community of Rahat, were abducted by Palestinian Hamas terrorists during the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre while they were working in Kibbutz Holit near the border with Gaza. Bilal and Aisha were released as part of the November 2023 ceasefire agreement between Jerusalem and Hamas after 55 days in captivity. On Oct. 7, 2023, 25 residents of Rahat, the largest Muslim Bedouin city in Israel’s Negev desert, headed to Gaza border communities Kibbutz Holit and Kibbutz Sufa to work and did not return. They were among the 1,200 people killed by Hamas during its invasion of Israel that morning. Thousands more were wounded, and more than 250 were taken back to the Strip as hostages, including six Bedouins. According to Israeli estimates, there are 98 hostages still in Hamas captivity in Gaza, including 94 abducted during the Oct. 7 attacks. Of the 251 hostages taken on Oct. 7, 157 have been returned or rescued, and Hamas is believed to be holding 36 bodies, 34 of them taken on Oct. 7 and the remaining two being IDF soldiers Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul, who were kidnapped in 2014.

Ireland accuses Israel of genocide, joining ICJ case	Dublin signs on to Gaza genocide case in the International Court of Justice, as part of petition first launched by South Africa. By World Israel News Staff Ireland signed on to South Africa’s petition to the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide in the Gaza Strip, the court announced Tuesday. The case was first launched in December, 2023, after South Africa’s government filed a brief with the United Nations court, calling for an investigation into Israel’s handling of the war in the Gaza Strip. Since then, a number of other countries, including Mexico, Colombia, Nicaragua, Maldives, Chile, Spain, Turkey, and Bolivia have signed onto the petition. The Palestinian Authority has also signed the petition, calling on the ICJ to intervene. On Monday, Dublin joined the case, invoking Article 63 of the court’s statue, while adding no new allegations against Israel. Ireland did offer a unique legal reasoning for the petition, however, telling the court that the definition of genocide, the 'intent to destroy, in whole or in part' of a population, could be met if actions could be reasonably perceived as having such a goal in mind. 'In Ireland's view, specific intent can also be inferred in any case where a reasonable person would have foreseen that the natural and probable consequence of the acts of the perpetrator was to so destroy or contribute to destruction of the protected group,' Dublin wrote to the court. 'Ireland respectfully submits that the perpetrator does not need to have, as his or her purpose, the commission of the crime of genocide when committing any one or more of the material elements of the crime.' Dublin has for almost a year signaled its intention to join onto South Africa’s petition, first announcing its plans to do so last March. The announcement comes as diplomatic relations between Israel and Ireland hit their nadir, after Jerusalem shuttered its embassy in Dublin last month. The decision came after the Irish cabinet voted to join South Africa’s ICJ case against Israel. 'The antisemitic actions and rhetoric that Ireland is taking against Israel are based on delegitimization and demonization of the Jewish state and on double standards,' Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said in December.

Hostages’ families petition High Court to force a deal with Hamas	By not agreeing to Hamas' demands, the government is violating their loved ones’ basic and state-guaranteed rights, 112 signatories said. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A group of 112 freed hostages and families of those still in Hamas captivity in Gaza petitioned the High Court of Justice Tuesday to try to force the government to make a deal with the terrorist organization. 'The goal is to illustrate that the State of Israel is deviating from protecting the basic rights of the citizens who are being held there, and it has been doing this for the last 15 months,' Renana Guma told Kan Reshet Bet. Guma’s children, Or and Gil, were freed in the only hostage deal to date in November 2023, but their father Yair was murdered and his body is being held among a mix of 100 living and dead hostages. 'In fact, the state is violating two Basic Laws,' she said. One is the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, which states that every human being is entitled to protection of his life, body and freedom. The other is the Nation-State Law, which has a clause stating that 'The state shall strive to ensure the safety of its citizens who are in distress and captivity because of their citizenship.' The petitioners accuse the government, and especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, of violating their loved ones’ basic constitutional rights by 'refus[ing] to agree to an arrangement for the release of the abductees held in the Gaza Strip' that includes bowing to Hamas’ demand to stop the war and withdraw the IDF from the coastal enclave. They are seeking an urgent judicial order to the government to defend how its non-action regarding the hostages is not violating the Basic Laws. Barak Medina, one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs, explained to Kan that although the court does not have the authority or ability to dictate to the government what policy to adopt, it does have the power to oblige it to provide explanations to the public and prove that it has an organized policy. But one of the court’s roles, he said, is to distinguish 'whether something the government or the Knesset legislature does violates human rights or does not violate them.' He also charged that 'There is not even a single government decision on the conditions under which a deal will take place. The prime minister decides alone, constantly changing the negotiating team's instructions, without anyone knowing what the logic is and without considering the heads of the security establishment, without there being an orderly discussion.' The 'proper procedure,' he said, would be to hear the opinions of all the security authorities and receive a list of 'the advantages and disadvantages of a deal and the consequences of not making a deal, and sets some parameters, something minimal.' Not all the hostage families believe in pressuring the government, believing instead that the pressure must be directed at those holding the hostages. The Tikva Forum repeated its longstanding demand Tuesday that that the Israeli government and the IDF 'immediately present a list of clear steps that will be taken to strike the Hamas terrorist organization to the point that it begs to release all the hostages.' These families are also firmly opposed to any agreements that do not result in the release of all the hostages together. Partial deals, they said, 'undermine the ability to return the remaining hostages, while legitimizing and empowering Hamas.' Even the very existence of negotiations, they said, 'strengthens the terror organization and gives it a sense of control and governance.'

IDF will keep killing terrorists until Hamas frees hostages, says...	We won't stop' - IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi tells Israeli army officers in Gaza that Israel's military operations in the Strip are meant to pressure Hamas into freeing Israeli hostages. By World Israel News Staff Israel is using its continuing military operation in the Gaza Strip to bring pressure to bear on the Hamas terror organization, with the aim of forcing it to release the remaining 100 captives held in the coastal enclave, the IDF's top officer said Tuesday. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi met with Israeli officers operating in the northern Gaza city of Jabalia on Tuesday. During his visit, Halevi held a situational assessment with the Southern Command Chief, Major General Yaron Finkelman, the 162nd Division Commander, Brigadier General Itzik Cohen, and a number of other senior IDF officers commanding forces in the Gaza Strip. Israel, Halevi told the officers, is working to use military force to bring Hamas 'to the point where it will understand that it needs to [release] all the hostages.' 'I look at the situation that Hamas is in, they see every day what you are doing to them and they understand that this thing is close to being unbearable.' 'And I am telling you that we will not stop. We will bring them to the point where they will understand that they need to release all the hostages, otherwise the very professional work you are doing will continue and continue, and it means more prisoners and more dead terrorists. And I know you are doing everything possible to minimize casualties on our side.' The comments came amid mixed signals regarding the status of hostage deal talks in Doha, Qatar. Various Arabic media outlets have reported this week that the two sides have made progress in the negotiations. However, senior Hamas spokesman and politburo member Osama Hamdan told a press conference in Algeria Tuesday that the terror group will not compromise on any of its core demands, insisting on the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and a complete end to the war. Israel has already rejected a complete pullout from Gaza, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will continue fighting the war until it has achieved all of its objectives, including the complete dismantling of the Hamas terror organization.

Amnesty International suspends Israeli branch for two years	The Israeli branch, which is a legally independent organization, rejected the claims that Jerusalem is perpetrating genocide in the Strip. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Amnesty International’s international board has suspended its Israel branch for two years, starting immediately, the nonprofit told JNS on Tuesday. The nonprofit’s board 'considered Amnesty Israel’s failure to align itself fully with Amnesty International research and positions, and its public discrediting of Amnesty’s research undermining well-investigated findings for several years,' a spokesperson told JNS. The Amnesty board also took the decision 'due to evidence of endemic anti-Palestinian racism within Amnesty Israel, which violates core human rights principles and Amnesty values,' the spokesperson claimed. 'Anti-Palestinian racism within Amnesty Israel has been denounced by a number of board members of Amnesty Israel since 2021, resulting in their resignations.' 'They have also taken to the media and social media to reject and condemn anti-Palestinian racism within Amnesty International Israel and beyond,' the spokesperson added. Earlier on Tuesday, a staff member at Amnesty’s Israel branch, which was founded in 1964 and is one of the nonprofit’s oldest chapters, confirmed the suspension to JNS and denied that the Tel Aviv-based chapter’s actions were racist against Palestinians. The source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, noted that Amnesty Israel consults with Arab and Jewish staffers about its statements and reports. The source didn’t say how Amnesty’s decision would affect the Tel Aviv-based organization’s day-to-day operations. Amnesty Israel has reportedly been dissatisfied with its parent body’s lack of concern for Jewish terror victims. On Dec. 5, Amnesty released the 296-page report 'You Feel Like You Are Subhuman,' noting 'Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.' The report accused Israel Defense Forces soldiers of 'prohibited acts under the Genocide Convention—namely killing, causing serious bodily or mental harm and deliberately inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction in whole or in part.' The Israeli branch, which is a legally independent organization, rejected the claims that Jerusalem is perpetrating genocide in the Strip. 'Our careful analysis does not find that the findings meet the definition of genocide, as carefully formulated in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide,' it stated. In 2022, Amnesty called Jerusalem’s treatment of Palestinian Arabs 'apartheid,' a conclusion that staff members of Amnesty Israel called 'problematic,' 'flawed' and at risk of producing 'an adverse effect.' Officials in Jerusalem have previously said that Amnesty Israel has violated anti-boycott legislation by campaigning for arms embargoes and promoting a blacklist of Jewish villages in Judea and Samaria. Last year, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich instructed the Israeli Tax Authority to launch a formal probe into tax benefits that the local Amnesty branch enjoys under Israeli law. Smotrich’s office said it also took issue with the fact that 80% of the organization’s budget came from Amnesty’s global headquarters, which it said raised questions about its legal independence.

Report: Latest hostage deal proposal making progress, includes 6-...	Pro-Hezbollah outlet in Lebanon reports that talks in Qatar are making progress with new proposal under which Israel would agree to 6-8 week ceasefire, in exchange for comprehensive list of hostages and their condition. By World Israel News Staff A Lebanese newspaper aligned with the pro-Iranian terror group Hezbollah reported Wednesday that hostage deal talks in Doha, Qatar are making progress towards a deal based on a proposal under which Israel would agree to an extended ceasefire in exchange for a complete list of all living hostages held in the Gaza Strip. According to the report published by Al-Akhbar Wednesday morning, ceasefire talks in Qatar are now focused on a proposed six-to-eight week truce in the Gaza Strip. During the ceasefire, Hamas will gather information on the condition of all Israeli captives still held by its operatives and by other terrorist groups in Gaza, and transfer a list of living hostages to Israel. In addition, Hamas will send a list of all hostages who are confirmed as having died in captivity. The report cited Egyptian officials who said that only hostages whose remains have been located will be included on the list. As part of the agreement, Israel would ensure a massive increase in the quantity of humanitarian aid entering the Gaza Strip during the ceasefire. Furthermore, Gaza's medical system would undergo a major upgrade during the truce. The report claimed that negotiators have set aside the question of post-war control of the Gaza Strip for the time being. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied the report, calling it 'absolutely false.' In a statement released by the Prime Minister's Office, Netanyahu derided the report as 'psychological warfare' against Israelis. 'The report in the Arab media about a pause of a number of weeks in the war in exchange for a list of hostages' names is absolutely false and an additional part of the psychological warfare that Hamas is trying to use on the hostages' families and the citizens of Israel.' 'The State of Israel will continue to work relentlessly, around the clock, to bring all of our hostages back home.'

Report details UNRWA’s ‘unholy alliance’ with Hamas, Islamic Jiha...	More than 100 survivors of Hamas’s October 7 attacks filed a $1 billion lawsuit against UNRWA in June, accusing the agency of 'aiding and abetting' the terror group. By Pesach Benson, TPS A United Nations watchdog organization accused the embattled UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees of having an 'unholy alliance' with the Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror groups in a report released on Tuesday. The report comes as Israeli legislation blacklisting the agency is due to go into effect later in January. The Geneva-based UN Watch alleges that senior UNRWA officials routinely engage with terror groups, describing each other as 'partners' and praising their 'cooperation.' The 55-page report accuses Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA’s Commissioner-General, and his colleagues of enabling infiltration by Hamas and other terror groups. It states that Hamas and Islamic Jihad influenced UNRWA policies, indoctrinated Palestinian children through agency schools, and established military infrastructure near UNRWA’s Gaza facilities. 'UNRWA isn’t just a bystander in the Arab-Israeli conflict – it’s a primary enabler,' observes Hillel Neuer, Executive Director of UN Watch. 'By allowing terrorists to infiltrate its ranks and incite violence, UNRWA isn’t promoting peace, they’re perpetuating hatred and war,' said UN Watch Executive Director Hillel Neuer. According to the report, over 10% of UNRWA’s senior educators in Gaza are members of Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Israeli authorities have also alleged that hundreds of UNRWA’s 13,000 Gazan employees, including teachers, are active members of Hamas. The report further claims that UNRWA complied with demands from terror groups, such as blocking biometric identification systems aimed at ensuring accurate refugee counts, resisting the adoption of ethics codes protecting LGBTQ rights, and failing to suspend employees who breached neutrality policies. The UN Watch report highlighted a May 2024 meeting in Beirut where Lazzarini reportedly reached an agreement with terror groups. Under this agreement, Hamas leader Fathi al-Sharif was allowed to remain the principal of a major UNRWA school and head of its teachers’ union despite his history of glorifying terrorist attacks. Al-Sharif’s suspension occurred only after a formal government complaint in early 2024. He was later killed by Israeli forces on Sept. 30, 2024. Hamas subsequently confirmed his leadership role and praised his 'jihadi education.' Another case involves Leni Stenseth, a former UNRWA deputy commissioner-general, who visited Gaza in June 2021 to meet Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s leader. This visit came after Hamas declared Matthias Schmale, then Gaza director of UNRWA, persona non grata for acknowledging the precision of Israeli strikes during the May 2021 conflict. Stenseth reportedly removed Schmale from his post and thanked Sinwar for his 'positivity' in facilitating UNRWA’s work. Former UNRWA Commissioner-General Pierre Krahenbuhl met Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders in 2017, fostering a secretive 'partnership' and allowing them to influence UNRWA decisions. After resigning amid scandal in 2019, he controversially became head of the International Red Cross, drawing U.S. Senate protests. In July, Israel gave the UN the names of around 100 UNRWA personnel who participated in the attack, held hostages, or were members of Hamas. However, the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services, which investigates mismanagement, fraud, corruption, and other misconduct, only probed 19 personnel. The OIOS did not indicate why it did not investigate the dozens of other workers. Of the 19 staffers who were investigated, the OIOS said nine 'may have been involved in the armed attacks' and that 'the employment of these individuals will be terminated in the interests of the Agency.' According to the report, 'The fact that Lazzarini has spent the last 14 months since October 7, 2023, shirking any responsibility by UNRWA for the atrocities perpetrated against Israelis by Hamas terrorists, including the involvement of UNRWA employees in those atrocities and in the ongoing hostilities in Gaza, shows that he is more focused on preserving UNRWA’s image than on ensuring its neutrality and independence.' Israeli Moves to Shut Down UNRWA In October, the Knesset passed legislation, which took effect later in January, stripping UNRWA of its diplomatic immunity and barring Israeli officials from cooperating with the agency. In November, Israel withdrew its diplomatic recognition of UNRWA. More than 100 survivors of Hamas’s October 7 attacks filed a $1 billion lawsuit against UNRWA in June, accusing the agency of 'aiding and abetting' the terror group. According to the suit, the lead plaintiff, 84-year-old Ditza Heiman of Kibbutz Nir Oz, was held captive for seven weeks in the home of a Palestinian man who said he was a UNRWA teacher at a boy’s school. The suit also alleges that UNRWA enacted an employee payment scheme to benefit Hamas in violation of UN protocols. Israel’s largest bank froze UNRWA’s account in February over suspicious financial transfers that the agency failed to adequately explain. That same month, Israeli forces discovered a Hamas complex located directly under the UNRWA’s Gaza City headquarters and connected directly to the agency’s electricity system. The facility included numerous computer servers belonging to the terror group. In May, UNRWA was ordered to vacate its Jerusalem offices in May over lease violations. Palestinian refugees are the only refugee population with its own dedicated UN agency. The rest of the world’s refugees fall under the mandate of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Petition urges The Jerusalem Post to nix ‘West Bank’ in reporting...	The appeal was launched following a tweet against the newspaper by a right-wing Israeli parliamentarian in the wake of Monday’s shooting attack by the Palestinian village of Al-Funduq near Kedumim. By JNS A group of conservative Jewish and Christian leaders has launched a public petition urging The Jerusalem Post to stop using the term West Bank in reporting on Israel’s biblical heartland and to call it by its historic name of Judea and Samaria. 'As Israel’s oldest English newspaper when it was called ‘The Palestine Post,’ The Jerusalem Post holds significant influence in shaping public opinion, influencing policies and defining global narratives,' the petition addressed to Eli Azur, the media outlet’s owner, and Zvika Klein, its editor-in-chief, stated. 'Your words and your headlines matter as Israel fights on the front lines and the front pages of media outlets around the globe.' The appeal was launched following a tweet against the newspaper by a right-wing Israeli parliamentarian in the wake of Monday’s shooting attack by the Palestinian village of Al-Funduq near Kedumim. 'It’s heartbreaking enough that Jewish blood is flowing needlessly in our biblical heartland,' MK Ohad Tal from Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich’s party wrote on X. 'It’s time for you to join hundreds of media outlets in calling our homeland by its correct name, ‘Judea and Samaria.’ Only the truth will help us overcome our enemies’ murders and lies.' The attack killed three Israelis, including two women in their 70s and an Israeli police officer who was gunned down in his car in front of his young son. The petition to The Jerusalem Post further stated that by 'referring to today’s attack in Kedumim, which killed three and injured eight as occurring in the ‘West Bank,’ your headline leads credence to those delegitimizing Israel.' Troy Miller, president of the National Religious Broadcasters, the largest association of Christian media broadcasters, urged association members during their annual convention in February 2024 to cease using the term 'West Bank' when reporting about Israel’s biblical heartland. 'Words matter in how we control the conversation and the language,' Miller said. 'Younger Christians don’t understand that the West Bank is within the biblical boundaries of Israel.'

Defeating Hamas could take 2-3 years, thinktank warns	Two decades of gathering weapons and building tunnels cannot be gotten rid of so quickly, says Dr. Eitan Shamir of the BESA Center. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The final military defeat of Hamas could take a few years, considering the time it has had to build its terror infrastructure, the director of a Middle East policy-oriented thinktank told The Media Line Wednesday. 'Hamas had over twenty years to accumulate a massive amount of firepower, dispersing it in many areas, including in its widespread underground tunnel network,' said Dr. Eitan Shamir, director of Bar Ilan University’s Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies (BESA Center). 'Combined with other terrorist organizations, such as the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), it had approximately 30,000 fighters. This could take two to three years to get rid of.' The IDF said more than six months ago that it had destroyed or completely degraded all of Hamas’ 24 military brigades. However, according to a recent Channel 12 report, the two groups have managed to recruit new men and now have between 20,000 to 23,000 fighters. Although the new recruits are barely trained in comparison to their predecessors, the army still has to root them out in major military operations, going back into places where it had already fought once or twice before. For example, in the just-concluded round in the northern part of the Strip, the IDF said more than 300 terrorists were killed. The Israeli army’s death toll in the ground offensive so far in Gaza stands at 398, with three soldiers losing their lives in the last two days. According to Yoni Ben Menachem, a Middle East expert from the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs, a think tank specializing in public and foreign policy, Hamas’ tunnel network is also a big threat that will take time to defeat. 'There is an estimated 40% of the tunnels still remaining, hundreds of kilometers of tunnels the Israeli intelligence was not aware of,' he told The Media Line. 'There are still very long tunnels that Israel has yet to have located, some of them with hostages inside,' he noted. 'This requires a very big operation and a massive amount of explosives that Israel currently does not possess.' The IDF has estimated that there are up to 450 miles of tunnels in the Strip, which is only some 140 square miles in size. 25-mile-long Gaza Strip. It has concentrated on destroying the largest and most strategically important ones, including those closest to the border with Israel, while damaging key points in others to render them unusable. Whether they stay inoperable is questionable, however, as a Channel 12 report in July cited an IDF assessment that the terrorists had managed to repair 'many' tunnels in Khan Yunis, for example. 'Israel does not have enough forces at this point to subdue Hamas both militarily and in its ability to govern Gaza,' Ben Menachem added. 'In order to do that, Israel needs to occupy the entire Gaza Strip and announce it is enforcing temporary military administration.' This is the preferred option of the more right-wing members of the current coalition. The outgoing Biden administration had flatly refused to endorse such a plan, desiring that a 'reformed' Palestinian Authority (PA) take over on 'the day after.' Considering the PA’s ongoing encouragement of terrorism, this idea has been shot down several times by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has yet to produce any concrete proposals regarding the governance of the Gaza Strip after the war’s goal of Hamas’ 'total defeat' is achieved.

Freed terrorist re-arrested for planning another attack	Moataz Berri served just three years in an Israeli military prison before his release. By World Israel News Staff A convicted terrorist released from an Israeli prison was recently arrested for planning an additional terror attack, Channel 14 News reported on Wednesday. In September 2020, Moataz Berri was arrested moments before carrying out an attack against Israeli civilians. Berri, a 24-year-old from the terror hotbed of Qalqilya, had illegally infiltrated Israel from PA-controlled territory. He was detained by security forces in the central city of Rosh HaAyin, where he was found to be in possession of a loaded gun. The terrorist left behind a 'martyrdom letter,' and admitted during an interrogation that he planned to shoot Israeli civilians. According to his testimony in military court, Berri wandered around Rosh HaAyin searching for victims for nearly two hours. He told the judges that he had planned to shoot an Orthodox Jewish man he encountered, but changed his mind after noticing that the potential victim had a baby in his vehicle. Berri claimed that he had already decided not to carry out the attack when he was arrested. In 2022, the court acquitted Berri of attempted murder charges, due to his expression of remorse for his actions. 'We welcome the court's decision to acquit the defendant. This is an important decision that sends a clear message to' potential terrorists, Berri's attorney, Merav Khory, said in a media statement at the time. The ruling 'sends a message that says 'it is never too late'' to 'stop their actions and save innocent lives.' He was convicted on less serious charges, and served just three years in an Israeli military prison before being freed. In October 2024, Berri was re-arrested by intelligence and security agencies after an investigation revealed he was planning to carry out another attack. According to the report, Berri had been in communication via 'encrypted channels' with Hamas operatives in Turkey. Berri said during his interrogation that he was instructed by his handlers to retrieve weapons, which had been buried in a field near the PA-controlled city of Tulkarem. Investigators found an M-16 assault rifle and two handguns at the site.

Ex-IDF soldier lands in Israel after fleeing Brazil ‘war crimes’ ...	We are all thrilled that he returned home safely,' said Itzik Vagdani, the soldier's father. By World Israel News Staff A former Israeli soldier who fled Brazil after a local court ordered police to investigate him on war crimes charges has landed safely in Israel, Hebrew-language media reported on Wednesday morning. Yuval Vagdani was targeted by the pro-Hamas Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) while traveling in Brazil, following his recent release from mandatory military service. The HRF stalks the social media profiles of current and former Israel soldiers, urging local authorities to arrest them when they travel abroad. Vagdani, who served in a unit which demolished homes used as Hamas terror assets, was forced to leave Brazil after the HRF submitted a 500-page complaint to a federal court. The documents included images that Vagdani had posted on his social media accounts of military activities in the Strip, which were used by the HRF to claim he he was complicit in 'genocide.' A Brazilian federal court instructed police to launch a probe of Vagdani, triggering According to Hebrew-language media reports, Israel's Foreign Ministry assisted Vagdani in immediately reaching Argentina. From there, he flew to Miami, in the U.S., and then back to Israel. 'We are all thrilled that he returned home safely,' said Itzik Vagdani, the soldier's father. 'Yuval is a survivor of the Nova massacre, and now that he has returned home, he has told his family that he will no longer upload videos about the activities he carried out in the Gaza Strip.' Itzik Vagdani added that his son 'will never return to Brazil again. He will learn from the mistakes he made. The main thing is that he has now returned to Israel and we are all happy that everything is behind us.' The incident has sparked serious concerns among Israeli leadership that former and active duty IDF soldiers could potentially be arrested while traveling abroad. According to a report from Hebrew-language outlet Ynet, soldiers are believed to be most at risk of being detained or prosecuted in Ireland, Brazil, Spain, Belgium, and South Africa.

‘God, save me’ – Former hostage recalls Hamas abduction	We hid under the bed, but then I heard ‘Allahu Akbar,’' said Sapir Cohen, recounting terrifying kidnapping by Hamas terrorists. By World Israel News Staff A former hostage who was kidnapped by the Hamas terror group and held captive in the Gaza Strip spoke about her terrifying ordeal in a recent interview. The weekend of October 7th, Sapir Cohen and her boyfriend Alexander (Sasha) Trufanov were visiting his parents in Kibbutz Nahal Oz. Prior to the visit, Trufanov had expressed reservations about traveling to the kibbutz, but Cohen convinced him to go anyway, she told the TBN Israel YouTube channel. The pair, who were staying in a separate kibbutz house near the Trufanov family home, were awakened on October 7th by nonstop air raid sirens. Then, Cohen said, Trufanov received a WhatsApp message from his mother that there were terrorists who had infiltrated the kibbutz. 'We hid under the bed, but then I heard ‘Allahu Akbar,’ I heard hundreds of terrorists storming houses, I heard things explode, the screams of the terrorists, the screams of the people killed by them, and I heard them come closer and closer to us. They were shooting everywhere, at everyone,' Cohen said. She prayed for God to save her, she said. Then, terrorists burst into the room, separating her from Trufanov. They were both abducted to Gaza. Cohen recounted crowds of civilians who jeered and attempted to beat her, as she was taken into the Strip on a motorcycle. Once in Gaza, Cohen was held alongside other captives who had been kidnapped during the massacres. 'I remember that I saw the other hostages, that one of them just laid down and he closed his eyes, he doesn’t want to be a part of this reality,' Cohen told TBN. 'I saw a young girl that was shaking, and I saw people that all their families were in the kibbutz on that day and they didn’t know what happened to their children, to their parents.' Cohen said that she once again prayed for God to save her, so that she could help support other hostages. After 55 days in captivity, Cohen was freed during a ceasefire. Troufanov is still held in the Strip. His mother, Yelena, and grandmother, Irina, who were also kidnapped, were released in the same deal as Cohen. His father, Vitali, was murdered on October 7th.

After Republicans take control of the Senate, Congress set to again take up legislation sanctioning the International Criminal Court and its chief prosecutor, over arrest warrants issued for Israeli prime minister, ex-defense chief. By World Israel News Staff Congressional Republicans signaled Tuesday that they will renew their efforts to impose sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC) and its chief prosecutor, Karim Kahn, after the previous attempt to do so was stymied by the Senate's Democratic leadership last year. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (LA-R) announced Tuesday that the lower chamber of Congress would vote on a sanctions bill later this week. 'This week, the House will vote to impose sanctions on ICC officials and put the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, back in his place,' Johnson said. The House Speaker castigated the ICC for its decision to issue arrest warrants for ISraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant last year for their involvement in the war against the Hamas terror organization in Gaza. Khan 'does not have jurisdiction over Israel or the United States, and it is outrageous that they’re issuing arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant,' Johnson continued. 'The ICC is actually equating Israel and Hamas, as even as Hamas still holds Israelis and American hostages. It is just absurd.' 'The House will not tolerate rogue actors who circumvent international law to attack Israel and threaten America. We won’t do it.' In June, the House voted in favor of a bill imposing sanctions on the ICC, with the backing of dozens of Democratic lawmakers. The measure was shelved in the Democratic-controlled Senate, however. Now, with Republicans controlling 52 seats in the Senate - rising to 53 once Senator-elect Jim Justice completes his term as West Virginia Governor - Majority Leader John Thune (SD-R) has vowed to advance the sanctions bill. 'If the ICC and its prosecutor do not reverse their outrageous and unlawful actions to pursue arrest warrants against Israeli officials, the Senate should immediately pass sanctions legislation, as the House has already done on a bipartisan basis,' Thune tweeted on November 17th, after Republicans secured a majority in the Senate, days after he won a leadership vote in GOP's Senate caucus, putting him on course to become Majority Leader. The Washington Free Beacon has reported that the House will vote on the legislation this Thursday. In parallel to the efforts in Congress, President-elect Donald Trump is reportedly planning to target the ICC with executive orders sanctioning the court's top officials. While the Biden administration rejected the ICC's decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, it fell short of taking punitive steps against the court.

‘Not good for Hamas’ – Trump issues ultimatum as envoy hints host...	Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, joins the president-elect at a press conference, claiming that 'a lot of progress' is being made in hostage deal talks in Doha, as inauguration day approaches. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President-elect Donald Trump appeared alongside his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, at a press conference at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida Tuesday, reiterating his warning to the Hamas terror organization that there will be 'hell to pay' if the remaining 100 hostages are not released by inauguration day on January 20th. 'If those hostages aren’t back … by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East — and it will not be good for Hamas and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone,' Trump said. 'All hell will break out. I don’t have to say anymore, but that’s what it is.' 'They should have given them back a long time ago, [and] they should have never taken them. There should have never been the attack on October 7th. People forget that. But there was, and many people are killed - they're no longer hostages.' 'If the deal isn't done before I take office, which is now gonna be two weeks, all hell will break out in the Middle East.' Trump's comments echoed similar remarks made a day earlier, when Trump told conservative pundit and radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt that 'there will be hell to pay' if Hamas does not release all hostages by January 20th. 'Those hostages have to get out. They have to get out now.' At Tuesday's press conference, Witkoff appeared to be optimistic regarding the prospects for achieving a hostage deal by inauguration day. 'Well, I think we're making a lot of progress, and I don't want to say too much because I think they're doing a really good job back in Doha,' Witkoff said. 'I think that we've had some really great progress, and I'm really hopeful that by the inaugural, we'll have some good things to announce on behalf of the president.'

Chabad of Metula was target of planned Oct. 7th-style Hezbollah i...	Rabbi Moshe Sasonkin told Ynet that IDF officials informed him that Hezbollah had collected information about him, including where he lived and even details about his car. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An IDF operation in Southern Lebanon uncovered documents outlining Hezbollah's plans to invade northern Israel, and one of the targets was the Chabad House in Metula, Ynet reports. Rabbi Moshe Sasonkin told Ynet that IDF officials informed him that Hezbollah had collected information about him, including where he lived and even details about his car. The plans to invade northern Israel were revealed when the IDF targeted a Hezbollah bunker in the village of village of Kfar Kila. In addition to discovering stockpiles of weapons, they found documents describing in detail plans to invade Metula and other communities in northern Israel. In September, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari confirmed that the IDF had eliminated Radwan Force Commander Ibrahim Aqil who had plans to capture the Galilee. Rabbi Sasonkin told the publication Kfar Chabad, 'A senior official revealed to me that after IDF forces entered the village of Kila, they found there, among other things, a document that contained very detailed plans for a massacre similar to October 7, which only by the grace of God did not come to fruition.' He added, 'Among the intelligence information found in the underground bunkers of Hezbollah terrorists, there was a list of the most important people in Metula, and our house also 'deserved' to be marked as a terrorist target. This is a very detailed document, which even accurately describes our vehicle.' Rabbi Sasonkin expressed hope that Israeli evacuees could return to their homes in the north but also described the scale to which Hezbollah was embedded, even in ordinary Lebanese homes right across the border from Israel. He said, 'The village of Kila and in many other Shiite villages and settlements in the vicinity, almost every house, even if it seems like the residence of an 'innocent' family - contained a cache of weapons, including RPG missiles and other deadly weapons.' Rabbi Sasonkin added, 'There is no logical explanation why they did not ultimately carry out the diabolical plan, after that. It was prepared in detail. The only explanation is a great miracle that happened to us and the mercy of God.'

Jerusalem court OKs seizure of $5.5 million in PA funds by relati...	Attorney Asher Stub, whose Justice for Terror Victims NGO helped write the bill on which the request was based, represented the Yaniv family. By JNS The Jerusalem District Court recently approved the seizure of 20 million shekels ($5.5 million) in Palestinian Authority funds by the relatives of slain brothers Hallel and Yagel Yaniv, who were murdered by an Arab terrorist in Samaria almost two years ago, Ynet reported on Tuesday. The suit was filed under the 'Compensation for Terror Victims Law,' passed by the Knesset in March. The law requires courts to award punitive damages of at least 10 million shekels per fatal casualty. To ease the collection of potential punitive awards by victims and their families, court judgments may be enforced against any property of the defendant, including any property seized or frozen by the State of Israel. Under agreements signed with the Palestine Liberation Organization in the 1990s, Israel collects taxes and customs duties on behalf of the P.A. 'Nothing can bring our loved ones back to us, and nothing will put our mind at ease,' Shalom Yaniv, father of the two terror victims, told Ynet. 'At the same time, the move to seize the P.A.’s funds is the beginning of doing justice to us as a family, as well as to the victims of terrorism.' 'This is a just and correct move,' Yaniv continued. 'Every family that was harmed by a terrorist incident should sue to convey the message that those who finance terror will also pay on an economic level. In addition, the State of Israel must engage in the expulsion of terrorists.' Attorney Asher Stub, whose Justice for Terror Victims NGO helped write the bill on which the request was based, represented the Yaniv family. 'The Compensation for Terror Victims Law, which was enacted this year in the Knesset at our initiative, will result in billions of shekels in compensation for the families of terror victims,' stated Stub. 'The Yaniv family’s lawsuit achieves the dual goal of providing adequate compensation to the family and harming the economic infrastructure that finances and encourages terrorist attacks,' the attorney added. Hallel Menachem, 21, and Yagel Yaakov Yaniv, 19, from the Samaria village of Har Bracha, were hit by terrorist gunfire during a traffic jam in the nearby hostile Palestinian community of Huwara on Feb. 26, 2023. The Israel Defense Forces said a terrorist drove to the Einabus junction and opened fire on an Israeli vehicle. The Yaniv brothers were evacuated to the hospital for treatment, where the two were pronounced dead. Under the P.A.’s 'pay for slay' policy, Ramallah disburses monthly stipends to convicted terrorists and the families of slain terrorists. The so-called Martyrs’ Fund is enshrined in P.A. law, granting terrorists or their next of kin the right to receive payments as long as they live. In October, attorneys for some 250 Israelis affected by Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre filed a record-breaking lawsuit against the Palestinian Authority, citing its support for terrorism through pay for slay. The terrorism victims and families of those killed during the Oct. 7 attacks, represented by the Jerusalem-based Arbus, Kedem, Tzur law firm, demanded 1.75 billion shekels ($462 million) in compensation. The claim came on top of a 210 million shekel ($55 million) lawsuit filed some three months earlier with the Jerusalem District Court by dozens of Israelis whose relatives were killed in recent years, including in the ax attack in Elad on Independence Day in 2022 and the Oct. 7 slaughter.

IDF reports it is battling newly recruited Hamas terrorists in Ga...	The source emphasized that there has been a notable decline in the quality of its forces. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News As the IDF has returned to northern Gaza to battle Hamas, Israel's military admits that many of the terrorists they are fighting are new recruits. The aim of the renewed campaign in northern Gaza is to eliminate terrorist infrastructure. Galai Tzahal (IDF Radio) Military correspondent Doron Kadosh reported that many of the Hamas terrorists soldiers are fighting against have been recruited since the war. Officers said the goal of the current operation is to destroy Hamas's infrastructure to make additional missions unnecessary. Kadosh said, 'We are undertaking actions that were not part of previous operations. We are advancing into areas where the IDF will not need to return. This is not a raid; it is a full-scale operation aimed at completely dismantling the enemy and its infrastructure.' He added that although a large number of the terrorists are 'veteran' Hamas members, many have been enlisted recently. The Hamas terror organization has replaced a significant portion of its forces lost in combat with Israel since October 7, according to reports by Israeli media outlets. According to estimates from the Israeli military, the Gaza-based group had around 25,000 fighters in the coastal enclave before the October 7, 2023 invasion of southwestern Israel. Since then, the IDF estimates that between 17,000 and 20,000 Gaza-based terrorists have been killed, the majority of whom were from Hamas. Additionally, thousands have been rendered incapable of fighting due to injuries sustained during the conflict, and Israel has captured many others. Over 4,300 Gazans are currently being held by Israel, including many Hamas operatives. Despite these significant losses, Hamas has reportedly managed to replenish its ranks, according to a report by Israel's Channel 12. Together with the much smaller Palestinian Islamic Jihad organization, the two terror groups now have between 20,000 to 23,000 men under arms in the Gaza Strip, the report said. The source emphasized that regardless of the number terrorists commanded by Hamas before the war or at present, there has been a notable decline in the quality of its forces, with large numbers of untrained teenagers filling Hamas' ranks.

As ceasefire’s end approaches, Israeli officials doubt Lebanon’s ...	Jerusalem remains concerned about the Lebanese Armed Forces’ ability to fill the vacuum left by Hezbollah. By Baruch Yedid, TPS As the end of a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon approaches, Israeli officials are voicing skepticism about Beirut’s ability to enforce the agreement over the long term. A senior Israeli political source told The Press Service of Israel, 'Until January 27th, there is still an eternity in terms of the region. The decision to completely withdraw from Lebanon could be made even 24 hours before the end of the 60 days, and there is still a long process of electing a president in Lebanon, and more developments are expected in Syria. We are keeping the extension of the [Israel Defense Force’s] stay as an option for all intents and purposes.' Under the terms of a two-month ceasefire that went into effect on November 27, Hezbollah is supposed to withdraw its armed presence from areas of southern Lebanon south of the Litani River. Israeli forces will also withdraw from southern Lebanon in stages. The Lebanese Armed Forces is to be deployed in southern Lebanon including along the 120 km border with Israel, as will monitors from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. 'The first phase of the agreement is now a test for Israel and Lebanon. Can the Lebanese army confront Hezbollah and impose the terms of the agreement? If not, what happens after the 60 days?' the Israeli political source told TPS-IL. A second Israeli source familiar with US mediator Amos Hochstein’s efforts told TPS-IL Jerusalem remains concerned about the Lebanese Armed Forces’ ability to fill the vacuum left by Hezbollah. 'We are closely examining what is happening on the ground. If the Lebanese are not sufficiently deployed, then what happens on the 61st day will delay the continued implementation of the ceasefire,' he said. January 9 may be a critical juncture. That’s when Lebanon’s parliament gathers to elect a new president. President Michel Aoun’s six-year term ended in October 2023 and political deadlock has left the position vacant ever since. The election comes as Hezbollah is weakened by war and isolated by the overthrow of Syria’s Iran-backed government. By convention, the Lebanese presidency is held by a Maronite Christian. Hezbollah’s preferred candidate had been Suleiman Frangieh, a former cabinet minister, but Frangieh’s strength was his closeness to now-deposed Syrian President Bashar Assad. If a Hezbollah-backed candidate fails to win, it will lose significant political standing and possibly spur the Iran-backed terror group to return to war. The US, France and Saudi Arabia back Lebanese Army Chief Joseph Aoun. The ceasefire gives Israel the ability to respond to Hezbollah violations of the ceasefire, and Israeli forces have frequently uncovered weapons and terror infrastructure south of the Litani River. But repeated Lebanese accusations of 'Israeli violations have fueled tensions. A Lebanese MTV report suggested the U.S. might propose extending the ceasefire agreement for another 60 days to address these challenges. Meanwhile, Israel’s withdrawal from the town of Naqoura has begun. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.
