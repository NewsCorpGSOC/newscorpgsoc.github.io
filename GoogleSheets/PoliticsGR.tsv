The release of reserve forces and their reintroduction to the labour market will lead to expansion of economic activity, which will be furthermore facilitated with low interest rates.The reception of the ceasefire by the stock market has been overwhelmingly positive; Tel Aviv index rose 5.65% in the last 5 days, climbing to record highs, despite today’s setback.However, the withdrawal of Otzma Yehudit from the government and the uncertainly over continuation of cooperation with Religious Zionism (the party of Smotrich) raises the possibility of elections, which could translate into uncertainty for investors.📝 Walla🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4614	2025-01-20T02:20:06-08:00

This comes after the government abandoned peace talks with the ELN on Friday and has already led to a new wave of civilians fleeing affected areas.The epicentre is the Catatumbo region, a strategic place for drug trafficking because of its proximity to Venezuela, security sources have said. It also has more than 30,000 hectares of cocaine plantations. Venezuela is heavily involved, providing military support and shelter for the ELN in order to control border areas.The ombudsman's office called on all armed groups to allow humanitarian aid and to end all attacks against civilians. As part of the conflict, 516 murders were reported last year, mainly in Catatumbo and the capital Bogotá.📝 El Espectador, El Tiempo, Reuters🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4561	2025-01-19T00:30:35-08:00

Forwarded From Mediterranean Man (Mediterranean Man)I have decided that due to some circumstances, we need new channels to flow into the telegram sphere, and thus, supporting small channels that I personally know would be a good idea, here are such channels that I recommend that you follow them and support.1) https://t.me/tabzlive , an up-to-date news aggregator on ongoing conflicts and political affairs, mostly in Europe and North America, I recommend him if you want to keep up with the general updates in these two regions.2) https://t.me/czaktuality , the name of the channel is literally News from the Middle East, and this is what it specializes in - News from the Middle East, I can say with full confidence that it is legitimately accurate and one of the best neutral sources out there, the admin simply wishes to relay the facts without much bias or personal input, which is commendable, I sincerely recommend him.3) https://t.me/Journalyze , a channel specializing in Middle Eastern and Indian Subcontinent affairs (India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh), alongside other ill-reported conflicts such as Burma, and other international news, although that is not its specialty, I recommend it if you wish to keep to up to date with the events going on in Asia.4) https://t.me/GeoPWatch , a channel specializing in Palestinian affairs specifically and international events in general, they also shine a light in forgotten conflicts in Africa and Asia, and keep up with the relevant political affairs in the Northern Hemisphere, they are factual, and therefore I recommend them.5) https://t.me/Warfront_Lens , A channel specializing in Kashmiri affairs, Indian news, and keeping on track with news involving extremist organizations and terrorists that are currently across warzones in Asia and Africa, I recommend them. 6) https://t.me/YTHBR A Turkish channel, in Turkish - fear not, for Durov, in his infinite wisdom, gave us a translation option - it posts in Turkish affairs from a Turkish perspective and mostly specializes in Central Asia and the Middle East from said perspective, so when you join in - just now what you are subscribing for.7) https://t.me/PoliticsGR - In return, a Greek channel - however, it is in English, it mostly specializes in relaying factual coverage in Middle Eastern and Eastern Mediterranean Affairs, however, it also reports on international events and political affairs, therefore, I also recommend it, he is a great guy.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4538	2025-01-18T06:30:06-08:00

Through Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Netanyahu has been forced to accept compromises. While the Israeli PM had been pushing for a temporary ceasefire that only related to the first phase of the three-stage proposal Israel submitted last May, the final agreement is increasingly closer to the original offer, with clauses connecting the first phase with the two others. This will make it harder for Israel to resume fighting once the initial stage goes into place. It’s also rumoured that Israel will agree to withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor during the first phase, even though most officials deny it up to date.This evening Netanyahu is meeting with national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who is the most fierce opponent of a deal. Tomorrow is the next top level meeting in Doha.📝 Haaretz, The Guardian, Times of Israel 🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4463	2025-01-13T11:30:06-08:00

However, analysts at Citi believe that bond prices are affected by concerns about the viability of the UK’s funding plan, as the government plans to sell more bonds this year in order to back up its debt. In either case, if borrowing costs continue to rise this will result to spending cuts in public services.📝 BBC, Reuters🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4429	2025-01-09T07:15:55-08:00

An absolute majority is required in subsequent rounds. According to the constitution, the president must be a Maronite Christian.⚖️ Most parties are likely to endorse Aoun, with the position of Hezbollah, Amal and FPM being uncertain after Frangieh’s withdrawal.🌍 The election has garnered significant interest from international actors:🇫🇷 France has endorsed Aoun through Macron’s envoy to Lebanon Jean-Yves Le Drian.🇮🇷 Iran hasn’t endorsed any candidate, but will likely negotiate with the eventual winner to continue providing its support for Hezbollah.🇸🇦 Saudi Arabia has endorsed Aoun, preparing to invest millions of dollars if he gains power.🇸🇾 Syria’s new ruler Ahmed Al Sharaa said that Damascus will no longer interfere in Lebanese political procedures.🇺🇸 The United States reiterated its support for Aoun in a meeting in Riyadh, saying it’s the best opportunity to sideline Hezbollah.🕚 The vote will take place at 11:00 AM local time.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4402	2025-01-09T00:00:24-08:00

But instead of expressing a general viewpoint, she particularly focused on the repercussions for LGBT and minority communities.Interestingly, Thorning-Schmidt is a former PM of Denmark. The oversight board was established by Nick Clegg, a former LibDem politician in the UK, who governed in coalition with the Tories and served as deputy PM from 2010 to 2015.

Mangoush, who is currently suspended, addressed the longstanding controversy surrounding the incident for the first time.➡️The initial unconfirmed reports in 2023 ignited widespread outrage across Libya, sparking public protests and fierce criticism. The uproar eventually led to Mangoush’s suspension from her ministerial post and her subsequent flight from the country, where she remains in exile to this day.➡️In the interview, Mangoush revealed details of the meeting, stating that it was not an individual initiative but had been authorized and orchestrated by the GNU, under the leadership of Abdel Hamid Dabaiba and Sadiq Al-Ghariani. Her disclosure has reignited anger among the Libyan public, who view the meeting as a betrayal of national and cultural values.➡️In light of these revelations, public frustration with the GNU has escalated. Many Libyans are now demanding the government’s resignation, accusing it of collusion in the controversial meeting. Calls for the overthrow of the GNU reflect growing discontent and highlight the deep divisions within the country’s political landscape.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4377	2025-01-07T11:28:46-08:00

Before that, he served in various ministerial positions, notably the Ministry of National Economy between 1985 and 1987, in which his austerity program caused dissatisfaction with the party majority, leading Papandreou to abolish it and fire Simitis.Under his premiership, annual inflation was brought down from 15% to about 3% and multiple infrastructure projects were constructed, even though most of them were delivered later than promised (Eleftherios Venizelos airport, Athens metro, Rio-Antirrio bridge). The developments correlated with Athens hosting the summer Olympics in 2004. Nevertheless, Simitis is criticised for the handling of the Imia crisis in 1996, the Greek stock market crash of 1999 and for manipulating statistical numbers.📝 Kathimerini, Naftemporiki🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4352	2025-01-05T02:30:16-08:00
