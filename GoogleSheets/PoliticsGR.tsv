The sarcophagus was partially buried at a depth of 1.5 to 2 metres and has a raised lid with a pitched roof.According to the archaeologists, the historical sources and proximity of the sarcophagus to the church lends weight to the theory that this could be his original tomb. -This could be a significant archaeological confirmation of historical sources regarding the burial place of St. Nicholas,- Findik commented.📝Heritage Daily🗺️@PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/3937	2024-12-11T03:06:22-08:00

This marks the largest international investment in Russia since the start of the conflict, signaling not only the return of foreign investments but also the political will of BRICS member countries.
