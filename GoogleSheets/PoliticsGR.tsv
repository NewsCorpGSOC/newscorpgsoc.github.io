If you look at their graph, you'll see that while Muslims are not near that in the same period, outside of it, they are listed just below, with their mentions sometimes slightly lower and, at other times, even higher.➡️ They essentially conclude that the phrase is used to -manipulate well-meaning faithful Christians into having their beliefs tethered to psychopaths.-📝It's important to note that the claim of it being -hateful- and -antisemitic- stems largely from its use by controversial figures with extreme views. Additionally, not all posts in the survey are -hateful-; many merely include the phrase -Christ is King.-@TabZLIVE	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/5864	2025-03-15T09:24:49-07:00

Key leaders included Saad Hariri (Rafik Hariri's son), Walid Jumblatt of the Progressive Socialist Party, and Samir Geagea of the Lebanese Forces. These leaders, mainly from Sunni and Christian communities, pushed for Lebanese sovereignty.In contrast, Hezbollah and the Amal Movement opposed the movement. These groups, primarily Shiite and closely aligned with Syria and Iran, supported Syria’s presence in Lebanon, viewing it as essential for national stability and security. Their position led to a deep political division within the country.Ultimately, the March 14 Alliance succeeded, pressuring Syria to withdraw its forces from Lebanon by April 14, 2005.🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/5830	2025-03-14T13:02:11-07:00

Forwarded From TabZ - Alternative Media (TabZ)🇬🇱⚡️ Greenland’s center-right opposition, Demokraatit, secured a surprising victory in the election... but what are their key goals?Demokraatit, regarded as the sister party of the Liberal Alliance in Greenland, strives for policies that include lowering taxes, cutting red tape, and reducing the size of the public sector.The party believes that easing the financial burdens on entrepreneurs and business owners should make launching and operating a business more affordable. Importantly, these tax reductions are designed to especially favor low- and middle-income citizens.Demokraatit also stresses the central role of the family in shaping individuals, though it acknowledges that sometimes alternative solutions must be sought when the family unit fails to provide adequate support. They advocate for an effective system to detect and address cases of neglect.Like nearly every party in Greenland except one, Demokraatit sees achieving independence as essential. The party is ready to engage in serious negotiations with Denmark on a step-by-step -roadmap for independence,- insisting that every political decision should move Greenland closer to this goal. Before full secession can occur, the party believes it is crucial to significantly bolster Greenland’s economy, reclaim certain areas from Danish control to enhance self-determination, and elevate educational standards, viewing education as the bedrock of a strong welfare state and a necessary component for eventual independence.Regarding the United States, Demokraatit makes it abundantly clear that Greenland is NOT for sale, NOT now, NOT in the future, and certainly NOT under any circumstances. They reject proposals like Donald Trump’s, stating that treating their country as a commodity shows profound disrespect for Greenlandic values.Nonetheless, the party is open to working with the US, especially since the nation maintains the Pituffik/Thule military base on Greenland. They see the United States as the only viable partner apart from Denmark and believe it is essential to establish a sincere, respectful dialogue that could eventually lead to cooperation or even negotiations on how the US might support Greenland’s journey towards full independence.Demokraatit is expected to negotiate a coalition, potentially partnering with the pro-independence Naleraq, which favors a faster path to sovereignty, or the more moderate Inuit Ataqatigiit, to secure the 16-seat majority needed for governance.At the heart of the party’s leadership is 33-year-old Jens-Frederik Nielsen, described among many people as -a leader who has really grown into the role.-@TabZLIVE	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/5786	2025-03-12T04:55:06-07:00

Many of the findings remain classified.The security service says a broader investigation is needed, a likely hint at the perceived need for a state commission of inquiry, which Netanyahu has refused to establish.📝 Times of Israel🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/5514	2025-03-04T10:43:00-08:00

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Olga Stefanishyna confirmed negotiations were nearing completion, calling it a long-term commitment.➡️ The draft agreement establishes a U.S.-Ukraine -Reconstruction Investment Fund- to boost Ukraine’s economy, focusing on mining, ports, and infrastructure. The U.S. pledges long-term financial support but aims to recover some costs related to Ukraine’s defense and reconstruction.➡️ Initially, Zelensky rejected a U.S. demand for $500 billion from Ukraine’s mineral projects, arguing it far exceeded U.S. contributions. The revised deal requires Ukraine to contribute $500 billion to the fund, twice the U.S. amount, without direct payments to Washington. It also allocates 50% of Ukraine’s revenue from minerals, oil, and gas to the fund, including resources in Russian-occupied territories if retaken.➡️ The draft lacks a firm U.S. military commitment but affirms support for Ukraine’s sovereignty. Final details will be coordinated by the U.S. Treasury and Commerce Departments alongside Ukraine’s Economy Ministry.

Only 26% answer positively to the same question today.🔸Over 50% of the voters espouse beliefs that the SPD cares more about citizen subsidies instead of the hard-working, has ruled long enough and should go back to opposition and neglects the interests of workers.🔸Olaf Scholz enjoys only 18% of public trust, the lowest percentage for an SPD politician and around half of his support in 2021. 🔸 Defence minister Boris Pistorius is slightly more popular among his party base and would additionally constitute a good chancellor pick for many Grüne and CDU voters, as shown by the evident increases in support.📝 Das Erste🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/5293	2025-02-23T10:25:06-08:00

Meanwhile, FDP has completely collapsed and will likely miss the electoral threshold of 5% for the second time since 2013.Linke has made a significant comeback in recent weeks, surpassing 7% after years due to its anti-war and anti-Trump stances.

Forwarded From Middle East Spectator – MES— 🇱🇧 🇵🇸 ☦️ A message by Archbishop Atallah Hannah, Archbishop of Sebastia, from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, on the funeral of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah:'Dear friends, in just a few days, Lebanon will witness a great and exceptional event: the funeral of His Eminence, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and the martyrs who stood with him. We, from Jerusalem, stand in reverence and honor for the sacrifices made by Sayyed Hassan and his companions, those who stood with Palestine, defended it, and paid a heavy price for it. We are loyal to these sacrifices. All Palestinians are loyal to the sacrifices of Sayyed Hassan and his comrades.While we send our condolences from the heart of our holy city, we want to express that we will never forget those who stood with Palestine and defended it during the most difficult times and under the harshest conditions. Today, the Palestinian cause is being conspired against. Our enemies seek to displace our people and erase our cause. But the Palestinians will never raise the flag of surrender. We hold firmly to our rights, our principles, and our constants. The word 'surrender' has no place in our Palestinian dictionary.Dear friends, we are all one family, one nation, facing the colonial projects that do not only target Palestine but the entire nation. Our message has always been, and will continue to be, that Palestine is the compass. Whoever’s compass is Palestine is in the right place, and whoever’s compass points elsewhere is in the wrong place. We urge them to correct their course and set their compass in the right direction.Our dear friends, our message today is that we, as a community, must remain united, Christians and Muslims, across all sects and denominations. They want us to be fragmented, divided. They want us to speak the language of sectarianism. They want us divided so they can implement their projects, following the well-known adage 'divide and conquer.' They want to divide us so they can push forward their colonial projects that target Palestine and the entire nation.We will remain Christians and Muslims in this region, one nation, with our compass pointing to Jerusalem, and our cause being Palestine. We must not allow anyone, or any entity, to push projects aimed at further division and fragmentation. We are one family, and that is how we have been, and how we will always remain.'@Middle_East_Spectator	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/5191	2025-02-20T10:40:02-08:00

However, a quick research on the contract’s address shows most of the tokens are held by one or a network of connected addresses.🔸 Promote it across social media saying it will promote public interest (citizen freedom, domestic growth etc).🔸 Shills fall for the scam, spend thousands on the coin in the hope of becoming rich overnight.🔸 Insiders pull out their money, the coin gets rug pulled. Everyone else loses his money and complains on Twitter.What started as ordinary corruption has expanded to new means of finance, with the results being the same; politicians getting rich off ordinary people.
