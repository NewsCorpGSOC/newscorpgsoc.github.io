The result prompted domestic incentives to revive Berlin’s economy and European meetings to increase defence meetings.

Many of the findings remain classified.The security service says a broader investigation is needed, a likely hint at the perceived need for a state commission of inquiry, which Netanyahu has refused to establish.📝 Times of Israel🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/5514	2025-03-04T10:43:00-08:00

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Olga Stefanishyna confirmed negotiations were nearing completion, calling it a long-term commitment.➡️ The draft agreement establishes a U.S.-Ukraine -Reconstruction Investment Fund- to boost Ukraine’s economy, focusing on mining, ports, and infrastructure. The U.S. pledges long-term financial support but aims to recover some costs related to Ukraine’s defense and reconstruction.➡️ Initially, Zelensky rejected a U.S. demand for $500 billion from Ukraine’s mineral projects, arguing it far exceeded U.S. contributions. The revised deal requires Ukraine to contribute $500 billion to the fund, twice the U.S. amount, without direct payments to Washington. It also allocates 50% of Ukraine’s revenue from minerals, oil, and gas to the fund, including resources in Russian-occupied territories if retaken.➡️ The draft lacks a firm U.S. military commitment but affirms support for Ukraine’s sovereignty.

Only 26% answer positively to the same question today.🔸Over 50% of the voters espouse beliefs that the SPD cares more about citizen subsidies instead of the hard-working, has ruled long enough and should go back to opposition and neglects the interests of workers.🔸Olaf Scholz enjoys only 18% of public trust, the lowest percentage for an SPD politician and around half of his support in 2021. 🔸 Defence minister Boris Pistorius is slightly more popular among his party base and would additionally constitute a good chancellor pick for many Grüne and CDU voters, as shown by the evident increases in support.📝 Das Erste🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/5293	2025-02-23T10:25:06-08:00

Meanwhile, FDP has completely collapsed and will likely miss the electoral threshold of 5% for the second time since 2013.Linke has made a significant comeback in recent weeks, surpassing 7% after years due to its anti-war and anti-Trump stances. On the other hand, left wing conservative BSW, which made the headlines in East German state elections, polls around 5%.📝 DAWUM, Freie Presse🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/5244	2025-02-22T04:50:06-08:00

Forwarded From Middle East Spectator – MES— 🇱🇧 🇵🇸 ☦️ A message by Archbishop Atallah Hannah, Archbishop of Sebastia, from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, on the funeral of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah:'Dear friends, in just a few days, Lebanon will witness a great and exceptional event: the funeral of His Eminence, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and the martyrs who stood with him. We, from Jerusalem, stand in reverence and honor for the sacrifices made by Sayyed Hassan and his companions, those who stood with Palestine, defended it, and paid a heavy price for it. We are loyal to these sacrifices. All Palestinians are loyal to the sacrifices of Sayyed Hassan and his comrades.While we send our condolences from the heart of our holy city, we want to express that we will never forget those who stood with Palestine and defended it during the most difficult times and under the harshest conditions. Today, the Palestinian cause is being conspired against. Our enemies seek to displace our people and erase our cause. But the Palestinians will never raise the flag of surrender. We hold firmly to our rights, our principles, and our constants. The word 'surrender' has no place in our Palestinian dictionary.Dear friends, we are all one family, one nation, facing the colonial projects that do not only target Palestine but the entire nation. Our message has always been, and will continue to be, that Palestine is the compass. Whoever’s compass is Palestine is in the right place, and whoever’s compass points elsewhere is in the wrong place. We urge them to correct their course and set their compass in the right direction.Our dear friends, our message today is that we, as a community, must remain united, Christians and Muslims, across all sects and denominations. They want us to be fragmented, divided. They want us to speak the language of sectarianism. They want us divided so they can implement their projects, following the well-known adage 'divide and conquer.' They want to divide us so they can push forward their colonial projects that target Palestine and the entire nation.We will remain Christians and Muslims in this region, one nation, with our compass pointing to Jerusalem, and our cause being Palestine. We must not allow anyone, or any entity, to push projects aimed at further division and fragmentation. We are one family, and that is how we have been, and how we will always remain.'@Middle_East_Spectator	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/5191	2025-02-20T10:40:02-08:00

PoliticsGR - Geopolitics, Intel, News, Statistics: 💬 @PoliticsGR Commentary:🇺🇸🇦🇷 So we got a new strategy to enrich politicians:🔸 Create a meme coin using a simplistic smart contract.🔸 Publish tokenomics with very vague distribution quota, most of the coin reserves go to -community development- or -public growth- and the rest are used for liquidity. However, a quick research on the contract’s address shows most of the tokens are held by one or a network of connected addresses.🔸 Promote it across social media saying it will promote public interest (citizen freedom, domestic growth etc).🔸 Shills fall for the scam, spend thousands on the coin in the hope of becoming rich overnight.🔸 Insiders pull out their money, the coin gets rug pulled. Everyone else loses his money and complains on Twitter.What started as ordinary corruption has expanded to new means of finance, with the results being the same; politicians getting rich off ordinary people.

This is the reason we have been looking for additional admins, so you are still able to apply. I would also like you to suggest topics to cover in graphics and maps. In terms of maps, we could publish historical maps (the Byzantine Empire for instance), war maps (please don’t ask a wide Ukraine map, it would be a nightmare), maps about other topics etc. In terms of graphics you are already aware of our prowess at financial and political developments.Let me know your topics of interest in the comments.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/5129	2025-02-16T07:20:06-08:00

The $LIBRA token is linked to KIP Protocol, a Web3 framework for AI, with partnerships involving national governance. According to its tokenomics, at least 50% of the reserves would go to stimulate growth. However, research on Bubblemaps revealed that 82% of the supply was held at a few connected wallets, raising suspicions about price manipulation.Eventually, the coin’s launch turned into a disaster after insiders cashed out over $107 million, wiping out nearly 94% of the token’s value within hours.📝 CoinTelegraph, CryptoBriefing🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/5119	2025-02-15T11:40:06-08:00
