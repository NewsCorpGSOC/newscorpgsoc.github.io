PoliticsGR - Geopolitics, Intel, News, Statistics: 💬 @PoliticsGR Commentary:🇺🇸🇦🇷 So we got a new strategy to enrich politicians:🔸 Create a meme coin using a simplistic smart contract.🔸 Publish tokenomics with very vague distribution quota, most of the coin reserves go to -community development- or -public growth- and the rest are used for liquidity. However, a quick research on the contract’s address shows most of the tokens are held by one or a network of connected addresses.🔸 Promote it across social media saying it will promote public interest (citizen freedom, domestic growth etc).🔸 Shills fall for the scam, spend thousands on the coin in the hope of becoming rich overnight.🔸 Insiders pull out their money, the coin gets rug pulled. Everyone else loses his money and complains on Twitter.What started as ordinary corruption has expanded to new means of finance, with the results being the same; politicians getting rich off ordinary people. And it’s ludicrous how mostly conservatives fall for it since they are the same to oppose CBDCs.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/5156	2025-02-18T08:50:07-08:00

The oil refinery in the city has been hit at least by 10 drones and is in flames. The Novo-Ryazan Thermal Power Station was also successfully hit by Ukrainian drones. Ukrainian channels… 💬 @PoliticsGR Commentary:🇺🇦🇷🇺 I personally don’t publish evolutions from the Russo-Ukrainian war anymore for a reason; the situation on the front is clearly a stalemate (clashes in Donetsk villages, siege of Pokrovsk, Russians are 4.5 kilometres from Dnipropetrovsk oblast and still don’t go in, Ukrainians conduct a counteroffensive in Kursk in an attempt to maintain their positions and fail). However, a topic I haven’t seen mentioned a lot in Telegram channels is drone warfare, and it’s where Ukrainians have a significant competitive edge, enabling them to deal constant damage to Russian energy and military facilities.To conduct a thorough analysis, we need to compare the aerial weapons employed in long-range attacks. Moscow predominantly relies on the Shahed 136 drone (also referred to as Geran-2), a -kamikaze drone- that is utilised alongside ballistic and cruise missiles. Locally-produced variants usually range from below $20,000 to $50,000, while drones exported from Iran are estimated at about $190,000 after a negotiated settlement. Even though Geran-2 remains a lethal weapon and is used frequently, it alone is not sufficient to conduct a sophisticated strike. Coupled with the high cost of missiles, with Kinzhals ranging up to $13 million, the Kremlin needs to cover significant expenses to plan a attack. The only field in which Russia was able to develop cost-effective drones was in reconnaissance operations, which are capable of detecting enemy defences in order to destroy them.On the other hand, Ukraine possesses a diversified drone stack, employing it in both direct combat and long-range attacks. Obviously the main milestone is the minimisation of costs in FPV drones, which accelerated production and usage in the battlefield. However, it has also improved its long-range arsenal, with notable examples being UJ-22, UJ-26 and An-196 Lyutyy and the second drone costing only about $100,000 per piece. Nevertheless, latest power struggles and corruption in government drone procurements could pose a threat to the buildup.In modern wars, military supremacy alone cannot win wars; the battlefield requires a consistent flow of cutting-edge technology, which should gradually become cheaper by reducing marginal costs. I believe we could draw parallels to the strategies used by non-state actors, such as Ansarullah and HTS taking into account they both developed cheaper drone models to offset enemies relying on more expensive technology.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4710	2025-01-24T08:30:47-08:00

Forwarded From ShamS⚡️🇸🇾🇷🇺 Cancellation of Investment Contract with Russia in Tartus Unrelated to Military Bases Syria has annulled its investment contract with Russia in Tartus due to the inability of the Russian company to fulfill its obligations, according to Alexei Chepa, the First Deputy Chairman of the Russian State Duma’s International Affairs Committee.Chepa attributed the collapse of the agreement to Moscow’s assumption of responsibility for civilian maintenance at the port. However, with a sharp reduction in Moscow’s presence, fulfilling these obligations has become increasingly difficult. He emphasized that this matter should not be linked to Russia’s military bases, as the two are distinctly separate issues.❗️Cancellation of investment contract will have no negative impact Russian-Syrian relations. According to Asharq Al-Awsat, a high-level Russian delegation is likely to visit Damascus in the near future. Discussions regarding the timing and arrangements for this visit are currently underway.Telegram | X	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4706	2025-01-24T06:25:45-08:00
