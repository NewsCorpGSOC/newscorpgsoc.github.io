So I took the chance to do a quick research about the diaspora’s financial impact on the country. As many already know, Moldova is among the European countries in which remittances account to a high percentage of the GDP, only behind Georgia according to the World Bank. In 2006, remittances accounted for as high as 34.5% of the sum, while a survey in 2007 indicated that 41% of them were from Russia. Another research in 2013 showed that Russia remained at the top, although academics argued that Russia wasn’t the primary country of remittances before 2008, which contradicts the EBRD survey. A later assessment by BNM (national bank) in 2020 showed that transfers from the CIS countries declined significantly and Europe took their position. Since then, remittances as percentage of GDP have declined, standing at 12.2% in 2023.All in all, I believe it’s legitimate that the diaspora votes in Moldova if it sends so much money to the country, money which is essential for the existence of many families. Additionally, the same criteria should be applied to all eligible voters, independent of whether they live in Moscow or Rome.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/3075	2024-11-04T11:15:06-08:00

So far, only 31 out of 231 diaspora centres have counted their votes.Although the country has proven to be divided over the country’s future orientation, and this is obvious from closer than expected results, it can still be a victory from the aspect of pro-Europeans, since a win is a win even if marginal. However, a potential resurgence of Eurosceptic forces could still happen in the 2025 parliamentary elections, where a political crisis would occur if the election was won by PSRM. There have been similar cases during the 2010s.All in all, it depends on the government’s ability to continue its European ascension path and convince the population about its potential.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/3054	2024-11-03T12:55:34-08:00

And there are stark differences compared to Moldova.Moldova is led by a pro-European government and since 2022 it has outlawed media perceived to be pro-Russian (Canal 2, Prime), thus stripping the opposition of media voices. This allowed Sandu to accuse Russia of interfering last Sunday in order to influence the result.Georgia, on the other hand, has various types of media, each of them promoting its own narrative. The government ones (Imedi TV, Rustavi 2) are promoting polls by GORBI, which show Georgian Dream at a safe position, while opposition media (Formula TV, Mtavari TV) publish polls that show the opposition being able to govern. This could explain the incidents of violence and attempted vote rigging we saw today.By the way, the electoral commission has yet to publish an official vote count.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/2750	2024-10-26T09:35:35-07:00

As well as OSF, Compact is Funded by Peter Thiel, and JD Vance mentor Thomas Klingenstein. Attendees told Vanity Fair -The tension in London was palpable- and -It was weird to me the whole f***ing time-.It’s possible this may be the beginning of larger OSF effort funding certain conservative outlets to combat the rise of Anti-Semitism and other more ‘extreme’ ideologies on the right.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/2729	2024-10-26T02:02:11-07:00

It should be noted that most candidates are pro-European and many prominent Eurosceptic figures have been rejected or declined to run (Bolea, Dodon). Some pro-European candidates have also been rejected (Munteanu, Pleșca).📊 Latest polls indicate a Sandu lead, although polls vary significantly and the percentage of undecided is higher than any candidate:🗳 Sandu: 29-35%🗳 Stoianoglo: 9-12%🗳 Usatîi: 6-11%🗳 Vlah: 3-6%🗳 Tarlev: 2-6%🗳 Chicu: 1-3%🗳 Turnout must be at least 33% so that the election can be declared valid. If a candidate obtains over 50% of the vote, he wins the election, otherwise a second round will be held.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/2507	2024-10-20T00:00:26-07:00

There is additionally a high percentage of undecided, ranging from 5.5% to around 15%.🗳 Polls will remain open until 19:00 Athens time. The winner will assume PASOK leadership.💬 Disclaimer; I have no affiliation with PASOK or any other party in Greece, but since it’s a political event of the country I think it should be covered. As for the election, I don’t think any of the next leaders can pose a threat to the current government unless it absorbs the electoral base of SYRIZA and reaches out to current ND voters.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/2256	2024-10-13T01:00:29-07:00

It should be noted that both he and Diamantopoulou have more centrist views, Doukas campaigned on a slightly more left wing platform, while the rest have no special ideological distinction.Regarding the second round, I believe Androulakis will likely win, since Doukas has already an important office as the mayor of Athens and I don’t think he can handle both positions at the same time. As for PASOK future prospects, it depends on its new leader.🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/2081	2024-10-07T11:01:16-07:00

While people have different views on whether Hamas succeeded or failed (based on who they support), everyone can agree that it increased the visibility of the Palestinian statehood issue and changed the course of Middle Eastern politics, leading to new generations of hardliners from both sides.Due to the anniversary, we are going to run some polls.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/2066	2024-10-07T01:45:06-07:00
