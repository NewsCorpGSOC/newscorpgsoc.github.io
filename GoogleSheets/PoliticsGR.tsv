The Texas Republican is a former federal prosecutor who emerged as a fierce Trump defender while serving as a congressman during Trump’s first impeachment.At his Senate hearing last week, Ratcliffe said the CIA must do better when it comes to using technology such as artificial intelligence to confront adversaries including Russia and China. He said the United States needed to improve its intelligence capabilities while also ensuring the protection of Americans’ civil rights.-We’re not where we’re supposed to be,- Ratcliffe told members of the Senate Intelligence Committee.📝 AP🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4723	2025-01-25T08:17:31-08:00

The oil refinery in the city has been hit at least by 10 drones and is in flames. The Novo-Ryazan Thermal Power Station was also successfully hit by Ukrainian drones. Ukrainian channels… 💬 @PoliticsGR Commentary:🇺🇦🇷🇺 I personally don’t publish evolutions from the Russo-Ukrainian war anymore for a reason; the situation on the front is clearly a stalemate (clashes in Donetsk villages, siege of Pokrovsk, Russians are 4.5 kilometres from Dnipropetrovsk oblast and still don’t go in, Ukrainians conduct a counteroffensive in Kursk in an attempt to maintain their positions and fail). However, a topic I haven’t seen mentioned a lot in Telegram channels is drone warfare, and it’s where Ukrainians have a significant competitive edge, enabling them to deal constant damage to Russian energy and military facilities.To conduct a thorough analysis, we need to compare the aerial weapons employed in long-range attacks. Moscow predominantly relies on the Shahed 136 drone (also referred to as Geran-2), a -kamikaze drone- that is utilised alongside ballistic and cruise missiles. Locally-produced variants usually range from below $20,000 to $50,000, while drones exported from Iran are estimated at about $190,000 after a negotiated settlement. Even though Geran-2 remains a lethal weapon and is used frequently, it alone is not sufficient to conduct a sophisticated strike. Coupled with the high cost of missiles, with Kinzhals ranging up to $13 million, the Kremlin needs to cover significant expenses to plan a attack. The only field in which Russia was able to develop cost-effective drones was in reconnaissance operations, which are capable of detecting enemy defences in order to destroy them.On the other hand, Ukraine possesses a diversified drone stack, employing it in both direct combat and long-range attacks. Obviously the main milestone is the minimisation of costs in FPV drones, which accelerated production and usage in the battlefield. However, it has also improved its long-range arsenal, with notable examples being UJ-22, UJ-26 and An-196 Lyutyy and the second drone costing only about $100,000 per piece. Nevertheless, latest power struggles and corruption in government drone procurements could pose a threat to the buildup.In modern wars, military supremacy alone cannot win wars; the battlefield requires a consistent flow of cutting-edge technology, which should gradually become cheaper by reducing marginal costs. I believe we could draw parallels to the strategies used by non-state actors, such as Ansarullah and HTS taking into account they both developed cheaper drone models to offset enemies relying on more expensive technology.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4710	2025-01-24T08:30:47-08:00

Forwarded From ShamS⚡️🇸🇾🇷🇺 Cancellation of Investment Contract with Russia in Tartus Unrelated to Military Bases Syria has annulled its investment contract with Russia in Tartus due to the inability of the Russian company to fulfill its obligations, according to Alexei Chepa, the First Deputy Chairman of the Russian State Duma’s International Affairs Committee.Chepa attributed the collapse of the agreement to Moscow’s assumption of responsibility for civilian maintenance at the port. However, with a sharp reduction in Moscow’s presence, fulfilling these obligations has become increasingly difficult. He emphasized that this matter should not be linked to Russia’s military bases, as the two are distinctly separate issues.❗️Cancellation of investment contract will have no negative impact Russian-Syrian relations.

The release of reserve forces and their reintroduction to the labour market will lead to expansion of economic activity, which will be furthermore facilitated with low interest rates.The reception of the ceasefire by the stock market has been overwhelmingly positive; Tel Aviv index rose 5.65% in the last 5 days, climbing to record highs, despite today’s setback.However, the withdrawal of Otzma Yehudit from the government and the uncertainly over continuation of cooperation with Religious Zionism (the party of Smotrich) raises the possibility of elections, which could translate into uncertainty for investors.📝 Walla🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4614	2025-01-20T02:20:06-08:00

This comes after the government abandoned peace talks with the ELN on Friday and has already led to a new wave of civilians fleeing affected areas.The epicentre is the Catatumbo region, a strategic place for drug trafficking because of its proximity to Venezuela, security sources have said. It also has more than 30,000 hectares of cocaine plantations. Venezuela is heavily involved, providing military support and shelter for the ELN in order to control border areas.The ombudsman's office called on all armed groups to allow humanitarian aid and to end all attacks against civilians. As part of the conflict, 516 murders were reported last year, mainly in Catatumbo and the capital Bogotá.📝 El Espectador, El Tiempo, Reuters🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4561	2025-01-19T00:30:35-08:00

Through Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Netanyahu has been forced to accept compromises. While the Israeli PM had been pushing for a temporary ceasefire that only related to the first phase of the three-stage proposal Israel submitted last May, the final agreement is increasingly closer to the original offer, with clauses connecting the first phase with the two others. This will make it harder for Israel to resume fighting once the initial stage goes into place. It’s also rumoured that Israel will agree to withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor during the first phase, even though most officials deny it up to date.This evening Netanyahu is meeting with national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who is the most fierce opponent of a deal. Tomorrow is the next top level meeting in Doha.📝 Haaretz, The Guardian, Times of Israel 🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4463	2025-01-13T11:30:06-08:00

However, analysts at Citi believe that bond prices are affected by concerns about the viability of the UK’s funding plan, as the government plans to sell more bonds this year in order to back up its debt.

An absolute majority is required in subsequent rounds. According to the constitution, the president must be a Maronite Christian.⚖️ Most parties are likely to endorse Aoun, with the position of Hezbollah, Amal and FPM being uncertain after Frangieh’s withdrawal.🌍 The election has garnered significant interest from international actors:🇫🇷 France has endorsed Aoun through Macron’s envoy to Lebanon Jean-Yves Le Drian.🇮🇷 Iran hasn’t endorsed any candidate, but will likely negotiate with the eventual winner to continue providing its support for Hezbollah.🇸🇦 Saudi Arabia has endorsed Aoun, preparing to invest millions of dollars if he gains power.🇸🇾 Syria’s new ruler Ahmed Al Sharaa said that Damascus will no longer interfere in Lebanese political procedures.🇺🇸 The United States reiterated its support for Aoun in a meeting in Riyadh, saying it’s the best opportunity to sideline Hezbollah.🕚 The vote will take place at 11:00 AM local time.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4402	2025-01-09T00:00:24-08:00

But instead of expressing a general viewpoint, she particularly focused on the repercussions for LGBT and minority communities.Interestingly, Thorning-Schmidt is a former PM of Denmark. The oversight board was established by Nick Clegg, a former LibDem politician in the UK, who governed in coalition with the Tories and served as deputy PM from 2010 to 2015.

Mangoush, who is currently suspended, addressed the longstanding controversy surrounding the incident for the first time.➡️The initial unconfirmed reports in 2023 ignited widespread outrage across Libya, sparking public protests and fierce criticism. The uproar eventually led to Mangoush’s suspension from her ministerial post and her subsequent flight from the country, where she remains in exile to this day.➡️In the interview, Mangoush revealed details of the meeting, stating that it was not an individual initiative but had been authorized and orchestrated by the GNU, under the leadership of Abdel Hamid Dabaiba and Sadiq Al-Ghariani. Her disclosure has reignited anger among the Libyan public, who view the meeting as a betrayal of national and cultural values.➡️In light of these revelations, public frustration with the GNU has escalated. Many Libyans are now demanding the government’s resignation, accusing it of collusion in the controversial meeting. Calls for the overthrow of the GNU reflect growing discontent and highlight the deep divisions within the country’s political landscape.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4377	2025-01-07T11:28:46-08:00

Before that, he served in various ministerial positions, notably the Ministry of National Economy between 1985 and 1987, in which his austerity program caused dissatisfaction with the party majority, leading Papandreou to abolish it and fire Simitis.Under his premiership, annual inflation was brought down from 15% to about 3% and multiple infrastructure projects were constructed, even though most of them were delivered later than promised (Eleftherios Venizelos airport, Athens metro, Rio-Antirrio bridge). The developments correlated with Athens hosting the summer Olympics in 2004. Nevertheless, Simitis is criticised for the handling of the Imia crisis in 1996, the Greek stock market crash of 1999 and for manipulating statistical numbers.📝 Kathimerini, Naftemporiki🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4352	2025-01-05T02:30:16-08:00
