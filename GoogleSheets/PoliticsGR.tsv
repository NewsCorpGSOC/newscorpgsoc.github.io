Polymarket suggested the raid may be a politically motivated response to users betting in favor of Donald Trump in the recent election. Before the election, the platform displayed high odds for Trump, countering mainstream polls that favored Kamala Harris.The Department of Justice has opened an investigation, reportedly focusing on Polymarket’s potential facilitation of U.S. bets. Polymarket calls itself a transparent prediction market designed to help people understand major events, including elections.Prominent tech figures, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Elon Musk, criticized the raid. Armstrong claimed the incident would strengthen Polymarket, while Musk commented, -This seems messed up.- Coplan, a known Trump supporter, has been photographed with Donald Trump Jr. and has reportedly been in touch with the president-elect’s team as votes were being tallied.Follow me on X | Subscribe to this channel @tabzlive ☑️	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/3334	2024-11-14T05:14:27-08:00

💬 @PoliticsGR Commentary 🇲🇩 Regarding Moldova I saw a lot of p...	💬 @PoliticsGR Commentary🇲🇩 Regarding Moldova I saw a lot of people complaining about how the election was influenced by diaspora votes, which overwhelmingly supported the incumbent leader. So I took the chance to do a quick research about the diaspora’s financial impact on the country. As many already know, Moldova is among the European countries in which remittances account to a high percentage of the GDP, only behind Georgia according to the World Bank. In 2006, remittances accounted for as high as 34.5% of the sum, while a survey in 2007 indicated that 41% of them were from Russia. Another research in 2013 showed that Russia remained at the top, although academics argued that Russia wasn’t the primary country of remittances before 2008, which contradicts the EBRD survey. A later assessment by BNM (national bank) in 2020 showed that transfers from the CIS countries declined significantly and Europe took their position. Since then, remittances as percentage of GDP have declined, standing at 12.2% in 2023.All in all, I believe it’s legitimate that the diaspora votes in Moldova if it sends so much money to the country, money which is essential for the existence of many families. Additionally, the same criteria should be applied to all eligible voters, independent of whether they live in Moscow or Rome.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/3075	2024-11-04T11:15:06-08:00

So far, only 31 out of 231 diaspora centres have counted their votes.Although the country has proven to be divided over the country’s future orientation, and this is obvious from closer than expected results, it can still be a victory from the aspect of pro-Europeans, since a win is a win even if marginal. However, a potential resurgence of Eurosceptic forces could still happen in the 2025 parliamentary elections, where a political crisis would occur if the election was won by PSRM. There have been similar cases during the 2010s.All in all, it depends on the government’s ability to continue its European ascension path and convince the population about its potential.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/3054	2024-11-03T12:55:34-08:00
