Every Western outlet adopts at the best case, a very mediocre moderate tone, while if this happened in China or Russia, they would publish entire essays of outcry. This does not mean that the Russian government can talk about any moral superiority, it has also attempted to restrict the app in the past and they casually admit it.I obviously didn’t mention Elon Musk’s reaction, since the Telegram hashtag in X is blocked, and he is well-known among real dissidents for virtue signalling.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/784	2024-08-25T09:35:06-07:00

Even if he has French citizenship it would be a suicidal step to go there since you likely need a license to land with your private aircraft at the country. Telegram is based in Dubai, not Russia, so his platform isn’t strictly controlled like VK. Even if it’s viewed negatively by European regulators, it continues to host people who are adversaries of Russia, including some political parties (like PP in Spain) and of course Ukraine uses it as well. On the other hand, it’s known that Telegram doesn’t moderate much of its content, including some criminal one like drug trade, terrorists or pedophiles. I have used some OSINT tools to discover both pedos and porn pages in my city and the results were appalling to say the least.In either case, Durov made a huge mistake to land at Francs and I really don’t know what was he thinking. I don’t think Telegram will be abandoned in the long run, as its user base is mainly concentrated in Eastern countries, however access will become harder due to new European regulations, so we will need VPNs and proxies.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/754	2024-08-24T22:25:22-07:00

Aged 39, he was accompanied by his bodyguard and a woman.The arrest was carried out by the gendarmes of the GTA (Gendarmerie des transports airs). A French search warrant was issued by the OFMIN of the National Directorate of the French Judicial Police on the basis of a preliminary investigation.Justice considers that the lack of moderation, cooperation with law enforcement and the tools offered by Telegram (such as cryptocurrencies) makes it complicit in terrorism, narcotics, complicity, fraud, money laundering, concealment, child-crime content.Durov traveled very little to Europe and avoided countries where Telegram is under surveillance.📝 TF1/LCI🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/751	2024-08-24T14:25:47-07:00

Russia is a country with multiple ethnicities, including some very hostile ones in the Caucasus, which are very prone to Islamism. The attacks in the 2000s are not very distant either, the state tried to cover them up by giving subsidies for the development of these regions, not all of which ended up in their target.The events in Rostov and Volgograd are a reflection of the flaws in Russia’s security sector. Many prisons are filled with Islamists and they have found breaches in their security (including in so-called maximum security facilities) so that they can obtain knifes. This facilitates riots and can wreck havoc, as we saw in the case of Ecuador earlier this year.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/722	2024-08-23T06:35:06-07:00

💬 @PolticsGR Commentary: The definition of oligarchs in Russia i...	💬 @PolticsGR Commentary: The definition of oligarchs in Russia is very ambivalent, considering Western -billionaires- have many similarities. They have ties to their governments (or specific politicians), pursue interests through lobbying (which is nothing more than legal corruption), and deposit their money in the same tax heavens. While I agree the case of Eastern Europe is special, as oligarchs have emerged from dubious privatisation schemes and at one time controlled their governments (as it was the case with Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine at various periods), it’s naive to believe Western countries are not vulnerable to similar phenomena.A great example is Europe; the European Correspondent published a research which dives into how the rich enrolled in politics. It mentions the case of Arthaud and his ties to Sarkozy, explores how Luxembourg has a strong anti-transparency legislature that doesn’t require the rich to disclose their fortunes, and lists critical businessmen who influence politics in various states. The article, nonetheless, turns a blind eye on the influence of NGOs, which are also funded by billionaires seeking to promote their narratives in a covert manner; the example of the feud between George Soros and Hungary is well-known. The case of the United States is much clearer; the rich is constantly involved in politics to defend its interests, having a stake in both parties despite the -differences- we hear on the media.Going to the topic of Russian oligarchs, it’s not surprising to see many of them investing abroad; they are capitalists and don’t care about national interests, they only seek to protect their investments in states with a more business-friendly framework. What surprised me the most in the research was how the government didn’t do anything to promote repatriation of oligarchs’ wealth despite having the time to do so since 2014; it didn’t do anything after 2017 either, when the US law targeting oligarchs passed, and it didn’t seek to convince its business elite to go to more friendly states in stark contrast to the state-owned conglomerates (Gazprom, Rosneft) which had the time to adopt their strategies. Even worse, Russia has a huge problem with bureaucracy, which complicates investments and causes unneeded delays.Russia’s failure in protecting its wealth must serve as a reminder that states need to be stricter and more transparent with their business elites. In a world that gets more protectionist every country must look after its economy and do everything to boost its competitive advantages and improve its legal framework.The European CorrespondentHow the Europe's richest influence politics — The European Correspondent	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/705	2024-08-22T10:05:59-07:00
