There is additionally a high percentage of undecided, ranging from 5.5% to around 15%.🗳 Polls will remain open until 19:00 Athens time. The winner will assume PASOK leadership.💬 Disclaimer; I have no affiliation with PASOK or any other party in Greece, but since it’s a political event of the country I think it should be covered. As for the election, I don’t think any of the next leaders can pose a threat to the current government unless it absorbs the electoral base of SYRIZA and reaches out to current ND voters.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/2256	2024-10-13T01:00:29-07:00

It should be noted that both he and Diamantopoulou have more centrist views, Doukas campaigned on a slightly more left wing platform, while the rest have no special ideological distinction.Regarding the second round, I believe Androulakis will likely win, since Doukas has already an important office as the mayor of Athens and I don’t think he can handle both positions at the same time.

The first two candidates will advance to the next round.💬 Disclaimer; I have no affiliation with PASOK or any other party in Greece, but since it’s a political event of the country I think it should be covered. As for the election, I don’t think any of the next leaders can pose a threat to the current government unless it absorbs the electoral base of SYRIZA and reaches out to current ND voters.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/2040	2024-10-06T00:30:06-07:00

The 2 organisations, which had previously stayed out of politics, said that the bill would deprive Afrikaans children of the rights to education in their mother tongue.Another aspect, although less talked about, is that the bill would lead most predominantly Afrikaans schools to become majority Black, which is likely the reason the ANC proposed the bill.📝 Capeindependent🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/2010	2024-10-03T03:39:04-07:00

The measure -Hang Seng Mainland Properties- rose about 6.41% in a day while some of the stocks had double digits % of rising.Central Bank of China played a role as well by cutting the (central) interest rate of house loans with 0.5% and reduced the payment in advance of a second house on 15% of the price.📝 Financial Greeks (Chris Tsounis)🗺️ @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/1928	2024-10-01T07:11:40-07:00

During the same period in 2023, about 8.200 illegal immigrants had already entered Cyprus🔸 The denial of asylum applications from 'Syrians' is not the only measure being taken. Another major factor has been the stronger guarding the maritime and also the land border between Cyprus and the illegally occupied regions of the country🔸 Until April and May 2024, the arrivals were 30% more than during the corresponding time in 2023🔸 The government has also been cracking down on illegal employment of illegal immigrants, sending the employers to the courts and deporting the illegal immigrants‼️ So far in 2024, around 1800 people were deported while 5.650 voluntarily returned to their homecountries (with a reward), bringing a total of about 7.400 immigrants leaving Cyprus, a number greater than the 6.900 that left in the same period of 2023⚠️ Cyprus is also building a new -pre-removal- immigrant camp for those that have exhausted their legal resources in Cyprus and will be housed there until they are deported🔸 Arrivals in 2024 are mostly non-syrians due to denying their Asylum Applications👉 Previous post on Cyprus decision to deny Asylum Applications of all Syrians@GreekBordersGeneral/GBG/ 🗂	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/1884	2024-09-30T01:15:31-07:00

For now, Hezbollah has much support in the south (among Shi’ites and some Christians) due to its role in the 1985-2000 and 2006 wars, which was largely victorious and defended Beirut from Israeli aggression. It didn’t disarm after the conflicts, exerted pressure on the Lebanese political system in order to solidify its presence, gained experience at the Syrian battlefield and continued stacking missiles for ages. However as the casualties in Lebanon increase and more high ranking officials are murdered, it is bound for the organisation to conduct similar operations against Israeli officers, thus inflicting heavy blows on Tel Aviv. This solution becomes more urgent as Israel is conducting advanced operations against its members using the leverage of its espionage network and its technology edge, as we saw with the interruption of communication methods and precision strikes.Whether it is actually feasible to see direct strikes on the Israeli leadership, it is to be answered in the next months. In a global geopolitical environment without limits and with the past’s fear of a nuclear apocalypse sidelined, many actors rely on escalation to achieve their goals.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/1669	2024-09-24T10:30:23-07:00

Incumbent president Ranil Wickremesinghe achieved 17% and was eliminated alongside 35 other candidates. Since no candidate has received more than 50%, the second and third preference votes of the eliminated candidates are redistributed to the remaining two candidates until one of them secures an outright majority.In the last election, Dissanayake’s NPP alliance had about 3% of the vote. The rise is explained by its appeal to young voters and the rejection of the old political order, blamed for the country’s financial crisis.📝 Al Jazeera🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/1487	2024-09-22T04:00:55-07:00
