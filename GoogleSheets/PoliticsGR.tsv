And there are stark differences compared to Moldova.Moldova is led by a pro-European government and since 2022 it has outlawed media perceived to be pro-Russian (Canal 2, Prime), thus stripping the opposition of media voices. This allowed Sandu to accuse Russia of interfering last Sunday in order to influence the result.Georgia, on the other hand, has various types of media, each of them promoting its own narrative. The government ones (Imedi TV, Rustavi 2) are promoting polls by GORBI, which show Georgian Dream at a safe position, while opposition media (Formula TV, Mtavari TV) publish polls that show the opposition being able to govern. This could explain the incidents of violence and attempted vote rigging we saw today.By the way, the electoral commission has yet to publish an official vote count.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/2750	2024-10-26T09:35:35-07:00

There is additionally a high percentage of undecided, ranging from 5.5% to around 15%.🗳 Polls will remain open until 19:00 Athens time. The winner will assume PASOK leadership.💬 Disclaimer; I have no affiliation with PASOK or any other party in Greece, but since it’s a political event of the country I think it should be covered. As for the election, I don’t think any of the next leaders can pose a threat to the current government unless it absorbs the electoral base of SYRIZA and reaches out to current ND voters.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/2256	2024-10-13T01:00:29-07:00

It should be noted that both he and Diamantopoulou have more centrist views, Doukas campaigned on a slightly more left wing platform, while the rest have no special ideological distinction.Regarding the second round, I believe Androulakis will likely win, since Doukas has already an important office as the mayor of Athens and I don’t think he can handle both positions at the same time.

The 2 organisations, which had previously stayed out of politics, said that the bill would deprive Afrikaans children of the rights to education in their mother tongue.Another aspect, although less talked about, is that the bill would lead most predominantly Afrikaans schools to become majority Black, which is likely the reason the ANC proposed the bill.📝 Capeindependent🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/2010	2024-10-03T03:39:04-07:00

The measure -Hang Seng Mainland Properties- rose about 6.41% in a day while some of the stocks had double digits % of rising.Central Bank of China played a role as well by cutting the (central) interest rate of house loans with 0.5% and reduced the payment in advance of a second house on 15% of the price.📝 Financial Greeks (Chris Tsounis)🗺️ @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/1928	2024-10-01T07:11:40-07:00

During the same period in 2023, about 8.200 illegal immigrants had already entered Cyprus🔸 The denial of asylum applications from 'Syrians' is not the only measure being taken. Another major factor has been the stronger guarding the maritime and also the land border between Cyprus and the illegally occupied regions of the country🔸 Until April and May 2024, the arrivals were 30% more than during the corresponding time in 2023🔸 The government has also been cracking down on illegal employment of illegal immigrants, sending the employers to the courts and deporting the illegal immigrants‼️ So far in 2024, around 1800 people were deported while 5.650 voluntarily returned to their homecountries (with a reward), bringing a total of about 7.400 immigrants leaving Cyprus, a number greater than the 6.900 that left in the same period of 2023⚠️ Cyprus is also building a new -pre-removal- immigrant camp for those that have exhausted their legal resources in Cyprus and will be housed there until they are deported🔸 Arrivals in 2024 are mostly non-syrians due to denying their Asylum Applications👉 Previous post on Cyprus decision to deny Asylum Applications of all Syrians@GreekBordersGeneral/GBG/ 🗂	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/1884	2024-09-30T01:15:31-07:00
