Based on his tweets, it’s definitely a scenario that he believed he would demonise Muslims by staging the attack; the target was a Christmas market besides. At this stage, I wonder how he was able to practice psychiatry. A thing I forgot to mention is that the attacker was wanted by Riyadh due to charges of terrorism and human trafficking in his country, but Berlin refused to extradite him (and eventually paid the price with the high civilian toll).

The sarcophagus was partially buried at a depth of 1.5 to 2 metres and has a raised lid with a pitched roof.According to the archaeologists, the historical sources and proximity of the sarcophagus to the church lends weight to the theory that this could be his original tomb. -This could be a significant archaeological confirmation of historical sources regarding the burial place of St. Nicholas,- Findik commented.📝Heritage Daily🗺️@PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/3937	2024-12-11T03:06:22-08:00

Some are modified consumer drones (Mavic 3/Mavic Air) while others are kits. Video is too big	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/3759	2024-12-03T00:10:06-08:00

We are talking about Greeks who live there for centuries.The city has a strong guard/militia which resists against the jihadists for years.It is said that the Syrian and the Russian army has abandoned them while its also said that there are Russian soldiers amongst the defenders of the city.They sincerely ask for the help of the Greek state to protect the Greek cities in Syria.💬 We shouldnt expect the Hellenophone (non Greek) goverment to interve.📝Tribune🗺️@PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/3758	2024-12-02T17:43:01-08:00
