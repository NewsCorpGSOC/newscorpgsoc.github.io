Forwarded From Middle East Spectator – MES— 🇱🇧 🇵🇸 ☦️ A message by Archbishop Atallah Hannah, Archbishop of Sebastia, from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, on the funeral of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah:'Dear friends, in just a few days, Lebanon will witness a great and exceptional event: the funeral of His Eminence, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and the martyrs who stood with him. We, from Jerusalem, stand in reverence and honor for the sacrifices made by Sayyed Hassan and his companions, those who stood with Palestine, defended it, and paid a heavy price for it. We are loyal to these sacrifices. All Palestinians are loyal to the sacrifices of Sayyed Hassan and his comrades.While we send our condolences from the heart of our holy city, we want to express that we will never forget those who stood with Palestine and defended it during the most difficult times and under the harshest conditions. Today, the Palestinian cause is being conspired against. Our enemies seek to displace our people and erase our cause. But the Palestinians will never raise the flag of surrender. We hold firmly to our rights, our principles, and our constants. The word 'surrender' has no place in our Palestinian dictionary.Dear friends, we are all one family, one nation, facing the colonial projects that do not only target Palestine but the entire nation. Our message has always been, and will continue to be, that Palestine is the compass. Whoever’s compass is Palestine is in the right place, and whoever’s compass points elsewhere is in the wrong place. We urge them to correct their course and set their compass in the right direction.Our dear friends, our message today is that we, as a community, must remain united, Christians and Muslims, across all sects and denominations. They want us to be fragmented, divided. They want us to speak the language of sectarianism. They want us divided so they can implement their projects, following the well-known adage 'divide and conquer.' They want to divide us so they can push forward their colonial projects that target Palestine and the entire nation.We will remain Christians and Muslims in this region, one nation, with our compass pointing to Jerusalem, and our cause being Palestine. We must not allow anyone, or any entity, to push projects aimed at further division and fragmentation. We are one family, and that is how we have been, and how we will always remain.'@Middle_East_Spectator	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/5191	2025-02-20T10:40:02-08:00

However, a quick research on the contract’s address shows most of the tokens are held by one or a network of connected addresses.🔸 Promote it across social media saying it will promote public interest (citizen freedom, domestic growth etc).🔸 Shills fall for the scam, spend thousands on the coin in the hope of becoming rich overnight.🔸 Insiders pull out their money, the coin gets rug pulled. Everyone else loses his money and complains on Twitter.What started as ordinary corruption has expanded to new means of finance, with the results being the same; politicians getting rich off ordinary people.

The oil refinery in the city has been hit at least by 10 drones and is in flames. The Novo-Ryazan Thermal Power Station was also successfully hit by Ukrainian drones. Ukrainian channels… 💬 @PoliticsGR Commentary:🇺🇦🇷🇺 I personally don’t publish evolutions from the Russo-Ukrainian war anymore for a reason; the situation on the front is clearly a stalemate (clashes in Donetsk villages, siege of Pokrovsk, Russians are 4.5 kilometres from Dnipropetrovsk oblast and still don’t go in, Ukrainians conduct a counteroffensive in Kursk in an attempt to maintain their positions and fail). However, a topic I haven’t seen mentioned a lot in Telegram channels is drone warfare, and it’s where Ukrainians have a significant competitive edge, enabling them to deal constant damage to Russian energy and military facilities.To conduct a thorough analysis, we need to compare the aerial weapons employed in long-range attacks. Moscow predominantly relies on the Shahed 136 drone (also referred to as Geran-2), a -kamikaze drone- that is utilised alongside ballistic and cruise missiles. Locally-produced variants usually range from below $20,000 to $50,000, while drones exported from Iran are estimated at about $190,000 after a negotiated settlement. Even though Geran-2 remains a lethal weapon and is used frequently, it alone is not sufficient to conduct a sophisticated strike. Coupled with the high cost of missiles, with Kinzhals ranging up to $13 million, the Kremlin needs to cover significant expenses to plan a attack. The only field in which Russia was able to develop cost-effective drones was in reconnaissance operations, which are capable of detecting enemy defences in order to destroy them.On the other hand, Ukraine possesses a diversified drone stack, employing it in both direct combat and long-range attacks. Obviously the main milestone is the minimisation of costs in FPV drones, which accelerated production and usage in the battlefield. However, it has also improved its long-range arsenal, with notable examples being UJ-22, UJ-26 and An-196 Lyutyy and the second drone costing only about $100,000 per piece. Nevertheless, latest power struggles and corruption in government drone procurements could pose a threat to the buildup.In modern wars, military supremacy alone cannot win wars; the battlefield requires a consistent flow of cutting-edge technology, which should gradually become cheaper by reducing marginal costs. I believe we could draw parallels to the strategies used by non-state actors, such as Ansarullah and HTS taking into account they both developed cheaper drone models to offset enemies relying on more expensive technology.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4710	2025-01-24T08:30:47-08:00
