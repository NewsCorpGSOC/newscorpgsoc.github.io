💬 @PoliticsGR Commentary: 🇱🇧🇮🇱 After some interesting resear...	💬 @PoliticsGR Commentary:🇱🇧🇮🇱 After some interesting research, here are some key details which could indicate an Israeli involvement in the attack:🔸 Israel must have had access to the supply chain of pagers, which could be done by bribing corrupt Lebanese officials. The Lebanese financial crisis and animosity by some parties towards Hezbollah can create alluring chances for Israeli officials to recruit opponents, making their operations more efficient.🔸 Israel could therefore obtain access to the production phase of pagers, including installing explosive components that could be triggered by remote control.🔸 At the same time, Israel is tracking the location of many officials through their cell phones and it’s monitoring footage of security cameras in southern Lebanon, which has made Hezbollah fighters and the organisation request citizens to disconnect their cameras from the internet. Now a question is; couldn’t this be done earlier, for instance when Hezbollah entered the war in autumn? The answer is uncertain, but in my opinion, the northern front wasn’t seen as much threatening as Gaza. Now that Israel has thousands of people who evacuated borderline settlements, the military leadership is beginning to change its goals. At the same time, people like Gallant and Halevi want to avoid a direct confrontation, favouring an asymmetric conflict instead.Furthermore, Israel has used other methods to accomplish assassinations and precision strikes, such as using Arab informants to call up suspects or the measures mentioned above.All in all, Israeli involvement in the incident is very likely and can set a prelude for a new 2006.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/1281	2024-09-17T07:30:06-07:00

This came a day after defense secretary Ronald Rumsfeld said that the Pentagon was unable to account for $2.3 trillion in transactions. The attacks were carried out by Al-Qaeda and the Bush administration launched a -global war on terror- by invading Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan among other states, causing more than 4 million deaths.I won’t publish a -red-pilled- take on the 9/11 attacks, as it’s not something I have thoroughly explored, however I do hope the perpetrators are held accountable and people understand its global implications.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/1150	2024-09-11T04:00:59-07:00

🇺🇸 Harris and Trump faced each other on the debate stage Tuesda...	🇺🇸 Harris and Trump faced each other on the debate stage Tuesday night.Harris said that Trump’s tariffs would create a sales tax one the middle class, even though she supported a more interventionist healthcare policy. She accused her opponent of organising January 6 and not agreeing to lose the elections, and repeated tropes about his abortion policy and foreign ties. Harris also went after his legal battles and emphasised she would continue supporting Israel in foreign affairs, alienating many progressive voters.Trump focused on immigration, national security, and the failures of the Biden administration. He called out Harris for the failed Afghanistan withdrawal, which set the pretext for the war in Ukraine, and expressed once again he would end the war. He also went after the moderation of 2020 campaign promises, saying she is virtually the same. The former president defended his abortion stances and his administration policies on the pandemic.Both candidates appeared arrogant, with Kamala laughing, smirking and raising her tone, while Trump remained short-tempered, which boosts his appeal to his supporters. Both of them didn’t manage to answer some questions.💬 I didn’t watch it for obvious reasons, however most liberal media seem to be worried about Harris’ chances.📝 AP News, Reuters🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/1146	2024-09-11T01:05:21-07:00

The project can be funded by commuting resources from the taxes on products with documented negative impact on cancer incidence. On the other hand, it also suggested to reduce tax rates on fruits and vegetables.Public spending accounts for 62% of health expenditure in Greece and private for 38%, while in Europe as a whole, they account for 78% and 22% respectively.📝 Euractiv, Naftemporiki🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/1030	2024-09-06T09:00:13-07:00

Reasons include lack of administrative capacity, uncertainty over the program’s implementation, and underestimation of the time limit.📝 Euractiv🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/950	2024-09-02T11:00:48-07:00

Another interesting conclusion is that BSW didn’t get many votes from AfD (13,000), even compared to diametrically opposed parties (CDU), hence allowing both parties to achieve considerable results.🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/936	2024-09-01T13:00:06-07:00

Even if he has French citizenship it would be a suicidal step to go there since you likely need a license to land with your private aircraft at the country. Telegram is based in Dubai, not Russia, so his platform isn’t strictly controlled like VK. Even if it’s viewed negatively by European regulators, it continues to host people who are adversaries of Russia, including some political parties (like PP in Spain) and of course Ukraine uses it as well. On the other hand, it’s known that Telegram doesn’t moderate much of its content, including some criminal one like drug trade, terrorists or pedophiles. I have used some OSINT tools to discover both pedos and porn pages in my city and the results were appalling to say the least.In either case, Durov made a huge mistake to land at Francs and I really don’t know what was he thinking. I don’t think Telegram will be abandoned in the long run, as its user base is mainly concentrated in Eastern countries, however access will become harder due to new European regulations, so we will need VPNs and proxies.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/754	2024-08-24T22:25:22-07:00

Aged 39, he was accompanied by his bodyguard and a woman.The arrest was carried out by the gendarmes of the GTA (Gendarmerie des transports airs). A French search warrant was issued by the OFMIN of the National Directorate of the French Judicial Police on the basis of a preliminary investigation.Justice considers that the lack of moderation, cooperation with law enforcement and the tools offered by Telegram (such as cryptocurrencies) makes it complicit in terrorism, narcotics, complicity, fraud, money laundering, concealment, child-crime content.Durov traveled very little to Europe and avoided countries where Telegram is under surveillance.📝 TF1/LCI🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/751	2024-08-24T14:25:47-07:00

Megali Idea served as a roadmap to annex more lands with Greek population and develop as a nation, even though most Greek governments neglected economic development at the same time.The map shows territories Greece liberated under his leadership. Note that not all territories were held at the same time (northern Epirus, for instance was held for some months in 1914, while Eastern Thrace and Minor Asia were held by Greece after 1919).Also, I know not all of you may care about Greek affairs, but it’s not bad to learn more about our modern history.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/729	2024-08-23T10:10:06-07:00

Russia is a country with multiple ethnicities, including some very hostile ones in the Caucasus, which are very prone to Islamism. The attacks in the 2000s are not very distant either, the state tried to cover them up by giving subsidies for the development of these regions, not all of which ended up in their target.The events in Rostov and Volgograd are a reflection of the flaws in Russia’s security sector. Many prisons are filled with Islamists and they have found breaches in their security (including in so-called maximum security facilities) so that they can obtain knifes. This facilitates riots and can wreck havoc, as we saw in the case of Ecuador earlier this year.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/722	2024-08-23T06:35:06-07:00

💬 @PolticsGR Commentary: The definition of oligarchs in Russia i...	💬 @PolticsGR Commentary: The definition of oligarchs in Russia is very ambivalent, considering Western -billionaires- have many similarities. They have ties to their governments (or specific politicians), pursue interests through lobbying (which is nothing more than legal corruption), and deposit their money in the same tax heavens. While I agree the case of Eastern Europe is special, as oligarchs have emerged from dubious privatisation schemes and at one time controlled their governments (as it was the case with Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine at various periods), it’s naive to believe Western countries are not vulnerable to similar phenomena.A great example is Europe; the European Correspondent published a research which dives into how the rich enrolled in politics. It mentions the case of Arthaud and his ties to Sarkozy, explores how Luxembourg has a strong anti-transparency legislature that doesn’t require the rich to disclose their fortunes, and lists critical businessmen who influence politics in various states. The article, nonetheless, turns a blind eye on the influence of NGOs, which are also funded by billionaires seeking to promote their narratives in a covert manner; the example of the feud between George Soros and Hungary is well-known. The case of the United States is much clearer; the rich is constantly involved in politics to defend its interests, having a stake in both parties despite the -differences- we hear on the media.Going to the topic of Russian oligarchs, it’s not surprising to see many of them investing abroad; they are capitalists and don’t care about national interests, they only seek to protect their investments in states with a more business-friendly framework. What surprised me the most in the research was how the government didn’t do anything to promote repatriation of oligarchs’ wealth despite having the time to do so since 2014; it didn’t do anything after 2017 either, when the US law targeting oligarchs passed, and it didn’t seek to convince its business elite to go to more friendly states in stark contrast to the state-owned conglomerates (Gazprom, Rosneft) which had the time to adopt their strategies. Even worse, Russia has a huge problem with bureaucracy, which complicates investments and causes unneeded delays.Russia’s failure in protecting its wealth must serve as a reminder that states need to be stricter and more transparent with their business elites. In a world that gets more protectionist every country must look after its economy and do everything to boost its competitive advantages and improve its legal framework.The European CorrespondentHow the Europe's richest influence politics — The European Correspondent	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/705	2024-08-22T10:05:59-07:00
