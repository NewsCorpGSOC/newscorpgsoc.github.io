💬 @PolticsGR Commentary: The definition of oligarchs in Russia i...	💬 @PolticsGR Commentary: The definition of oligarchs in Russia is very ambivalent, considering Western -billionaires- have many similarities. They have ties to their governments (or specific politicians), pursue interests through lobbying (which is nothing more than legal corruption), and deposit their money in the same tax heavens. While I agree the case of Eastern Europe is special, as oligarchs have emerged from dubious privatisation schemes and at one time controlled their governments (as it was the case with Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine at various periods), it’s naive to believe Western countries are not vulnerable to similar phenomena.A great example is Europe; the European Correspondent published a research which dives into how the rich enrolled in politics. It mentions the case of Arthaud and his ties to Sarkozy, explores how Luxembourg has a strong anti-transparency legislature that doesn’t require the rich to disclose their fortunes, and lists critical businessmen who influence politics in various states. The article, nonetheless, turns a blind eye on the influence of NGOs, which are also funded by billionaires seeking to promote their narratives in a covert manner; the example of the feud between George Soros and Hungary is well-known. The case of the United States is much clearer; the rich is constantly involved in politics to defend its interests, having a stake in both parties despite the -differences- we hear on the media.Going to the topic of Russian oligarchs, it’s not surprising to see many of them investing abroad; they are capitalists and don’t care about national interests, they only seek to protect their investments in states with a more business-friendly framework. What surprised me the most in the research was how the government didn’t do anything to promote repatriation of oligarchs’ wealth despite having the time to do so since 2014; it didn’t do anything after 2017 either, when the US law targeting oligarchs passed, and it didn’t seek to convince its business elite to go to more friendly states in stark contrast to the state-owned conglomerates (Gazprom, Rosneft) which had the time to adopt their strategies. Even worse, Russia has a huge problem with bureaucracy, which complicates investments and causes unneeded delays.Russia’s failure in protecting its wealth must serve as a reminder that states need to be stricter and more transparent with their business elites. In a world that gets more protectionist every country must look after its economy and do everything to boost its competitive advantages and improve its legal framework.The European CorrespondentHow the Europe's richest influence politics — The European Correspondent	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/705	2024-08-22T10:05:59-07:00
