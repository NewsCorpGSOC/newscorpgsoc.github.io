Polymarket calls itself a transparent prediction market designed to help people understand major events, including elections.Prominent tech figures, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Elon Musk, criticized the raid. Armstrong claimed the incident would strengthen Polymarket, while Musk commented, -This seems messed up.- Coplan, a known Trump supporter, has been photographed with Donald Trump Jr. and has reportedly been in touch with the president-elect’s team as votes were being tallied.Follow me on X | Subscribe to this channel @tabzlive ☑️	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/3334	2024-11-14T05:14:27-08:00

💬 @PoliticsGR Commentary 🇲🇩 Regarding Moldova I saw a lot of p...	💬 @PoliticsGR Commentary🇲🇩 Regarding Moldova I saw a lot of people complaining about how the election was influenced by diaspora votes, which overwhelmingly supported the incumbent leader. So I took the chance to do a quick research about the diaspora’s financial impact on the country. As many already know, Moldova is among the European countries in which remittances account to a high percentage of the GDP, only behind Georgia according to the World Bank. In 2006, remittances accounted for as high as 34.5% of the sum, while a survey in 2007 indicated that 41% of them were from Russia. Another research in 2013 showed that Russia remained at the top, although academics argued that Russia wasn’t the primary country of remittances before 2008, which contradicts the EBRD survey. A later assessment by BNM (national bank) in 2020 showed that transfers from the CIS countries declined significantly and Europe took their position. Since then, remittances as percentage of GDP have declined, standing at 12.2% in 2023.All in all, I believe it’s legitimate that the diaspora votes in Moldova if it sends so much money to the country, money which is essential for the existence of many families. Additionally, the same criteria should be applied to all eligible voters, independent of whether they live in Moscow or Rome.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/3075	2024-11-04T11:15:06-08:00

So far, only 31 out of 231 diaspora centres have counted their votes.Although the country has proven to be divided over the country’s future orientation, and this is obvious from closer than expected results, it can still be a victory from the aspect of pro-Europeans, since a win is a win even if marginal. However, a potential resurgence of Eurosceptic forces could still happen in the 2025 parliamentary elections, where a political crisis would occur if the election was won by PSRM. There have been similar cases during the 2010s.All in all, it depends on the government’s ability to continue its European ascension path and convince the population about its potential.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/3054	2024-11-03T12:55:34-08:00

I would say the Greek is a seriously good player. Do you agree? And tell me, who has more Greek in him, the Greek or me? I think we have about the same, right?- Trump said. -He's a great player. Maybe the best player in the NBA, actually. He's supposed to be a very good guy, too.-The comment came during Trump's speech at Fiserv Forum, home of the Bucks, where he repeatedly referred to Giannis as -the Greek.-💬 Someone would say that Trump is too humble in the comparison considering he is of the same race as Greeks.📝Basket News🗺️@PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/3000	2024-11-02T07:08:28-07:00
