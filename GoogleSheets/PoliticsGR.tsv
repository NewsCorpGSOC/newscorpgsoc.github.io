Forwarded From Geopolitics Watch (XLevant)😯 — So far, the airstrikes on Yemen have targeted sensitive strategic civil sites such as the airports of Hodeidah and Sanaa. This is likely an indication of the current inability of Israeli intelligence in Yemen to reach the storage sites for missiles and drones or the presence of Houthi leaders.🗓As a reminder: Israeli threats throughout the past days have been to assassinate Houthi leaders.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4206	2024-12-26T07:23:11-08:00

It additionally coordinates with UAVs, integrates artificial intelligence and has the potential to carry hypersonic missiles.Thus, China is the first country to test a 6th generation aircraft, with the United States having to fast-track their own Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program.📝 Army Recognition🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4199	2024-12-26T05:00:13-08:00

In an attempt to improve public finances, the government plans to trim new bond issuance next fiscal year to 28.6 trillion yen from the initially planned 35.4 trillion yen, helped by tax revenue growth. Indeed, tax revenue is projected to rise to a record of 78.4 trillion yen due to recovery in corporate profits.📝 Reuters🗺️ @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4188	2024-12-25T10:00:06-08:00

Based on his tweets, it’s definitely a scenario that he believed he would demonise Muslims by staging the attack; the target was a Christmas market besides. At this stage, I wonder how he was able to practice psychiatry. A thing I forgot to mention is that the attacker was wanted by Riyadh due to charges of terrorism and human trafficking in his country, but Berlin refused to extradite him (and eventually paid the price with the high civilian toll). I would obviously appreciate if you have more content to share in the comments.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4097	2024-12-21T01:10:49-08:00

Police had said earlier that they believed the gunman bought the items at a nearby coffee shop while awaiting his target.Mangione, 26, remained jailed without bail Wednesday in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested and initially charged with gun and forgery offenses.
