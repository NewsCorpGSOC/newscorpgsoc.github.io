Results vary based on methodology and sample.💬 COMMENTARY: Democrats will vote for everyone running on their ticket, independent of his public record. Even better, Harris is the current Vice President, and she can actually push for some of her policies immediately. This rise in popularity can be attributed to mass media support and indicates how most Western democracies are rather ochlocracies.🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/618	2024-08-18T11:00:10-07:00
