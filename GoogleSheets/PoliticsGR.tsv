However, analysts at Citi believe that bond prices are affected by concerns about the viability of the UK’s funding plan, as the government plans to sell more bonds this year in order to back up its debt. In either case, if borrowing costs continue to rise this will result to spending cuts in public services.📝 BBC, Reuters🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4429	2025-01-09T07:15:55-08:00

An absolute majority is required in subsequent rounds. According to the constitution, the president must be a Maronite Christian.⚖️ Most parties are likely to endorse Aoun, with the position of Hezbollah, Amal and FPM being uncertain after Frangieh’s withdrawal.🌍 The election has garnered significant interest from international actors:🇫🇷 France has endorsed Aoun through Macron’s envoy to Lebanon Jean-Yves Le Drian.🇮🇷 Iran hasn’t endorsed any candidate, but will likely negotiate with the eventual winner to continue providing its support for Hezbollah.🇸🇦 Saudi Arabia has endorsed Aoun, preparing to invest millions of dollars if he gains power.🇸🇾 Syria’s new ruler Ahmed Al Sharaa said that Damascus will no longer interfere in Lebanese political procedures.🇺🇸 The United States reiterated its support for Aoun in a meeting in Riyadh, saying it’s the best opportunity to sideline Hezbollah.🕚 The vote will take place at 11:00 AM local time.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4402	2025-01-09T00:00:24-08:00

But instead of expressing a general viewpoint, she particularly focused on the repercussions for LGBT and minority communities.Interestingly, Thorning-Schmidt is a former PM of Denmark. The oversight board was established by Nick Clegg, a former LibDem politician in the UK, who governed in coalition with the Tories and served as deputy PM from 2010 to 2015. Thus, it can be clearly seen how Meta’s policy was politically influenced to favour a neoliberal narrative.💬 While nothing special has been done yet, it’s quite interesting how social media are evolving to move closer to the right wing as Trump is taking office.📝 BBC🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4398	2025-01-08T12:30:44-08:00

Mangoush, who is currently suspended, addressed the longstanding controversy surrounding the incident for the first time.➡️The initial unconfirmed reports in 2023 ignited widespread outrage across Libya, sparking public protests and fierce criticism. The uproar eventually led to Mangoush’s suspension from her ministerial post and her subsequent flight from the country, where she remains in exile to this day.➡️In the interview, Mangoush revealed details of the meeting, stating that it was not an individual initiative but had been authorized and orchestrated by the GNU, under the leadership of Abdel Hamid Dabaiba and Sadiq Al-Ghariani. Her disclosure has reignited anger among the Libyan public, who view the meeting as a betrayal of national and cultural values.➡️In light of these revelations, public frustration with the GNU has escalated. Many Libyans are now demanding the government’s resignation, accusing it of collusion in the controversial meeting. Calls for the overthrow of the GNU reflect growing discontent and highlight the deep divisions within the country’s political landscape.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4377	2025-01-07T11:28:46-08:00

Before that, he served in various ministerial positions, notably the Ministry of National Economy between 1985 and 1987, in which his austerity program caused dissatisfaction with the party majority, leading Papandreou to abolish it and fire Simitis.Under his premiership, annual inflation was brought down from 15% to about 3% and multiple infrastructure projects were constructed, even though most of them were delivered later than promised (Eleftherios Venizelos airport, Athens metro, Rio-Antirrio bridge). The developments correlated with Athens hosting the summer Olympics in 2004. Nevertheless, Simitis is criticised for the handling of the Imia crisis in 1996, the Greek stock market crash of 1999 and for manipulating statistical numbers.📝 Kathimerini, Naftemporiki🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4352	2025-01-05T02:30:16-08:00

In an attempt to improve public finances, the government plans to trim new bond issuance next fiscal year to 28.6 trillion yen from the initially planned 35.4 trillion yen, helped by tax revenue growth. Indeed, tax revenue is projected to rise to a record of 78.4 trillion yen due to recovery in corporate profits.📝 Reuters🗺️ @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4188	2024-12-25T10:00:06-08:00

Based on his tweets, it’s definitely a scenario that he believed he would demonise Muslims by staging the attack; the target was a Christmas market besides. At this stage, I wonder how he was able to practice psychiatry. A thing I forgot to mention is that the attacker was wanted by Riyadh due to charges of terrorism and human trafficking in his country, but Berlin refused to extradite him (and eventually paid the price with the high civilian toll).
