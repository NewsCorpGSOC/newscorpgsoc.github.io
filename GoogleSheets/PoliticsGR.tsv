An assistant FBI agent in charge declared that it was -not a terrorist event.- The news conference ended before authorities could reconcile the two characterizations.🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4317	2025-01-01T06:27:57-08:00

Based on his tweets, it’s definitely a scenario that he believed he would demonise Muslims by staging the attack; the target was a Christmas market besides. At this stage, I wonder how he was able to practice psychiatry. A thing I forgot to mention is that the attacker was wanted by Riyadh due to charges of terrorism and human trafficking in his country, but Berlin refused to extradite him (and eventually paid the price with the high civilian toll).

The sarcophagus was partially buried at a depth of 1.5 to 2 metres and has a raised lid with a pitched roof.According to the archaeologists, the historical sources and proximity of the sarcophagus to the church lends weight to the theory that this could be his original tomb. -This could be a significant archaeological confirmation of historical sources regarding the burial place of St. Nicholas,- Findik commented.📝Heritage Daily🗺️@PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/3937	2024-12-11T03:06:22-08:00

Macron hasnt yet decided who will succeed him.
