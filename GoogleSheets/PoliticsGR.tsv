It should be noted that both he and Diamantopoulou have more centrist views, Doukas campaigned on a slightly more left wing platform, while the rest have no special ideological distinction.Regarding the second round, I believe Androulakis will likely win, since Doukas has already an important office as the mayor of Athens and I don’t think he can handle both positions at the same time.

The 2 organisations, which had previously stayed out of politics, said that the bill would deprive Afrikaans children of the rights to education in their mother tongue.Another aspect, although less talked about, is that the bill would lead most predominantly Afrikaans schools to become majority Black, which is likely the reason the ANC proposed the bill.📝 Capeindependent🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/2010	2024-10-03T03:39:04-07:00

The measure -Hang Seng Mainland Properties- rose about 6.41% in a day while some of the stocks had double digits % of rising.Central Bank of China played a role as well by cutting the (central) interest rate of house loans with 0.5% and reduced the payment in advance of a second house on 15% of the price.📝 Financial Greeks (Chris Tsounis)🗺️ @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/1928	2024-10-01T07:11:40-07:00

During the same period in 2023, about 8.200 illegal immigrants had already entered Cyprus🔸 The denial of asylum applications from 'Syrians' is not the only measure being taken. Another major factor has been the stronger guarding the maritime and also the land border between Cyprus and the illegally occupied regions of the country🔸 Until April and May 2024, the arrivals were 30% more than during the corresponding time in 2023🔸 The government has also been cracking down on illegal employment of illegal immigrants, sending the employers to the courts and deporting the illegal immigrants‼️ So far in 2024, around 1800 people were deported while 5.650 voluntarily returned to their homecountries (with a reward), bringing a total of about 7.400 immigrants leaving Cyprus, a number greater than the 6.900 that left in the same period of 2023⚠️ Cyprus is also building a new -pre-removal- immigrant camp for those that have exhausted their legal resources in Cyprus and will be housed there until they are deported🔸 Arrivals in 2024 are mostly non-syrians due to denying their Asylum Applications👉 Previous post on Cyprus decision to deny Asylum Applications of all Syrians@GreekBordersGeneral/GBG/ 🗂	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/1884	2024-09-30T01:15:31-07:00

For now, Hezbollah has much support in the south (among Shi’ites and some Christians) due to its role in the 1985-2000 and 2006 wars, which was largely victorious and defended Beirut from Israeli aggression. It didn’t disarm after the conflicts, exerted pressure on the Lebanese political system in order to solidify its presence, gained experience at the Syrian battlefield and continued stacking missiles for ages. However as the casualties in Lebanon increase and more high ranking officials are murdered, it is bound for the organisation to conduct similar operations against Israeli officers, thus inflicting heavy blows on Tel Aviv. This solution becomes more urgent as Israel is conducting advanced operations against its members using the leverage of its espionage network and its technology edge, as we saw with the interruption of communication methods and precision strikes.Whether it is actually feasible to see direct strikes on the Israeli leadership, it is to be answered in the next months. In a global geopolitical environment without limits and with the past’s fear of a nuclear apocalypse sidelined, many actors rely on escalation to achieve their goals.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/1669	2024-09-24T10:30:23-07:00

SPD has likely won, AfD will remain on the 2nd place, and rest of the parties will make no difference.

Incumbent president Ranil Wickremesinghe achieved 17% and was eliminated alongside 35 other candidates. Since no candidate has received more than 50%, the second and third preference votes of the eliminated candidates are redistributed to the remaining two candidates until one of them secures an outright majority.In the last election, Dissanayake’s NPP alliance had about 3% of the vote.

The offensive lasted a day and quickly reached the outskirts of Stepanakert, leading to the dissolution of the breakaway Republic of Artsakh in 2024.The successful capture of Nagorno-Karabakh triggered a change of geopolitical ties and power balances for both countries. Armenia has deteriorated relations with Russia, which it blamed for failure to address Azeri forces, has frozen its participation in the CSTO and has joined the ICC in order to take steps against Baku. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan has improved its ties with Moscow and seeks a closer cooperation due to animosity towards Western countries actively siding with Armenia (in particular France).🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/1340	2024-09-19T02:00:26-07:00

💬 @PoliticsGR Commentary: 🇱🇧🇮🇱 After some interesting resear...	💬 @PoliticsGR Commentary:🇱🇧🇮🇱 After some interesting research, here are some key details which could indicate an Israeli involvement in the attack:🔸 Israel must have had access to the supply chain of pagers, which could be done by bribing corrupt Lebanese officials. The Lebanese financial crisis and animosity by some parties towards Hezbollah can create alluring chances for Israeli officials to recruit opponents, making their operations more efficient.🔸 Israel could therefore obtain access to the production phase of pagers, including installing explosive components that could be triggered by remote control.🔸 At the same time, Israel is tracking the location of many officials through their cell phones and it’s monitoring footage of security cameras in southern Lebanon, which has made Hezbollah fighters and the organisation request citizens to disconnect their cameras from the internet. Now a question is; couldn’t this be done earlier, for instance when Hezbollah entered the war in autumn? The answer is uncertain, but in my opinion, the northern front wasn’t seen as much threatening as Gaza. Now that Israel has thousands of people who evacuated borderline settlements, the military leadership is beginning to change its goals. At the same time, people like Gallant and Halevi want to avoid a direct confrontation, favouring an asymmetric conflict instead.Furthermore, Israel has used other methods to accomplish assassinations and precision strikes, such as using Arab informants to call up suspects or the measures mentioned above.All in all, Israeli involvement in the incident is very likely and can set a prelude for a new 2006.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/1281	2024-09-17T07:30:06-07:00

She accused her opponent of organising January 6 and not agreeing to lose the elections, and repeated tropes about his abortion policy and foreign ties. Harris also went after his legal battles and emphasised she would continue supporting Israel in foreign affairs, alienating many progressive voters.Trump focused on immigration, national security, and the failures of the Biden administration. He called out Harris for the failed Afghanistan withdrawal, which set the pretext for the war in Ukraine, and expressed once again he would end the war. He also went after the moderation of 2020 campaign promises, saying she is virtually the same.
