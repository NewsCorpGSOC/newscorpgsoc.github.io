However, if it happens, it will be really great news for a country that has been in constant turmoil since 2003. The presence of US bases is simply redundant; Iraq has earned a place in the Axis of Resistance through the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), the country continues to fight ISIS, the safety of troops is in jeopardy, and the operations require constant funding. It’s undeniably a beneficial deal for both sides.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/491	2024-08-11T11:30:52-07:00
