The $LIBRA token is linked to KIP Protocol, a Web3 framework for AI, with partnerships involving national governance. According to its tokenomics, at least 50% of the reserves would go to stimulate growth. However, research on Bubblemaps revealed that 82% of the supply was held at a few connected wallets, raising suspicions about price manipulation.Eventually, the coin’s launch turned into a disaster after insiders cashed out over $107 million, wiping out nearly 94% of the token’s value within hours.📝 CoinTelegraph, CryptoBriefing🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/5119	2025-02-15T11:40:06-08:00

The oil refinery in the city has been hit at least by 10 drones and is in flames. The Novo-Ryazan Thermal Power Station was also successfully hit by Ukrainian drones. Ukrainian channels… 💬 @PoliticsGR Commentary:🇺🇦🇷🇺 I personally don’t publish evolutions from the Russo-Ukrainian war anymore for a reason; the situation on the front is clearly a stalemate (clashes in Donetsk villages, siege of Pokrovsk, Russians are 4.5 kilometres from Dnipropetrovsk oblast and still don’t go in, Ukrainians conduct a counteroffensive in Kursk in an attempt to maintain their positions and fail). However, a topic I haven’t seen mentioned a lot in Telegram channels is drone warfare, and it’s where Ukrainians have a significant competitive edge, enabling them to deal constant damage to Russian energy and military facilities.To conduct a thorough analysis, we need to compare the aerial weapons employed in long-range attacks. Moscow predominantly relies on the Shahed 136 drone (also referred to as Geran-2), a -kamikaze drone- that is utilised alongside ballistic and cruise missiles. Locally-produced variants usually range from below $20,000 to $50,000, while drones exported from Iran are estimated at about $190,000 after a negotiated settlement. Even though Geran-2 remains a lethal weapon and is used frequently, it alone is not sufficient to conduct a sophisticated strike. Coupled with the high cost of missiles, with Kinzhals ranging up to $13 million, the Kremlin needs to cover significant expenses to plan a attack. The only field in which Russia was able to develop cost-effective drones was in reconnaissance operations, which are capable of detecting enemy defences in order to destroy them.On the other hand, Ukraine possesses a diversified drone stack, employing it in both direct combat and long-range attacks. Obviously the main milestone is the minimisation of costs in FPV drones, which accelerated production and usage in the battlefield. However, it has also improved its long-range arsenal, with notable examples being UJ-22, UJ-26 and An-196 Lyutyy and the second drone costing only about $100,000 per piece. Nevertheless, latest power struggles and corruption in government drone procurements could pose a threat to the buildup.In modern wars, military supremacy alone cannot win wars; the battlefield requires a consistent flow of cutting-edge technology, which should gradually become cheaper by reducing marginal costs. I believe we could draw parallels to the strategies used by non-state actors, such as Ansarullah and HTS taking into account they both developed cheaper drone models to offset enemies relying on more expensive technology.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4710	2025-01-24T08:30:47-08:00

The release of reserve forces and their reintroduction to the labour market will lead to expansion of economic activity, which will be furthermore facilitated with low interest rates.The reception of the ceasefire by the stock market has been overwhelmingly positive; Tel Aviv index rose 5.65% in the last 5 days, climbing to record highs, despite today’s setback.However, the withdrawal of Otzma Yehudit from the government and the uncertainly over continuation of cooperation with Religious Zionism (the party of Smotrich) raises the possibility of elections, which could translate into uncertainty for investors.📝 Walla🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4614	2025-01-20T02:20:06-08:00

This comes after the government abandoned peace talks with the ELN on Friday and has already led to a new wave of civilians fleeing affected areas.The epicentre is the Catatumbo region, a strategic place for drug trafficking because of its proximity to Venezuela, security sources have said. It also has more than 30,000 hectares of cocaine plantations. Venezuela is heavily involved, providing military support and shelter for the ELN in order to control border areas.The ombudsman's office called on all armed groups to allow humanitarian aid and to end all attacks against civilians. As part of the conflict, 516 murders were reported last year, mainly in Catatumbo and the capital Bogotá.📝 El Espectador, El Tiempo, Reuters🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4561	2025-01-19T00:30:35-08:00

Forwarded From Mediterranean Man (Mediterranean Man)I have decided that due to some circumstances, we need new channels to flow into the telegram sphere, and thus, supporting small channels that I personally know would be a good idea, here are such channels that I recommend that you follow them and support.1) https://t.me/tabzlive , an up-to-date news aggregator on ongoing conflicts and political affairs, mostly in Europe and North America, I recommend him if you want to keep up with the general updates in these two regions.2) https://t.me/czaktuality , the name of the channel is literally News from the Middle East, and this is what it specializes in - News from the Middle East, I can say with full confidence that it is legitimately accurate and one of the best neutral sources out there, the admin simply wishes to relay the facts without much bias or personal input, which is commendable, I sincerely recommend him.3) https://t.me/Journalyze , a channel specializing in Middle Eastern and Indian Subcontinent affairs (India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh), alongside other ill-reported conflicts such as Burma, and other international news, although that is not its specialty, I recommend it if you wish to keep to up to date with the events going on in Asia.4) https://t.me/GeoPWatch , a channel specializing in Palestinian affairs specifically and international events in general, they also shine a light in forgotten conflicts in Africa and Asia, and keep up with the relevant political affairs in the Northern Hemisphere, they are factual, and therefore I recommend them.5) https://t.me/Warfront_Lens , A channel specializing in Kashmiri affairs, Indian news, and keeping on track with news involving extremist organizations and terrorists that are currently across warzones in Asia and Africa, I recommend them. 6) https://t.me/YTHBR A Turkish channel, in Turkish - fear not, for Durov, in his infinite wisdom, gave us a translation option - it posts in Turkish affairs from a Turkish perspective and mostly specializes in Central Asia and the Middle East from said perspective, so when you join in - just now what you are subscribing for.7) https://t.me/PoliticsGR - In return, a Greek channel - however, it is in English, it mostly specializes in relaying factual coverage in Middle Eastern and Eastern Mediterranean Affairs, however, it also reports on international events and political affairs, therefore, I also recommend it, he is a great guy.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/4538	2025-01-18T06:30:06-08:00
