For now, Hezbollah has much support in the south (among Shi’ites and some Christians) due to its role in the 1985-2000 and 2006 wars, which was largely victorious and defended Beirut from Israeli aggression. It didn’t disarm after the conflicts, exerted pressure on the Lebanese political system in order to solidify its presence, gained experience at the Syrian battlefield and continued stacking missiles for ages. However as the casualties in Lebanon increase and more high ranking officials are murdered, it is bound for the organisation to conduct similar operations against Israeli officers, thus inflicting heavy blows on Tel Aviv. This solution becomes more urgent as Israel is conducting advanced operations against its members using the leverage of its espionage network and its technology edge, as we saw with the interruption of communication methods and precision strikes.Whether it is actually feasible to see direct strikes on the Israeli leadership, it is to be answered in the next months. In a global geopolitical environment without limits and with the past’s fear of a nuclear apocalypse sidelined, many actors rely on escalation to achieve their goals.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/1669	2024-09-24T10:30:23-07:00

He currently stands at around 20%.The main favourite is Marxist Anura Kumara Dissanayake, gathering close to 40% of the vote. He promises to renegotiate terms with the IMF, wanting the reduction of some taxes, the elimination of VAT in essential goods and the increase of social welfare, thus attracting many young voters. Finally, Sajith Premadasa is centrist candidate who aims to to reduce living costs and is polling around 35%.Opinion polls predict a close race between the last two candidates, with Dissanayake having the upper hand.📝 Deutsche Welle, Lankapuvath🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/1437	2024-09-21T03:00:59-07:00

The offensive lasted a day and quickly reached the outskirts of Stepanakert, leading to the dissolution of the breakaway Republic of Artsakh in 2024.The successful capture of Nagorno-Karabakh triggered a change of geopolitical ties and power balances for both countries. Armenia has deteriorated relations with Russia, which it blamed for failure to address Azeri forces, has frozen its participation in the CSTO and has joined the ICC in order to take steps against Baku. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan has improved its ties with Moscow and seeks a closer cooperation due to animosity towards Western countries actively siding with Armenia (in particular France).🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/1340	2024-09-19T02:00:26-07:00

💬 @PoliticsGR Commentary: 🇱🇧🇮🇱 After some interesting resear...	💬 @PoliticsGR Commentary:🇱🇧🇮🇱 After some interesting research, here are some key details which could indicate an Israeli involvement in the attack:🔸 Israel must have had access to the supply chain of pagers, which could be done by bribing corrupt Lebanese officials. The Lebanese financial crisis and animosity by some parties towards Hezbollah can create alluring chances for Israeli officials to recruit opponents, making their operations more efficient.🔸 Israel could therefore obtain access to the production phase of pagers, including installing explosive components that could be triggered by remote control.🔸 At the same time, Israel is tracking the location of many officials through their cell phones and it’s monitoring footage of security cameras in southern Lebanon, which has made Hezbollah fighters and the organisation request citizens to disconnect their cameras from the internet. Now a question is; couldn’t this be done earlier, for instance when Hezbollah entered the war in autumn? The answer is uncertain, but in my opinion, the northern front wasn’t seen as much threatening as Gaza. Now that Israel has thousands of people who evacuated borderline settlements, the military leadership is beginning to change its goals. At the same time, people like Gallant and Halevi want to avoid a direct confrontation, favouring an asymmetric conflict instead.Furthermore, Israel has used other methods to accomplish assassinations and precision strikes, such as using Arab informants to call up suspects or the measures mentioned above.All in all, Israeli involvement in the incident is very likely and can set a prelude for a new 2006.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/1281	2024-09-17T07:30:06-07:00

His tenure lasted for 10 years; from 1990 to 2000.His legacy was rather mixed, with leftists accusing him of war crimes and right wingers praising him for combatting the Maoist guerrilla movement of the Shining Path, which was notorious even among many communists. Fujimori was viewed as a dictator and spent multiple years in jail after 2005, until he got released last December.📝 Andina 🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/1165	2024-09-12T01:00:31-07:00

This came a day after defense secretary Ronald Rumsfeld said that the Pentagon was unable to account for $2.3 trillion in transactions. The attacks were carried out by Al-Qaeda and the Bush administration launched a -global war on terror- by invading Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan among other states, causing more than 4 million deaths.I won’t publish a -red-pilled- take on the 9/11 attacks, as it’s not something I have thoroughly explored, however I do hope the perpetrators are held accountable and people understand its global implications.	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/1150	2024-09-11T04:00:59-07:00

She accused her opponent of organising January 6 and not agreeing to lose the elections, and repeated tropes about his abortion policy and foreign ties. Harris also went after his legal battles and emphasised she would continue supporting Israel in foreign affairs, alienating many progressive voters.Trump focused on immigration, national security, and the failures of the Biden administration. He called out Harris for the failed Afghanistan withdrawal, which set the pretext for the war in Ukraine, and expressed once again he would end the war. He also went after the moderation of 2020 campaign promises, saying she is virtually the same. The former president defended his abortion stances and his administration policies on the pandemic.Both candidates appeared arrogant, with Kamala laughing, smirking and raising her tone, while Trump remained short-tempered, which boosts his appeal to his supporters.

The project can be funded by commuting resources from the taxes on products with documented negative impact on cancer incidence. On the other hand, it also suggested to reduce tax rates on fruits and vegetables.Public spending accounts for 62% of health expenditure in Greece and private for 38%, while in Europe as a whole, they account for 78% and 22% respectively.📝 Euractiv, Naftemporiki🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/1030	2024-09-06T09:00:13-07:00

Another interesting conclusion is that BSW didn’t get many votes from AfD (13,000), even compared to diametrically opposed parties (CDU), hence allowing both parties to achieve considerable results.🗺 @PoliticsGR	https://t.me/PoliticsGR/936	2024-09-01T13:00:06-07:00
