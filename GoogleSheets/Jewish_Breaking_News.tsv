Thankfully, the family living here was evacuated by the Israeli government shortly after October 7th. Tens-of-thousands are still evacuated from their homes as Hezbollah wages a war of terror against Israeli civilians. The unprovoked war with Hezbollah continues to rage—thousands of rockets and drones have penetrated Israeli territory since the start of the war in the north. Read the facts—and most importantly—don’t forget the people of northern Israel.WHATSAPP GROUP 🔗 https://chat.whatsapp.com/Kqm3fXa932PC1EQJKfym3nTELEGRAM 🔗 https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegramWHATSAPP CHANNEL 🔗 https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va4EEJU7YSdAqzGs362FSTATUS 🔗 https://wa.me/message/2BHKFPEVQP3FK1	https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram/5753	2024-08-21T13:53:43-07:00
