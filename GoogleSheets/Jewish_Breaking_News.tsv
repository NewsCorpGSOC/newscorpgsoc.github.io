He lived on the seventh floor of the same building, likely to limit the need to move around in the open. Nasrallah said during his eulogy for Shukr that he had been in touch with him until just hours before his death. On the evening of Israeli strike, Fuad Shukr received a call from someone telling him to go to his apartment five floors up. Around 7 p.m., Israeli munitions slammed into the apartment and the three floors underneath, killing Shukr, his wife, two other women and two children. More than 70 people were injured, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.The call to draw Shukr to the seventh floor, where he would be easier to target amid the surrounding buildings, likely came from someone who had breached Hezbollah’s internal communications network. Hezbollah and Iran continue to investigate the intelligence failure but believe that Israel beat the group’s countersurveillance with better technology and hacking. The killing was a major blow to Hezbollah, taking out one of the group’s best strategists and exposing the degree to which its operations have been penetrated. Paired with the death hours later of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in a suspected Israeli attack in Tehran, it also pushed the Middle East to the brink of a regional war that the U.S. is scrambling to head off. - Wall Street Journal WHATSAPP GROUP 🔗 https://chat.whatsapp.com/GmbUPJXCg678NpL1mQ3pnETELEGRAM 🔗 https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegramWHATSAPP CHANNEL 🔗 https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va4EEJU7YSdAqzGs362FSTATUS 🔗 https://wa.me/message/2BHKFPEVQP3FK1	https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram/5680	2024-08-18T15:28:35-07:00

ISRAELI POLICE:-Today, around eight o'clock in the evening, perhaps a minute past eight, dozens of phone calls started coming in to the 100 emergency line at the police station here in Tel Aviv, reporting that they heard an explosion and that body parts were scattered somewhere on this street, I believe it’s called Lachish Street. The forces that arrived at the scene indeed noticed a mutilated body, with signs of an explosion on the wall right here next to a business called Tambour. After, of course, scanning the area and clarifying various factors, we have difficulty identifying the person whose body was mutilated. We know that the mutilated body does not belong to an innocent passerby, but rather the one the explosive was carried by. Whether this is a criminal or terrorist incident is too early to say; we currently have difficulty identifying the person since all his body parts are quite mutilated. For the time being, we haven’t found any clear evidence that would allow a positive identification. We are trying different methods, attempting to do so through laboratory procedures. We are exploring all avenues, and I can also say that the terrorist angle is very relevant. It’s very relevant because of the characteristics of the scene. As of this moment, we have another injured individual who happened to be passing by on the road with a scooter; he was injured in his lower body by shrapnel. He is currently receiving treatment, and likely later we will also obtain information and testimony from him, which might shed light on the circumstances.-WHATSAPP GROUP 🔗 https://chat.whatsapp.com/GmbUPJXCg678NpL1mQ3pnETELEGRAM 🔗 https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegramWHATSAPP CHANNEL 🔗 https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va4EEJU7YSdAqzGs362FSTATUS 🔗 https://wa.me/message/2BHKFPEVQP3FK1	https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram/5667	2024-08-18T14:34:23-07:00
