Civilians are posting numerous videos of interceptions over the skies of Gush Dan and the Shfela.

The ballistic missile launched from Yemen that exploded in an ope...	The ballistic missile launched from Yemen that exploded in an open area near Modiin:1. The missile traveled a distance of about 2,000 km. The flight time required for a ballistic missile to cover such a distance is around 15 minutes. There was ample time to both detect and successfully intercept it.2. It seems the missile was detected by the defense systems, but the question is at what stage this happened, and whether it was already too late for a successful interception, given that this was a heavy, long-range ballistic missile. Several interceptors were launched at the missile, including from the Arrow system and Iron Dome (the latter were aimed at large debris from the interception, out of concern that it could cause damage).3. The Air Force is investigating this morning why the missile was not intercepted. Since the start of the war, the Arrow system has performed dozens of successful interceptions, achieving close to 100% success, both in the Iranian attack on 14/4 and in several ballistic missile launches by the Houthis from Yemen.4. The Houthis had an unsettled score with Israel: on July 20, the Air Force attacked the port of Hodeidah, and the Houthis promised to retaliate but had yet to do so. Perhaps this morning was their response. Just yesterday, the Houthi defense minister issued threats.5. This is not the first time the Houthis have penetrated Israeli defense systems: in April, a cruise missile from Yemen exploded north of Eilat, and in July, a Houthi drone hit Tel Aviv, killing a civilian.6. There are no changes to Home Front Command guidelines. Routine life and school activities in the central region are continuing as usual this morning. The north, however, remains under constant threat and will continue to face disruptions with no real return to normalcy.WHATSAPP GROUP 🔗 https://chat.whatsapp.com/CBmo94NAISJKhHatfMPlWwTELEGRAM 🔗 https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegramWHATSAPP CHANNEL 🔗 https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va4EEJU7YSdAqzGs362FSTATUS 🔗 https://wa.me/message/2BHKFP-EVQP3FK1	https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram/6127	2024-09-15T02:31:41-07:00

An investigation by the IAF revealed that the helicopter, from the 123rd Squadron, was evacuating a seriously wounded combat engineer from Rafah around 11:30 p.m. While attempting to land at an IDF encampment, the helicopter impacted the ground instead of landing correctly. The helicopter was not hit by enemy fire, and the crash happened just before touchdown, meaning it did not fall from a significant height.The crash left the helicopter heavily damaged, with all passengers injured. Two soldiers died, and eight others were hospitalized, including four in serious condition. Among the seriously injured is the combat engineer, who was wounded separately during fighting.TELEGRAM 🔗 https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram	https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram/6070	2024-09-11T03:02:59-07:00

Someone who was connected with the greatest love to her bed, her partner, Rinat.He never left her side for a moment.When she closed her eyes, he closed his.He was present at every check-up, every doctor visit, with every breath she took.When she found it hard to breathe, he breathed for her. When she found it hard to lift her hand, he held it up so that no treatment would be withheld from her.Rinat was the angel watching over her for all these months.When everyone else gave up, he fought. Even when there were doubts, he had faith.She had love within her, and she triumphed because of Michelle's courage.She couldn't walk a step, but Rinat held her hand, marching together with her, step by step, to pass the long journey she still needed to go through.This week, Rinat proposed to Michelle, offered her to be his partner in life, in good and bad, in health and in sickness.

Abu Obeida, the spokesman for Hamas's military wing, stated that after Israel's successful hostage rescue in Nuseirat in June, new orders were given to terrorists guarding captives, instructing them to kill the hostages if Israeli forces approached. The six hostages—Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Alex Lobanov, Carmel Gat, and Almog Sarusi—are believed to have been killed just days before Israeli troops discovered their bodies, according to autopsy reports and the IDF. Abu Obeida warned that Prime Minister Netanyahu's preference for military action over negotiations would result in hostages returning to their families in coffins.WHATSAPP GROUP 🔗 https://chat.whatsapp.com/GdcZl6AhE53IeNfKqaTkg6TELEGRAM 🔗 https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegramWHATSAPP CHANNEL 🔗 https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va4EEJU7YSdAqzGs362FSTATUS 🔗 https://wa.me/message/2BHKFPEVQP3FK1	https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram/5930	2024-09-02T14:48:43-07:00

Although there was no pre-planned mission specifically to rescue him, the IDF had been operating in the southern Gaza Strip for several days, working under the assumption that hostages might be held in the area.As members of the Navy's Shayetet 13 commando unit and the Shin Bet security agency cautiously searched a tunnel complex, they discovered al-Qadi, who appeared to have been left behind by his captors. He was extracted from the tunnel and safely returned to Israel.The involvement of special forces from the outset indicates that the military was actively searching for hostages in the area. The IDF emphasized that it has applied lessons learned from a previous incident in which soldiers accidentally killed three hostages who had escaped their captors during an operation that wasn’t a dedicated rescue mission.WHATSAPP GROUP 🔗 https://chat.whatsapp.com/Kqm3fXa932PC1EQJKfym3nTELEGRAM 🔗 https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegramWHATSAPP CHANNEL 🔗 https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va4EEJU7YSdAqzGs362FSTATUS 🔗 https://wa.me/message/2BHKFPEVQP3FK1	https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram/5833	2024-08-27T09:38:42-07:00
