The group claims the proposal permits Israel to maintain control over key areas, including the Netzer axis, Rafah crossing, and Philadelphia axis.Hamas also argues that the proposal introduces unfavorable terms for a prisoner exchange and backtracks on earlier discussions. They reaffirm their commitment to the July 2 agreement, citing Biden's speech and the Security Council's decision as justification.The group urges mediators to pressure Israel into honoring what they claim was previously agreed upon.
