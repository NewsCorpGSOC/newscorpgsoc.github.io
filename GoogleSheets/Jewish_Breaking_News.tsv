In an unusual step, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant imposed sanctions on 18 oil tankers linked to Iran's Quds Force, accusing them of financing Hezbollah and Hamas. The Defense Ministry's NBCTF explained that these tankers transport oil under a legitimate façade to circumvent international sanctions, funding terrorist activities. The sanctions aim to disrupt key financing for Quds Force and its proxies, though the impact on Iran's operations remains uncertain.
