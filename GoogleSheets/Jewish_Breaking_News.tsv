POLICE: Israeli Arrested for Spying and Arson on Behalf of IranIn December 2024, Israeli security forces arrested Alexander Granovsky, a 29-year-old resident of Petah Tikva, on suspicion of collaborating with Iranian terror groups to undermine Israel’s security. The joint investigation by the Shin Bet and the Lahav 433 Unit of the Israeli Police exposed Granovsky’s involvement in espionage, arson, and other acts carried out on behalf of Iran.The investigation revealed that in November 2024, Granovsky began communicating with Iranian operatives. He was tasked with multiple missions, including setting fire to eight vehicles across Israel, leaving graffiti reading -Children of Ruhollah- as a signature of his acts. He also filmed critical Israeli infrastructure and photographed the entrance to the home of former Defense Minister Benny Gantz, sending the images directly to his Iranian handlers. Granovsky even provided personal information about an Israeli citizen he knew, facilitating recruitment efforts by Iran. Additionally, he purchased Israeli military uniforms with the intent of filming their desecration in a propaganda video.Iranian operatives sought to escalate the scope of Granovsky’s activities. They instructed him to procure firearms and grenades to attack residential neighborhoods and demanded addresses of Israeli government ministers for potential targeting. Granovsky was also asked to carry out arson attacks on police vehicles, buses, and trucks. Although he refused some of these directives, he continued his cooperation with Iranian agents in other capacities.This case highlights Iran’s ongoing efforts to exploit Israeli citizens for its hostile operations. Granovsky’s arrest is part of a troubling pattern of Iranian attempts to use financial incentives and coercion to destabilize Israel from within. Israeli authorities have emphasized their unwavering commitment to uncovering and prosecuting such collaborators.Granovsky is set to face multiple charges for security offenses, with a formal indictment expected in the coming days. Israeli officials are calling on citizens to remain alert and report any suspicious approaches or offers from Iranian operatives, reinforcing the nation’s defense against Tehran’s relentless aggression.WHATSAPP CHANNEL 🔗 https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va4EEJU7YSdAqzGs362FTELEGRAM 🔗 https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegramWHATSAPP GROUP 🔗 https://chat.whatsapp.com/JizSZJGiuJGFyuWc8jJSLm	https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram/8375	2024-12-30T04:49:58-08:00
