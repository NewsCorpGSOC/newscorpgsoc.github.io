ISRAELI POLICE:-Today, around eight o'clock in the evening, perhaps a minute past eight, dozens of phone calls started coming in to the 100 emergency line at the police station here in Tel Aviv, reporting that they heard an explosion and that body parts were scattered somewhere on this street, I believe it’s called Lachish Street. The forces that arrived at the scene indeed noticed a mutilated body, with signs of an explosion on the wall right here next to a business called Tambour. After, of course, scanning the area and clarifying various factors, we have difficulty identifying the person whose body was mutilated. We know that the mutilated body does not belong to an innocent passerby, but rather the one the explosive was carried by. Whether this is a criminal or terrorist incident is too early to say; we currently have difficulty identifying the person since all his body parts are quite mutilated. For the time being, we haven’t found any clear evidence that would allow a positive identification. We are trying different methods, attempting to do so through laboratory procedures. We are exploring all avenues, and I can also say that the terrorist angle is very relevant. It’s very relevant because of the characteristics of the scene. As of this moment, we have another injured individual who happened to be passing by on the road with a scooter; he was injured in his lower body by shrapnel. He is currently receiving treatment, and likely later we will also obtain information and testimony from him, which might shed light on the circumstances.-WHATSAPP GROUP 🔗 https://chat.whatsapp.com/GmbUPJXCg678NpL1mQ3pnETELEGRAM 🔗 https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegramWHATSAPP CHANNEL 🔗 https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va4EEJU7YSdAqzGs362FSTATUS 🔗 https://wa.me/message/2BHKFPEVQP3FK1	https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram/5667	2024-08-18T14:34:23-07:00

The group claims the proposal permits Israel to maintain control over key areas, including the Netzer axis, Rafah crossing, and Philadelphia axis.Hamas also argues that the proposal introduces unfavorable terms for a prisoner exchange and backtracks on earlier discussions. They reaffirm their commitment to the July 2 agreement, citing Biden's speech and the Security Council's decision as justification.The group urges mediators to pressure Israel into honoring what they claim was previously agreed upon.
