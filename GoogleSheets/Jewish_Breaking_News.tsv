In Tulkarem, members of the Border Police's elite Yamam counterterrorism unit engaged in a firefight with a group of terrorists based on intelligence provided by the Shin Bet.The confrontation resulted in the deaths of five Arab terrorists and left one Yamam officer with light injuries, the military reported. Among those killed was Muhammad Jaber, also known as Abu Shuja'a, identified as the commander of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s local wing in the Nur Shams camp in Tulkarem. The Shin Bet indicated that Jaber had been involved in orchestrating several terror attacks, including the killing of Amnon Muchtar in Qalqilya this past June.Additionally, another terrorist was apprehended during the operation.

Although there was no pre-planned mission specifically to rescue him, the IDF had been operating in the southern Gaza Strip for several days, working under the assumption that hostages might be held in the area.As members of the Navy's Shayetet 13 commando unit and the Shin Bet security agency cautiously searched a tunnel complex, they discovered al-Qadi, who appeared to have been left behind by his captors. He was extracted from the tunnel and safely returned to Israel.The involvement of special forces from the outset indicates that the military was actively searching for hostages in the area. The IDF emphasized that it has applied lessons learned from a previous incident in which soldiers accidentally killed three hostages who had escaped their captors during an operation that wasn’t a dedicated rescue mission.WHATSAPP GROUP 🔗 https://chat.whatsapp.com/Kqm3fXa932PC1EQJKfym3nTELEGRAM 🔗 https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegramWHATSAPP CHANNEL 🔗 https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va4EEJU7YSdAqzGs362FSTATUS 🔗 https://wa.me/message/2BHKFPEVQP3FK1	https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram/5833	2024-08-27T09:38:42-07:00
