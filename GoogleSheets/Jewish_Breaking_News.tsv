The IDF has reported a concerning increase in suspected suicides among its personnel since the onset of the war, alongside updated statistics on military fatalities from the past two years.Data reveals that 38 soldiers are believed to have taken their own lives in 2023 and 2024, with 28 of those occurring after the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack. This marks a sharp rise compared to 14 suicides in 2022 and 11 in 2021.Overall, deaths in the military during 2023 and 2024 have reached the highest levels in decades, driven by ongoing conflicts in Gaza, Lebanon, and other fronts. In 2023 alone, the IDF reported 558 fatalities, with 512 occurring during operational activity and three in terror attacks. Accidents claimed the lives of 16 soldiers, and 10 died due to illness. Of the 17 suspected suicides that year, seven were conscripts, four were career soldiers, and six were reservists. Seven of these suicides took place after the October 7 attack.In 2024, the IDF documented 363 total deaths, including 295 in operational activity and 11 in terror attacks. Accidents accounted for 23 fatalities, and illness claimed 13 lives. Suspected suicides rose to 21, comprising seven conscripts, two career soldiers, and 12 reservists—a significant increase attributed to the mass mobilization of nearly 300,000 reservists during the war.In total, all 38 suicides recorded in 2023 and 2024 involved male soldiers. To address the issue, the IDF has intensified mental health support, launching a 24/7 helpline that has handled over 3,900 calls since October 2023. Additionally, more than 800 reservist mental health officers have been deployed to assist troops.Since the war began on October 7, 2023, a total of 891 soldiers have died, not all in combat. These include 329 deaths during the initial Hamas assault, 390 in fighting within Gaza, 37 in attacks on northern Israel, 50 in battles in Lebanon, and 11 in the West Bank.WHATSAPP CHANNEL 🔗 https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va4EEJU7YSdAqzGs362FTELEGRAM 🔗 https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegramWHATSAPP GROUP 🔗 https://chat.whatsapp.com/FNcTPkjoAsC5itYXJQUs6a	https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram/8448	2025-01-02T06:44:49-08:00

FBI Reverses Course, Now Declares New Orleans Attack a Terrorist IncidentNew developments in the New Year’s attack on Bourbon Street reveal a black flag with white writing, resembling the ISIS flag, was found attached to the back of the truck that plowed into crowds, killing 12 and injuring dozens. Police have zip-tied the flag and removed it from public view as part of the ongoing investigation.The FBI has officially reclassified the New Year’s attack on Bourbon Street as a terrorist incident, reversing its initial stance. The attack left 12 dead and dozens injured after the suspect drove an SUV into a crowd, opened fire on survivors, and left improvised explosive devices (IEDs) at the scene.The attacker, described as wearing body armor and -hell-bent on creating carnage,- has not been publicly identified. Authorities initially dismissed the event as non-terror related, despite New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell calling it a terrorist act in the immediate aftermath.This latest development has heightened public scrutiny as the FBI continues to investigate the attacker’s motives and potential affiliations.WHATSAPP CHANNEL 🔗 https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va4EEJU7YSdAqzGs362FTELEGRAM 🔗 https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegramWHATSAPP GROUP 🔗 https://chat.whatsapp.com/FNcTPkjoAsC5itYXJQUs6a	https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram/8430	2025-01-01T09:43:16-08:00

The Shin Bet’s annual activity report reveals the extent of its counterterrorism operations over the past year, highlighting substantial achievements in thwarting threats across multiple fronts. The agency claims to have foiled 1,040 major terror plots in the West Bank and Jerusalem, interrogated over 650 suspects from Gaza, dismantled 20 terror cells within Israel, and blocked 13 Iranian espionage efforts.In Gaza, Shin Bet operations led to the detention of 1,350 individuals at checkpoints, including senior commanders and those tied to the October 7 attack. Intelligence from these interrogations reportedly provided critical, life-saving insights for ongoing military operations and targeted strikes against terror groups.In Lebanon, the agency supported the elimination of 25 high-ranking commanders from Hamas, al-Jama’a al-Islamiyya, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Within Israel, operations disrupted terror activities by Arab Israelis, including five cells preparing attacks involving explosives and car bombs.Significant success was recorded in the West Bank, with 689 shooting plots, 326 explosive device plans, and 13 stabbing attempts among the 1,040 thwarted attacks. This contributed to a 40% reduction in terror incidents in the region compared to the previous year.The Shin Bet disclosed its involvement in high-stakes missions, including hostage rescues in Gaza, cyber defense collaborations thwarting 700 cyber attacks, and elite counterterror Tequila team deployments. The agency also supported Israeli delegations abroad and expanded espionage countermeasures, with a 400% increase in arrests for Iranian-linked activities.One of the report’s emotional highlights was an audio recording from the rescue of Cpl. Ori Megidish, captured during Hamas’s October 7 attack. The clip features a Shin Bet agent reassuring Megidish of her safety and praising her bravery as she responded, -Yes, yes, I’m ok.-WHATSAPP CHANNEL 🔗 https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va4EEJU7YSdAqzGs362FTELEGRAM 🔗 https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegramWHATSAPP GROUP 🔗 https://chat.whatsapp.com/FNcTPkjoAsC5itYXJQUs6a	https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram/8413	2024-12-31T12:52:37-08:00

POLICE: Israeli Arrested for Spying and Arson on Behalf of IranIn December 2024, Israeli security forces arrested Alexander Granovsky, a 29-year-old resident of Petah Tikva, on suspicion of collaborating with Iranian terror groups to undermine Israel’s security. The joint investigation by the Shin Bet and the Lahav 433 Unit of the Israeli Police exposed Granovsky’s involvement in espionage, arson, and other acts carried out on behalf of Iran.The investigation revealed that in November 2024, Granovsky began communicating with Iranian operatives. He was tasked with multiple missions, including setting fire to eight vehicles across Israel, leaving graffiti reading -Children of Ruhollah- as a signature of his acts. He also filmed critical Israeli infrastructure and photographed the entrance to the home of former Defense Minister Benny Gantz, sending the images directly to his Iranian handlers. Granovsky even provided personal information about an Israeli citizen he knew, facilitating recruitment efforts by Iran. Additionally, he purchased Israeli military uniforms with the intent of filming their desecration in a propaganda video.Iranian operatives sought to escalate the scope of Granovsky’s activities. They instructed him to procure firearms and grenades to attack residential neighborhoods and demanded addresses of Israeli government ministers for potential targeting. Granovsky was also asked to carry out arson attacks on police vehicles, buses, and trucks. Although he refused some of these directives, he continued his cooperation with Iranian agents in other capacities.This case highlights Iran’s ongoing efforts to exploit Israeli citizens for its hostile operations. Granovsky’s arrest is part of a troubling pattern of Iranian attempts to use financial incentives and coercion to destabilize Israel from within. Israeli authorities have emphasized their unwavering commitment to uncovering and prosecuting such collaborators.Granovsky is set to face multiple charges for security offenses, with a formal indictment expected in the coming days. Israeli officials are calling on citizens to remain alert and report any suspicious approaches or offers from Iranian operatives, reinforcing the nation’s defense against Tehran’s relentless aggression.WHATSAPP CHANNEL 🔗 https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va4EEJU7YSdAqzGs362FTELEGRAM 🔗 https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegramWHATSAPP GROUP 🔗 https://chat.whatsapp.com/JizSZJGiuJGFyuWc8jJSLm	https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram/8375	2024-12-30T04:49:58-08:00
