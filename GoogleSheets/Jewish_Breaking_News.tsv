In a rapid and dramatic operation, the IDF recovered the bodies of six Israeli hostages from southern Gaza overnight, marking the quickest such mission amid the ongoing war. The 98th Division expanded its operation in Khan Younis on Sunday, achieving -operational control- over a neighborhood by early Monday. Acting on precise intelligence, combat engineers located a 10-meter deep tunnel where Hamas had hidden the hostages' bodies behind a false wall. Within 24 hours, the elite Yahalom unit and Shin Bet operatives breached the tunnel’s defenses, uncovering the remains alongside weapons and explosives. The mission followed intense fighting, during which several Hamas guards were killed. The bodies of both the hostages and the dead terrorists were brought back to Israel for identification.WHATSAPP GROUP 🔗 https://chat.whatsapp.com/GmbUPJXCg678NpL1mQ3pnETELEGRAM 🔗 https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegramWHATSAPP CHANNEL 🔗 https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va4EEJU7YSdAqzGs362FSTATUS 🔗 https://wa.me/message/2BHKFPEVQP3FK1	https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram/5720	2024-08-20T07:21:04-07:00
