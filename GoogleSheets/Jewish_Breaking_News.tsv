Massive Weapons Shipments on Their Way to IsraelSecretary of State Rubio has signed an order classifying the upcoming arms deal with Israel as an emergency matter tied to U.S. national security interests. This designation allows the administration to bypass the lengthy congressional approval process.So, what’s on the way? • 35,500 heavy bombs (MK-84 and BLU-117, exact split unspecified). The MK-84 is a nearly one-ton bomb (previously delayed by Biden), while the BLU-117 is an upgraded version with improved penetration against fortified targets—essentially a -budget bunker buster- that also delivers significant above-ground destruction. • 4,000 BLU-109 bunker busters (used in the critical strike on Nasrallah). While useful for operations in Iran, they are not heavy enough to penetrate Iran’s deepest nuclear facilities, such as the Fordow enrichment site. • 4,800 BLU-110 bombs (~450 kg each, a slightly improved version of the MK-83, essentially standard half-ton bombs). • 5,000 JDAM guidance kits to convert -dumb- iron bombs into precision-guided weapons.This is a massive munitions package by any standard.It’s good to have true friends in Washington.Credit: Tamir Morag, Channel 14.WHATSAPP CHANNEL 🔗 https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va4EEJU7YSdAqzGs362FTELEGRAM 🔗 https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegramWHATSAPP GROUP 🔗 https://chat.whatsapp.com/JMJbkda2SRLCc1ascbYVAU	https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram/9555	2025-03-02T15:42:14-08:00
