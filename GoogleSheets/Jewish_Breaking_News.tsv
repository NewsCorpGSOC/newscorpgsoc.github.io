The fallen soldier, identified as 21-year-old Lt. Shahar Ben Nun of the Paratroopers Brigade’s reconnaissance unit from Petah Tikva, was among a group of troops struck by an errant missile.According to an initial IDF investigation, around 6:30 a.m., Israeli Air Force F-15 jets were conducting strikes on targets in the Khan Younis area. Due to a technical malfunction, one of the missiles failed to hit its intended target and instead struck a multi-story building approximately 300 meters away, where the paratroopers were stationed.The missile hit an upper-floor apartment, leading to the collapse of part of the building, which injured the soldiers in an adjacent apartment. In addition to Ben Nun, three soldiers were seriously wounded, while three others sustained less severe injuries.The Israeli Air Force emphasized that this incident is highly unusual, noting that tens of thousands of munitions have been deployed during the Gaza conflict without encountering similar malfunctions.WHATSAPP GROUP 🔗 https://chat.whatsapp.com/GmbUPJXCg678NpL1mQ3pnETELEGRAM 🔗 https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegramWHATSAPP CHANNEL 🔗 https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va4EEJU7YSdAqzGs362FSTATUS 🔗 https://wa.me/message/2BHKFPEVQP3FK1	https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram/5698	2024-08-19T09:59:58-07:00
