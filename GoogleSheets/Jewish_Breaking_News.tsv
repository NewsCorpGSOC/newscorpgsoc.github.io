Why it matters: The sources indicated that this represents a shift from the previous assessment in recent days, which suggested that international pressure on Iran was restraining it from carrying out a direct attack against Israel. A source familiar with the details stated that the situation -remains fluid,- and the internal debate in Iran continues, meaning that Iran's decision-making could still change.Behind the scenes: A source with knowledge of the details revealed that, in recent days, there has been an internal debate in Iran between the Revolutionary Guards and the new Iranian president and his associates regarding the nature and timing of the response to Haniyeh's assassination. The Revolutionary Guards pushed for a more severe and broader response than the April 13 attack, while the Iranian president and his advisors believed that a harsh response should be avoided. - Axios TELEGRAM 🔗 https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram	https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram/5518	2024-08-11T13:37:25-07:00
