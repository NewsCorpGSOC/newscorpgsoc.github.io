⚠️ Shin Bet Report Exposes Critical Failures Ahead of Hamas’s Oct...	⚠️ Shin Bet Report Exposes Critical Failures Ahead of Hamas’s October 7 Attack ⚠️The Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security agency, has released a sobering summary of its investigations into the systemic breakdowns that preceded Hamas’s devastating October 7, 2023, assault. The report, compiled through internal reviews by each Shin Bet unit and an external panel of former senior officials and experts, identifies significant shortcomings within the agency while also attributing much of the failure to external factors, including an ambiguous division of duties with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), a passive government policy toward Gaza, and the agency’s ill-suited approach to countering a militarized adversary like Hamas.Much of the report remains classified to protect the Shin Bet’s sensitive intelligence methods, but the unclassified portions paint a stark picture of an agency caught off guard. The investigation concludes that the Shin Bet failed to issue a warning about Hamas’s large-scale attack, despite receiving indicators on the night of October 6. While a small contingent of elite Shin Bet and police officers was deployed to the Gaza border and engaged in combat, their efforts were insufficient to halt the onslaught.The report outlines a series of professional and managerial lapses that contributed to the intelligence failure. The agency states that these deficiencies have been -thoroughly examined,- with lessons already being implemented. Contrary to assumptions of complacency, the Shin Bet insists it recognized Hamas as a serious threat and sought to neutralize it, though its actions fell short.Key findings reveal why no alert was raised:- Mishandled Intelligence: Hamas’s invasion plans, detailed in an IDF-obtained document dubbed -Jericho’s Walls,- were not adequately addressed over several years or incorporated into training scenarios.- Jurisdictional Confusion: An unclear delineation of responsibilities between the Shin Bet and IDF left uncertainty over who was accountable for war warnings as Hamas evolved into a full-fledged military force.- Strategic Misalignment: The Shin Bet’s focus on thwarting terror attacks was ill-equipped to tackle an enemy operating with army-like capabilities.- Operational Breakdown: On the night of October 6-7, intelligence handling faltered, protocols were bypassed, and coordination with IDF intelligence was lacking.- Oversight Gaps: Weaknesses in intelligence supervision allowed critical lapses to persist.- Misread Priorities: Analysts believed Hamas aimed to escalate tensions in the West Bank, not Gaza.- Overconfidence in Defenses: The agency misjudged the Gaza border barrier’s strength and the IDF’s response capacity.- Unchallenged Assumptions: Hamas’s perceived intentions went largely unquestioned in assessments.- Limited Intelligence: Restricted operational freedom in Gaza hampered the Shin Bet’s ability to gather robust data.The report also highlights factors that enabled Hamas to amass strength and execute the attack. Israel’s policy of maintaining calm in Gaza inadvertently allowed Hamas to build its military might. Qatari funds bolstered the group’s arsenal, while Israel’s deterrence steadily eroded. A reliance on intelligence and defensive measures, rather than proactive strikes, further emboldened Hamas. The decision to launch the assault was fueled by grievances over Israeli actions at the Temple Mount, treatment of Palestinian prisoners, and perceptions of a fractured Israeli society.The Shin Bet acknowledges the gravity of these failures and pledges ongoing reforms. The findings underscore a harsh reality: even a sophisticated security apparatus can falter when confronted with an evolving threat and systemic missteps.WHATSAPP CHANNEL 🔗 https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va4EEJU7YSdAqzGs362FTELEGRAM 🔗 https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegramWHATSAPP GROUP 🔗 https://chat.whatsapp.com/JMJbkda2SRLCc1ascbYVAU	https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram/9595	2025-03-04T13:08:24-08:00

Among them were three individuals in critical condition—a man and woman in their 30s, and a 15-year-old boy. A 70-year-old woman suffered moderate injuries.

Massive Weapons Shipments on Their Way to IsraelSecretary of State Rubio has signed an order classifying the upcoming arms deal with Israel as an emergency matter tied to U.S. national security interests. This designation allows the administration to bypass the lengthy congressional approval process.So, what’s on the way? • 35,500 heavy bombs (MK-84 and BLU-117, exact split unspecified). The MK-84 is a nearly one-ton bomb (previously delayed by Biden), while the BLU-117 is an upgraded version with improved penetration against fortified targets—essentially a -budget bunker buster- that also delivers significant above-ground destruction. • 4,000 BLU-109 bunker busters (used in the critical strike on Nasrallah). While useful for operations in Iran, they are not heavy enough to penetrate Iran’s deepest nuclear facilities, such as the Fordow enrichment site. • 4,800 BLU-110 bombs (~450 kg each, a slightly improved version of the MK-83, essentially standard half-ton bombs). • 5,000 JDAM guidance kits to convert -dumb- iron bombs into precision-guided weapons.This is a massive munitions package by any standard.It’s good to have true friends in Washington.Credit: Tamir Morag, Channel 14.WHATSAPP CHANNEL 🔗 https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va4EEJU7YSdAqzGs362FTELEGRAM 🔗 https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegramWHATSAPP GROUP 🔗 https://chat.whatsapp.com/JMJbkda2SRLCc1ascbYVAU	https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram/9555	2025-03-02T15:42:14-08:00
