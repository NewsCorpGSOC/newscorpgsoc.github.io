The Lebanese channel Al-Jadeed reported that Arab sources have contacted Hezbollah, requesting that the response to the assassination of Fuad Shukr be delayed until after August 15 (the scheduled resumption of negotiations on Gaza in Cairo).? According to the report, the aim is to prevent the terror group from being blamed for disrupting the negotiations. Hezbollah has not provided a response, neither negative nor positive, the report noted. International efforts to de-escalate and reduce the intensity of Hezbollahs response have intensified, to avoid giving Israel an excuse to expand the conflict.TELEGRAM  https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram	https://t.me/JewishBreakingNewsTelegram/5492	2024-08-10T10:58:30-07:00
