Israel Security Cabinet News,*Soruka Spokesperson:**Good news from Saban Children's Hospital in Soruka**7-year-old Amina Alhusani was hit in the head by shrapnel from an Iranian missile that was intercepted about 4 months ago in the Arad area. She was referred to Soroka in critical condition and was released today for rehabilitation*. Amina was referred to the trauma room in Soroka with a severe and complex head injury, when her life was in real danger. A multi-professional team stabilized her condition, and she was rushed to urgent neurosurgery to save her life. Due to her severe injury, she later had to undergo a series of neurosurgical operations in collaboration with other departments at the medical center. Amina was hospitalized for about two months in the pediatric intensive care unit at Saban Children's Hospital, and was sedated and ventilated for a long time, with a multi-professional team treating her throughout and fighting for her life: neurosurgery teams children, anesthesia, children's intensive care, plastic surgery and children's wards B and children's surgery, and the health professions teams of physical therapy, occupational therapy, communication clinicians and social services. After a long hospitalization in children's intensive care and after her condition improved and she regained consciousness, Amina was transferred to continue treatment in the children's department At Saban Children's Hospital.* Dr. Miki Gidon, director of pediatric neurosurgery in Soroka, and who operated on Amina during her long hospitalization:* 'Amina's head injury was severe, complex and shocking. At the same time, there was no doubt that we would fight for her life and to our great joy, and with the efforts of all the teams we succeeded in our mission. To see Amina today fully conscious as she communicates, smiles and is ready for the next stage of her rehabilitation, fills our hearts with hope and strengthens our hands. From a personal point of view, as someone who immigrated from Iran in her youth and now takes care of Amina who was harmed by the criminal Iranian attack, this is about closing a circle.*Dr. Tzachi Lazar, The director of the pediatric intensive care unit at Saban Children's Hospital in Soroka*: 'When Amina was admitted to the unit that Saturday night, it was hard to believe that the small and fragile girl actually survived her severe injury. Much thanks to the multi-professional team that treated her with great dedication and professionalism, but mostly thanks to Amina's strength, her desire to live and recover, and her family members, who never left her bed during the long and difficult days of hospitalization. We were privileged to see Amina recover and get stronger and reach the day she moves to a rehabilitation setting. Amina, whose injury was so severe that it was highly doubtful whether she would survive it, taught us what a war for life is. Her mother, father and brother who did not give up, stayed with her day and night and continued to talk, hug and demand that she get better - they got to have Amina back. I feel great pride in being part of Soroka's multi-professional team that contributed greatly to Amina's recovery and to her embarking on a new path of rehabilitation. All of us in the pediatric intensive care unit wish her and her family members good health and success in the future.,Sun Jul 28 2024 05:08:47 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time),https://t.me/News_cabinet_news/150123
