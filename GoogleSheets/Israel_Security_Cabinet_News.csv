Israel Security Cabinet News,News - The C.B. Security Cabinet: Note the contradiction in the words of the IDF spokesman - on the one hand, he is talking about a murderous terrorist organization. On the other side he claims and says - "No one thought that a murderous terrorist organization would shoot at a football field where boys and girls hang out." When the IDF spokesman states that the IDF did not think that Hezbollah would shoot at a football field, it reminds me of those senior IDF officers who announced a few days before the outbreak of war that Hamas was deterred and not interested in escalation."
