Belarus will not merge with Russia in the near future, Lukashenko says	Belarus will not formally merge with Russia in the near future, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko said on March 14 while addressing the Russian Federation Council. &quot;If we are going to burst through this open door, we will ruin everything we have done. It is necessary to go calmly, step by step,&quot; Lukashenko said. In early January, independent Russian media Meduza reported, citing sources close to the Kremlin, that Putin may revisit plans to formally absorb Belarus once the war against Ukraine is resolved. Despite his claim of maintaining relations with a range og global actors including China, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the EU, Lukashenko said that Minsk will &quot;always side with Moscow.&quot; &quot;It can&apos;t be otherwise. Belarus will never leave Russia alone, just as Russia will never leave Belarus,&quot; he added, highlighting what he described as &quot;open fraternal relations&quot; between the two countries. Lukashenko&apos;s visit to Russia marks his first trip since securing a seventh presidential term in an election widely denounced as a sham. On March 13, he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Following their talks, Lukashenko and Putin signed a joint statement pledging to expand bilateral trade, economic, and investment cooperation. Belarus has been largely cut off from the West following Lukashenko&apos;s violent crackdown on mass protests in 2020 against fraudulent election results. Since then, his regime has further curtailed political freedoms and deepened its alignment with Moscow, providing logistical and military support for Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Even before launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin reportedly had devised a plan for the &quot;creeping annexation&quot; of Belarus by 2030. The plan outlined steps for &quot;harmonizing&quot; Russian and Belarusian laws, &quot;coordinated foreign and defense policy,&quot; and economic integration based on Russian interests. President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on Feb. 14 that Russia is once again building up troops in Belarus, possibly in preparation for large-scale operations against NATO countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-will-not-merge-with-russia-in-the-near-future-lukashenko-says/	2025-03-14T05:15:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204325998-1.jpg
Ukraine is the front line in the battle against oligarchic capitalism	The war in Ukraine is not just a fight for national sovereignty &#x2014; it&#x2019;s a battle at the crossroads of a collapsing global order. While Ukrainians heroically resist Russia&#x2019;s brutal invasion, the war has exposed the fractures of an economic system that has, for decades, concentrated wealth, power, and decision-making into the hands of a few. It is a test &#x2014; not only for Ukraine but for the entire world: Will this war be remembered as the moment democracy fought back against authoritarianism, or will it serve as yet another chapter in the story of oligarchs and corporate elites profiting from conflict while ordinary people suffer? For decades, the world has been sliding toward an era of oligarchical capitalism &#x2014; a system where political and economic power is no longer in the hands of democratic institutions but controlled by corporate monopolies, financial empires, and political elites. This war has accelerated that transformation, reshaping global energy markets, financial systems, and military-industrial economies in ways that will be felt for decades. While the world rightly focuses on Ukraine&#x2019;s survival, the war is also a struggle over who will control the global economy of the future. Russia&#x2019;s invasion wasn&#x2019;t just an act of territorial aggression &#x2014; it was a calculated gamble that Western economic dependence on Russian energy would prevent a unified response. It failed. But in the wake of sanctions and military realignments, the war has triggered an economic upheaval that is redrawing global supply chains and financial alliances. Ukraine is at the heart of this transformation. Its vast agricultural exports, industrial base, and newly discovered lithium reserves &#x2014; critical for the future of battery technology &#x2014; make it an economic battleground as much as a military one. The reconstruction of Ukraine will not only require billions in aid but will likely be shaped by the very corporate and financial interests that have long profited from global crises. At the same time, Western oligarchs and corporations are not passive actors in this conflict. While Russian elites seek to maintain their grip on power, Western defense contractors, energy giants, and private financial interests stand to gain massively from this war. The war economy is booming. European nations are re-militarizing at an unprecedented pace. The fossil fuel industry &#x2014; once thought to be in decline &#x2014; is experiencing a resurgence as nations scramble to secure energy independence. The war has also become a proving ground for new forms of digital warfare, surveillance capitalism, and AI-driven propaganda. The world is witnessing, in real time, how information can be weaponized, how financial systems can be leveraged as geopolitical tools, and how war accelerates the use of technologies that may outlast the battlefield.

While some of these measures are necessary for security, history warns us that emergency powers granted in times of crisis rarely disappear when the crisis ends. The normalization of war economies and mass surveillance risks creating a permanent state of conflict-driven capitalism, where war is not an exception but an ongoing condition of economic and political life. Ukraine is proving to the world that authoritarian aggression can be resisted. But it is also exposing a deeper question: What kind of world will emerge from this war? If the global economic order continues to be dictated by the interests of oligarchs &#x2014; whether Russian, Western, or otherwise&#x2014;then the ideals Ukraine is fighting for will be at risk of being co-opted by the same elite interests that have manipulated wars and crises for centuries. This war must not become another chapter in the long history of wealth consolidation through conflict. Ukraine&#x2019;s fight for sovereignty must be met with an equally urgent fight for economic justice, democratic renewal, and the dismantling of the systems that have allowed oligarchical capitalism to thrive unchecked. If Ukraine&#x2019;s resistance is to mean something beyond its borders, the world must ensure that this is not just a war for survival but a moment that reshapes global power in the interests of people &#x2014; not just corporations, war profiteers, and financial elites. Ukraine&#x2019;s struggle is more than its own. It is a warning to the world &#x2014; and an opportunity to create a different future. The question is whether we will seize it.

How Ukraineâ€™s defense tech is shaping the future of warfare	Geopolitical events over the past three years have forced a rethinking of the global security framework. Ukraine&#x2019;s battlefield has evolved into an innovation lab for modern defense technologies &#x2014; transforming not only how wars are fought but also how peace is secured. Drawing insights from the recent Brave1 Defense Tech Innovations Forum and Ukraine&#x2019;s own hard-won experience since 2014, it&#x2019;s clear: Ukraine is emerging as the epicenter of a defense revolution. In a world where old alliances and institutions struggle to keep pace with new threats, investing in Ukraine&#x2019;s defense technologies is an investment in a safer, more resilient future. Ukraine&#x2019;s reality has shattered the notion that war is a distant or isolated affair. As Ukrainian Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation Oleksandr Bornyakov stated, &#x201C;The world is not safe anymore.&#x201D; The ongoing Russia-Ukraine War has exposed the limitations of traditional security guarantors, such as the UN and NATO. Yet Ukraine&#x2019;s experience suggests that weak or outdated security frameworks only increase vulnerability in the face of hybrid threats from autocratic adversaries. For Europe, the lesson is clear: defense spending is not waste, but rather critical investment in peace and resilience. With looming threats from old rivals like Russia, amid emerging global uncertainty and the weakening of international institutions like the UN and NATO, the need to bolster defensive capabilities has never been greater. Channeling funds into innovative defense technology can transform Europe&#x2019;s security posture from passive crisis response to proactive mitigation. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war is rewriting the rules of modern warfare. On battlefields where conventional systems fall short, rapid innovation has become the only viable answer, with a demand for both new offensive and defensive systems. These evolving needs are driven by three interlocking factors: First, adaptation to small-scale threats. Traditional air defense systems, designed to counter large, fast-moving aircraft, have proven inadequate &#x2014; and too costly &#x2014; against smaller, slower-moving drones. Recognizing this gap, Ukraine has accelerated the development of both kinetic and electronic anti-drone technologies. This is quickly growing into Ukraine&#x2019;s competitive advantage, as few countries have invested as heavily in this area or have real experience in applying such systems. Second, economics of attrition. In a protracted state-vs-state war, attrition is a critical factor. Innovation is focused on maximizing value for money, making low-cost, high-impact solutions like drones the perfect weapon for the 21st century. We are also seeing international producers gradually adapt to this shift toward cost-effective, rapidly deployable solutions. Third, speed of innovation. Whereas typical defense procurement cycles in the EU or U.S. span decades, Ukraine&#x2019;s evolving battlefield demands a more rapid response. According to Ukrainian Armed Forces representatives, any innovation not reaching production within six months risks becoming obsolete.

(Oleksandr Magula/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)The revolution in modern warfare is far from over. While drones have already reshaped the battlefield, their full potential remains untapped until they evolve into fully autonomous, interconnected systems. Three areas are key to this transformation: First, automation. Operating a drone with a human in the loop is no longer as effective or safe, especially in environments saturated with electronic interference and fast-evolving countermeasures. The future lies in autonomous systems that can operate remotely and independently, reducing risks to human operators and improving operational efficiency. Experts predict not only improved control but also the emergence of drone swarms and fleets. Second, standardization. Rapid innovation has given rise to a wide variety of systems, which are often incompatible with one another. By adopting shared standards for new defense technologies, integration within a country&#x2019;s forces and among allies will be much simpler, allowing these innovations to be rolled out more quickly and on a larger scale. Third, interconnection. Drone warfare remains limited by the speed of human decision-making. Overcoming this challenge requires a robust digital infrastructure that connects a variety of systems, enabling them to operate as a single coordinated entity. This is a crucial next step for drone warfare, where Ukraine has the opportunity to outpace not only its enemies but even its allies, becoming a valuable asset for European security. Despite its challenges, Ukraine&#x2019;s defense ecosystem is currently one of the most innovative and agile in Europe. However, Ukrainian startups face significant roadblocks when attempting to export their technologies or partner with international companies and organizations. To fully harness the potential of its defense innovations, Ukraine needs some form of integration into the international security framework. Until recently, the goal was NATO membership. However, in the current volatile geopolitical landscape, alternatives like the proposed European Armed Forces can serve a similar purpose. In any case, if Ukraine maintains its speed of innovation and continues to attract funding into its fledgling defense sector, the country has the opportunity to not only improve its own security but also offer significant export capacity. Projections estimate a production capacity of 4.6 million drones by 2025, more than double the current planned procurement. This growing capacity represents a great opportunity for international investors and strategic partners. However, high-level political decisions from both Ukraine and its allies are needed to fully unlock it. Additionally, Ukraine could expand partnerships with its allies by offering battlefield testing to international partners. &#x201C;Adopted by the Armed Forces of Ukraine&#x201D; is quickly becoming the most valuable seal of quality in the defense industry, creating both technological and economic opportunities for the country going forward.

JD Vance says he would be 'shocked' if Trump agreed to station US nukes in Poland	U.S. Vice President JD Vance has said he would be &quot;shocked&quot; if the White House agreed to a Polish request to deploy American nuclear weapons on its territory as a deterrent against future Russian aggression. &quot;I haven&apos;t talked to the president about that particular issue, but I would be shocked if he was supportive of nuclear weapons extending further east into Europe,&quot; Vance told Fox News on March 13. The statement was in response to a statement from Polish President Andrzej Duda earlier on March 13 who said such a move would be justified given Russia had already taken similar steps by deploying tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus. &quot;The borders of NATO moved east in 1999, so 26 years later, there should also be a shift of the NATO infrastructure east. For me, this is obvious,&quot; Duda said. &quot;Russia did not even hesitate when they were relocating their nuclear weapons into Belarus,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;They didn&apos;t ask anyone&apos;s permission.&quot; Duda said he recently discussed the idea with Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, and hopes to revive a nuclear-sharing proposal that he unsuccessfully presented to former U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration in 2022. The proposal comes amid mounting warnings from Western leaders and intelligence agencies about the possibility of a large-scale war in Europe within the next five years. Russia&apos;s tactical nuclear weapons are designed for use on the battlefield in Europe and Asia and have a more limited range compared to strategic nuclear weapons, which could reach the U.S. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly issued nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West since launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. While those threats have not materialized, concerns persist over Russia&apos;s military ambitions beyond Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/jd-vance-says-he-would-be-shocked-if-trump-agreed-to-station-us-nukes-in-poland/	2025-03-14T04:52:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204115152.jpg
Putin sent 'additional signals' to Trump on ceasefire proposal, Kremlin says	Russia has sent &quot;additional signals&quot; to U.S. President Donald Trump regarding a proposed ceasefire through special envoy Steve Witkoff, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on March 14. Witkoff landed in Moscow on March 13 and met with Russian President Vladimir Putin late in the evening, according to Peskov. Following Witkoff&apos;s report to Trump, Moscow and Washington will discuss potential dates for a phone call between the leaders, he added in comments reported by Russian state media. &quot;Additional information was provided to the Russian side. Through Witkoff, Putin also passed information and additional signals to Trump,&quot; Peskov said. The visit comes as the U.S. seeks Russian agreement on a proposed 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, which Kyiv accepted during talks in Jeddah on March 11. The agreement led Washington to restart military and intelligence support for Ukraine after halting it last week. Putin said on March 13 that Russia is prepared to accept the ceasefire but demanded that Ukraine halt mobilization, military training, and foreign aid deliveries during the truce. Trump called Putin&apos;s remarks &quot;very promising&quot; but said they were &quot;not complete,&quot; addinghe is open to meeting with the Russian leader. President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed Putin&apos;s response as &quot;manipulative&quot; and suggested the Russian president is preparing to reject the proposal. &quot;Now we have all heard very predictable, very manipulative words from Putin in response to the idea of silence at the front &#x2014; he is, in fact, preparing to reject it as of now,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address on March 13. Witkoff previously traveled to Moscow in February to negotiate the release of U.S. teacher Marc Fogel from Russian prison. He claimed he spoke directly with Putin for over three hours during that visit.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-sent-additional-signals-to-trump-through-special-envoy-witkoff-kremlin-spokesperson-says/	2025-03-14T03:51:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204290859.jpg
Ukrainian activist Demyan Hanul shot dead in central Odesa	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story that is being updated. Ukrainian activist Demyan Hanul was shot dead in central Odesa, the National Police reported on March 14. Hanul, 31, was a well-known public figure, blogger, and founder of the Street Front NGO. He participated in the EuroMaidan Revolution and the May 2 clashes against pro-Russian forces in Odesa. The activist had been active in rallies supporting Ukraine, charity fundraisers for the military, and campaigns to dismantle Soviet and imperial monuments. The shooter fled the scene, and police have launched an investigation. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said he is taking personal control of the case, adding that a top investigative team from the National Police is en route to Odesa. &quot;An investigative team of the best officers has been formed with the central office of the National Police and has already left for Odesa. A regiment of the National Police has also been sent to Odesa,&quot; he said during an hour of questions to the government in the Verkhovna Rada. Pro-Russian media Tipichanya Odesa initially reported that the shooter was a man in military uniform. Klymenko denied this information. &quot;Operatives and police investigators are working to identify the shooter and arrest him,&quot; Klymenko added. Hanul had previously reported threats against his life. In July 2024, he claimed Russian sources had leaked personal information about his relatives and that a $10,000 bounty was offered for an attack on him.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-activist-demyan-hanul-shot-dead-in-central-odesa/	2025-03-14T03:14:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1043773770.jpg
With Putin demanding new concessions for a ceasefire, all eyes are on Trumpâ€™s next move	As a U.S. delegation in Moscow worked to hammer out a ceasefire agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader responded by demanding extensive concessions in exchange for a ceasefire deal in Ukraine. So far, Trump has made harsh demands on Ukraine while avoiding putting similar pressure on Russia. Now, attention turns back to Trump as to whether he will continue his trend of appeasement or double down and force Russia to accept a deal. Speaking at a press conference on March 13, Putin demanded guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops nor receive military aid during the proposed 30-day ceasefire, which some experts see as an attempt to prolong negotiations rather than a sincere attempt at peace. Putin&#x2019;s comments came two days after Kyiv agreed to a ceasefire proposed by Washington during talks in Saudi Arabia on the condition that Russia also accept the terms. Putin also said that further talks are needed to prepare for a ceasefire, including a conversation directly with Trump. The delegation in Moscow was headed by Steve Witkoff, Trump&apos;s special envoy to the Middle East, and left in the early hours of March 14.

(Mikhail Klimentyev / Sputnik / AFP via Getty Images)Trump responded that Putin&apos;s statement was &quot;very promising&quot; but &quot;wasn&#x2019;t complete,&quot; adding he is willing to meet with the Russian president. Ahead of the Russian leader&#x2019;s demands, &#x201C;Trump was very clear: Accept this or I am going to get tough on you,&#x201D; John Herbst, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine under George W. Bush, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Trump&apos;s going to look like a world-class fool if he lets Putin get away with saying no to this proposal. Now that doesn&apos;t mean that Trump, therefore, must do something. &#xA0;But there will be serious pressure on him to do something against Russia,&#x201D; he added. One potential response could be increasing sanctions, a move that Senator Lindsey Graham has pushed for in the event that Putin rejects the ceasefire proposal. &#x201C;If Russia refuses (a ceasefire), we should sanction the hell out of them,&#x201D; Graham wrote on X on March 11 after Washington and Kyiv inked their deal. Nothing in Trump&#x2019;s actions since his inauguration in January has indicated any willingness to put pressure on Russia, said Jenny Mathers, a lecturer in international politics at the U.K.&apos;s Aberystwyth University. Trump has escalated pressure on Ukraine by halting military aid and intelligence sharing until a ceasefire deal was signed, demanding Ukraine sign over natural resource rights to the U.S., berating President Volodymyr Zelensky at a meeting in the Oval Office, suspending a Ukrainian refugee program, and ending USAID funding used to rebuild critical infrastructure struck by Russian missiles. In contrast, despite threats of doubling down on Russian sanctions, Russia has largely evaded escalatory pressure from Trump. Whether or not Trump is willing to change this stance is still up in the air. Another question is whether or not Trump will view Russia&#x2019;s new ceasefire demands as a rejection. &#x201C;Trump seems to be in the mindset of viewing any demands from Russia as reasonable rather than insane, and no list of concessions demanded from Ukraine (by Russia) as outrageous,&#x201D; Mathers said. Still, a scenario where Trump responds to Putin rejecting the deal by throwing his support behind Ukraine is &#x201C;not entirely far-fetched,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Trump is notoriously vain and thin-skinned and easily offended. If he decides that Putin is making him look like a fool in the eyes of the world and not showing him respect, then he could lash out. But even if that happens, Trump could change his mind again,&#x201D; Mathers added. &#x201C;Honestly, one of the few constants in the foreign policy of Trump 2.0 is the affinity for Russia.&#x201D; The ceasefire agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine signed on March 11 featured limited details, including a resumption of U.S. weapons and intelligence, the option to extend beyond the 30 days, and a vague admission of American corporations into Ukrainian mining. It doesn&#x2019;t include the preconditions for a ceasefire Putin named last June, which were largely seen as a non-starter and would have been an effective surrender for Ukraine. The demands Putin set included a full withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from four eastern oblasts &#x2013; Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia &#x2013; which Russia does not fully control.

(Maxim Shemetov / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)According to Ryhor Nizhnikau, a Russia expert at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, entering peace negotiations may be a delay tactic while Putin furthers his goal of &#x201C;political capitulation&#x201D; from Ukraine. &#x201C;Putin will try to prolong the negotiations, which in the meantime will give him opportunities to definitely further deteriorate or disrupt relations between Washington and Kyiv and Washington and its European allies within the process,&#x201D; said Nizhnikau. Sergei Parkhomenko, a Russian-born columnist and political commentator, agreed that Putin may choose to engage in &#x201C;long, tedious negotiations,&#x201D; but that he isn&#x2019;t yet willing to make concessions or sign a peace deal. &#x201C;He needs this war for its own sake, more than he needs victory in it, more than he needs Ukraine, and more than he needs anything else,&#x201D; Parkhomenko told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;For him, war is a way of life, a method of governing the country, a way of maintaining himself in power.&#x201D; In his evening address after Putin made his comments, Zelensky echoed the same sentiment. &quot;Putin is afraid to say directly to President Trump that he wants to continue this war, that he wants to kill Ukrainians. That&apos;s why they in Moscow demand such preconditions for a ceasefire that will make it impossible or will (postpone it) as long as possible,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/with-putin-demanding-new-concessions-for-a-ceasefire-all-eyes-are-on-trumps-next-move/	2025-03-14T03:03:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1152488863.jpg
Finland sentences Russian neo-Nazi mercenary Yan Petrovsky to life for war crimes in Ukraine	The Helsinki District Court sentenced Russian neo-Nazi mercenary Yan Petrovsky to life in prison for war crimes committed in Ukraine, Finnish public broadcaster Yle reported on March 14. Petrovsky, co-leader of the Rusich paramilitary unit, was convicted of war crimes in Luhansk Oblast on Sept. 5, 2014, during Russia&apos;s invasion of Donbas. Prosecutors presented video evidence showing him ordering and participating in the execution of Ukrainian soldiers. Petrovsky denied all accusations, but the court ruled that the video recordings provided sufficient proof of his involvement. Rusich, a notorious Russian neo-Nazi group, has documented and published evidence of its own war crimes, including torture and extrajudicial killings. One of the five charges against him was dismissed. Ukraine had requested Petrovsky&apos;s extradition, but a Finnish court ruled on Dec. 8, 2023, that he could not be sent to Ukraine, citing concerns over prison conditions under the European Convention on Human Rights. The Rusich unit, linked to Russia&apos;s Wagner Group, has a long history of brutality. Co-founder Alexey Milchakov gained notoriety for publishing images of animal cruelty and openly celebrating war crimes. Petrovsky has been under EU and U.S. sanctions since 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/finland-sentences-russian-neo-nazi-mercenary-petrovsky-to-life-for-war-crimes/	2025-03-14T02:53:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2187712266.jpg
Ukrainian drones strike Russian gas facilities, air defense missile depot, source claims	Drones launched by Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) struck two gas compressor stations and a warehouse storing missiles for Russia&apos;s S-300/S-400 air defense systems, a security source told the Kyiv Independent on March 14. The long-range drones targeted gas compressor stations in Russia&apos;s Tambov and Saratov oblasts, according to the source. Another strike reportedly hit a missile depot near the village of Radkovka in Belgorod Oblast, triggering a detonation of stored ammunition. &quot;The SBU conducted another successful special operation on enemy territory, causing significant damage to Russia&apos;s budget and reducing its ability to finance and sustain the war,&quot; the source said. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. 0:00/1&#xD7;The purported moment of a Ukraine Security Service (SBU) drone strike on industrial equipment at Russian gas compressor stations, published on March 13 (Exilenova / Telegram)The S-300 and S-400 systems are Russia&apos;s primary long-range air defense weapons, capable of intercepting aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic threats. Ukraine targets Russian gas compressor stations to disrupt energy exports, a key source of revenue for Moscow&#x2019;s war effort. Ukraine has consistently targeted Russia&apos;s fossil fuel and military infrastructure to weaken its ability to sustain prolonged aggression. Overnight on March 14, Ukrainian drones also hit the Tuapse oil refinery in Krasnodar Krai, setting fire to a gasoline storage tank. Russian pro-government media outlet Mash claimed the fire was caused by debris from a downed drone, while eyewitnesses reported hearing a series of explosions.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-target-russian-gas-facilities-air-defense-missile-depot-source-claims/	2025-03-14T01:48:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-14-at-10_47_13.png
Putin still seeks control over Ukraine despite US peace efforts, WP reports	Russian President Vladimir Putin has not abandoned his maximalist goal of controlling Ukraine, despite U.S. efforts to broker a ceasefire, the Washington Post (WP) reported on March 13, citing sources familiar with classified U.S. intelligence reports. Putin has a &quot;long-standing desire to restore &#x2018;Mother Russia&apos;&quot; and remains determined to assert power over Kyiv, one official said commenting on the U.S. intelligence assessment circulated among President Donald Trump&apos;s administration on March 6. Some officials reportedly believe that even if Russia agrees to a temporary truce, Moscow will use the pause to rearm, violate the agreement, and create provocations to blame on Ukraine. Ukraine had agreed to the truce during talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided Russia did as well. The deal led Washington to resume military and intelligence support for Kyiv. Putin said on March 13 that Russia is prepared to accept the U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire, but only if Kyiv halts mobilization, military training, and arms imports. Zelensky later dismissed Putin&apos;s conditions as &quot;Russian manipulations&quot; and called for tougher sanctions on Moscow. Trump, who has previously warned of &quot;devastating&quot; financial consequences for Russia if the war continues, said on March 13 that Putin&apos;s statement was &quot;very promising&quot; but &quot;wasn&apos;t complete.&quot; Moscow views Trump as weak, lacking a basic set of principles, and potentially open to manipulation, a European intelligence official told WP, citing fresh intelligence. If a permanent ceasefire is reached, Russia is likely to revert to the &quot;hybrid&quot; or non-military tactics it used to undermine Ukraine before its full-scale invasion in 2022, the official added. U.S. officials are reportedly cautious in assessing what peace terms Putin might agree to, but see no indication that he has backed down from his demand to bring Kyiv into Russia&apos;s sphere of influence. Western security officials told Bloomberg on March 10 that Putin has deliberately set &quot;maximalist&quot; demands on territorial concessions, peacekeepers, and Ukraine&apos;s neutrality, knowing they are likely unacceptable to Kyiv and European nations.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-still-seeks-control-over-ukraine-despite-us-peace-efforts-wp-reports/	2025-03-14T01:01:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1988745197.jpg
Ukrainian drones strike Tuapse oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar Krai, governor says	Ukrainian drones struck the Tuapse oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai overnight on March 14, setting fire to a gasoline storage tank, regional Governor Veniamin Kondratiev said. &quot;The area of the fire is more than 1,000 square meters, and emergency services are working,&quot; Kondratiev wrote on Telegram, claiming there were no casualties. Russian pro-government media outlet Mash reported that the fire was caused by debris from a downed drone. Eyewitnesses reportedly heard a series explosions over several minutes.

(Astra / Telegram)The Tuapse oil refinery, with an annual processing capacity of 12 million tons, plays a key role in supplying fuel to the Russian military. Following an earlier strike, the facility underwent an emergency shutdown in May. Kyiv has intensified attacks on Russian fossil fuel infrastructure, seeking to disrupt revenue streams that fund Moscow&apos;s war effort. Ukrainian forces regularly conduct long-range drone strikes on military and industrial targets inside Russia. Earlier this week, 74 drones were shot down on approach to Moscow in the early hours of March 11, authorities claimed, marking the largest drone attack against Russia&apos;s capital during the full-scale war. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its forces had intercepted a massive strike of 337 Ukrainian drones across multiple regions, including 91 over Moscow Oblast, 126 over Kursk Oblast, 38 over Bryansk Oblast, and others over the Belgorod, Ryazan, Kaluga, Lipetsk, Oryol, Voronezh, and Nizhny Novgorod regions. This is the largest number of drones launched against Russia in a single attack during the entire full-scale war. The strike took place as Ukrainian and U.S. delegations were about to meet in Saudi Arabia to discuss possible peace terms with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-hit-russias-tuapse-oil-refinery-reportedly-setting-fuel-tank-on-fire/	2025-03-13T23:53:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-14_07-21-50.jpg

Majority of Americans believe Trump 'too closely aligned' with Russia, poll finds	Some 56% of Americans believe that U.S. President Donald Trump is &quot;too closely aligned&quot; with Russia amid shifting U.S. foreign policy, a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on March 13 found. A total of 40% of respondents disagreed with the statement, the poll showed, while 4% chose not to answer. Since taking office, Trump has distanced the U.S. from its traditional role as Ukraine&#x2019;s primary supporter, instead questioning Kyiv&#x2019;s commitment to peace and implying that Ukraine shares blame for the ongoing war. Those agreeing with the statement were split heavily along partisan lines, with 89% of Democrats and just 27% of Republicans agreeing that Trump &#xA0;is &quot;too closely aligned&quot; with Russia. Trump&#x2019;s recent stance on Ukraine, including his public rebuke of President Volodymyr Zelensky and short-lived halt on U.S. military aid to Kyiv, has drawn praise from Russian officials while raising concerns among European allies. His administration&#x2019;s position has prompted Russian officials to express optimism about a potential thaw in U.S.-Russia relations. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state television on March 3 that &quot;the new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations,&quot; calling the shift a positive development that &quot;largely aligns&quot; with Moscow&apos;s interests. Since taking office Trump has called for Ukraine to sign a mineral resource deal with the United States. The deal was derailed after a spat between Zelensky, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the White House on Feb. 28. Despite the complexities of the deal, a plurality of Americans, or 44%, said they support Trump&apos;s plan of &quot;conditioning U.S. military support for Ukraine on the U.S. getting a share of Ukraine&apos;s mineral wealth.&quot; The poll was conducted online among 1,422 U.S. adults between March 11-12 and has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.	https://kyivindependent.com/majority-of-americans-believe-trump-too-closely-aligned-with-russia-poll-finds/	2025-03-13T21:29:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1066818340.jpg
Large fire reported at oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar Krai following Ukrainian strike	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A large fire covering over 1,000 square meters engulfed the Tuapse oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai overnight on March 14, regional Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said on Telegram. Several explosions were heard by residents in the region around 5 a.m. local time. Videos posted on social media show a large fire burning in the location of the depot. Kondratyev later claimed on social media that the explosions were a results of an attack carried out by Kyiv. A gasoline storage tank is currently ablaze as over 100 emergency personnel are working to extinguish the blaze, Kondratyev added.

Enough is enough' â€” Greenland PM criticizes Trump's annexation efforts	Greenland&apos;s Prime Minister Mute Egede criticized U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s suggestion that the U.S. could annex Greenland in a Facebook post on March 13. &#x201C;The U.S. president has once again aired the thought of annexing us,&#x201D; Egede wrote. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t keep treating us with disrespect. Enough is enough.&#x201D; Egede announced plans to convene a meeting with Greenland&#x2019;s political leaders to reinforce their rejection of Trump&#x2019;s proposal. Trump&apos;s most recent comments about Greenland came during a White House meeting on March 12 with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. &#x201C;I think it will happen,&#x201D; Trump said in response to a reporter asking the probability of Greenland&#x2019;s annexation. He also claimed that the U.S. needs Greenland &#x201C;for international security.&#x201D; Greenland is an autonomous territory of Denmark and a NATO member state. The Arctic island houses both Danish and U.S. military bases and has vast reserves of mineral wealth. Russia has said it is monitoring developments regarding Trump and Greenland due to Moscow&apos;s own &quot;strategic interests&quot; in the Arctic region.	https://kyivindependent.com/enough-is-enough-greenland-pm-criticizes-trumps-annexation-efforts/	2025-03-13T20:04:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192273983.jpg
German Defense Minister calls for unified European approach toward defense procurement	German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius called for a unified European approach toward defense procurement in order to avoid bureaucratic delays, Reuters reported on March 12. &quot;We don&apos;t have time for this, it&apos;s excessive and expensive,&quot; he said. His remarks followed a meeting with defense ministers from the U.K., France, Italy, and Poland in Paris, where they discussed strengthening European defense and supporting Ukraine. Pistorius also called for coordinated and consistent arms purchases across Europe. &quot;We want to buy more, we want to buy consistently and simultaneously... together we can buy cheaper,&quot; he stated. Under German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s leadership, Germany has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. Germany allocated around 8 billion euros in military aid to Ukraine in 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-defense-minister-calls-for-unified-european-approach-toward-defense-procurement/	2025-03-13T19:16:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193104154.jpg
Trump's Ukraine envoy sidelined by Kremlin amid peace talks, NBC reports	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, was excluded from peace talks between Russia and the United States after the Kremlin said it did not want him present, NBC News reported on March 13, citing U.S. and Russian officials. Although Kellogg was appointed by Trump to negotiate an end to Russia&apos;s war, he has been notably absent from the recent peace talks in Jeddah and Riyadh. According to a Russian official that spoke to NBC News, Russian dictator Vladimir Putin did not want Kellogg included in the peace talks because he is perceived as being too sympathetic to Ukraine. Kellogg previously co-authored a peace plan that would freeze the front line in Ukraine, take NATO accession off the table for an extended period, and partially lift sanctions imposed on Russia. His peace proposals also call for continued U.S. military aid to Ukraine as well as strong security guarantees to Kyiv to prevent further Russian aggression. Kellogg previously visited Kyiv in late February for discussions with Ukrainian officials, but has since not been involved in a U.S. delegation in talks with Russia. Notably, Trump&apos;s special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, has emerged as a key negotiator with Russia. Witkoff, who previously traveled to Russia to negotiate the release of American teacher Marc Fogel, arrived in Moscow on March 13 to discuss the 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine proposed by the U.S. According to experts who spoke with the Kyiv Independent last month, Kellogg may still have a role to play, particularly regarding U.S.-Europe relations. However, others suspect that Kellogg may have been fully sidelined and will no longer be involved in brokering peace between Ukraine and Russia. Kyiv agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia did as well. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on March 13 Russia is ready to agree to the U.S.-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine but demands guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops, nor receive military aid during it.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-ukraine-envoy-sidelined-by-kremlin-nbc-reports/	2025-03-13T17:58:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1242112038.jpg
US to resume shipping long-range bombs to Ukraine, Reuters reports	The United States is preparing to resume shipping long-range Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bombs (GLSDB) to Ukraine, Reuters reported on March 13, citing sources familiar with the weapon. According to Reuters, the GLSDBs, which have been upgraded to more effectively counter Russian jamming, may be used by Ukrainian military forces in the coming days, as a stockpile is already present in Europe. The weapons will arrive at a critical time, as U.S. and Ukrainian officials have confirmed that Kyiv&apos;s supply of Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles, has been depleted. In total, the U.S. sent Ukraine less than 40 long-range ATACMS since the start of the full-scale invasion. Earlier this week, President Trump&apos;s administration agreed to resume security assistance to Ukraine, including military aid and intelligence sharing, following high-level talks in Saudi Arabia. Kyiv also confirmed its commitment to the interim 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington, on the condition that Russia agrees to the terms and implements them simultaneously. U.S. security assistance to Ukraine had been previously frozen following the heated meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on February 28. The GLSDB can reportedly strike at a range of 160 kilometers, expanding Ukraine&#x2019;s long-range capabilities, alongside Storm Shadow/SCALP and ATACMS missiles. The delivery of the GLSDB was first announced by the Biden administration in February 2023, with initial estimates putting their arrival in Ukraine in late 2023. Ultimately, the weapons were first delivered in February 2024. As talks on a 30-day ceasefire continue, the Trump administration toughened sanction on March 13 on Russia&apos;s oil and gas industry. The move comes as U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 7 that he is considering imposing sweeping banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until there is a ceasefire and peace agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-receive-long-range-bombs-from-us-reuters-reports/	2025-03-13T16:06:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/SAAB.jpg
Sweden to provide $137 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine	Sweden will provide Ukraine with more than 1.4 billion Swedish kronor ($137.7 million) in humanitarian aid, the country&apos;s International Development Minister Benjamin Dousa announced on March 13. The support package, its largest civilian support package to date, will go toward humanitarian assistance as well as Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction and development. According to Dousa, the funds will address urgent needs such as energy supply, housing, medical care, mine clearance, safe schooling, vocational training, and veteran support. &quot;We must strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s resilience in every way possible. The Ukrainians are defending both their own freedom and security ours,&quot; Dousa said in a statement. The support package will be allocated to a number of projects and initiatives, including more than $10 million toward the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for mine clearance and energy infrastructure support. In 2025, Sweden&apos;s total support to Ukraine will account for 14 percent of its overall development assistance budget. In recent months, Sweden, a staunch NATO ally, has continued to provide Ukraine with various aid packages. On March 8 the Swedish Embassy in Ukraine announced the country will provide 22.5 million Swedish kronor ($2.2 million) to support Ukrainian women. And on Jan. 30, the country announced a military aid package to Ukraine worth over $1.2 billion &#x2014; Sweden&apos;s largest tranche of military assistance since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Earlier in the day on March 13, neighboring Finland announced that the country will provide its own military aid package valued at approximately 200 million euros ($217.4 million).	https://kyivindependent.com/sweden-to-provide-137-million-in-civilian-support-to-ukraine/	2025-03-13T15:37:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2156168873.jpg
US toughens sanctions on Russian energy payments	The Trump administration has toughened sanction on Russia&apos;s oil and gas industry on March 13 by not renewing an exemption that allows Russian banks to access U.S. payment systems to conduct energy transactions. The exemption, initially issued by the Biden administration, was not re-signed by Trump and will make it more difficult for countries to buy primarily Russian oil, likely leading to higher oil prices. The exemption initially applied to transactions involving natural gas, oil and petroleum products, coal, uranium, and similar products. The move comes as U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 7 that he is considering imposing sweeping banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until there is a ceasefire and peace agreement. Kyiv agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia did as well. The talks in Saudi Arabia also led to the U.S. restarting key military and intelligence support for Ukraine, which had been halted last week. Trump previously ruled out lifting sanctions on Moscow before a deal is reached. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on March 13 that Russia is ready to agree to the U.S.-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine but demands guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops, nor receive military aid during it. Reuters reported on March 12, citing Russian sources, that Russia is unlikely to agree to a temporary truce in Ukraine proposed by the U.S., feeling it has the upper hand on the battlefield and viewing the ceasefire as a trap. Shortly after his inauguration, Trump threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions on Russia to force their hand in negotiations, saying &quot;we can do it the easy way or the hard way.&quot; In the following weeks, Trump instead lashed out at Ukraine, claiming President Volodymyr Zelensky was &quot;not ready for peace&quot; and halting military aid to Ukraine and intelligence sharing with Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-toughens-sanctions-on-russian-energy-payments/	2025-03-13T15:13:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1240913057.jpg

McDonald's relaunches breakfast menu in Ukraine amid full-scale war	McDonald&apos;s Ukraine announced the return of its breakfast menu in six Ukrainian cities after the menu&#x2019;s disappearance following the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale Russian in February 2022, the company said in a press release on March 13. The comeback of McDonald&apos;s breakfast in Ukraine follows months of customer requests, with social media users repeatedly calling for its comeback and turning it into a viral trend. The announcement comes as more Western companies expand offerings to Ukrainian customers amid the full-scale war, with some companies choosing to reopen storefronts across the country. &quot;Around 60% of goods and products for McDonald&apos;s in Ukraine come from local suppliers. The company provides stable and large-scale orders, helping create new jobs and increasing tax revenues,&quot; said Oleksandr Bohorodov, CFO of McDonald&apos;s Ukraine. Breakfast is now available in six western Ukrainian cities &#x2013; Lviv, Lutsk, Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, Yaremche, and Kovel &#x2013; until 10:30 AM in restaurants and 10:15 AM for delivery. Before relaunching its breakfast menu, McDonald&apos;s has been testing it in Vinnytsia since December. After Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, McDonald&apos;s temporarily suspended operations and reopened its first three restaurants in Kyiv in September 2022. McDonald&apos;s said breakfast will return to more cities in the coming weeks. However, in eastern regions closer to the front line, including Poltava, Dnipro, Kremenchuk, Kryvyi Rih, Kropyvnytskyi, and Oleksandriia, the breakfast menu will remain unavailable. The obstacles are primarily air raids and related operational difficulties, McDonald&apos;s wrote. For safety reasons, McDonald&apos;s restaurants close during air raid alerts, and all employees must take shelter. Once the alert ends, it takes about an hour to restart equipment and prepare for reopening, the company said. According to air raid statistics, on March 12, Sumy Oblast was under alert for 20 hours, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast for 17.5 hours, and Kharkiv Oblast for over 14 hours per day. Currently, 109 McDonald&apos;s restaurants are operating in 36 cities across Ukraine, the same number as before the invasion, employing around 10,000 people. Fifteen McDonald&apos;s locations in Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv, and Sumy remain closed, while restaurants in Dnipro, the main city of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, reopened in 2023. In January 2025, a Russian missile strike on Kyiv damaged Ukraine&#x2019;s oldest McDonald&apos;s, which first opened in 1997 as the country&apos;s first-ever location. Other retailers like H&amp;M reopened in November 2023, while Inditex, a Spanish-owned multinational company that owns Zara and other brands, reopened some of their stores in Kyiv in 2024. Swedish furniture giant Ikea also reopened their stores in Ukraine last summer. In 2022, following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, McDonald&apos;s closed its 847 restaurants in Russia, taking a financial hit of $55 million per month before fully exiting the Russian market.	https://kyivindependent.com/mcdonalds-relaunches-breakfast-menu-in-ukraine-amid-full-scale-war/	2025-03-13T13:37:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1243384031.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia needs war, Zelensky says in response to Putin's preconditions for ceasefire	Key developments on March 13: Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s remarks about a 30-day ceasefire indicate that he is preparing a rejection of the U.S. proposal, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during his evening address on March 13. &quot;Putin is afraid to say directly to (U.S.) President (Donald) Trump that he wants to continue this war, that he wants to kill Ukrainians. That&apos;s why they in Moscow demand such preconditions for a ceasefire that will make it impossible or will (postpone it) as long as possible,&quot; Zelensky said. Kyiv agreed to a temporary truce proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia did as well. Days after, on March 13, Putin said he was ready to agree to the proposal but demands guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops, nor receive military aid during it. Zelensky described Putin&apos;s response as &quot;Russian manipulations.&quot; &quot;Now we have all heard very predictable, very manipulative words from Putin in response to the idea of silence at the front &#x2014; he is in fact preparing to reject it as of now,&quot; Zelensky said. In his response during a press conference on March 13, Putin mentioned the situation on the battlefield, claiming that a ceasefire would be beneficial to Ukraine now as Russia is advancing along the front line. He also raised the question of who would control the temporary truce along the more than 2,000-kilometer front line. The American side is ready to organize the oversight and verification of the temporary ceasefire, according to Zelensky. He also argued that a truce would make it possible to address all security issues and &quot;put a plan to end the war on the table.&quot; &quot;We do not set conditions that complicate anything. Russia does that,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;They need a war.&quot; Zelensky called for pressure on Putin by imposing sanctions on Russia. Previously, Trump warned that Moscow could face &quot;devastating&quot; financial consequences if it chooses to continue its all-out war against Ukraine. Trump said on March 13 that Putin&apos;s statement regarding the 30-day ceasefire was &quot;very promising&quot; but &quot;wasn&#x2019;t complete,&quot; adding he is willing to meet with the Russian president. Russian forces have retaken Sudzha, a key stronghold of Ukrainian troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on March 13. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claim. As of late March 12, the Ukrainian military confirmed battles in the Sudzha area. Ukrainian troops captured Sudzha, a town with a pre-war population of 6,000 some 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s border, at the start of the Kursk incursion in August 2024. Military analysts from the DeepState monitoring group and the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank have also reported that Russia has partially or fully seized Sudzha, as Ukraine is allegedly withdrawing from the town. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry published a video of the ruined Sudzha after its reported recapture. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the footage&apos;s veracity. &quot;The Russian military almost entirely destroyed Sudzha with airstrikes,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, an official at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &quot;The town and its surroundings were destroyed, and few civilian buildings survived.&quot; The news comes at the heels of a rapid Russian advance in the border region that seemed to have greatly diminished the Ukrainian salient. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, said on March 12 that Russia has retaken more than 86% of the territory in Kursk Oblast captured by Kyiv in mid-2024. The Russian Defense Ministry also reported capturing the settlements of Melovoi and Podol as of March 13. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi acknowledged the &quot;difficult situation&quot; in the region but said that Ukraine will hold the defenses &quot;as long as reasonable and necessary.&quot; Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) drones attacked a camouflaged drone production facility in Russia&apos;s Kaluga Oblast late on March 12, HUR sources confirmed to the Kyiv Independent. Drone production lines were located on the grounds of an aerated concrete plant in the village of Obukhovo in Kaluga Oblast&apos;s Dzerzhinsky district, one of the sources claimed. The statement comes after Kaluga Oblast Governor Vladislav Shapsha said that 25 drones were downed over the region overnight, with drone wreckage setting fire to an unspecified industrial facility in Dzerzhinsky district. One employee suffered minor injuries, and the fire has been extinguished, according to Shapsha. Locals reported powerful explosions and a fire at the plant on social media. Drone debris also damaged a cell tower and a power line in the Khvastovichsky district, the southernmost part of Kaluga Oblast, Shapsha said. Russian air defenses downed 77 drones overnight, including 30 over Bryansk Oblast, six over Kursk and Voronezh oblasts each, and five over Rostov and Belgorod oblasts each, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. An unspecified infrastructure facility was also damaged on the evening of March 12 in Voronezh Oblast, a region bordering Ukraine&apos;s Luhansk Oblast, Governor Alexander Gusev said on his Telegram channel. The targeted facility was part of the region&apos;s gas infrastructure, the Baza Telegram channel reported, citing residents. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Airports in Penza, Saratov, and Volgograd imposed temporary flight restrictions overnight, Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency announced. Washington has discussed with Ukraine the control of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant as part of a potential peace deal, U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 13. Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said that Ukraine and the U.S. had discussed a lot of details of the final deal, including &quot;concepts of land.&quot; &quot;We have been discussing with Ukraine land and pieces of land that would be kept and lost and all of the other elements of a final agreement,&quot; Trump said. &quot;There&apos;s a power plant involved, a very big power plant involved. Who is going to get the power plant, and who is going to get this and that, and so you know it&apos;s not an easy process. But phase one is the ceasefire,&quot; he added. The largest nuclear plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in the city of Enerhodar, has been under Russian occupation since 2022. While the facility remains under Russian control, it is not currently generating electricity.

Russia does that,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;They need a war.&quot; Zelensky called for pressure on Putin by imposing sanctions on Russia. Previously, Trump warned that Moscow could face &quot;devastating&quot; financial consequences if it chooses to continue its all-out war against Ukraine. Trump said on March 13 that Putin&apos;s statement regarding the 30-day ceasefire was &quot;very promising&quot; but &quot;wasn&#x2019;t complete,&quot; adding he is willing to meet with the Russian president.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-is-afraid-to-tell-trump-he-wants-to-continue-war-in-ukraine-zelensky-says/	2025-03-13T13:12:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164821112.jpg
Hungary seeks removal of Russian oligarch Fridman from EU sanctions list, FT reports	Hungary&#x2019;s ambassador to the EU demanded that Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman be removed from the sanctions list, threatening to block the extension of EU sanctions imposed on about 2,000 Russians otherwise, the Financial Times reported on March 13, citing four officials familiar with the matter. Hungarian leadership, broadly seen as the most Russian-friendly in the EU, has repeatedly obstructed and delayed the bloc&apos;s sanctions against Moscow and military aid for Ukraine. The travel restrictions and asset freezes on politicians and businessmen who supported Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine will expire on March 15, unless all EU member countries decide to extend them for another six months. The bloc&apos;s ambassadors are meeting in Brussels on March 13 after several days of talks that failed to reach a compromise, according to the Financial Times (FT). Initially, Budapest sought a removal of eight names from the sanctions list, including Russian oligarchs Petr Aven and Alisher Usmanov, but finally focused on Fridman, the newspaper wrote. Fridman and Aven were sanctioned by the EU on Feb. 28, 2022, for their ties to the Kremlin and support for Moscow&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine. In April 2024, the EU&#x2019;s General Court lifted sanctions against the two, ruling that the EU had failed to demonstrate their role in undermining Ukraine. However, subsequent EU decisions kept them on the sanctions list under a different justification, classifying them as &quot;leading businesspersons providing substantial revenue&quot; to Russia. Ukraine&apos;s staunchest allies, such as the Baltic States, reportedly opposed any easing of EU sanctions against Moscow. Hungary&apos;s idea to remove Fridman from the sanctions list was backed by Luxembourg, three unnamed officials told FT. Last year, Fridman filed a lawsuit against Luxembourg, where his stake in the London-based investment company LetterOne is located. The oligarch claimed $15.8 billion in sanctions-related damages.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-seeks-removal-of-russian-oligarch-fridman-from-eu-sanctions-list-ft-reports/	2025-03-13T12:39:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1168816031.jpg
US opposed to frozen conflict in Ukraine, Zelensky's chief of staff says	The U.S. opposes settling Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine as a frozen conflict, Presidential Office Head Andriy Yermak said on March 13. &quot;We have been very clear that we will never agree to a frozen conflict. We are very much against it, and our positions align with our American partners,&quot; Yermak said. Speaking on national television, Yermak said that the Ukraine-U.S. meeting in Saudi Arabia on March 11 &#x2013; which he had led &#x2013; and a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire are just the beginning, with more work ahead. Kyiv agreed to a temporary truce, provided that Russia did as well. Days after, on March 13, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he is ready to agree to the proposal but demands guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops, nor receive military aid during it. Washington opposed an agreement that would be similar to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum or the 2014-2015 Minsk agreements, which failed to prevent or stop Russia&apos;s aggression, Yermak said. According to Yermak, the Ukrainian and American delegations also agreed that European representatives would participate in the peace process. Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy, said earlier that Europe will not be directly involved in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, but its interests will be considered.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-opposed-to-frozen-conflict-in-ukraine-zelenskys-chief-of-staff-says/	2025-03-13T12:20:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2201664857.jpg
â€˜Putin thinks Trump is an easy mark,â€™ John Bolton says in interview	Instead of approaching the war in Ukraine from a geopolitical and moral perspective, U.S. President Donald Trump is framing his policy on Russia through the lens of his personal relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to former U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton. &#x201C;Trump thinks Putin is his friend. He trusts Putin,&#x201D; Bolton told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Putin thinks Trump is an easy mark. And as a former KGB agent, Putin knows exactly how to manipulate him, and I think that&apos;s what he&apos;s been doing since the inauguration, if not before,&#x201D; he explained. Bolton served as the national security advisor to Trump from 2018-2019 during his first administration. Bolton&apos;s 2020 memoir, &#x201C;The Room Where It Happened,&#x201D; offers a candid account of the tumultuous turn his working relationship with Trump took, highlighting his concerns about his ability to effectively lead, including his impulsive decision-making on complex policy issues and lack of understanding of the importance of a strong U.S. foreign policy. In an interview with the Kyiv Independent, Bolton provided his insight on why Trump appears so eager to appease the Kremlin, why any U.S. attempt to align with Russia to deter China would be a &quot;fantasy,&quot; and the missed opportunities the U.S. for more than a decade to deter Russian aggression not only in Ukraine but beyond. This interview was conducted several hours before Putin signaled he was ready for a ceasefire on the condition that Ukraine doesn&#x2019;t receive more military aid or build its military. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.

(Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Trump has repeatedly claimed that negotiating with Russia is easier than with Ukraine. Despite Russia&#x2019;s nightly attacks on Ukraine, he continues to insist that Putin wants peace. Why do you think Trump is so eager to cater to the Kremlin&apos;s interests, especially when they have such maximalist demands? John Bolton: Trump has said many times publicly that he believes if he has good relations with a foreign head of state, then the U.S. has good relations with that country. And the opposite is also true. If he has bad relations with a foreign head of state, U.S. relations with that country are bad. Trump thinks Putin is his friend. He trusts Putin. He has said in just the past few weeks, &#x201C;Putin says he wants peace, and I trust him. I think if he didn&apos;t want peace, he would tell me.&#x201D; &#xA0;So that gives you a pretty good idea of how he sees Putin. Now, I don&apos;t think Putin thinks he&apos;s Trump&apos;s friend at all. I think Putin thinks Trump is an easy mark. And as a former KGB agent, Putin knows exactly how to manipulate him, and I think that&apos;s what he&apos;s been doing since the inauguration, if not before. The notion that Russia is easy to deal with dates back to 2018, when Trump left Washington for the NATO summit &#x2014; where he nearly withdrew from the alliance &#x2014; before heading to Helsinki for a bilateral meeting with Putin. As he was leaving the White House to get on helicopter Marine One, he said to the assembled press, &#x201C;You know, I&apos;ve got this NATO meeting, then I&apos;m going to meet Prime Minister Theresa May in London, then I&apos;m going to meet Putin in Helsinki. You know, the meeting with Putin could be the easiest of them all. Who would think it?&#x201D; Well, there&apos;s only one person who would think it, and it&apos;s Trump. That was almost six years ago, and nothing has changed. The facts about Russia&#x2019;s conduct in the war &#x2014; being the aggressor from the start &#x2014; simply don&#x2019;t matter to Trump. After all, he believes in helping his friends. President Volodymyr Zelensky has had a strained relationship with Trump &#x2014; through no fault of his own or Ukraine&#x2019;s &#x2014; ever since the infamous &quot;perfect phone call&quot; in the summer of 2019, which ultimately led to Trump&#x2019;s first impeachment. And Zelensky has tried very hard, I think, in the past six months to build a relationship with Trump, but as we saw in the catastrophe in the Oval Office a few weeks ago, it hasn&apos;t worked. And there are people like U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance, who I think have also decided they don&apos;t like Zelensky and don&apos;t like Ukraine &#x2014; Vance once said in his 2022 Senate campaign, &#x201C;I don&apos;t care what happens to Ukraine.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s an uphill struggle. The Kyiv Independent: The Republican Party historically championed strong defense policies and deterrence against U.S. adversaries like Russia. What do you think accounts for the party&#x2019;s shift in attitude toward Ukraine? John Bolton: I believe a majority of Republicans actually still support Ukraine, certainly out in the country among Republican voters. And I think quietly behind the scenes, a majority in Congress do, too, but they&apos;re intimidated by Trump. They&apos;re very worried that he will support candidates against them in a primary election to decide who the Republican nominee will be. And in districts that are very safely Republican, it doesn&apos;t matter who the Democratic nominee is in November. It matters whether the incumbent House member, let&apos;s say, can win against a primary opponent. But I think the situation is beginning to change. More people are beginning to speak out. Trump&apos;s tariff policies are causing a lot of concern, and that adds to concern about his 180-degree shift toward Russia in the Ukraine situation. If our European allies continue their efforts to clarify who&#x2019;s at fault in Ukraine and what&#x2019;s at stake, we&#x2019;ll just have to keep fighting this battle day by day. The Kyiv Independent: The Kremlin has recently said that Trump&apos;s apparent foreign policy shift aligns with their interests. What damage does a U.S.-Russia alliance cause on the global stage? John Bolton: It could come close to destroying NATO. Having watched Trump come very close to withdrawing from NATO at the Brussels summit in 2018, I saw more than I needed to see about how much he doesn&apos;t like the institution &#x2014; he hasn&apos;t changed his view on that. But even before a formal withdrawal, he could do a lot that would debilitate NATO and really undermine the capabilities of the institution to defend its own members or its interests in other conflicts. It&#x2019;s a very dangerous course that he&apos;s pursuing. They&apos;re certainly watching it very carefully in Beijing, where they believe that if the U.S. and NATO won&apos;t stand up for a country in the middle of Europe that&apos;s been invaded, we won&apos;t stand up for Taiwan, we won&apos;t stand up for the Southeast Asian countries near the South China Sea. So it really does have global implications for U.S. security and that of our friends and allies, too. The Kyiv Independent: Some argue that Trump sees a potential rapprochement with Russia as a way to deter China in the future. I&apos;m curious about your thoughts on that, especially given the uncharacteristically supportive statements China has made for Ukraine recently. What is the dynamic that&apos;s forming here? John Bolton: It&apos;s a fantasy to believe the U.S. can somehow use the conflict in Ukraine to separate Russia from China. In the abstract, separating Russia is a very good goal to have. But for reasons not having anything to do with Ukraine or the U.S., Russia and China have grown closer, and it&apos;s really almost impossible to separate Russia from them today. The China-Russia axis is far from perfect, but in the case of the Ukraine war, China has been a considerable assistance to Russia. They have laundered sanctioned Russian financial assets through their own opaque financial system out into global markets. They&apos;ve significantly increased purchases of Russian oil and gas. They&apos;ve talked about building new pipeline capacity, which from China&apos;s point of view would be a plus so they don&apos;t have to lift oil in the Persian Gulf and risk taking it across the Indian Ocean. And they&apos;ve provided a lot of political cover for Russia during this war, which they would expect reciprocity for if they went against Taiwan or did something in the South China Sea. There are still differences of interest between Russia and China. This is not the Cold War Sino-Soviet alliance that had an ideological bond. And obviously China is the partner in charge now, not Russia. So it&apos;s not exactly the same, but I think the idea that somehow Russia could be pulled away from China as part of a settlement in Ukraine is totally unrealistic. I don&apos;t think China has any good intentions in mind for Ukraine, either &#x2014; they see it as something obviously Russia wants to have. The Kyiv Independent: Given your hawkish stance on Russia, was there a decisive moment in the past decade of the war in Ukraine when the U.S. had a real chance to deter Russian aggression but failed? John Bolton: When former U.S. President George W. Bush said at the Bucharest NATO Summit in April of 2008 that Ukraine and Georgia should have been brought into NATO on a fast track, that was the time to do it. Four months later, we saw the Russians move into Georgia, occupying Abkhazia and South Ossetia &#x2014; and they&#x2019;re still there. The only effective deterrence (against Russian aggression) is NATO membership, which is something that obviously Finland and Sweden concluded after 75 years of neutrality. They watched what happened in Ukraine and concluded the only real security was behind a NATO border. We had a chance in 2008 to do that (for Ukraine), and France and Germany objected. After Russia&apos;s 2014 annexation of Crimea and takeover of part of the Donbas, the West did little to impose meaningful sanctions. Former U.S. President Barack Obama showed no interest in taking strong action. I believe this all but guaranteed that when the Kremlin felt ready for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, they expected little resistance. That expectation was reinforced by the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan &#x2014; negotiated by Trump but carried out by Biden &#x2014; which sealed the deal. There were several missed opportunities (to combat Russian aggression), and unfortunately, we&#x2019;re seeing the consequences today. The Kyiv Independent: &#xA0;The Trump administration has said the ball is in Russia&#x2019;s court regarding a Ukraine ceasefire. But given Russia&#x2019;s track record of violating agreements and shifting blame, can we argue that responsibility now lies with the U.S.? If Russia inevitably breaks another ceasefire, and tries to blame Ukraine, how do you think Trump&#x2019;s administration will respond? John Bolton: We&#x2019;ll have to see what happens with the ceasefire first. The ceasefire is not in Ukraine&apos;s interest &#x2014; anything that freezes the conflict along the existing battle lines is laying a foundation for annexation of all the territory on the Russian side by the Russians. That&apos;s been their pattern before. I think Putin has not had any incentive to come to the negotiating table because Trump&apos;s been giving him everything that he wanted. But I think now, with this ceasefire idea out there, Putin also has to be careful he doesn&apos;t lose credibility with Trump. I don&apos;t think he will outright reject the ceasefire. He may accept it, or I think most likely he&apos;ll say something like, &#x201C;I think a ceasefire idea is absolutely worthwhile and I&apos;m ready to proceed. In principle, I agree with it.&#x201D; But there would be technical details to work out there, which wouldn&#x2019;t get worked out anytime soon. Putin, judging by Russian propaganda from yesterday, seems convinced that they are on the verge of pushing the remaining Ukrainian troops out of Kursk. I don&#x2019;t think he will entertain negotiations until that operation is complete. In the meantime, he&#x2019;ll stall for time, mindful of preserving the goodwill he has built with Trump. Although Trump has given away so much at this point, it&apos;s hard to see what he could take back. Hi there, it&#x2019;s Kate Tsurkan, thank you for reading my latest interview. Given Bolton&#x2019;s experience of working alongside Trump, I felt like he was one of the best people to talk to about the ongoing problems surrounding the U.S.&#x2019;s increasingly uncertain role in achieving peace in Ukraine.

China is more likely than the EU to replace Starlink on the Ukrainian battlefield	Fears of a Starlink shut-off at the front line have racked Ukraine. European satellite internet firms took the opportunity to step forward as replacements &#x2014; but even collectively, they are unlikely to fill the void in coverage that Starlink&apos;s shut off would leave. Today, Starlink satellite internet service dominates both worldwide and at Ukraine&#x2019;s front lines. Moreover, Chinese rather than European competitors are building equivalent satellite constellations. If Ukraine is left waiting on an ally to provide an alternative to Starlink, Russia will likely get one from China first. The U.S. paused weapons aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine last week, though that aid resumed after ceasefire talks in Jeddah. Ukrainians had feared Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and semi-official but eminently visible member of President Donald Trump&#x2019;s team would cut Starlink access in Ukraine. Musk has tweeted, however, that he would &#x201C;never do such a thing or use it as a bargaining chip.&#x201D; &#x201C;Nobody knows right now if he&#x2019;ll cut it off,&#x201D; Colonel Pavlo Khazan of the General Directorate of Electronic and Cyber Warfare within the General Staff tells the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;But this would be a very serious problem.&#x201D; There are a handful of alternative satellite internet providers, but on the ground, Starlink still provides several hundred times more bandwidth than the nearest second &#x2014; while also being much cheaper and easier to use. Starlink has proved remarkably resistant to Russian electronic interference. &#x201C;There would probably be some kind of catastrophe,&#x201D; a head of intelligence for a unit near Pokrovsk told the Kyiv Independent, who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons, &#x201C;because right now, everyone is still on Starlinks.&#x201D; &#x201C;There are no real alternatives,&#x201D; a cybersecurity specialist with Ukraine&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry who asked to remain anonymous as they were not authorized to speak publicly told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;But I hardly think they&#x2019;re going to turn it off. It would be bad for business.&#x201D; The character of Ukraine&#x2019;s defense would fundamentally change without Starlink. The front would not necessarily collapse, but it would certainly go much darker. European satellite internet firms are looking to fill in for Starlink at the same time that the European Union is broadly looking to take up the mantle of protection that Trump is keenly throwing away. But while they are eagerly presenting themselves as alternatives, they ultimately fall down on numbers. Among major proposed alternatives are providers like Luxembourg&#x2019;s SES and the French Eutelsat Group, which includes the British firm OneWeb. Of all 10,000-plus man-made satellites in orbit around the earth, over two-thirds are Starlink&#x2019;s. They are, moreover, the best of their kind. &#x201C;No one had really built industrial-level laser comms terminals before at this massive scale, and so Starlink just did it,&#x201D; says Blaine Curcio, a space and satcom consultant who publishes the China Space Monitor. Starlink has been shut off on the Russian side of the line since the start of the war. That made Kursk the largest test bed for a Starlink-free Ukrainian military. Reports have found OneWeb provided Ukrainian soldiers with satellite internet in Kursk Oblast during their seven-month occupation of the Russian region. Starlink&#x2019;s nearest functional competitor, OneWeb has 648 satellites in orbit. OneWeb has not launched a new satellite since &#x201C;completing its fleet&#x201D; in March 2023. The fleet only has one satellite over Ukraine. OneWeb&#x2019;s satellites each provide a bandwidth of 7.2 gigabits per second, adding up to a network with a &#x201C;cumulative usable capacity of 1.1 terabits per second.&#x201D; Starlink&#x2019;s current V2 satellites offer 96 Gbps, and SpaceX claims that its V3 satellite under development will hit 1 Tbps per unit. As of the end of 2024, Starlink&#x2019;s total capacity was roughly 350 Tbps. A Terabit is 125,000 megabytes. Streaming a high-definition movie requires around 10 megabytes per second, meaning only 12,500 people worldwide could watch a movie at the same time on OneWeb. Curcio sees EutelStat&#x2019;s claims of stepping up in Ukraine as a way of patching up a long-tarnished reputation. &#x201C;They have been beaten down pretty badly because everyone thinks it&#x2019;s a complete cash sink,&#x201D; said Curcio. &#x201C;In addition to saying, &#x2018;Hey, we care about the Ukrainians,&#x2019; they&#x2019;re trying to show people that OneWeb is something that can actually work, because that&#x2019;s been a big challenge for them.&#x201D; OneWeb has been around for almost as long as Starlink but has not had an illustrious track record. EutelSat Group, formed following a merger with OneWeb near the end of 2023, has seen its share price collapse in the intervening years. It went up over 600% following comments by Eva Berneke that they are &#x201C;looking at&#x201D; replacing Starlink in Ukraine. A medic from Ukraine&apos;s 43rd Brigade stands next to a Starlink terminal at a base in Bakhmut District on April 19, 2023, in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. (Ed Ram/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)Starlink currently boasts 5 million users globally and over 42,000 terminals in Ukraine. Representatives for OneWeb declined to comment on their ability to replicate that scale but wrote in a statement to the Kyiv Independent that &#x201C;OneWeb solutions can provide an alternative for certain government and defense applications.&#x201D; OneWeb representatives would also not answer as to where to buy its terminals in Ukraine. On outside markets, they run upwards of $10,000. New Starlinks, for comparison, sell on Ukrainian online electronics stores for just over $400, compared to roughly $549 on U.S. Amazon. The numbers for other would-be EU competitors to Starlink are even grimmer. SES has a total of 70 satellites. Canadian firm Telesat is currently trying to get 198 satellites into orbit. They face remarkably slow launch times. These EU telecoms are unlikely to be able to expand coverage rapidly to cover Ukraine in the near term. &#x201C;It&apos;s not feasible because there&apos;s not enough spare satellites,&#x201D; says Curcio. &#x201C;There are other constellations in development that will be bigger in terms of mass, but OneWeb is the one that has actually achieved its fleet,&#x201D; says Juliana Suess, an associate at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, &#x201C;whereas Project Kuiper, IRIS&#xB2;, etc., they haven&apos;t got satellites up yet. So they&apos;re not really an alternative for now.&#x201D; The California-based Astranis is one firm that Curcio points to as more likely to be able to send a handful of satellites to Ukraine in the near future, largely because they do launches for relatively high-risk customers like the Peruvian satellite communications company Andesat, some of whom go broke and can no longer pay for Astranis&#x2019; service. Another military comms service called TooWay is a joint project between EutelSat and Viasat dating back to 2007 that Ukraine was already using before Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. &#x201C;With TooWay, the speed of transfer of this data and internet connection is very small. That is, you&#x2019;ll end up downloading one video for half a day,&#x201D; Volodymyr &#x201C;Tekhnar,&#x201D; a battalion commander for the 28th Mechanized Brigade who declined to provide his last name for security reasons, told the Kyiv Independent. A Starlink terminal gives connection to live drone images and information as the 59th Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces fires grad missiles on Russian positions on Dec. 30, 2022 in Donetsk, Ukraine. (Pierre Crom/Getty Images)Russia hacked and brought down Tooway an hour before attacking on Feb. 24, 2022, ultimately pushing Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces onto Starlink in the first place. Despite being a consumer technology, Starlink has also remained remarkably resistant to Russian electronic warfare. As a result, Ukraine today remains &#x201C;quite&#x201D; dependent on Starlink, said Suess. In the absence of Starlink, alternatives would, in effect, take Ukraine&#x2019;s front-line forces back in time from broadband to dial-up internet. It&#x2019;s not likely to destroy the Ukrainian line overnight. But Ukrainian soldiers would shortly face communications issues similar to those of their Russian counterparts, shrouding them in a thicker fog of war. &#x201C;We are prepared for the event that the Starlink network goes down. We may not have super speeds, but let&apos;s just say that we will be able to watch online as time goes on,&#x201D; said Tekhnar. Starlink has been geofenced to skirt the Russian line since before the outset of the full-scale war. Russian acquisition of limited access hastened advances like that on Vuhledar this past fall. Conversely, the Ukrainian advance near the end of 2022 slowed as Ukrainian forces pushed forward faster than Starlink was restoring coverage to areas previously blocked as being under Russian occupation. Much of the souring of the relationship between Ukraine and Musk began with Musk refusing a Ukrainian request to turn on Starlink to allow a military operation in Crimea. Ukraine on its own has a handful of satellites in orbit, mostly of a tiny experimental variety. As of the end of 2024, Russian state-owned space firm RosKosmos tallied 288 satellites in orbit. Suess noted that most Russian satellites &#x201C;don&#x2019;t look like they&apos;re suitable for tactical communications.&#x201D; &#x201C;Some of the communication satellites that Russia has that were used by the intelligence service, for example, were purely mailbox satellites,&#x201D; she explained. &#x201C;So you send up a signal or a message, and then you have to wait for that satellite to just come back around to the ground station in however many hours.&#x201D; Like Russia, Ukraine without Starlink will have to depend more on data streams that are narrower and more vulnerable to interference, including frequency bands of cell service reserved for military and greater reliance on on-the-ground radio comms like walkie talkies, as well as civilian cell towers that often behave erratically at the front. Streaming and sharing high-resolution footage of drone attacks would become a largely untenable luxury. Further into the future, however, the most likely alternative to Starlink for both Russia and Ukraine is not European but Chinese. The first alternative to Starlink that came to mind for Colonel Khazan was G60 Starlink, also known as the Thousand Sails, a network of satellites from the Chinese company SpaceSail. &#x201C;The most relevant company by far is SpaceSail,&#x201D; agreed Curcio. &#x201C;In the last year and a bit, they&apos;ve now launched 72 satellites, and I guess more importantly, they&apos;ve entered a handful of forward markets in different ways.&#x201D; After years of Chinese state projects falling short of launch goals, the government gave &#x201C;the green flag for somewhat private investment&#x201D; into the telecom industry at the end of 2023, Curcio said. SpaceSail was the primary beneficiary. The firm is, however, barred from providing services within China and has a strictly international aim. &#x201C;Give them 18 months and SpaceSail will probably be able to get a couple tens of gigabits per second, maybe, of capacity over that general part of the world at any given time &#x2014; maybe more. Maybe a hundred,&#x201D; said Curcio of Ukraine. This is, however, not likely to benefit Ukraine in the long term. Ukrainian government agencies have in recent years purged Chinese telecoms equipment like Huawei from their networks since the start of the war. Chinese companies routinely provide Russia with high-tech services and equipment that the U.S. and EU ban. In January, SpaceSail set up a subsidiary in Kazakhstan, a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States and a long-time eager intermediary for Russian sanctions evasion. SpaceSail&#x2019;s ongoing launches are consequently more likely to give Russian soldiers in Ukraine internet services that Ukrainian soldiers have long enjoyed than they are to help Ukraine move beyond Starlink.

Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant part of peace talks, Trump says	Washington has discussed with Ukraine the control of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant as part of a potential peace deal, U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 13. Trump&apos;s remarks come days after Kyiv agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia did as well. The talks also concerned potential territorial concessions, according to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said that Ukraine and the U.S. had discussed a lot of details of the final deal, including &quot;concepts of land.&quot; &quot;We have been discussing with Ukraine land and pieces of land that would be kept and lost and all of the other elements of a final agreement,&quot; Trump said. &quot;There&apos;s a power plant involved, a very big power plant involved. Who is going to get the power plant, and who is going to get this and that, and so you know it&apos;s not an easy process. But phase one is the ceasefire,&quot; he added. The largest nuclear plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in the city of Enerhodar, has been under Russian occupation since 2022. While the facility remains under Russian control, it is not currently generating electricity. Ukraine and its allies have repeatedly urged Russia to withdraw its troops from the plant. Throughout its occupation, the plant has been repeatedly disconnected from the Ukrainian power grid due to Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure. Russian forces currently occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine, from where reports of systematic repression, torture, and forced deportations emerge.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-occupied-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-part-of-peace-talks-trump-says/	2025-03-13T10:51:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1255012375.jpg
John Bolton on Trumpâ€™s Russian policy missteps	The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Kate Tsurkan sat down with former U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton to discuss why U.S. President Donald Trump considers Putin &#x201C;a friend,&#x201D; and why a ceasefire at this time would not be favorable for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/john-bolton-on-trumps-russian-policy-missteps/	2025-03-13T10:26:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_1337.JPG
BREAKING: Putin ready for ceasefire but demands 'guarantees' depriving Ukraine of aid	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. Russia is ready to agree to the U.S.-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine but demands guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops, nor receive military aid during it, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on March 13. Speaking at a press conference with Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, Putin said that the end of hostilities should &quot;address the original causes of the crisis,&quot; parroting the Kremlin&apos;s long-standing narrative about its all-out war against Ukraine. Kyiv agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia did as well. The talks in Saudi Arabia also led to the U.S. restarting key military and intelligence support for Ukraine, which had been halted last week. According to Putin, the proposed temporary truce must be designed in a way to lead to a long-term peace. He said that Russia wants guarantees that Ukraine will not mobilize or train soldiers, as well as won&apos;t receive weapons during the 30-day ceasefire.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-ready-for-ceasefire-but-demands-guarantees-depriving-ukraine-of-aid/	2025-03-13T09:15:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/03/GettyImages-1249872830.jpg
Russia seeks to prolong war, Zelensky says about lack of clear response to proposed ceasefire	Russia is trying to delay peace for as long as possible, given the lack of its clear position on a proposed 30-day ceasefire, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 13. Kyiv agreed to a temporary ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia did as well. The talks in Saudi Arabia also led to the U.S. restarting key military and intelligence support for Ukraine. Yuri Ushakov, a Russian presidential aide, said earlier on March 13 that the Kremlin was prioritizing a long-term settlement over a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine but the final position is up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to Zelensky, Kyiv is committed to moving quickly toward peace and is prepared to do its part in creating &quot;all of the conditions for a reliable, durable, and decent peace.&quot; &quot;Regrettably, for more than a day already, the world has yet to hear a meaningful response from Russia to the proposals made,&quot; he said. &quot;This once again demonstrates that Russia seeks to prolong the war and postpone peace for as long as possible.&quot; The U.S. is ready to organize the technical aspects of control over the temporary truce, Zelensky said. He voiced hope that Washington&apos;s pressure would be &quot;sufficient&quot; to compel Russia to end its all-out war. Zelensky&apos;s remarks come as U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, arrived in Moscow for talks on the proposed 30-day ceasefire. Witkoff is expected to meet Putin later in the day, who is unlikely to agree to a temporary truce in Ukraine, according to Reuters. The news agency reported on March 12, citing undisclosed Russian sources, that Moscow feels it has the upper hand on the battlefield and viewing the ceasefire as a trap. The ceasefire proposal coincided with Russia&apos;s breakthrough in Kursk Oblast. Moscow claimed on March 12 to have retaken over 86% of seized territories in the region, including a key town of Sudzha, captured by Ukrainian troops at the start of the Kursk incursion in August 2024. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi acknowledged the &quot;difficult situation&quot; in the region but said that Ukraine will hold the defenses &quot;as long as reasonable and necessary.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-seeks-to-prolong-war-zelensky-says-about-lack-of-clear-response-to-proposed-ceasefire/	2025-03-13T08:07:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204066732.jpg
The Counteroffensive: What Trump's intelligence sharing pause cost Ukraine	For nearly a week, Ukraine was left in the dark by its once-close ally, deprived of American intelligence as Russia advanced. Civilians suffered missile and drone attacks, while the military faced Russian offensives. All of this was aimed at forcing Ukraine into a &quot;peace&quot; agreement. &quot;(With U.S. President Donald Trump), there is a swing that goes back and forth. To be honest, I don&apos;t know what will happen next,&quot;said Maksym*, a Ukrainian soldier working with intelligence. After a weeklong pause, U.S. intelligence sharing resumed during talks between the U.S. and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia on March 11. During the hiatus, Ukraine&#x2019;s position weakened as Russian forces captured more territory and launched terror attacks on civilians. On March 8, for example, Russia launched a massive missile and drone attack on Odesa, hitting the port and civilian targets. This pause demonstrated that the U.S. was willing to cut its partner off from vital intelligence, even as Ukraine faced escalating threats. &#x201C;This is not Mean Girls. This is not some episode of some television show. This is very serious,&#x201D; said U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, announcing the resumption of intelligence sharing. Someone should remind him that it was his administration&#x2019;s actions that put people&#x2019;s lives in danger due to a political dispute. Trust is hard to build and easy to lose. Ukraine will never fully trust the Trump administration again, and every day will bring new worries about whether another slip of the tongue could lead to another suspension of support. This isn&#x2019;t &quot;deal-making&quot; as the Trump White House might frame it. It&#x2019;s hostage-taking, the worst kind: preventing long-time allies from defending themselves against a deadly foe. &quot;Of course, we were upset. That goes without saying. The lack of intelligence sharing brings a lot of problems,&quot; Maksym told The Counteroffensive. Before the war, Maksym worked in IT, with no military background. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion, he woke to a strange sound: &quot;Who sets off fireworks at five in the morning?&quot; It didn&#x2019;t take long to realize that those weren&#x2019;t fireworks. Worried that Russian forces might invade his home region of Rivne, bordering Belarus, Maksym left Kyiv to join Ukraine&apos;s territorial defense. Over the past three years, he&#x2019;s taken on multiple roles: training troops on drone operations, becoming an air defense specialist, and eventually working in intelligence. He now focuses on open-source intelligence and automating processes within Ukraine&#x2019;s military. While the exact sources of Ukraine&apos;s intelligence are unclear, Politico estimates that 80% of it comes from foreign sources, with the majority provided by the U.S. Specifically, the U.S. supplies Ukraine with radar data, satellite imagery, and alerts about Russian aircraft or missile launches. Thankfully, no one interviewed by The Counteroffensive considered the suspension of U.S. intelligence to be an irreversible catastrophe. Although this pause significantly hampered Ukrainian operations, Kyiv could still gather intelligence from its own drones, radio interceptions, and by working with other countries. However, U.S. intelligence had never been fully comprehensive. Washington shared only a portion of its data with Ukraine and sometimes did so with delays.

(Diego Fedele/Getty Images)The U.S. advantage is its unrivaled dominance in military satellite reconnaissance. With nearly 250 military satellites, the U.S. conducts near real-time surveillance. NATO countries combined have just about 50. For Ukraine, the suspension of satellite imagery from U.S.-based Maxar was particularly critical. Though Ukraine could purchase satellite imagery on its own, the cost was high. Maxar provides 90% of U.S. geospatial intelligence and can capture key locations every 3-4 hours with high resolution &#x2014; capabilities few others can match. &quot;We could see, for example, a Russian convoy moving toward a certain location, allowing us to prepare in advance. But now, our troops are somewhat &apos;blind,&apos;&quot; Maksym said before U.S. intelligence sharing resumed. Ukraine still had two satellites of its own and one provided by Germany, but Maxar&#x2019;s contributions were far more comprehensive. During the pause, France offered some assistance, though its capabilities were far more limited. French satellites specialize in electromagnetic spectrum monitoring, which can detect Russian activity. Additionally, suspending intelligence sharing complicated the use of U.S. weapons like the HIMARS precision-guided missile system, which relies heavily on American intelligence. Ukrainian forces have used HIMARS to disrupt Russian supply routes and destroy ammunition depots. However, without U.S. data, Ukrainian troops had to rely on their own drones for targeting. According to Oleksii Teplukhin, CEO of the Ukrainian AI startup Griselda, intelligence pauses like this severely hinder Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to plan deep strikes inside Russia. &quot;To take out an (Russian) oil depot, you don&#x2019;t just need to know where it&#x2019;s located. You need more detailed intelligence &#x2014; what was there last week, the exact position of the rectification column [a technological apparatus used for separating mixtures], and so on,&quot; Oleksii told The Counteroffensive. But the suspension didn&#x2019;t just impact the military. Civilians paid the price too. &quot;I&#x2019;m glad U.S. support has been restored. At the very least, it will help our air defense because, over the past few days, both drones and missiles have heavily terrorized cities like Dnipro and Odesa,&quot; Maksym said. Despite the setbacks, Maksym doesn&#x2019;t consider Americans enemies. He&#x2019;s puzzled by the motivations behind the White House&#x2019;s decisions. Going forward, though, he believes Ukraine will take steps to reduce its reliance on the U.S. and look more toward European allies, such as NATO, for intelligence. Ukraine has learned a vital lesson: it can&#x2019;t rely solely on others for its survival. Just as Kyiv developed its own long-range weapons when Western allies hesitated, it&#x2019;s likely to seek independent solutions for intelligence. &quot;The U.S. is a huge country, and any mistakes or inaccuracies on its part affect the entire world. It&#x2019;s like a voodoo doll for the whole planet,&quot; Maksym said. The name of the military service member has been changed for security reasons.

Ukraine receives $1.7 billion from Canada under G7 loan covered by Russian assets	Ukraine has received the first tranche of 2.5 billion Canadian dollars (about $1.7 billion) from Ottawa under the G7&apos;s Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) initiative, the Ukrainian Finance Ministry announced on March 13. The ERA mechanism, totaling $50 billion, provides loans to Ukraine that will be repaid using future profits from frozen Russian assets. According to the ministry, Canada&apos;s contribution to the initiative is $3.5 billion, and the loan will be granted for 30 years. &quot;Canada is a reliable and steadfast partner of Ukraine. I am grateful for the support of the ERA mechanism. It is a fair and necessary tool to hold Russia financially accountable for its crimes in Ukraine,&quot; Ukrainian Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko said. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, G7 countries have frozen approximately $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets. The ERA initiative, backed primarily by the U.S. and the EU, aims to use profits from these frozen assets to finance Ukraine&apos;s defense and reconstruction. In addition to the Canadian contribution, Kyiv received 752 million pounds ($970 million) as the first installment of the U.K.&apos;s contribution to the G7 loan, as Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on March 7.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-receives-1-7-billion-from-canada-under-g7-loan-covered-by-russian-assets/	2025-03-13T06:58:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2201099727.jpg
Putin has likely rejected Trump's ceasefire proposal â€” what now?	It looks like Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected the 30-day ceasefire proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump on the war against Ukraine. According to the Financial Times, citing an unnamed senior aide to Putin, Moscow does not want a temporary ceasefire and is pushing for a long-term peace settlement that will &quot;take into account its interests and concerns.&quot; Trump promised tough action against Russia if it failed to engage in peace talks over Ukraine. He suggested escalating military support for Ukraine and imposing severe sanctions on Russia in response. Keep in mind that when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky voiced similar skepticism about a temporary ceasefire and called for more substantive talks before pursuing long-term peace, he was harshly criticized. In that now-infamous Oval Office moment, Trump berated Zelensky for not being serious about peace, even threatening to cut military and intelligence support for Ukraine. This decision cost real lives. So what will Trump do now? Putin has just smashed the ball back into Trump&#x2019;s court, and now the president is scrambling to keep the game going. His next move will be crucial in signaling to all parties, particularly Putin, whether Trump is really willing to use a &quot;stick&quot; approach against Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) walks past a guard before a meeting with Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashshenko at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, on March 13, 2025. (Maxim Shemetov/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)Putin can smell weakness. He&#x2019;s seen it throughout the negotiation process with Trump, who already gave away much of his negotiating leverage before any talks even began &#x2014; promising Russia could keep all the territory it currently occupies, agreeing to no NATO membership for Ukraine, no security guarantees for Ukraine, and a quick lift on sanctions. Putin will likely exploit this weakness and Trump&#x2019;s apparent desire to win Putin&#x2019;s favor at Ukraine&#x2019;s expense. Putin&#x2019;s modus operandi in negotiations, both on Ukraine and with the West, has always been to use talks as a leverage point to secure concessions. He sees negotiations as a way to probe for weaknesses and demand concessions. His instinct here will be to play hard to get, drag talks out to show strength, or imply that Russia doesn&#x2019;t need a ceasefire &#x2014; the other side is the one that really wants it. The danger for Putin is that if he pushes too hard, drags things out too long, he risks angering Trump. The assumption here is that the U.S. would boost military support for Ukraine and increase sanctions on Russia. However, given that the Trump administration has thus far taken a carrot-and-stick approach &#x2014; offering carrots to Russia and sticks to Ukraine &#x2014; it&#x2019;s unclear whether Trump has the resolve to really take on Putin. If I have doubts, so does Putin, and he will likely test the U.S. position in these ceasefire talks. Understanding the Trump administration&#x2019;s willingness to play hardball now will be useful for Putin later when more substantive talks begin. Is Trump truly willing to play tough with Putin to secure peace in Ukraine?

Kyiv Mayor Klitschko announces more dismissals of city officials amid corruption probe	Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko announced further dismissals of top city officials on March 13 amid a widening corruption probe into land dealings in the capital. The dismissals follow revelations from Ukraine&apos;s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&apos;s Office (SAPO), which released recordings of Kyiv officials allegedly involved in fraudulent land schemes. &quot;Regarding the latest high-profile news concerning the capital&apos;s land sector, the city provides law enforcement officers with all requested documents and facilitates the investigation,&quot; Klitschko wrote on Facebook. The following officials are set to be dismissed: Ihor Dolinsky, director of the Kyiv Institute of Land Relations; Volodymyr Sharyi, director of the special housing fund; Viktor Pohrebnoi, director of the Financial Company Zhytloinvest; and Valentina Sviatina, deputy director of the Department of Urban Planning and Architecture, Klitschko said. Klitschko previously announced on Feb. 28 that Yurii Leonov, deputy director of the city&apos;s special housing fund, Oleksii Mushta, deputy head of an urban infrastructure management agency, and Petro Olenych, deputy head of the Kyiv City Administration, are also being fired. Kyiv city council member and chairman of the land commission Mykhailo Terentiev has written a letter of resignation from the Engineering Center communal enterprise director post. &quot;Also, the Udar political party faction recalls him from the Kyiv council deputies,&quot; Klitschko added. Investigators claim the suspects registered ownership of non-existent buildings to obtain land plots without a fair tender. Olenych was previously detained in February, with the High Anti-Corruption Court setting bail at Hr 15 million (nearly $360,000). He was released on Feb. 21 and claimed that his family had borrowed money for bail while he planned to seek suspension from office during the investigation. Authorities have charged 10 individuals in the case, seven of whom have been detained. The alleged mastermind, former Kyiv City Council member Denys Komarnytskyi, remains on Ukraine&apos;s wanted list.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-mayor-klitschko-fires-top-officials-amid-corruption-probe/	2025-03-13T06:44:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2198905810.jpg
Kyiv sees no surprises as Russia signals its rejection of US-backed ceasefire proposal	Russia is signaling its intention to reject a U.S. ceasefire proposal already accepted by Ukraine in Jeddah this week, setting the stage for a likely diplomatic standoff between Washington and Moscow. After nearly 48 hours of silence on the issue, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov on March 13 dismissed the idea of a ceasefire, describing it as a &quot;respite for the Ukrainian military&quot; and adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin would comment on the matter later in the day. Following weeks of tumultuous talks and meetings, including the now infamous Oval Office showdown, Ukrainian and U.S. officials on March 11 emerged from talks in Saudi Arabia in agreement over a ceasefire proposal. Kyiv said it was ready to accept a 30-day-long ceasefire if Russia did as well. In the words of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Kyiv&#x2019;s readiness meant the &quot;ball is in (Russia&apos;s) court,&quot; adding that if the Kremlin rejected the proposal, &quot;then we&apos;ll, unfortunately, know what the impediment is to peace here.&quot; In response to Ushakov&#x2019;s statement, a source in the President&apos;s Office told the Kyiv Independent that it is &#x201C;awaiting what Putin will say.&#x201D; The source added that it would be &quot;a question for the Americans&quot; if Putin rejects the U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal. The potential rejection came as no surprise in Kyiv. &quot;Putin is absolutely not interested in peace or a true ceasefire,&quot; lawmaker Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of the parliament&apos;s foreign affairs committee, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;On the other hand, he is afraid of (U.S. President Donald) Trump. So, he will try to formulate his response to Trump&apos;s proposal as a sort of agreement but with unacceptable demands.&quot; The expectation in Kyiv &#x2014; as well as in other Western capitals &#x2014; is that Putin will not back down from the maximalist demands he set out at the beginning of his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;Putin has not backed off one iota from his maximalist demands, which we all know, (includes) the four (oblasts) of eastern Ukraine, and the neutralization of Ukraine,&quot; General Sir Richard Shirreff, former deputy supreme allied NATO commander Europe, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;In other words, no NATO, the demilitarization of Ukraine, the &apos;denazification&apos; of Ukraine, by which he means installing a puppet government.&quot; Russia is set to demand Ukraine withdraw from areas of the four oblasts &#x2014; Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk &#x2014; it illegally annexed in 2022 despite not fully controlling them. The future of any peace process now hinges on Trump&apos;s response. The U.S. has a lot less leverage than it did just a few weeks ago. The Trump administration has ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine and said Kyiv must be prepared to concede territory. These moves were described by Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia and professor of international studies at Stanford University, as &quot;giving away all your strongest cards before the negotiation has started.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s an incredibly bad negotiating strategy on behalf of the Trump team,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent earlier this week. Ukraine has largely accepted that it won&apos;t be joining NATO in time to make a difference to the ongoing peace talks, but the issue of territorial concessions is still in play. Although Kyiv may be forced to agree to some sort of territorial concessions, it has previously rejected a full withdrawal from all four oblasts. Putin, however, said such a move would be a prerequisite for peace talks. These mutually incompatible viewpoints mean Trump will be forced to step in and mediate, though what exactly he will do &#x2014; and which side he&apos;ll come down on hardest &#x2014; remains to be seen. &quot;Trump&apos;s got to do something; otherwise, he&apos;ll look very weak,&quot; Shirreff said. Now, the U.S.&apos;s strongest hand remains economic pressure in the form of sanctions, something Trump has already threatened Russia with if they don&apos;t agree to the ceasefire proposal. John Herbst, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, told the Kyiv Independent that this puts immense pressure on Trump to follow through. &quot;If he suddenly makes a new demand on Ukraine because Russia is asking for it, he looks like Putin&apos;s poodle,&quot; he said. But there&apos;s always the possibility Trump could impose Putin&apos;s maximalist demands on Ukraine, something Shirref said would have enormous consequences for the entire world. &quot;If the international community signed up to that, it would mean the absolute final nail in the coffin of the international rules-based order,&quot; he said. &quot;Because it means that might is right, and that Putin has got what he wants by appalling force.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-sees-no-surprises-as-russia-signals-its-rejection-of-us-backed-ceasefire-proposal/	2025-03-13T06:37:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202985151.jpg
Putin aide claims NATO 'threatens' Russia in Baltic	Russian presidential aide Nikolai Patrushev claimed on March 13 that NATO is deliberately &quot;escalating&quot; tensions in the Baltic region, portraying the alliance as a threat to Russia&apos;s security. His comments come amid NATO&apos;s warnings that Russia may be ramping up hybrid operations in the region. Several undersea cables were damaged in recent months, leading the alliance to increase its presence in the Baltic Sea. Speaking to National Defense, a Russian military and political magazine, Patrushev alleged that NATO&apos;s naval forces are working to &quot;block&quot; Russia in the Baltic while ignoring diplomatic engagement with Moscow. Patrushev further accused the alliance, particularly the U.K., of provoking instability in the region. &quot;The forecast of the situation in the Baltic allows us to draw attention to the deliberate fomentation of regional tensions by the naval forces of European countries of the alliance,&quot; he said. Patrushev also claimed, without evidence, that NATO is conducting cyberattacks on Russian ships&apos; navigation systems to create maritime emergencies, including accidents and infrastructure failures. While Russian-linked vessels have been detained in connection to damaged Baltic Sea cables, Western intelligence agencies remain divided on whether they were acts of sabotage or accidental damage. Tensions between NATO and Russia have risen following Moscow&apos;s all-out attack against Ukraine. Western leaders and intelligence agencies have warned of a potential large-scale war in Europe within the next five years, citing Russia&apos;s increasingly aggressive posture.	https://kyivindependent.com/putins-aide-blames-nato-for-escalating-tensions-in-the-baltic/	2025-03-13T06:07:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1245767486.jpg
ECHR rules Ukraine failed to prevent, investigate violence in Odesa in 2014	The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled on March 13 that the Ukrainian government failed to prevent and adequately investigate deadly clashes between the EuroMaidan supporters and opponents in Odesa in May 2014. The ruling concerns seven applications filed by 28 individuals &#x2014; 25 relatives of the victims and three survivors &#x2014; between 2016 and 2018. Forty-eight people died in the violence that erupted between the two camps on May 2, 2014. A group of pro-Russian activists attacked a pro-EuroMaidan rally but retreated to the Trade Unions House after the ensuing violence. Forty-two of the EuroMaidan opponents died after the building caught fire as the two groups began throwing petrol bombs. Two pro-Ukrainian activists were also killed after suffering gunshot wounds. The ruling noted &quot;authorities&#x2019; failure to do everything that could reasonably be expected of them to prevent the violence in Odesa on 2 May 2014, to stop that violence after its outbreak, to ensure timely rescue measures for people trapped in the fire, and to institute and conduct an effective investigation into the events.&quot; The ECHR noted that Russian propaganda helped to instigate the clashes but acknowledged the applicants&apos; complaints that Ukraine failed to prevent the violence and adequately investigate it. The Ukrainian state was ordered to pay out compensations. The plaintiffs included relatives of victims from both camps, all of whom accused the Ukrainian state of inaction. Russian propaganda has heavily employed the violent episode in Odesa to vilify the EuroMaidan Revolution and falsely paint the movement as pro-Nazi and extremist. The EuroMaidan Revolution began in November 2013 when people gathered at Maidan Nezalezhnosti, Kyiv&apos;s central square, to protest pro-Kremlin President Viktor Yanukovych&apos;s refusal to sign the long-awaited Association Agreement with the European Union. Law enforcement officers, namely Berkut riot police, used violence to suppress the protests, including lethal force. More than 100 people were killed during the revolution, which culminated in Yanukovych fleeing to Russia. &quot;The Court noted that distortion of the events in Odesa had eventually become a tool of Russian propaganda in respect of the war waged by the Russian Federation against Ukraine since February 2022,&quot; the ECHR&apos;s ruling said. &quot;Enhanced transparency in the related investigative work by the Ukrainian authorities might have helped to prevent or counteract that propaganda effectively.&quot; The court noted that the investigation should have been &quot;carried out by an organ entirely independent from the police.&quot; At the same time, the ECHR dismissed allegations that the authorities were not impartial when investigating the deaths of EuroMaidan opponents and supporters.	https://kyivindependent.com/echr-rules-ukraine-failed-to-prevent-violence-in-odesa-in-2014/	2025-03-13T05:40:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-458286736.jpg
Top Putin aide opposes temporary ceasefire, calls it 'respite' for Ukraine	The Kremlin is prioritizing a long-term settlement over a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov said on March 13, calling the U.S. truce proposal a &quot;respite for the Ukrainian military.&quot; His remarks come as U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, reportedly arrived in Moscow for talks on a proposed 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to provide further comments on March 13. &quot;We believe that our goal is a long-term peaceful settlement, and we are striving for that, a peaceful settlement that takes into account the legitimate interests of our country and our known concerns,&quot; Ushakov said on state television. Ushakov added that he outlined Russia&apos;s position on the ceasefire to U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. &quot;I outlined our position that this (ceasefire) is nothing more than a temporary respite for the Ukrainian military, nothing more,&quot; Ushakov said. Waltz and Ushakov also agreed that Ukraine&apos;s potential NATO accession cannot be part of the peace settlement debate, Putin&apos;s aide claimed. The Trump administration has previously called Kyiv&apos;s prospects of joining the alliance unrealistic, while Russia has named a ban on Ukraine&apos;s entry as one of the key conditions in any negotiations. Asked about Witkoff&#x2019;s possible arrival in Moscow, Ushakov declined to comment, saying, &quot;We agreed that this kind of contact would be of a closed nature.&quot; Kyiv agreed to the U.S. proposal during negotiations in Jeddah on March 11, after which Washington resumed military and intelligence support for Ukraine. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham called for sanctions against Russia if Moscow refuses a proposed ceasefire. He promised to introduce new congressional measures targeting Russia and nations that continue to buy Russian goods, including oil, gas, and uranium. In the past, Moscow ruled out a temporary ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. Russian nationalist voices and pro-war bloggers have already spoken out against the U.S.-backed proposal. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed that U.S. officials are in Moscow but did not disclose Russia&apos;s position on the ceasefire proposal.	https://kyivindependent.com/ushakov-comments-on-ceasefire/	2025-03-13T04:34:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2160070185.jpg
Finland announces $217 million military aid package for Ukraine	Finland has announced its 28th military aid package for Ukraine, valued at approximately 200 million euros ($217.4 million), the Finnish Defense Ministry said on March 13. Finnish Defense Minister Antti Hakkanen confirmed that the package includes artillery ammunition, citing Ukraine&apos;s urgent need for such supplies. &quot;There is broad political support and national unanimity on the issue of assistance to Ukraine,&quot; Hakkanen said. The announcement comes as U.S. President Donald Trump urges Europe to take greater responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security while sending mixed signals on whether European allies should be involved in peace negotiations. During a meeting with Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, Hakkanen signed a memorandum of understanding on deepening defense cooperation. The agreement covers defense materiel, intelligence sharing, research and innovation, and munitions production. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Finland has provided Ukraine with 2.5 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in defense aid. On Feb. 26, Helsinki pledged an additional 660 million euros ($691 million) in military assistance, including domestically produced equipment.	https://kyivindependent.com/finland-announces-over-200-million-military-aid-package-for-ukraine/	2025-03-13T04:15:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2064209173--1-.jpg
Rheinmetall prepared to supply arms for possible Ukraine peacekeeping mission	German defense company Rheinmetall is prepared to supply weapons for a potential international peacekeeping mission in Ukraine following the end of Russia&#x2019;s war, the company&apos;s CEO, Armin Papperger, said on March 12, Deutsche Welle reported. Papperger said that Rheinmetall could provide &quot;more than 2,000 items&quot; for such a mission, including tanks, armored vehicles, electronic warfare systems, reconnaissance drones, and satellite technology for monitoring a demarcation line. Several European countries, including the U.K., France, Denmark, and Sweden, have previously expressed willingness to deploy peacekeepers to Ukraine. The Washington Post reported on Feb. 17 that up to 30,000 European troops could be involved in the ceasefire monitoring mission. Papperger noted that the talks remain theoretical for now, with no concrete negotiations underway with the company. While U.S. President Donald Trump claimed on Feb. 24 that Russian President Vladimir Putin would allow European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a peace deal, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has rejected the idea. Rheinmetall is one of Europe&#x2019;s largest arms manufacturers and a key supplier to Ukraine. Under German government contracts, it delivers 155 mm artillery rounds, Leopard 1 tanks, mortar shells, and surveillance drones. The company also opened a military vehicle repair facility in Ukraine in June 2024 and plans to build three additional plants in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/rheinmetall-prepared-to-supply-arms-for-possible-ukraine-peacekeeping-mission/	2025-03-13T03:52:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2076692591.jpg
Ukrainian drones strike covert UAV plant in western Russia, sources claim	Ukrainian military intelligence drones (HUR) attacked a camouflaged drone production facility in Kaluga Oblast late on March 12, HUR sources confirmed for the Kyiv Independent. Drone production lines were located on the grounds of an aerated concrete plant in the village of Obukhovo in Kaluga Oblast&apos;s Dzerzhinsky district, one of the sources claimed. Kyiv has carried out regular long-range drone strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia&apos;s rear, seeking to undermine its ability to wage its all-out war. The statement comes after Kaluga Oblast Governor Vladislav Shapsha said that 25 drones were downed over the region overnight, with drone wreckage setting fire to an unspecified industrial facility in Dzerzhinsky district. One employee suffered minor injuries, and the fire has been extinguished, according to Shapsha. Locals reported powerful explosions and a fire at the plant on social media. Drone debris also damaged a cell tower and a power line in the Khvastovichsky district, the southernmost part of Kaluga Oblast, Shapsha said. Russian air defenses downed 77 drones overnight, including 30 over Bryansk Oblast, six over Kursk and Voronezh oblasts each, and five over Rostov and Belgorod oblasts each, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. An unspecified infrastructure facility was also damaged on the evening of March 12 in Voronezh Oblast, a region bordering Ukraine&apos;s Luhansk Oblast, Governor Alexander Gusev said on his Telegram channel. The targeted facility was part of the region&apos;s gas infrastructure, the Baza Telegram channel reported, citing residents. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Airports in Penza, Saratov, and Volgograd imposed temporary flight restrictions overnight, Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency announced.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-strike-covert-uav-plant-in-western-russia-source-confirms/	2025-03-13T03:43:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/chasiv-yar-4.jpg
UK, France lead talks among 37 countries on 'coalition of the willing' in Ukraine, Bloomberg reports	London and Paris are leading discussions among 37 countries from Europe, Asia, and the Commonwealth on shielding Ukraine against any future Russian aggression in case of a peace settlement, Bloomberg reported on March 13, citing official sources. The &quot;coalition of the willing,&quot; which would provide security guarantees to Kyiv by sending peacekeeping troops, aircraft, or other support, was first presented by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer during the London summit on March 2, which hosted leaders of European nations and Canada. Officials from Australia, Japan, and New Zealand joined a follow-up meeting in Paris on March 11, expanding the potential coalition beyond the confines of NATO and Europe, undisclosed sources told Bloomberg. The U.S., which seeks to scale back its involvement in the Russia-Ukraine war and ruled out deployment of its own peacekeepers in the country, was not part of the discussions. The Trump administration has adopted a more confrontational stance toward Kyiv and Europe while seeking a reset of relations with Moscow. Kyiv&apos;s partners nevertheless hope to form a unified strategy to present to U.S. President Donald Trump and persuade him to commit some form of security guarantees, such as airpower or intelligence support, Bloomberg wrote. The coalition aims to form a &quot;reassurance force&quot; as a key security guarantee for Ukraine. Members who are reluctant to send their own troops to Ukraine can instead deploy soldiers to neighboring countries or provide ships, aircraft, intelligence, tanks, or other support, according to the outlet. Further details are to be discussed during a follow-up meeting this weekend. Russia has repeatedly rejected any presence of NATO peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a potential peace deal. Moscow has also been evasive on the issue of a 30-day ceasefire agreed upon between the U.S. and Ukraine. European countries have welcomed the proposed truce but stressed that security guarantees must be part of any stable peace deal. France, the U.K., and Germany also oppose Russia&apos;s efforts to demilitarize Ukraine, seeing the Ukrainian Armed Forces as the best possible security guarantee.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-france-lead-talks-between-37-countries-on-coalition-of-the-willing-in-ukraine-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-13T03:17:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2199562383.jpg
Trump's envoy Witkoff reportedly lands in Moscow as US seeks Russian agreement on ceasefire	A plane carrying Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s special envoy to the Middle East, has landed in Moscow, Russian pro-government media Interfax reported on March 13, citing aviation services. Witkoff&#x2019;s visit comes as the U.S. seeks Russian agreement on a proposed 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, which Kyiv accepted during talks in Jeddah on March 11. Washington subsequently resumed military and intelligence support for Ukraine after suspending it the previous week. The White House has not confirmed whether Trump plans to call Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the proposal. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has confirmed that U.S. negotiators are traveling to Russia but declined to reveal Moscow&apos;s position on the ceasefire proposal. U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz reportedly held a phone conversation with his Russian counterpart on March 12, and Witkoff is expected to meet with Russian officials, possibly including Putin, in Moscow. Witkoff previously traveled to Moscow in February for the release of U.S. teacher Marc Fogel from a Russian prison. Witkoff claimed he spoke directly with Putin for over three hours during his visit. According to Reuters, some U.S. officials and analysts fear Moscow could exploit the truce to deepen divisions between Washington, Kyiv, and their European allies while regrouping for further offensives.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-envoy-witkoff-reportely-lands-in-moscow-as-us-seeks-russian-approval-for-ceasefire/	2025-03-13T03:07:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196945288.jpg
Russian diesel exports to Africa reportedly plummet amid Ukrainian drone strikes	Russia has sharply reduced diesel exports to Africa following repeated Ukrainian drone attacks on its oil refineries, Russian pro-state media outlet RBC reported on March 13. Russian diesel exports to African countries nearly halved in February, dropping from 1.27 million tons in January to 684,000 tons, according to a report by the Price Index Center research project reviewed by RBC. Exports to Brazil fell by 41%, while deliveries to Turkey, Russia&apos;s largest diesel export market, declined by 12% to 1.13 million tons. &quot;The decline in exports is due to an increase in the number of incidents at refineries,&quot; the analysts said, referencing Ukrainian drone strikes. On March 10, Ukrainian military intelligence confirmed it had struck the Novokuybyshevsk oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Samara Oblast. A day earlier, a Ukrainian drone reportedly hit an oil depot in Cheboksary, Chuvashia Republic &#x2014; marking the first attack on the region. Ukraine considers Russian oil infrastructure a legitimate military target, arguing that fossil fuel revenues fund Moscow&apos;s war effort. Kyiv has systematically targeted Russian refineries, military sites, and logistics hubs to weaken Moscow&apos;s capacity to continue its full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-diesel-exports-to-africa-reportedly-plummet-amid-ukrainian-drone-strikes/	2025-03-13T02:48:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
Russia claims to retake Sudzha; Ukraine hasn't confirmed	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russian forces have retaken Sudzha, a key stronghold of Ukrainian troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on March 13. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claim. As of late March 12, the Ukrainian military confirmed battles in the Sudzha area. Ukrainian troops had captured Sudzha, a town of 6,000 residents some 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s border, at the start of the Kursk incursion in August 2024. Military analysts from the DeepState monitoring group and the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank have also reported that Russia has partially or fully seized Sudzha, as Ukraine is allegedly withdrawing from the town. The news comes at the heels of a rapid Russian advance in the border region that seemed to have greatly diminished the Ukrainian salient. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, said on March 12 that Russia has retaken more than 86% of the territory in Kursk Oblast captured by Kyiv in mid-2024. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi acknowledged the &quot;difficult situation&quot; in the region but said that Ukraine will hold the defenses &quot;as long as reasonable and necessary.&quot; The Russian Defense Ministry also reported capturing the settlements of Melovoi and Podol as of March 13. The development comes as the U.S. seeks to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. Kyiv has sought to leverage its positions in Kursk Oblast in potential negotiations but began to rapidly lose its ground in the region at the same time that the U.S. temporarily paused military and intelligence support for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-to-retake-sudzha-kyiv-hasnt-confirmed/	2025-03-13T02:17:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2166312603.jpg
French National Assembly backs resolution on seizing Russian assets	France&apos;s National Assembly, the lower chamber of the country&apos;s parliament, passed a resolution calling for increased support for Ukraine and the seizure of frozen Russian assets, Le Figaro reported on March 13. The resolution, whose significance is largely symbolic, urges the European Union, NATO, and allied nations to boost political, economic, and military aid for Ukraine. It also calls for the EU to move forward with seizing Russia&apos;s frozen assets &#x2014; valued at approximately $300 billion, two-thirds of which are held in Europe &#x2014; to finance Ukraine&apos;s military needs and post-war reconstruction. Kyiv has only received loans covered by interest earned from the frozen assets. Despite fierce debate, the resolution passed with 288 votes in its favor. Fifty-four lawmakers from the left-wing France Unbowed and the Communist Party opposed it, while the far-right National Rally abstained. French lawmakers also amended the resolution to push for &quot;an independent European defense&quot; and to explore the possibility of deploying a European peacekeeping force to Ukraine once hostilities end. The proposal aligns with efforts by French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer to advance a European-led initiative to support Ukraine, particularly amid uncertainty from Washington. Macron has previously floated the idea of sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, a suggestion that sparked backlash from the Kremlin. A recent Elabe Institute poll cited by BFM TV on March 4 found that roughly two-thirds of the French public favor maintaining or increasing aid to Ukraine, as well as deploying peacekeepers after a ceasefire. France, one of Ukraine&apos;s most vocal backers, has taken a leading role alongside the U.K. in supporting Kyiv as U.S. President Donald Trump pressures European nations to increase their contributions. Trump has repeatedly criticized former U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration&apos;s level of aid to Ukraine, insisting that European allies should bear more of the burden.	https://kyivindependent.com/french-national-assembly-backs-resolution-for-more-ukraine-aid-seizure-of-russian-assets/	2025-03-13T01:57:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204111315.jpg
Polish president urges US to deploy nuclear weapons in Poland	Polish President Andrzej Duda called on the U.S. to deploy nuclear weapons in Poland as a deterrent against future Russian aggression, he said in an interview with the Financial Times published on March 13. &quot;The borders of NATO moved east in 1999, so 26 years later, there should also be a shift of the NATO infrastructure east. For me, this is obvious,&quot; Duda said. Duda suggested that U.S. President Donald Trump could relocate nuclear warheads stationed in Western Europe or the U.S. to Poland, arguing that Russia had already taken similar steps by deploying tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus. &quot;Russia did not even hesitate when they were relocating their nuclear weapons into Belarus,&quot; Duda said. &quot;They didn&apos;t ask anyone&apos;s permission.&quot; Duda said he recently discussed the idea with Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, and hopes to revive a nuclear-sharing proposal that he unsuccessfully presented to former U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration in 2022. The proposal comes amid mounting warnings from Western leaders and intelligence agencies about the possibility of a large-scale war in Europe within the next five years. Then-Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and his Belarusian counterpart, Viktor Khrenin, signed an agreement in May 2023 to transfer tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, Poland&apos;s neighbor. Russia&apos;s tactical nuclear weapons are designed for use on the battlefield in Europe and Asia and have a more limited range compared to strategic nuclear weapons, which could reach the U.S. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly issued nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West since launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. While those threats have not materialized, concerns persist over Russia&apos;s military ambitions beyond Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron has also signaled a shift in nuclear policy, saying on March 5 that France is open to extending its nuclear umbrella to protect European allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-president-duda-urges-us-to-deploy-nuclear-weapons-in-poland/	2025-03-13T01:18:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1676988608.jpg
Russia suspected of killing 5 Ukrainian POWs in Kursk Oblast	Russian forces allegedly executed five Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) in Kursk Oblast, Ukrainian Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets reported on March 13. Lubinets referred to a video circulating on social media that purportedly shows unarmed Ukrainian soldiers killed after being captured by Russian troops. According to Ukrainian activist Serhii Sternenko, a video of the suspected execution was recorded in Kursk Oblast, near the village of Kozacha Loknya. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. &quot;We once again see a cynical disregard for international humanitarian law on the part of the Russian army,&quot; Lubinets said, adding that he had sent letters to the U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross to document the suspected war crime. The news comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin made his first visit to Kursk Oblast on March 12 since Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into the region in August 2024. During the visit, which took place amid a rapid Russian advance, Putin declared that Ukrainian military personnel captured in the region &quot;will be treated as terrorists.&quot; Ukraine has previously documented widespread violations of the Geneva Conventions by Russian forces, including the execution of 177 captured Ukrainian soldiers as of mid-December 2024. The U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine reported a sharp rise in executions of Ukrainian POWs, documenting 79 extrajudicial killings across 24 separate incidents since August 2024. Visual evidence of such atrocities continues to emerge, reinforcing concerns over Moscow&apos;s systematic violations of international law.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-executed-five-ukrainian-pows-in-kursk-oblast-ombudsman-says/	2025-03-13T01:11:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2166040846.jpg
5 killed, 28 injured in Russian strikes against Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least five civilians and injured at least 28 over the past day, regional authorities reported on March 13. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 74 of the 117 drones launched by Russia overnight over 11 regions, the Air Force reported. Thirty-eight decoy drones disappeared from radars without causing damage, according to the statement. Russia also launched one Iskander-M ballistic missile from Kursk Oblast, the Air Force said without commenting on the consequences. Four people were injured in Russian attacks against Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, according to Governor Serhii Lysak. A drone attack against Dnipro, the regional center, set fire to an infrastructure facility and damaged residential buildings. The victims included three women aged 52, 56, and 82, according to the statement. A 64-year-old woman was also injured during the Russian attacks against the Nikopol district. Three people were killed and 14 injured during Russian attacks in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. This included two people killed and one injured in Myrnohrad, one killed and another injured in Pokrovsk, eight injured in Kostiantynivka, two injured in Druzhkivka, and two others injured in Oleksiievo-Druzhkivka, according to the statement. A 60-year-old man was injured during a Russian attack against the town of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Russian strikes killed one person and injured six in Kherson Oblast, said the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. Two apartment buildings and 20 houses were damaged. In Sumy Oblast, one civilian was killed in the Seredyna-Buda community when attempting to handle a Russian drone, which subsequently exploded. Two more people were injured during Russian attacks against the Khotin community, the regional military administration reported. An overnight drone strike against the Okhtyrka community also set ablaze multiple garages, though no casualties were reported. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, a 50-year-old man was injured during a Russian strike against the Vasylivka district, Governor Ivan Fedorov said.	https://kyivindependent.com/5-killed-28-injured-in-russian-strikes-against-ukraine-over-past-day/	2025-03-13T00:42:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-13_07-15-01-1.jpg
Russia presents US with demands for possible Ukraine peace deal, Reuters reports	Russia has presented the U.S. with a list of demands for a potential deal to end the war against Ukraine and reset relations with Washington, Reuters reported on March 13, citing two undisclosed sources. According to the sources, Russian and U.S. officials discussed these demands during face-to-face and virtual conversations over the past three weeks. These broad conditions are said to largely mirror those Russia has previously made to Ukraine, the U.S., and NATO. The exact content of the list remains unclear, however, as does the issue of whether Russia is willing to engage in peace talks with Kyiv before these conditions are met. Russia&apos;s previously voiced conditions have included Ukraine permanently abandoning NATO aspirations, prohibiting foreign troop deployments on Ukrainian soil, and recognizing Crimea and four partially occupied regions &#x2014; the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts &#x2014; as Russian territory. In June 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted that Ukraine must withdraw from those four regions as a precondition for negotiations. President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated on March 12 that Ukraine would not recognize any occupied territories as part of Russia in any future peace agreement. Despite U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s claim on Feb. 24 that Putin would allow European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a deal, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has rejected the idea. Russia has also continued to push its long-standing demand that the U.S. and NATO address what it calls the &quot;root causes&quot; of the war, including the alliance&apos;s eastward expansion. Ukraine officially submitted its application to NATO in September 2022. Though NATO members pledged that Ukraine&apos;s path toward membership is &quot;irreversible&quot; at the allied summit in Washington in 2024, the Trump administration has ruled out the accession in the foreseeable future. Trump is waiting to hear from Putin on whether Russia will agree to a 30-day ceasefire that Ukraine has already accepted on the condition that Moscow does as well. Ukraine agreed to the proposal for the temporary truce during talks in Jeddah on March 11, after which Washington resumed military and intelligence support. Putin&apos;s response to the ceasefire proposal remains uncertain. Some U.S. officials and analysts fear that Moscow will use the temporary pause to deepen divisions between Washington, Kyiv, and their European allies while preparing for further offensives, Reuters writes. The Washington Post reported on a document drafted by a Moscow think tank close to the Federal Security Service (FSB) that lays out Russia&apos;s potential maximalist demands for ending the war. These include a buffer zone in northeastern Ukraine along the borders of Bryansk and Belgorod oblasts and a demilitarized zone in southern Ukraine. The document, drafted in February, further calls for &quot;the complete dismantling&quot; of Ukraine&apos;s current government and says that peace is unlikely before 2026. It is unclear what &#x2014; if any &#x2014; role this document plays in the Kremlin&apos;s decision-making. Western security officials told Bloomberg on March 10 that Putin has deliberately set &quot;maximalist&quot; demands on territorial concessions, peacekeepers, and Ukraine&apos;s neutrality, knowing they are likely unacceptable to Kyiv and European nations.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-presents-us-with-demands-for-possible-ukraine-war-deal-reuters-reports/	2025-03-13T00:13:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1251592140.jpg
Ukrainian drones set ablaze Russian factory, infrastructure site overnight, authorities claim	Ukraine attacked six Russian regions with close to 80 drones overnight on March 13, with fires reported at an infrastructure site in Voronezh Oblast and an industrial plant in Kaluga Oblast, according to Russian authorities. Kyiv has carried out regular long-range drone strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia&apos;s rear, seeking to undermine its ability to wage its all-out war. Russian air defenses downed 77 drones overnight, including 30 over Bryansk Oblast, 25 over Kaluga Oblast, six over Kursk and Voronezh oblasts each, and five over Rostov and Belgorod oblasts each, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. Drone wreckage set fire to a building of an industrial enterprise in Dzerzhinsky district in the northern part of Kaluga Oblast, Governor Vladislav Shapsha said. The fire has been extinguished, but one employee received a minor injury, the governor claimed. Drone debris also reportedly damaged a cell tower and a power line in the Khvastovichsky district, the southernmost part of Kaluga Oblast. Kaluga Oblast lies in the western part of Russia, bordering Moscow Oblast from the west. An unspecified infrastructure facility was damaged in the evening of March 12 in Voronezh Oblast, a region bordering Ukraine&apos;s Luhansk Oblast, Governor Alexander Gusev said on his Telegram channel. No casualties were reported. The targeted facility was part of the region&apos;s gas infrastructure, the Baza Telegram channel reported, citing residents. A fallen drone also started a fire in the village of Kalininsky in Rostov Oblast, but the nearby industrial facility was not damaged, according to Governor Yuri Slyusar. Airports in Penza, Saratov, and Volgograd imposed temporary flight restrictions overnight, Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency announced. The full extent of possible damage is being determined. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. The strikes come only two days after Ukraine launched what appears to be its largest drone strike against Russia, deploying over 330 drones across 10 different regions to attack oil facilities and other strategic sites.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-set-ablaze-russian-factory-infrastructure-site-overnight-authorities-claim/	2025-03-12T23:30:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/chasiv-yar-4.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 890,250 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 890,250 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on March 13. This number includes 1,200 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,307 tanks, 21,432 armored fighting vehicles, 40,355 vehicles and fuel tanks, 24,409 artillery systems, 1,314 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,103 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 28,983 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-890-250-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-03-12T23:11:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1863681631-1.jpg
White House won't confirm if it has mechanisms to enforce ceasefire with Russia	White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to say whether or not the U.S. has enforcement mechanisms in the event Russia violates a potential ceasefire when speaking to reporters on March 12. Ukrainian and U.S. officials met in Saudi Arabia for talks on March 11. At the conclusion of negotiations, Ukraine agreed to a U.S. proposal for a temporary 30-day ceasefire, so long as Russia complies with the terms. When asked whether the U.S. has enforcement mechanisms in place to ensure Russia abides by the ceasefire, Leavitt declined to comment. &quot;Well, that&apos;s obviously a grand hypothetical question that I won&apos;t comment on, because we&apos;re not there yet,&quot; Leavitt told reporters on March 12. Leavitt confirmed U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz had a telephone conversation with his Russian counterpart earlier in the day and that Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff is traveling to Moscow in the coming days to discuss the ceasefire. &quot;The current state of play is that the Ukrainians have agreed to a ceasefire, the Ukrainians have agreed to the peace plan that was put on the table yesterday in Saudi Arabia,&quot; Leavitt said. Negotiations are now &quot;on the tenth yard line of peace,&quot; Leavitt said, and it is &quot;up to the Russians to agree to this plan.&quot; Leavitt did not confirm if U.S. President Donald Trump plans to call Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the ceasefire proposal. &quot;(I)f that call happens, he will let you guys know,&quot; she said. Trump said on March 12 that American officials are already on their way to Russia to negotiate a ceasefire. It was also previously reported that Witkoff is expected to meet with Putin during an upcoming visit to Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/white-house-declines-to-say-if-it-has-enforcement-mechanisms-for-russia-in-potential-ceasefire/	2025-03-12T22:00:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200647187.jpg
EU parliament accuses US of 'blackmailing' Ukraine in joint declaration	EU lawmakers passed a wide-ranging joint declaration on March 12 condemning the U.S. for &quot;blackmailing&quot; Ukrainian leadership into capitulating to Russia. The declaration comes a day after Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office announced it was ready to accept Washington&apos;s proposal of a 30-day ceasefire, so long as Russia also complies with the terms. When Kyiv agreed to the plan, Washington resumed previously suspended shipments of military aid. The joint statement &quot;strongly deplores any attempts at blackmailing Ukraine&apos;s leadership into surrender to the Russian aggressor for the sole purpose of announcing a so-called &apos;peace deal.&apos;&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin is now being &quot;rewarded&quot; for Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, the resolution says. The declaration accuses the U.S. of trying &quot;to negotiate a ceasefire and peace agreement with Russia over the heads of Ukraine and other European states.&quot; It also denounces the U.S. for being &quot;counterproductive and dangerous.&quot; Support for Ukraine must be increased in the face of the foreign policy shift in Washington, the joint declaration says. The lawmakers proposed to further &quot;increase the effectiveness and impact of sanctions on Russia in order to definitively undermine Russia&apos;s ability to continue waging its brutal war of aggression against Ukraine and threatening the security of other European countries.&quot; The resolution was passed by 440 lawmakers in the European Parliament, which consists of 720 seats. Signatories included members of many political parties, including Greens, Socialists &amp; Democrats, Christian Democrats, and far-right conservatives. The U.S. has infuriated many lawmakers in Europe by repeatedly saying it will exclude the continent from potential Ukraine peace negotiations. Top European officials have decried the White House for pandering to Russia. Despite the condemnation from members of the European Parliament (MEPs), European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on March 12 praised the outcome of Ukraine&apos;s recent talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia and reaffirmed the EU&apos;s support for the embattled nation.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-parliament-accuses-us-of-blackmailing-ukrainian-leader-in-joint-declaration/	2025-03-12T21:21:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1246737828-1.jpg
Europe-bound Chinese rail shipments through Russia plummet due to transit restrictions	Russian restrictions and the seizure of dual-use goods have caused Europe-bound rail shipments from China via Russia to plunge, The South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on March 11. Russian authorities in October banned the transit of dual-use military and civilian goods to Europe via its territory. The restrictions apply to a range of goods that could potentially aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Since the ban, rail cargo volumes through Russia from China have been declining for months as Chinese logistics companies lose confidence in the trade route, industry players told SCMP. &quot;We have not dared to ship (goods through Russian rail routes) since November,&quot; Andrew Jiang, general manager of Shanghai freight forwarding company Air Sea Transport, said. Russia&apos;s new restrictions have caused Chinese rail shipments to be sent to Europe via alternative routes that bypass Russia. These include routes through Central Asian countries, such as Kazakhstan. Many Chinese freight companies learned about the restrictions weeks after their implementation. This has caused thousands of containers to be seized by Russian authorities. Moscow&apos;s restrictions allow Russian authorities to seize and keep hard-to-get Western-sanctioned goods. These items can then be used to manufacture weapons for the war against Ukraine. Russian authorities have confiscated large amounts of equipment that on the surface appear to be harmless, such as welding materials, metal fasteners, and airplane parts, importers of Chinese goods in Russia told the Moscow Times. Russian importers now face difficulty obtaining goods from Chinese suppliers due to a lack of confidence in Russian freight routes. China has become Russia&apos;s key economic partner, supplying Moscow with critical dual-use goods as sanctions have increasingly isolated the country from the global market. Russia has come to rely heavily on China since the launch of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-bound-chinese-rail-shipments-through-russia-plummet/	2025-03-12T20:16:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2160158492.jpg
Journalist Viktoria Roshchyna receives posthumous human rights award	Viktoria Roshchyna, a Ukrainian journalist who died in Russian captivity, was posthumously awarded the 2024 Homo Homini Human Rights Award by the Czech human rights organization &#xA0;People in Need on March 12. Sevgil Musayeva, the chief editor of the Ukrainian media outlet Ukrainska Pravda, accepted the honor on Roshchyna&apos;s behalf at a ceremony in Prague, activist Maksym Butkevych announced on social media. Roshchyna shares the award with Nigerian journalist Philip Obaji. Roshchyna received the Homo Homini award for her &quot;courage to tell the stories of Ukrainians in the Russian-occupied territories and for her long-term journalistic work dedicated to portraying issues threatening the democratic order of Ukraine, which she did not compromise on, even at the risk of her personal safety,&quot; the executive board of People in Need said. The journalist disappeared in August 2023 while reporting in Russian-occupied territory, with Moscow admitting her detention the following year. Previously, in March 2022, Roshchyna was detained for 10 days by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers while leaving Berdiansk in the direction of Mariupol. As a condition of her release, she was forced to record a video saying Russian forces had saved her life. Ukrainian officials confirmed Roshchyna&apos;s death on Oct. 10, 2024, but said that the circumstances were still under investigation. &#xA0; The Media Initiative for Human Rights, a Ukrainian NGO, reported in October 2024 that Roshchyna had been held in at least two notorious Russian prisons: the penal colony n. 77 in Berdiansk in occupied Ukraine and the detention center n. 2 in Russia&apos;s Taganrog. Both facilities are known for the use of torture against prisoners. Roshchyna was taken out of Taganrog detention center sometime in September 2024. According to Russia, she died on Sept. 19. Ukrainian prosecutors have classified Roshchyna&apos;s death as a war crime and murder.	https://kyivindependent.com/journalist-viktoria-roshchyna-receives-posthumous-human-rights-award/	2025-03-12T18:55:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/roshchyna.jpeg
Ukraine out of ATACMS missiles, AP reports	Ukraine has no more long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) in its arsenal, the Associated Press (AP) reported on May 12, citing unnamed U.S. and Ukrainian officials. The news comes as the U.S. resumes the flow of military aid to Kyiv after talks with Ukrainian delegates in Saudi Arabia on March 11. Washington suspended weapons shipments in early March. A U.S. official and Ukrainian lawmaker confirmed to the AP that Ukraine currently has no remaining ATACMS missiles. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to provide details on the status of the weapons. ATACMS are U.S.-supplied ballistic missiles can fly up to 300 kilometers (about 186 miles). Former U.S. President Joe Biden eased restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of ATACMS in November 2024, allowing Kyiv to launch them against military targets in Russia. The U.S. sent Ukraine less than 40 long-range ATACMS in total, the U.S. official told the AP. According to the official, Kyiv ran out of the missiles in January. The New York Times (NYT) reported in December 2024 that Kyiv was near the end of its supply of ATACMS and was limiting their use. Kyiv first began receiving older, shorter-range versions of ATACMS in fall of 2023. In the spring of 2024, the U.S. began shipping updated models with a range of up to 300 kilometers. &#xA0;At the time, Ukraine was only permitted to deploy these missiles against targets in occupied Ukrainian territory. Following Biden&apos;s change in policy &#x2014; which was accompanied by permission from the U.K. to attack Russia with British long-range Storm Shadows &#x2014; Ukraine launched a series of missile strikes against Russian airfields, military facilities, and weapons factories. U.S. President Donald Trump has previously said he disagreed &quot;very vehemently&quot; with the decision to permit Ukrainian long-range strikes against Russia with American weapons. Deliveries of U.S. weapons resumed this week after senior Ukrainian officials met with White House representatives in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on March 11. Washington imposed a freeze on military aid following a heated exchange between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. At the conclusion of the Jeddah talks, Ukraine announced that military aid had resumed and agreed to accept Washington&apos;s proposal for an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, provided that Moscow abides by the terms of the ceasefire simultaneously.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-out-of-atacms-missiles-ap-reports/	2025-03-12T18:01:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/ep30-take-4-01.png
Fires reported at infrastructure facilities in Russia's Voronezh and Rostov regions following drone strikes	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Infrastructure facilities in Russia&apos;s Voronezh and Rostov regions caught fire following multiple drone strikes, governors Alexander Gusev and Yuri Slyusar reported on March 12. In the Voronezh region, two unnamed infrastructure facilities were allegedly shelled, one of which caught fire. Russian air defenses reportedly shot down five drones in the Rostov region, with one falling on the territory of an industrial facility. Local residents reported that the drones targeted gas infrastructure. No casualties were reported, according to the acting governors&#x2019; statements. The Kyiv Independent is unable to immediately verify the reports. The attack comes amid an uptick in Ukraine&#x2019;s drone operations targeting Russian energy infrastructure. Kyiv has particularly taken aim at Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure as part of its strategy to undermine funding for the Kremlin&apos;s war operations. Both regions border Ukraine to the west. Voronezh is located around approximately 279 kilometers (173 miles) northeast of Kharkiv., and Rostov Oblast borders Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.	https://kyivindependent.com/fires-reported-at-infrastructure-facilities-in-russias-voronezh-and-rostov-regions-following-drone-strikes/	2025-03-12T16:30:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1258999936.jpg
Putin reportedly makes first visit to Kursk Oblast since start of incursion	Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 12 reportedly made his first visit to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast since Ukraine&apos;s incursion into the region began in August 2024. Putin, in a video released by the Kremlin, reportedly met with military leadership in the region while visiting an undisclosed command post in Kursk Oblast. The Kyiv Independent cannot independently verify the details or location of Putin&apos;s reported visit. The Ukrainian military has not publicly commented on the claims. The reported visit into the region comes amid a renewed Russian offensive in the region, with Russian troops reportedly having regained control of more than 86% of the territory in Kursk Oblast captured by Kyiv. Russian troops have entered Sudzha, a key Ukrainian-held stronghold in the Russian border region of Kursk. In the video, Putin is seen donning military attire for the first time since Russia&apos;s full scale invasion began in February 2022 &#x2014; instead of the suit that he typically wears for meetings with military personnel. The choice in attire mimics that of President Volodymyr Zelensky who has refused to wear a suit throughout the war &#x2014; symbolizing Zelensky&apos;s wartime leadership. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on March 10 that there is no immediate threat of encirclement as Ukrainian forces are repositioning to &quot;favorable defense lines.&quot; Syrskyi added on March 12 that Ukraine will hold the defense in Kursk Oblast &quot;as long as reasonable and necessary.&quot; Ukraine launched the cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially seizing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. Since then, Russian forces, reinforced by North Korean troops, have steadily pushed back against Ukrainian forces. Over seven months of fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Russian losses have reached nearly 54,900 personnel, with over 22,000 killed, Syrskyi claimed on March 12.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-reportedly-makes-first-visit-to-kursk-oblast-since-start-of-ukraines-incursion/	2025-03-12T14:43:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/d072c83-----_690x387.jpg
30-day ceasefire deal may be struck within days, Rubio says	A 30-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine may be finalized within &quot;days,&quot; U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 12. The temporary ceasefire agreement is contingent on whether Russia agrees to halt hostilities. Ukraine agreed to the U.S.&apos;s proposal for a 30-day truce during talks in Jeddah on March 11, after which Washington resumed military and intelligence support for Kyiv. The U.S. is expected to discuss the proposal with Russia in the coming days. &quot;Here&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;d like the world to look like in a few days: Neither side is shooting at each other &#x2014; not rockets, not missiles, not bullets, nothing, not artillery&quot; Rubio said in an airport in Ireland when asked about potential discussions regarding Ukraine ceding territory. &quot;The shooting stops, the fighting stops, and the talking starts.&quot; Reuters reported on March 12, citing Russian sources, that Russia is unlikely to agree to a temporary truce in Ukraine proposed by the U.S., feeling it has the upper hand on the battlefield and viewing the ceasefire as a trap. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov gave an evasive answer when asked about the U.S. proposal, explaining that the topic must first be discussed with the American side. Any ceasefire agreement would have to take Russia&apos;s battlefield advances into account and provide &quot;guarantees&quot; to Moscow, sources told the news agency. In the past, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top officials have ruled out a temporary ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that Russia could face &quot;devastating&quot; financial consequences if it chooses to continue its all-out war against Ukraine. &quot;There are things you can do that wouldn&apos;t be pleasant in a financial sense,&quot; Trump said. &quot;It would be very bad for Russia. I don&apos;t want to do that, because I want to get peace.&quot; Russia continues to occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory and made steady advances in Donetsk Oblast in late 2024. While Russia&apos;s advance in Ukraine&apos;s east has reportedly stalled earlier this year, Moscow&apos;s troops seemed to have made rapid gains in Kursk Oblast, the Russian border region where Ukraine has been fighting since August 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/30-day-ceasefire-deal-may-be-struck-within-days-rubio-says/	2025-03-12T13:39:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194552772.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Kyiv ready to fight in Kursk Oblast 'as long as necessary' as Russia claims to retake over 86% of seized territories	Key developments on March 12: Russian troops have regained control of more than 86% of the territory in Kursk Oblast captured by Kyiv, Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the General Staff of the Russian army, said on March 12, while Ukraine said it was ready to fight as long as needed. His claims come as multiple Ukrainian and Russian sources reported that Russian troops had entered Sudzha, a key Ukrainian-held stronghold in the Russian border region of Kursk. Following Gerasimov&apos;s reports, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi confirmed ongoing battles in the suburbs of Sudzha and the surrounding areas. &quot;In the most difficult situation, my priority has been and remains to save the lives of Ukrainian soldiers. To do this, the units of the Defense Forces, if necessary, maneuver to more favorable positions,&quot; said Syrskyi. He added that Ukraine will hold the defense in Kursk Oblast &quot;as long as reasonable and necessary.&quot; According to Gerasimov, Russian forces have recaptured 24 settlements and 259 square kilometers (100 square miles) of territory in Kursk Oblast. Russian news agency Tass published purported footage showing Russian President Vladimir Putin visiting one of the Russian troops&apos; control centers in Kursk Oblast, which is claimed to have marked his first trip to the embattled region since the beginning of Kyiv&apos;s incursion. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. The Ukrainian military has not publicly commented on the claims. Putin ordered to regain control over the entire territory of Kursk Oblast and to consider creating a &quot;security zone&quot; along the border with Ukraine, Tass wrote. Russia is seeking to push Ukrainian troops out of Kursk Oblast and move the fighting to Sumy and Kharkiv oblast. The Russian president also said that Ukrainian soldiers captured in Kursk Oblast should be labeled as &quot;terrorists.&quot; Russia&apos;s General Staff claimed that over 400 Ukrainian troops have been taken captive in the region. Over seven months of fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Russian losses have reached nearly 54,900 personnel, with over 22,000 killed, Syrskyi claimed on March 12. Ukraine wanted to demonstrate to U.S. President Donald Trump and its European partners that it is serious about ending the war, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 12 about why Kyiv agreed to Washington&apos;s temporary truce proposal. While Ukraine initially proposed a partial ceasefire that would extend only to aerial and naval operations, U.S. delegates proposed a full truce during talks with Ukrainian officials in Jeddah on March 11. After receiving the proposal, Zelensky said Ukraine was &quot;ready for a 30-day ceasefire format offered by the U.S. side.&quot; &quot;I have repeatedly stressed that none of us trust Russia... but we will not play with narratives that we want the war to continue,&quot; Zelensky said at a press conference. &quot;I am very serious, and it is important for me to end the war. I want the U.S. president to see this; so that Europe and everybody unites to push Russia toward ending the war.&quot; The Ukrainian president also noted that the ceasefire would be only the first step toward a full peace. After the war ends, martial law will be lifted, and elections will be held, he added. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed on March 12 that Ukraine-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia on March 11 included discussions about potential &quot;territorial concessions&quot; as part of a negotiated settlement with Russia. &quot;Yeah, we&apos;ve had conversations,&quot; Rubio said in an airport in Ireland when asked about potential discussions regarding Ukraine ceding territory. The Trump administration has repeatedly said that both Kyiv and Moscow will have to make compromises for a peace deal, calling Ukraine&apos;s goal of restoring its pre-2014 borders &quot;unrealistic.&quot; Russian forces currently occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine, from where reports of systematic repression, torture, and forced deportations regularly emerge. Rubio also said that the Jeddah talks covered &quot;what a negotiation process would look like&quot; and reiterated, &quot;There is no military solution to this conflict.&quot; The official acknowledged that Ukraine requires security assurances to deter possible future Russian aggression and emphasized that &quot;Europeans will need to be involved in this regard.&quot; Trump has so far refused to offer such security guarantees, saying during his Feb. 28 meeting with Zelensky that responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security should fall on Europe. Small Russian infantry groups have stepped up assault operations in Ukraine&apos;s south over the past two weeks as they look to improve Moscow&apos;s battlefield positions, a spokesperson for the military told Ukrinform on March 12. Thirty-five attacks have been recorded in the area today so far, with Russian forces pushing on the Huliaipole and Orikhiv sectors in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, said Vladyslav Voloshyn, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command. &quot;This is not an offensive or part of the enemy&apos;s strategic actions, but tactical attempts to improve their position relative to the combat line,&quot; Voloshyn said. Russia has also intensified artillery shelling and air and missile strikes on Ukraine&apos;s Tavria group of forces, which covers Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, Voloshyn said.

Ukraine Business Roundup â€” The foreign arms producer showing real results in Ukraine	The following is the March 11, 2025 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. For all the hype around foreign weapons producers setting up shop in Ukraine to help it fend off Russia&#x2019;s invasion, they have little to show for it. With the exception of the Prague-domiciled conglomerate Colt CZ, which has set up assembly of its Bren 2 assault rifles inside Ukraine, reporter Kollen Post writes in his latest. The Ukraine-assembled rifle &#x2014; dubbed the &#x201C;Sich&#x201D; for the center of life of the Ukrainian historical nomad-warrior Cossacks &#x2014; offers swappable components for alternating between Soviet and NATO calibers. Ondrej Bohac, head of public sector at Colt CZ, said that something in the &#x201C;upper tens of thousands&#x201D; are already in Ukrainian hands and &#x201C;tens of thousands should be assembled (in Ukraine) this year.&#x201D; The company&#x2019;s ultimate goal is to &#x201C;get rid of Ukrainian dependence on Soviet weapons, like the AK-47, and not only on the weapons themselves but also on the ammunition, which is still produced mainly in Russia and Belarus,&#x201D; Bohac told Post. Ukraine does not seem close to running through its old stockpiles of ammunition, but as with the conversion from Soviet 122 and 152 mm artillery to NATO-standard 120 and 155 mm, the transition is a long-term Western turn. Many international arms giants have announced plans to build their wares inside of Ukraine, ranging from Rheinmetall to Northrop Grumman to Baykar, but those projects have mostly stalled out, writes Post. Colt CZ is one of the first to set up production, putting the firm in a relative frontier position. Its experience will be a bellwether for NATO-based weapons manufacturers expanding to Ukraine. Read the full profile here. Ukraine&apos;s Central Bank raised the key policy rate from 14.5% to 15.5% per annum from March 7, adding that it was ready to take further steps to curb growing inflation in the country. The move marks the second raise of the key policy rate since the beginning of 2025. In late January, the central bank raised it from 13.5% to 14.5%. Inflation reached its highest level in about 18 months in January as a result of a lower harvest, growing business costs, particularly energy, and continued Russian attacks. Price growth was expected to peak sometime in the middle of this year, but tense relations with the Donald Trump administration have soured expectations. Pyshnyi also warned of increasing risks due to less favorable economic trends caused by &quot;further geopolitical polarization of countries&quot; and &quot;the corresponding fragmentation of global trade.&quot; Preident Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Friday, Feb. 28, 2025 (Jim Lo Scalzo / Getty Images)Minerals deal: Will it ever happen?After the Oval Office showdown a couple of weeks ago and the subsequent collapse of the minerals agreement, everyone in town is wondering what&#x2019;s up with the deal. Some reports have suggested that in retaliation for an argument in the White House, Trump was negotiating for a &#x201C;better deal.&#x201D; But multiple sources have told the Kyiv Independent that the details of the agreement haven&#x2019;t changed, and that it&#x2019;s more a matter of when the two sides will sign it &#x2014; which remains unclear. It could all hinge on this week&#x2019;s meetings in Saudi Arabia. Trump&apos;s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News that he was &#x201C;really hopeful&#x201D; that President Volodymyr Zelensky would return to the U.S. to sign the deal in the near future. Ukraine&#x2019;s government plans to spend $2.6 billion purchasing 4.5 million first-person-view (FPV) drones this year as part of a large-scale effort to equip its military with advanced technologies, the Defense Ministry said on March 10. Ukraine purchased 1.5 million drones in 2024, with 96% of spending going to Ukrainian producers. A Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support to Kyiv. The agency funded school reconstruction, bomb shelters, critical energy repairs, and civil society initiatives. A Russian attack on Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure overnight on March 7 forced Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy company DTEK to shut down one of its gas production facilities in Poltava Oblast. Meanwhile, DTEK is in talks with U.S. suppliers to bring more natural gas to Europe, Wall Street Journal reported. Ukraine&apos;s largest state-owned energy company, Naftogaz, and Poland&apos;s petroleum refineries company, Orlen, have signed a contract for the supply of approximately 100 million cubic meters (mcm) of liquefied natural gas (LNG), Naftogaz announced on March 7. As Russia continues targeting Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure, domestic gas production has declined due to Russian strikes, forcing Ukraine to increase imports. Ukraine has received 752 million pounds ($970 million) as the first installment of the U.K.&apos;s contribution to the G7 loan covered by frozen Russian assets, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on March 7. &quot;The funds will go towards strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities,&quot; Shmyhal said on X.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-business-roundup-the-foreign-arms-producer-showing-real-results-in-ukraine/	2025-03-12T12:37:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/production_cz_04.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly â€” Issue 17	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 17 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from March 3&#x2013;9, 2025. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Ukraine&#x2019;s President signs IMF-mandated budget code amendments on public investments President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky has signed draft law #12245, introducing amendments to the budget code to enhance the management of public investment projects. The legislation fulfills one of the International Monetary Fund&apos;s structural benchmarks. The reform establishes a general public investment fund, which will be allocated by the newly formed Strategic Investment Council within the government &#x2014; a body that mirrors the composition of the Cabinet of Ministers. Under the new framework, multiple budget allocations will be consolidated into this &#x201C;fund of funds.&quot; The government will then oversee its distribution across priority projects. Ukraine&#x2019;s Parliament to vote on two Ukraine Facility bills Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, is set to hold final votes on two legislative proposals tied to the country&#x2019;s commitments under the Ukraine Facility program. Lawmakers will consider draft law #8222, which introduces a new civil service pay structure based on Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development SIGMA principles. The bill aims to classify government positions by function and align public sector wages with the private sector. Over the next five years, salaries for government employees are expected to reach 70-90% of the equivalent private-sector compensation for positions of similar complexity and responsibility.

Ukrainian government allocates additional Hr 570 million for delayed payments under winter support and national cashback programs The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has allocated Hr 570 million (approximately $13.5 million) from the state budget&#x2019;s reserve fund to cover delayed payments under the winter support program and the national cashback program. The decision follows a public statement by the Economy Ministry, which cited operational issues as the reason for payment delays for December and January. The funding will be used to ensure beneficiaries receive their overdue financial assistance. Last week, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal confirmed that the national cashback program would be extended for the coming years, signaling continued government support for the initiative.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-17/	2025-03-12T12:32:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1398149194.jpg
Russian intelligence recruited teenagers for terrorist attack in western Ukraine, SBU claims	Russia&apos;s intelligence service blew up two teenagers it had recruited to carry out a terrorist attack in the western city of Ivano-Frankivsk on the evening of March 11, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reported on March 12. Explosions were reported near the railway station and in a high-rise building in Ivano-Frankivsk. One person was killed and three other injured, authorities said. The remote detonation of self-made devices used in Russian intelligence planned attacks is a new tactic of Moscow&apos;s in its covert operations against Ukraine, allowing it to carry out attacks while getting rid of perpetrators, Serhii Andrushchenko, SBU&apos;s deputy head, previously told the Kyiv Independent. According to law enforcement, the recruited agents were two teenagers aged 15 and 17 who sought quick money on Telegram channels. Russian intelligence services allegedly recruited them online and offered payment for carrying out a series of terror attacks in the city. A Russian handler rented an apartment for the teenagers in a high-rise building near the local railway station, the SBU said. Following Russia&apos;s instructions, the two made explosives and two devices disguised as thermoses. They equipped both explosives with remote detonators, according to the SBU. The teenagers were allegedly heading to a designated location to place one of the explosive devices when the Russian intelligence service activated the explosives in their package. Another explosive was detonated in the rented apartment. The 17-year-old boy was killed, and the 15-year-old was hospitalized with serious injuries. Two passers-by &#x2014; a 20-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman &#x2014; also suffered injuries. If charged, the 15-year-old could face life imprisonment. In February, the SBU reported that Russia recruited the attacker responsible for a deadly explosion at a military enlistment office in Rivne. Russia also recruited minors via social media to set fire to military cars parked in Ukrainian cities, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said. Last year, cases of setting fire to military vehicles were recorded in Kyiv, Odesa, and Dnipro.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-intelligence-behind/	2025-03-12T12:23:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/7c4dbf1182188d844e1b5b7ca0c7016c.jpg
There will still be war' â€” Ukraine's soldiers on ceasefire proposal, Russia, and Putin	The &quot;ball is in (Russia&apos;s) court,&quot; U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 11 after Kyiv and Washington emerged from talks in Saudi Arabia in agreement over a ceasefire proposal. After the negotiations with Washington, Ukraine announced that it was ready to accept a 30-day-long ceasefire if Russia also complied with it. Now, all eyes are on Moscow as it mulls a response to the proposal, but expectations are not high &#x2014; even if a ceasefire comes into force, Moscow has a long history of disregarding them. After Russia invaded Ukraine&apos;s east with the use of proxies and annexed Crimea in 2014, Moscow violated multiple ceasefire deals 25 times, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a meeting with Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. We asked five serving Ukrainian soldiers what they thought of the ceasefire proposal and if they think Russia will agree to its terms. I&#x2019;m not sure that Russia will agree to a ceasefire. Trump wants to show that he&#x2019;s the only one making decisions in this situation, but Putin is unlikely to dance to the tune of a U.S. president. However, if Russia does agree to a ceasefire, it means their situation is worse than it seems. In that case, it&#x2019;s a clear signal that the pause should be short, and Russia must be pressured even harder on the front line.

Fought in Donbas in 2014-2018 during previous &apos;ceasefires&apos; with Russia And when will they reach an agreement? It could take a day or a year to reach an agreement. This has legalized Russia at the negotiating table. The murderer is now sitting among the prosecutor and the judges. And he is given every right to say that he is not a murderer. They will now start bargaining, and what will they bargain with? With Ukraine, our state, our lands, our people. And what will these 30 days do, even if there is a truce and the shooting stops? Has no one thought about what will come after them? Has anyone thought that Russia will then go further and accumulate forces and means? Russia has a strategic plan for 2035 to capture Ukraine along the east bank in its entirety or even the entire country. They will not deviate from this plan. They will take a break for 30 days to replenish their forces, resources, etc., and then move forward. The question here is what we will do in the meantime. In Ukraine, during this period, there should be heavy manpower reinforcements (in the army) and 100% replenishment of ammunition and equipment. Starting with small arms, ending with aviation, and everything in between. Because here we often think, &#xA0;&#x201C;Oh, that&apos;s it, the war is on hold, we can sit and have a smoke.&#x201D; And everyone will sit on their asses until the storm hits again and the Russians push on. And when they do, everyone will start shouting again, &#x201C;Give us weapons urgently, give us people urgently.&#x201D; I have seen previous &#x201C;truces&#x201D; in Donbas. There was a ceasefire, a &#x201C;harvest truce,&quot; and we were standing on Krymske (in Luhansk Oblast). &#xA0;Their subversive groups were working constantly. I was the acting platoon commander. They hit my position with a Pion (a Soviet self-propelled 203 mm cannon). There were dead and wounded. No one stopped anything, it was just a &quot;light version&quot; (of the war). We&apos;ve been through this before. An agreement with the Russians is not worth the paper it is written on. 26-year-old military service woman Regarding the 30-day ceasefire, it is a good opportunity to show the world that Ukraine is most interested in peace. No other country in the world is as interested in ending this war as Ukraine. And the main thing is the conditions under which we do this. We have already seen what Trump has proposed. It does not work. It is too stupid to use the same non-working scenario and repeatedly fall into the same trap. Fortunately, we learn from our mistakes and do not want to make the same mistakes for the second, third, or tenth time. However, we must show the international community that Ukraine is more interested in peace than anyone else. Suppose there are 30 days of silence in Ukraine without missiles or drones. In that case, it would be a good opportunity to invite international representatives to Ukraine, show our capital, show different cities, show the front-line areas without danger to their lives, show how the military lives, and invite as many journalists as possible. We can do a lot in a month. Of course, the military will be able to rest and recover a bit. Their loved ones can travel to (Ukraine&#x2019;s) east and spend time with them without worrying about their safety. &#x491; I&apos;m sure not every military member will be allowed to go on vacation. But there is an opportunity to visit loved ones safely.

This time will be the same because I don&apos;t see that Russia is ready to start a ceasefire. I don&apos;t think it will change anything for me. There will still be war, it will still be the same job. But maybe, if there really is a ceasefire, it will be good that we can rotate our troops and organize some rest for some of our soldiers. sapper 25th Airborne Brigade I don&#x2019;t think Russia will follow through (with a ceasefire).

Trump said Ukraine is 'more difficult to deal with' than Russia â€” that might be about to change	Over the course of a tumultuous few weeks of talks, U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his frustration with Kyiv. On March 7, Trump declared that he finds it &quot;more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine&quot; than Russia. Yet, after weeks of strong-arming Ukraine into submission, the Trump administration is yet to ask Russia for a single concession, and real negotiations with the Kremlin have yet to actually begin. According to experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent, some of them with direct experience of diplomatic dealings with Moscow, the reality of coming up against Russian President Vladimir Putin in talks may come as a shock to Trump. &quot;I think (Putin) probably sees Trump as a useful idiot who is helpful in promoting his agenda,&quot; Ryhor Nizhnikau, a Russia expert at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, told the Kyiv Independent. Nizhnikau expects the Kremlin to reject the proposed ceasefire and come back with counter-proposals in an attempt to draw out the negotiating process, putting forward what he describes as &quot;a lot of dangerous ideas.&quot; Kyiv and Washington on March 11 emerged from talks in Saudi Arabia in agreement over a ceasefire proposal, as well as the resumption of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing. After the negotiations with Washington, Ukraine announced that it was ready to accept a 30-day-long ceasefire if Russia also complied with it. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio later said the &quot;ball is in (Russia&apos;s) court,&quot; adding if the Kremlin rejects the ceasefire proposal, &quot;then we&apos;ll, unfortunately, know what the impediment is to peace here.&quot; There had been no official response from the Kremlin, and even state TV propagandists had been largely silent on the matter. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov when asked by journalists about the proposal gave an evasive answer, saying they were &quot;getting a little ahead of yourselves.&quot; &quot;The Russians will definitely reject the ceasefire,&quot; Nizhnikau said. &quot;They cannot accept it because they say it&apos;s Washington&apos;s plan.&#x201D; Previous statements from Kremlin officials give an indication of what Russia is likely to demand. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan, National Security Advisor Mosaad bin Mohammad al-Aiban, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Ukrainian Head of Presidential Office Andriy Yermak, and Ukrainian Minister of Defense Rustem Umerov attend a meeting between the U.S. and Ukraine hosted by Saudi Arabia in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11, 2025. (Salah Malkawi/Getty Images)Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Feb. 17 there could be &quot;no thought of&quot; territorial concessions, suggesting Russia may well demand Ukraine withdraw from areas of the four oblasts &#x2014; Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk &#x2014; it illegally annexed in 2022 despite not fully controlling. Although Kyiv may be forced to agree to some sort of territorial concessions, it has previously rejected a full withdrawal from all four oblasts. Putin, however, said such a move would be a prerequisite for peace talks. How Russia&apos;s latest territorial demands will be met by Washington remains to be seen but Ambassador Kurt Volker, who served as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations in 2017-2019 and U.S. ambassador to NATO in 2008-2009, said it&apos;s likely that Trump will have anything but an easy time. &quot;I think he has some kind of belief that Putin has limited and reasonable demands, which is not the case. Putin has unlimited demands,&quot; he said. Volker believes that as negotiations continue and Trump&apos;s stated aim of a swift end to war moves further away, he will become &quot;very disappointed in Putin&quot; because he &quot;keeps moving the goalposts and upping the ante.&quot; There is also a self-inflicted wound that hobbles the U.S. as it enters talks in earnest with Russia &#x2014; the Trump administration has already thrown away some of its strongest cards. The White House has ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine and insisted it makes territorial concessions, with the return to pre-2014 and even pre-2022 borders taken off the table. &quot;They&apos;re giving Putin everything,&quot; Michael McFaul, former U.S. Ambassador to Russia and professor of international studies at Stanford University, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It&apos;s just like diplomacy 101 &#x2014; in any negotiation, you don&apos;t start by giving away all your strongest cards before the negotiation has started. And that&apos;s what it looks like the Trump team is doing.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelenskiy speaks at a news conference in Kyiv, Ukraine, on March 12, 2025. Zelenskiy calls for a period of monitored &quot;silence&quot; on the frontline before the 30-day truce proposed by the U.S. (Andrew Kravchenko/Bloomberg via Getty Images)McFaul said that Russia will have been emboldened by these concessions and will now simply demand more from the negotiating process. &quot;They just put it in their pocket, and they say, &apos;Well, what are you going to give us now?&apos; That&apos;s their strategy. And they sit quietly, and they wait,&quot; he said. McFaul added that the original maximalist aims of Putin&apos;s full-scale invasion &#x2014; the &quot;demilitarization&quot; of Ukraine and the removal of President Volodymyr Zelensky &#x2014; are very much still on the table, in large part because the U.S. has been agreeing with Russia and its demands. &quot;It&apos;s an incredibly bad negotiating strategy on behalf of the Trump team,&quot; McFaul added. What the U.S. could do, or would be prepared to do, in order to impose Ukraine&apos;s demands for a satisfactory peace upon a maximalist Russia remains to be seen, but Trump on March 12 appeared upbeat. Following announcing that he might speak with Putin this week, Trump emphasized the need to engage with Russia, expressing hope that Putin would also agree and that negotiations could move forward. &quot;It takes two for tango, as I have already said, so I hope he (Putin) will also agree as well, and I really think that would be 75% of the way, the rest is getting it documented,&quot; he said. &quot;Ukraine has agreed to it, and hopefully Russia will agree to it&#x2026; hopefully, we&apos;ll be able to wipe out a deal,&quot; he added. But McFaul points out another potential impediment to the Trump team&apos;s success &#x2014; experience. &quot;Lavrov&apos;s been at this for over two decades, he&apos;s pretty good at it. Rubio just started in this job a few weeks ago. And, you know, maybe he&apos;s just trying to figure out how to do this,&quot; he said. Regardless of whether or not U.S. negotiators can step up, for Russian-born columnist and political commentator Sergei Parkhomenko, negotiations and any thoughts of a genuine peace process are wishful thinking. &quot;Putin needs this war,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;He needs this war for its own sake more than he needs a victory in it, more than he needs Ukraine and more than he needs anything else. &quot;For him, war is a way of life, a method of governing the country, a way of maintaining himself in power. Therefore, real peace directly contradicts his political interests.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-said-ukraine-is-more-difficult-to-deal-with-than-russia-that-might-be-about-to-change/	2025-03-12T10:41:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203994697.jpg
US officials heading to Russia for ceasefire talks, Trump says	American representatives are on their way to Russia to discuss a proposed 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 12 during a meeting with Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin in the White House. &quot;We have people going to Russia right now,&quot; Trump said. Speaking to journalists in the Oval Office, the U.S. president said Washington has &quot;some positive messages about a possible ceasefire.&quot; He added that a potential of the temporary truce is now up to Russia. Kyiv agreed to a temporary ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia also did. The talks in Saudi Arabia also led to the U.S. restarting key military and intelligence support for Ukraine. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov gave an evasive answer when asked about the U.S. proposal, explaining that the topic must first be discussed with the American side. Trump also warned that Russia could face &quot;devastating&quot; financial consequences if it chooses to continue its all-out war against Ukraine. &quot;There are things you can do that wouldn&apos;t be pleasant in a financial sense,&quot; he said. &quot;It would be very bad for Russia. I don&apos;t want to do that, because I want to get peace.&quot; Shortly after his inauguration, Trump said that the U.S. can impose tariffs and sanctions on Russia to force their hand in negotiations, saying &quot;we can do it the easy way or the hard way.&quot; Recently, however, Washington reportedly considered easing sanctions on Russian oil, a major source of funding for the war in Ukraine. Earlier in a day, Reuters reported citing undisclosed Russian sources that Moscow is unlikely to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine, feeling it has the upper hand on the battlefield and viewing the ceasefire as a trap. In the past, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top officials have ruled out a temporary ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kyiv doesn&apos;t trust Russia but wanted to show to Trump and European partners that Ukraine is serious about ending Russia&apos;s full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-delegation-heading-to-russia-for-ceasifire-talks-trump-says/	2025-03-12T10:34:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203672248.jpg
Ukraine struggles to hold on in Kursk Oblast as Russia strikes back before peace talks	Ukraine&#x2019;s retreat from Kursk Oblast appears more likely as the latest news shows Russia taking ground amid intense attacks to drive Ukraine out, experts and soldiers say. Retaking Ukrainian-held territory in Kursk Oblast could leave Kyiv without its hard-fought bargaining chip before potential negotiations with Russia. In recent days, Russian forces have destroyed Ukrainian logistics in Kursk Oblast, claimed to capture several settlements, and reportedly entered the key town of Sudzha. Soldiers on the ground told the Kyiv Independent on March 7 that with &#x201C;zero logistics&#x201D; left, some would like to withdraw. Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership said on March 10 that there was no threat of encirclement for Ukrainian troops and ordered reinforcements. President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a briefing on March 12 that Ukrainian forces continue to fulfill tasks in Kursk Oblast, while the command is &#x201C;preserving the maximum of lives of our soldiers.&#x201D; The news comes as U.S. officials plan to meet with Russian representatives in the coming days to consider a temporary 30-day ceasefire discussed during U.S. talks with Ukraine in Saudi Arabia on March 11. &#x201C;Before any talks between Russia and the U.S., the Russians are trying to resolve (the Kursk problem) as quickly as possible, concentrating all the forces they can,&#x201D; Mykhailo Samus, military expert and director of the New Geopolitics Research Network, told the Kyiv Independent. Russians have brought their most effective drone units to Kursk Oblast, who are now fire-controlling Ukrainian logistic routes, thanks to Russia&#x2019;s advances on the right and left flanks of the salient, experts say. In Kursk Oblast, logistics are good &#x2014; with good roads and enough settlements where Ukrainian troops can reside and build shelters, Ruslan Mykula, a military analyst and co-founder of the DeepState OSINT project told the Kyiv Independent. But the main problem for Ukrainian forces is a section of about 10 kilometers of the main highway in Ukraine&#x2019;s Sumy Oblast between the village of Yunakivka and the Sudzha border crossing. &#x201C;Formally, all the logistics are tied to the Sumy-Sudzha asphalt highway, which is very easy to control, because the distances (to the enemy) there are not very long, about 5-7, maximum 15 kilometers, which is not a problem for modern drones,&#x201D; a retired military officer and defense expert Viktor Kevliuk told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Logistics routes are also not so numerous because the area is either swampy or bridges are destroyed,&#x201D; he added. Oleksandr, who serves in intelligence of the 82nd brigade that participates in the Kursk incursion, shows a video of his unit&apos;s drone destroying Russian equipment in Sumy, Ukraine on Nov. 6, 2024. (Oksana Parafeniuk for The Washington Post via Getty Images)A soldier fixes a drone underground in a Ukrainian military position in Ukrainian-controlled territory in Kursk Oblast, Russia on Aug. 18, 2024. (Ed Ram / For The Washington Post via Getty Images)&#x201C;This operation turned into something similar to Krynky,&#x201D; Mykula said, referring to the village in the Russian-occupied east bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast held by Ukrainian forces for about nine months in 2023-2024. Ukrainians lost hundreds of soldiers during the dangerous river crossings &#x2014; the only conventional logistics route to Krynky. &#x201C;The road between Yunakivka and the (Kursk Oblast) border is like the Dnipro River (near Krynky), where every infantryman or vehicle can be hit by first-person-view (FPV) drones day and night,&#x201D; Mykula explained. While regular FPV drones are counteracted by electronic warfare equipment used by both Ukrainian and Russian forces, it is powerless against fiber-optic-controlled drones that use an exceptionally long wire unraveled during the flight. Some can fly up to 20 kilometers. &#x201C;Not all, but most of the fiber-optic crews in the Russian army are now in the Kursk Oblast. There is a huge concentration of drones there,&#x201D; Mykula said. According to Mykula, Ukrainian forces in Kursk Oblast never found a way to counteract this type of drone. Having cut logistics, Russian forces have pushed on the ground in the past several days. According to Kevliuk, Russian forces are trying to advance both with small infantry groups overnight or during low visibility to avoid drones and on high-speed vehicles such as motorcycles, civilian cars, quad bikes, and golf carts during the day, driving over minefields to quickly storm Ukrainian positions. On March 8, reports emerged that some Russian sabotage and assault groups had used an underground gas pipe to try to gain a foothold on the outskirts of Sudzha, emulating a similar operation where Russians used the sewers in Avdiivka. Ukraine&#x2019;s General staff published a video on March 9, claiming the destruction of those units. But according to open-source monitoring groups, on March 12, the fighting is ongoing in Sudzha. The Ukrainian military has not commented on Russian forces entering the town as of this publication. Other attacks are targeting alternative Ukrainian logistic routes that are known to Russians, according to Mykula. &#xA0; &#x201C;The (North) Korean soldiers&#x2019; offensive near Guevo (on Ukraine&#x2019;s right flank) had a clear task to enter the logistics route of the defense forces through the forest, which they did,&#x201D; Mykula said. A North Korean POW captured by Ukrainian forces during hostilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Photo published on Jan. 11, 2025. (President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)It could also be a move to encircle Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast. As part of these efforts, Russia has deployed two battalions of North Korean special forces, far better-prepared than previous North Korean soldiers sent to the area to fight, Kevliuk said. &#x201C;But the encirclement is not working so far, and it will not work in the future because the enemy simply does not have enough troops to do it,&#x201D; he added. Ukraine&#x2019;s continued incursion in Kursk Oblast has had two main goals, experts say. First was gaining Ukraine leverage in possible peace talks, where Ukrainian-controlled areas of Russia could be exchanged for some Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories, according to Ukraine&#x2019;s leadership. The second goal was to divert Russian forces from other parts of the front line, prevent further attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s Sumy Oblast, and take the fight to Russian soil. When the Kursk incursion began in August 2024, Russia&#x2019;s leadership decided to keep the momentum in Ukraine&#x2019;s east instead of diverting them to Kursk Oblast, according to experts. While Russia made small yet steady territorial gains in the east, it failed to achieve all of its major goals for 2024, Samus said. &#x201C;Pokrovsk is not occupied, and Chasiv Yar, Toretsk, and Kupiansk are not occupied. (The Russians) did not enter Dnipropetrovsk Oblast,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Now, there are 60,000 of not the worst Russian soldiers and North Korean soldiers (in Kursk Oblast), trying to resolve this issue before the start of negotiations between Russia and the United States,&#x201D; he added. However, the original idea that Ukraine&#x2019;s foothold in Kursk Oblast could affect negotiations held more weight before the U.S. President Donald Trump got involved, Samus says. &#x201C;This could be said before Trump, when the politics were formed traditionally, in some adequate, comprehensible ways.&#x201D; U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 30, 2025. (Oliver Contreras/AFP via Getty Images)If Trump and his administration continue to act in a way that contributes to Russia&apos;s interests &#x2014; halting military aid, denying Ukraine&#x2019;s security guarantees before peace talks, and lifting sanctions on Russia &#x2014; they might also decline to consider Kursk Oblast as a bargaining chip, Samus said. The U.S. restored its military assistance to Ukraine on March 11 after the talks in Saudi Arabia, and Ukraine said it would agree to the temporary 30-day ceasefire if Russia did the same. It was not immediately clear what the fate of Ukraine-controlled Kursk Oblast would be during any possible ceasefire. &#x201C;If (the Kursk region) cannot be traded at the strategic level, then (Ukraine&#x2019;s military command) must decide from an operational and tactical point of view whether it is more efficient to withdraw and use these forces in other areas,&#x201D; Samus said. Some experts say that Ukraine can stabilize the logistics and keep its foothold in Kursk Oblast if it sends more resources. But others, as well as soldiers on the ground, suggest that the Ukrainian retreat has already begun. Ukrainian troops are using &#x201C;very well-built&#x201D; Russian fortifications, well-concealed and fitted for local topography, which would allow them to stay there for a long time, according to Kevliuk.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos via Getty Images)&#x201C;War theory tells us that troops should keep a reserve (of supplies) for autonomous operations for 10 days,&#x201D; Kevliuk added. &#x201C;If this norm was met (by Ukrainian troops in Kursk), we can talk about 10-14 days (of fighting without logistics).&#x201D; &#x201C;There&apos;s very little room or reason to try to maneuver in Kursk anymore,&#x201D; said Emil Kastehelmi, a Finnish military analyst from the Black Bird Group open-source intelligence collective. One Ukrainian soldier who asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive matters told the Kyiv Independent that his unit had recently withdrawn from Kursk Oblast, losing almost all of their vehicles. &#x201C;It was a horror what was happening on that road,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We don&apos;t know what will happen next.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-struggles-to-stay-in-kursk-oblast-until-negotiations-during-russias-new-push/	2025-03-12T09:49:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2166040846.jpg
Russia has stepped up attacks in Ukraine's south over past two weeks, military says	Small Russian infantry groups have stepped up assault operations in Ukraine&apos;s south over the past two weeks as they look to improve Moscow&apos;s battlefield positions, a spokesperson for the military told Ukrinform on March 12. Thirty-five attacks have been recorded in the area today so far, with Russian forces pushing on the Huliaipole and Orikhiv sectors in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, said Vladyslav Voloshyn, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command. &quot;This is not an offensive or part of the enemy&apos;s strategic actions, but tactical attempts to improve their position relative to the combat line,&quot; Voloshyn said. Russia has also intensified artillery shelling and air and missile strikes on Ukraine&apos;s Tavria group of forces, which covers Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, Voloshyn said. Voloshyn&apos;s statement come amid Russia&apos;s breakthrough in embattled Kursk Oblast. Multiple Ukrainian and Russian sources claimed on March 12 that Russian troops had entered Sudzha, a key Ukrainian-held stronghold in the Russian border region of Kursk. Previously, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine&apos;s offensive into Kursk Oblast prevented Russian forces from carrying out large-scale operations in northeastern and southern Ukraine. Parts of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts have been occupied by Russian forces since the full-scale invasion of 2022. The regions remain a regular target of Russian aerial attacks. The Ukrainian military warned in fall 2024 that Russian forces were amassing in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in preparation for a southern offensive. Heavy fortifications were constructed around the regional capital of Zaporizhzhia ahead of the possible renewed push.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-has-stepped-up-attack-in-ukraines-south-over-past-two-weeks-military-says/	2025-03-12T09:24:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2074365868.jpg
Ukraine won't recognize occupied territories as Russian as part of any peace deal, Zelensky says	Ukraine will not recognize any occupied territories as part of Russia under a potential future peace agreement with Moscow, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on March 12. &quot;We are fighting for our independence. Therefore, we will not recognize any occupied territories as Russia&apos;s. This is a fact,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Our people have fought for this, our heroes died. How many injured, how many passed. No one will forget about it... This is the most important red line. We will not let anyone forget about this crime against Ukraine.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s comments come a day after Kyiv agreed to a 30-day ceasefire put forth by the U.S. during the talks between the two countries in Jeddah. Ukraine said it was ready to move forward with the ceasefire if Russia did the same. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio later confirmed that Ukraine-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia on March 11 included discussions about potential &quot;territorial concessions&quot; as part of a negotiated settlement with Russia. The Trump administration has repeatedly said that both Kyiv and Moscow will have to make compromises for a peace deal, calling Ukraine&apos;s goal of restoring its pre-2014 borders &quot;unrealistic.&quot; Russian forces currently occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine, from where reports of systematic repression, torture, and forced deportations regularly emerge. While a ceasefire and peace deal could freeze the war along current front lines, Ukraine is unlikely to ever recognize Russian-occupied territories as legally part of Russia. Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts are partially controlled by Russian troops. Russia claims to have annexed the whole territory of those regions in 2022 despite not controlling two regional capitals &#x2014; Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Moscow also controls all of Ukraine&apos;s Crimean peninsula. When asked about sanctions or other steps to put pressure on Russia in case of violation of the ceasefire, Zelensky said that this move would depend on the U.S. side.d &quot;If they (Russians) are not ready (for a ceasefire), we do hope that the American side will demonstrate exactly what it said,&quot; the president added. Senator Lindsey Graham called for sanctions against Russia if Moscow refuses from a proposed ceasefire. He promised to introduce new congressional sanctions targeting Russia and nations that continue to buy Russian goods, including oil, gas, and uranium. In the past, Russia has ruled out a temporary ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. Russian nationalist voices and pro-war bloggers have already spoken out against the U.S.-backed proposal.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-wont-recognize/	2025-03-12T08:36:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203160376.jpg
Ex-envoy to Russia slams Trump's negotiating strategy as 'incredibly bad'	The Kyiv Independent&apos;s Chris York sits down with Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia and political scientist, to discuss the Ukraine-Russia peace negotiations, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s approach to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the ideological parallels between Putinism and MAGA.	https://kyivindependent.com/ex-envoy-to-russia-slams-trumps-negotiating-strategy-as-incredibly-bad/	2025-03-12T08:19:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_9383.jpg
Losing foothold in Kursk Oblast would be 'politically significant,' experts say	As Russian troops are set to push Ukrainian soldiers out of Kursk Oblast, experts say Kyiv&apos;s withdrawal from the region could be &quot;politically significant.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s seven-month-long hold of a small portion of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast might be ending. On March 12, Russian troops entered the town of Sudzha, which served as Ukraine&apos;s main stronghold in the region. Fearing encirclement, Ukrainian troops have begun to pull back closer to the border. The news comes a day after Ukraine had agreed to the U.S. proposal for a 30-day-long ceasefire. The Kremlin said &quot;it was studying the proposal.&quot; &quot;It feels like we&apos;re getting to a position where people are trying to settle the front lines in anticipation that we might have a set of negotiations,&quot; said Scott Lucas, a political scientist and professor of American Studies and International Politics at University College Dublin&apos;s Clinton Institute. Western and Ukrainian experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said that Ukraine has already achieved certain political objectives by invading Russia in the first place and holding onto parts of Kursk Oblast for months. Kyiv will now have to decide whether it should reinforce the Kursk salient by sending more troops and resources that could be deployed elsewhere, or organize a retreat to avoid what could be a disastrous scenario on the ground. &quot;Ukraine wants to be able to show that it continues to stand and to resist, even as the Trump administration walks away,&quot; Lucas said, referring to the U.S.&apos; cutting off its military aid and intelligence sharing earlier in March. The U.S. on March 11 agreed to lift the ban on intelligence sharing following talks with the Ukrainian side in Saudi Arabia. However, the future U.S. support &#x2014; and Europe&apos;s readiness to take the lead in providing Ukraine with military aid &#x2014; remains uncertain.

(Fermin Torrano / Anadolu via Getty Images)And losing a foothold in Russia may have an impact on the mood both inside and outside Ukraine. Kyiv has repeatedly pointed out the success in Kursk Oblast even as Russian troops advanced significantly along the front lines in Donetsk Oblast, capturing long-time Ukrainian strongholds of Vuhledar, and Kurakhove. Both Kyiv and Western countries have labeled the partial occupation of Kursk Oblast as a crucial bargaining chip for possible peace negotiations when the time comes. &quot;(Ukraine&apos;s) position in Kursk is an important one because certainly it&apos;s something that would factor in any negotiation that may come about in the coming year,&quot; then U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters in January. Russia&apos;s inability to protect its own territory last August and its decision to pursue further invasion of Ukraine at the cost of keeping safe its own territory resulted in &quot;negative sentiments&quot; domestically, according to Oleksiy Melnyk, the co-director of foreign policy and international security at the Kyiv-based think tank Razumkov Center. &quot;It&apos;s not about the city of Sudzha or square kilometers, but about Russian territorial integrity,&quot; Melnyk said. But it may have been a poor decision for Kyiv to publicly discuss its openness for trading the Kursk salient for Ukrainian territory, he added. Earlier in February, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the Guardian that he planned to play the Kursk card in potential negotiations to &quot;swap one territory for another&quot; without clarifying which part of Russian-occupied territory Kyiv would ask for in return. Disclosing Ukraine&apos;s negotiation position has likely served &quot;as a digger&quot; for Moscow to concentrate its effort to deprive Ukraine of such a leverage, he stressed.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)Moscow is currently accelerating its push in Kursk Oblast, with the Russian Defense Ministry claiming on March 11 that it recaptured 12 settlements and 100 square kilometers (40 square miles) of territory there. Ukrainian troops on the ground have told the Kyiv Independent in recent days that the situation is ever more critical, as the logistics were hampered. Russian forces have gained ground south of Sudzha, potentially cutting off some Ukrainian positions from the rest of the salient. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, denied threats of encirclement. Losing the Kursk salient would likely not result in a further decline of U.S. support as &quot;we can&apos;t get into negative numbers in that sense,&quot; according to Steven Horrell, a non-resident senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis. Hanging onto the Kursk Oblast territory is an important bargaining chip &quot;in the international eyes,&quot; with the operation allowing Ukraine to show Western countries that it can still strike back despite battlefield setbacks, Horrell said. &quot;I think the surge of (Western) support after the Kursk offensive was concrete proof of that,&quot; he added. Now, with the operation seemingly dying out slowly, Ukraine&apos;s potential retreat from Kursk Oblast can reinforce U.S. President Donald Trump and his team&apos;s point that &quot;there is no way Ukraine can win,&quot; Horrell said. &quot;Losing Kursk, people begin to question whether or not you just have to simply give up,&quot; Lucas said.	https://kyivindependent.com/losing-foothold-in-kursk-oblast-would-be-politically-significant-experts-say/	2025-03-12T08:01:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2166312596.jpg
Kremlin quiet on ceasefire proposal, Russian milbloggers call it 'pure treachery'	Moscow has remained tight-lipped over the news that Ukraine has accepted a full 30-day ceasefire proposal during negotiations with the U.S. in Jeddah on March 11. After the negotiations with Washington, Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office announced that it was ready to accept the terms if Russia also complied with the agreement. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio later said the &quot;ball is in (Russia&apos;s) court,&quot; adding if the Kremlin rejects the ceasefire proposal, &quot;then we&apos;ll, unfortunately, know what the impediment is to peace here.&quot; By the afternoon of March 12, the only thing close to an official Russian position on developments was an evasive answer from Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov when asked by journalists about the proposal. &quot;Look, you are getting a little ahead of yourselves. We don&apos;t want to do that,&quot; he said, explaining the topic must first be discussed with the American side. Prominent Russian state TV propagandists are also uncharacteristically quiet on the topic. Vladimir Solovyov stuck to official reports coming out of the meeting during the day, while Olga Skabeyeva simply asked, &quot;What would we get in return?&quot; But less constrained by the official Kremlin line, Russia&apos;s vibrant and vocal community of pro-war military bloggers, or milbloggers, were more forthcoming in their appraisal of the ceasefire proposal. &#x201C;Any ceasefire at this stage is pure treachery and sabotage,&quot; the milbogger channel Ngp Razvedka, which has almost 100,000 subscribers, said. &quot;The Ukrainian Armed Forces are holding on with their last strength, and it is possible to roll into Sumy on their shoulders,&quot; it added. The theme of a ceasefire being an opportunity for Ukrainian forces to regroup and rearm was repeated by several other milbloggers &#x2014; Two Majors, which has over 1.2 million subscribers, said the pause in fighting would allow them to &quot;lick their wounds.&quot; Ukrainian soldiers stay underground awaiting orders in Sumy Oblast, Ukraine, on Sept. 30, 2024.

(Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)&quot;The truce proposal is actually Minsk-3, which will give the Ukrainian Armed Forces an opportunity to strengthen and rearm,&quot; milblogger Yuriy Podolyaka, told his more than 3 million subscribers. &quot;After that, the war will continue in much worse conditions for us. Therefore, we will not agree, that much is obvious.&quot; Some of the anger was also directed at U.S. President Donald Trump. Millblogger Vladislav Evtushenko, told his 10,000 subscribers that the &quot;right thing to do would be to shoot the old man in the other ear,&quot; referencing the failed assassination attempt on Trump last year. According to reports, Russia is unlikely to agree to the temporary truce, feeling it has the upper hand on the battlefield and viewing the ceasefire as a trap, Reuters reported on March 12, citing undisclosed Russian sources. Any ceasefire agreement would have to take Russia&apos;s battlefield advances into account and provide &quot;guarantees&quot; to Moscow, sources told the news agency. In the past, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top officials have ruled out a temporary ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. Russia continues to occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory and made steady advances in Donetsk Oblast in late 2024. While Russia&apos;s advance in Ukraine&apos;s east has reportedly stalled earlier this year, Moscow&apos;s troops seemed to have made rapid gains in Kursk Oblast, the Russian border region where Ukraine has been fighting since August 2024. One source told Reuters that a ceasefire could weaken Russia&apos;s position, as the West could pin the blame on Moscow should it fail to end the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-quiet-on-ceasefire-proposal-russian-milbloggers-call-it-pure-treachery/	2025-03-12T07:31:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1255667814.jpg
Temporary ceasefire or redrawing borders? What â€˜territorial concessionsâ€™ mean to Ukraine, Russia, and the US	After Ukrainian and U.S. officials met in Saudi Arabia for peace deal talks to end the war with Russia, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed on March 12 that potential &quot;territorial concessions&quot; from Ukraine were part of the discussion. Since U.S. President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January and opened talks with the goal of ending the war quickly, members of his administration have repeatedly expressed that Ukraine will need to drop its long-standing demand that any end to the war involves a full return of captured territories. In recent months, Kyiv has relented and signaled that it is open to some sort of territorial concessions, inching closer to compromise between the two parties at war. But even with concessions potentially on the table, the parties in the conflict still have a stark divide to bridge. While a gulf remains between Russia and Ukraine on what territory could be up for negotiation, they also stand at odds on a far more basic question: how to define territorial concessions. &#x201C;The phrase &#x2018;territorial concessions&#x2019; means different things to different state actors,&#x201D; George Barros, who heads the Russia and geospatial intelligence teams at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), said in a written response to Kyiv Independent questions. Clarifying what the different sides mean when they use the phrase is &#x201C;key to understanding the opposing negotiating positions and the fraught information environment surrounding peace negotiations,&#x201D; he said.

(Salah Malkawi/Getty Images)Russia&#x2019;s demands: Ukrainian &#x2018;capitulation&#x2019;Russia&#x2019;s demands for concessions include the complete relinquishing by Ukraine of four oblasts &#x2014; Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. These oblasts contain wide swathes of territory that Ukraine currently controls, including the regional capitals of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. The four oblasts provide a valuable connection by land from Russia to Crimea, an autonomous region of Ukraine that Russia illegally annexed in 2014. Such a concession would transfer more land to Russia than simply freezing the current battle lines, where Russia currently controls around 20% of Ukraine&#x2019;s territory. In December, Russia said that a full withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from these oblasts would be a requirement to begin peace talks, a demand that Kyiv rejected. Not only is Russia seeking control of these territories, it is also seeking legal recognition from Ukraine and the U.S. that these territories belong to Russia. &#x201C;These demands are tantamount to a full Ukrainian and U.S. capitulation and would undermine the international-rules based order,&#x201D; said Barros. Last month, Russia also ruled out the idea of a territorial exchange &#x2014; exchanging land currently controlled by Russia for portions of Ukrainian-occupied Kursk in Russia. It is currently pushing forward in Kursk and regaining territory that Ukraine has held since the surprise offensive in August. In September 2022, Russia illegally enshrined ownership in its constitution over the four oblasts it now demands after illegal sham referendums in occupied territories, a move that holds no weight internationally. The move, however, complicates Russia&#x2019;s calculus in negotiations, said Andreas Umland, an analyst at the Stockholm Center for Eastern European Studies (SCEES). If Moscow formally agreed in negotiations that any of these territories do not legally belong to Russia, it would set a precedent Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely hoping to avoid, he explained. &#x201C;If there is some sort of compromise from Russia&#x2019;s side on territories that, according to its constitution, officially belong to Russia, then this could be a model for future breakups from the legitimate territory of Russia,&#x201D; Umland said. If a crisis broke out in a border region of Russia that wanted to break away, they could follow the model for changing or breaking the constitution to make that happen &#x201C;the same as was done in these Ukrainian territories,&#x201D; he said. Unlike Russia, Ukraine&#x2019;s position on territorial concessions has shifted over time. For the first years of the war &#x2014; and as recently as late last year &#x2014; Ukraine maintained it wouldn&#x2019;t negotiate any peace deal that didn&#x2019;t include a full restoration of Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereign land. Ukraine has demanded a return to its 2014 borders, prior to Russia&#x2019;s seizing of Crimea and a small area of the Donbas, though some see the 2022 borders as a more viable option, meaning the territory Ukraine held prior to the full-scale invasion. That position has softened in recent months as territory and troop losses mount during the third year of Russia&#x2019;s invasion and as the U.S. ramps up pressure on Ukraine to reach a quick settlement. While Ukraine now signals that it could accept the temporary occupation of territories Russia has seized, President Volodymyr Zelensky has underscored that Ukraine would still retain its legal claims to the land. &#x201C;We cannot legally acknowledge any occupied territory of Ukraine as Russian,&quot; Zelensky said in November. Ukraine is also not offering any concessions of land that Russia does not currently control.

(Andreas Arnold/picture alliance via Getty Images)The willingness among Ukraine&#x2019;s people to make territorial concessions to end the war quickly is at an all-time high, but the view is still in the minority, according to polling from the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published on Jan. 3. The poll found that around 38% percent of Ukrainians were open to conceding territory in a peace deal, up from 8% in December 2022. The number of Ukrainians who oppose giving up territories under any circumstances, &#x201C;even if this would prolong the war and threaten the preservation of independence,&#x201D; stands at 51%, according to the poll. A Gallup poll released in November 2024, however, found that just over half of Ukrainians were open to territorial concessions, compared with 38% who were not. Zelensky faces pressure to make a deal, but Ukrainian people are split over what type of deal is acceptable, said Umland of SCEES. &#x201C;I think that is also one of Russia&apos;s strategies,&#x201D; said Umland. &#x201C;They want to create this contentious issue in Ukraine.&#x201D; Neither poll clarified whether territorial concessions meant signing over land to Russia or an agreement where Ukraine would acknowledge occupation while still retaining its claim to the land. Russia and Ukraine&#x2019;s stances on territorial concessions are clear, if incompatible. What the U.S. means when it demands territorial concessions is far less explicit. Under the previous U.S. administration, former President Joe Biden ruled out handing land to Russia. &#x201C;The United States will never, never, never recognize Russia&apos;s claims on Ukraine&apos;s sovereign territory,&quot; U.S. President Joe Biden said on Sept. 29, 2022, after Russia illegally annexed Ukraine&#x2019;s four eastern oblasts. Trump&#x2019;s approach, however, has been far more transactional and no longer emphasizes Ukrainian sovereignty. U.S. President Donald Trump exits a Tesla Model S on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, DC, on March 11, 2025. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Trump reportedly said he wanted to see that Ukraine is willing to make territorial concessions before he restarted military aid to and intelligence Ukraine after cutting it in March, but hasn&#x2019;t specified what this could look like. Intelligence sharing and military aid were restored on March 11, after Ukraine and the United States agreed to a plan for a 30-day ceasefire. Whether Russia will agree to the terms is unknown. A Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on March 7 that it hadn&#x2019;t received any official proposals for territorial concessions. Earlier in March, Zelensky called for more clarity on the U.S.&#x2019;s position. Ahead of the March 11 talks in Saudi Arabia, a source in Zelensky&#x2019;s office responded to a question about what the Ukraine team expected to learn: &#x201C;Finally hearing what the Americans want from the negotiations.&quot; &#x201C;It&#x2019;s unclear what the U.S. is seeking in terms of territorial concessions,&#x201D; ISW&#x2019;s Barros said. &#x201C;For the U.S., there is a principled model for how to deal with wars of conquest: non-recognition of occupied territory. The U.S. never officially recognized the Soviet Union&#x2019;s occupation of the Baltic States, for example.&#x201D; After the Soviet army invaded and occupied the Baltic countries in 1940, Acting U.S. Secretary of State Sumner Welles issued a diplomatic statement known as the Welles Declaration. It condemned the Soviet Union&#x2019;s invasion and refused to recognize the Soviet-declared annexation of this territory. The statement &#x201C;lays out a principled blueprint&#x201D; for how the U.S. could handle a situation where Russia continued to occupy Ukrainian land without legally recognizing it, Barros added. The U.S. hasn&#x2019;t said whether it would follow a similar model. &#x201C;The stark reality is that Ukraine has offered some concessions to get to the negotiating table (concessions on territorial integrity) whereas the Russian side has not budged at all, and demands territorial concessions on lands that Russian forces haven&#x2019;t occupied on the battlefield,&#x201D; Barros said.	https://kyivindependent.com/temporary-ceasefire-or-redrawing-borders-what-territorial-concessions-mean-to-russia-ukraine-and-the-us/	2025-03-12T07:12:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201827435.jpg
Ukraine's military 'preserving maximum of lives of our soldiers' in Kursk Oblast, Zelensky says	Ukrainian troops operating in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast continue in their tasks despite intense Russian pressure, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a briefing on March 12. &#x201C;The military command is doing what it should do, preserving the maximum of lives of our soldiers,&quot; Zelensky said, urging a &quot;sober&quot; assessment of the battlefield situation rather than reacting to Russian information warfare. His remarks come as multiple Ukrainian and Russian sources claimed that Russian troops had entered Sudzha, a key Ukrainian-held stronghold in the Russian border region of Kursk. Russian news agency TASS published purported drone footage showing that Russian troops had entered the town center and raised a Russian flag. The Ukrainian military has not publicly commented on the claims. Roman Kostenko, secretary of the parliamentary defense committee, acknowledged that the situation in Kursk Oblast is &quot;complicated&quot; but said Ukrainian forces are working to stabilize the front line. &quot;I talked to the soldiers in the morning; they do not confirm our complete withdrawal from Sudzha... I have no information that our troops have completely left Sudzha as of two hours ago,&quot; Kostenko said at a press briefing. Sudzha is located less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Ukrainian border and 85 kilometers (53 miles) from the regional capital, Kursk. Russia launched a renewed offensive in Kursk Oblast last week and reportedly made rapid advances. The developments coincided with the U.S. instituting a temporary pause on all military and intelligence support for Ukraine. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said on March 10 that there is no immediate threat of encirclement as Ukrainian forces are repositioning to &quot;favorable defense lines.&quot; Ukraine launched the cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially seizing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. Since then, Russian forces, reinforced by North Korean troops, have steadily pushed back against Ukrainian forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-forces-continue-operations-in-kursk-under-heavy-russian-pressure-zelensky-says/	2025-03-12T06:54:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/fd0d9d5c4438dcaa95c1a8bd467e8c30_1686065778.jpeg
Ukraine doesn't trust Russia but wants to show US its readiness for peace, Zelensky says on ceasefire deal	Ukraine wanted to demonstrate to U.S. President Donald Trump and its European partners that it is serious about ending the war, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 12 about why Kyiv agreed to Washington&apos;s temporary truce proposal. While Ukraine initially proposed a partial ceasefire that would extend only to aerial and naval operations, U.S. delegates proposed a full truce during talks with Ukrainian officials in Jeddah on March 11. After receiving the proposal, Zelensky said Ukraine was &quot;ready for a 30-day ceasefire format offered by the U.S. side.&quot; &quot;I have repeatedly stressed that none of us trust Russia... but we will not play with narratives that we want the war to continue,&quot; Zelensky said at a press conference. &quot;I am very serious, and it is important for me to end the war. I want the U.S. president to see this; so that Europe and everybody unites to push Russia toward ending the war.&quot; After a heated exchange between Trump and Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28, the Trump administration accused Ukraine of not being ready for peace and froze military and intelligence assistance. The pause was lifted after Kyiv agreed to the ceasefire deal. The Ukrainian president also noted that the ceasefire would be only the first step toward a full peace. After the war ends, martial law will be lifted, and elections will be held, he added. The Trump administration has been pressuring Ukraine to hold elections even before a full peace agreement, even though the Ukrainian Constitution prohibits this under martial law. According to Zelensky, support from Kyiv&apos;s international partners will be required for &quot;technical monitoring&quot; of a full ceasefire. He also raised the question of whether Moscow is open to the agreement. The Kremlin has not voiced an official position on the proposal until it can discuss it with Washington. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said discussions with Russia would be held on March 12. Reuters reported earlier the same day that, according to undisclosed Russian officials, Russia is unlikely to agree to the proposal unless it takes into account Moscow&apos;s battlefield advances and other demands.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-doesnt-trust-russia-but-wants-to-show-trump-readiness-for-peace-zelensky-says-on-ceasefire-deal/	2025-03-12T06:34:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204065456--1-.jpg
Ukraine-US talks in Jeddah concerned potential territorial concessions, Rubio confirms	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed on March 12 that Ukraine-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia on March 11 included discussions about potential &quot;territorial concessions&quot; as part of a negotiated settlement with Russia. &quot;Yeah, we&apos;ve had conversations,&quot; Rubio said in an airport in Ireland when asked about potential discussions regarding Ukraine ceding territory. The Trump administration has repeatedly said that both Kyiv and Moscow will have to make compromises for a peace deal, calling Ukraine&apos;s goal of restoring its pre-2014 borders &quot;unrealistic.&quot; Russian forces currently occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine, from where reports of systematic repression, torture, and forced deportations emerge. Rubio also said that the Jeddah talks covered &quot;what a negotiation process would look like&quot; and reiterated, &quot;There is no military solution to this conflict.&quot; The official acknowledged that Ukraine requires security assurances to deter possible future Russian aggression and emphasized that &quot;Europeans will need to be involved in this regard.&quot; Trump has so far refused to offer such security guarantees, saying during his Feb. 28 meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky that responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security should fall on Europe. Kyiv agreed to a temporary 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia abides by it. Moscow has not officially declared its position on the proposal. U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 11 that Washington would engage Russian President Vladimir Putin this week to discuss the ceasefire terms. Rubio claimed the U.S. &#x201C;will have contact with Russians&#x201D; on March 12. The agreement led to the U.S. resuming military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, which had been suspended after Zelensky&apos;s Oval Office clash with Trump. The ceasefire proposal marks a significant shift for Kyiv, as Ukrainian officials have previously warned that a temporary pause in fighting would allow Russia to regroup and relaunch its offensive.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-talks-in-saudi-arabia-discussed-potential-territorial-concessions-rubio-confirms/	2025-03-12T06:01:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194087620.jpg
200,000-500,000 men could leave Ukraine after war ends and borders open, minister says	Between 200,000 and 500,000 men could leave Ukraine after the war with Russia ends and all travel restrictions are lifted, Deputy Prime Minister and National Unity Minister Oleksii Chernyshov said on March 12. Draft-age men are not permitted to leave Ukraine under martial law, which was instituted at the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, without a special permission. Speaking at a press briefing attended by the Kyiv Independent, Chernyshov stressed the demographic challenges facing Ukraine in the fourth year of the full-scale war. A January report by the National Bank of Ukraine estimated the net outflow of migrants from Ukraine at 200,000 this year and up to 500,000 in 2027. Some 32 million people live in Ukraine-controlled territories, Chernyshov said. Roughly 5 million Ukrainian refugees remain abroad under the temporary protection of host countries, while millions more live in Russian-occupied parts of the country. The minister estimated that only roughly 30% of the Ukrainians living abroad may return within the year after the war&apos;s potential end. Another 30% may not return at all, he added. Discussions about peace are gaining ground as the U.S. and Ukraine recently agreed on a temporary ceasefire, which they presented as a step toward a broader peace agreement with Russia. Demographic trends do not work in Ukraine&apos;s favor either. For every 150,000 Ukrainian children born in a year, 450,000 die in the same period, a figure excluding war-related deaths, according to the minister. This complicates an already dire situation in Ukraine&apos;s labor market. Ukraine currently lacks more than 4.5 million workers, Chernyshov said.	https://kyivindependent.com/200-000-500-000-men-could-leave-ukraine-after-war-ends-borders-open-minister-says/	2025-03-12T05:54:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1820446236.jpg
Northern Operational Command chief dismissed for unclear reasons	Major General Dmytro Krasylnykov, commander of Ukraine&apos;s Northern Operational Command, has been dismissed from his post, he told Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne on March 12. Krasylnykov said he was not given an official reason for his dismissal. The order, signed on March 7, places him in a reserve battalion. &quot;I&apos;m guessing, but I don&apos;t want to talk about it yet,&quot; Krasylnykov told Suspilne when asked about the possible reasons for his removal. The dismissal follows reports of intensified Russian advances against Ukrainian positions in Kursk Oblast, where Kyiv launched a cross-border incursion in August 2024. The Northern Operational Command oversees units deployed in Ukraine&apos;s northern regions, including Sumy Oblast, the launching ground for the Kursk incursion. Speaking to the outlet, Krasylnykov said he does not see any possible reasons for his dismissal, including in relation to the developments in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Roughly speaking, I left Kursk Oblast back in November (2024),&quot; he said. Russian forces reportedly have entered the town of Sudzha as of March 12, according to DeepState, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), and Russian state news agency TASS. Krasylnykov had commanded the Northern Operational and Tactical Group since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. In March 2023, he was appointed commander of the Northern Operational Command. On Feb. 28, 2022, Krasylnykov was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine and the Order of the Golden Star for his role in defending Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty. Concerns about the situation in Kursk Oblast have grown amid Ukraine&apos;s temporary loss of U.S. military and intelligence support after the Feb. 28 clash between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. The support was resumed on March 11 after Ukraine agreed to a U.S.-proposed temporary ceasefire.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-north-operational-command-chief-dismissed/	2025-03-12T04:53:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/468597721_967844978707860_4260084381588029574_n.jpg
Raiffeisen Bank International's subsidiary remains invested in sanctioned Russian entities, report says	Raiffeisen Bank International&apos;s (RBI) Russian assets manager continues to hold and promote investments in sanctioned Russian companies and government bonds, according to a joint investigation by the BankTrack NGO and the B4Ukraine coalition published on March 12. As of January, Raiffeisen Capital held around 31.7 billion rubles ($365 million) in shares and bonds in entities sanctioned by the U.S. and the EU for their role in supporting Russian aggression in Ukraine, the report said, citing financial documents. This sum is only part of the overall value of 70.9 billion ($818 million) rubles reportedly held across 10 funds. Austria&apos;s Raiffeisen banking group has been long scrutinized for failing to exit the Russian market despite the EU sanctions imposed at the outbreak of the full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022. The investigation highlights that these assets included roughly 2.7 billion rubles ($31 million) in state bonds issued after March 9, 2022, a cut-off date past which the EU banned trade in any transferable securities issued by the Russian government. The asset manager&apos;s other investments reportedly include about 1.6 billion rubles ($18.5 million) worth of shares in the Russian state-owned bank Sberbank and 2.2 billion rubles ($25.4 million) in the state energy giant Gazprom, both under Western sanctions. Raiffeisen remains the largest Western bank still operating in Russia, despite pleding in July 2024 that it would &quot;drastically&quot; scale down its business in the country. &quot;We must call these investments what they are: war profiteering with reckless disregard for the Ukrainian people and for European efforts to sanction the Russian war machine,&quot; said Max Hammer, a human rights campaigner at BankTrack. &quot;RBI must address and be made to answer for these violations, and it must provide detailed information on its financial links to the Russian war machine. If it fails to do so, European authorities should not hesitate to respond appropriately.&quot; The authors of the report argue that Raiffeisen Capital&apos;s investment activities may contravene European sanctions legislation. &quot;RBI has previously claimed that its Russian business is subject to rigorous due diligence and sanctions compliance checks, but these due diligence procedures have clearly not been enough to prevent the bank from investing in key sponsors of Russia&#x2019;s war of aggression,&quot; Nezir Sinani, the executive director at B4Ukraine, said in a statement. &quot;The time for RBI to decisively sever its relationship with Russia&#x2019;s wartime economy is long overdue.&quot; Raiffeisen Capital has not responded to the Kyiv Independent&apos;s request for comment at the time of publication.	https://kyivindependent.com/raiffeisen-bank-internationals-subsidiary-remains-invested-in-sanctioned-russian-entities-report-says/	2025-03-12T04:30:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1250736178.jpg
Russian, US intelligence chiefs call to discuss 'reducing confrontation,' Russian media reports	Sergey Naryshkin, director of Russia&apos;s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and CIA Director John Ratcliffe held a telephone conversation on March 11 to discuss reducing confrontation between Moscow and Washington, pro-Kremlin media outlet Kommersant reported. According to Kommersant, the agencies agreed to maintain communication &quot;to help ensure international stability and security, as well as to reduce confrontation.&quot; &quot;The two intelligence services discussed issues of interaction in the areas of common interest and crisis management,&quot; the service said, as quoted by Kommersant. Naryshkin last spoke with the CIA chief, a position held at the time by Bill Burns, in the summer of 2023. The renewed dialogue follows U.S.-Russia talks in Istanbul on Feb. 27 and an earlier round in Riyadh on Feb. 18, part of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s push for a swift peace deal between Ukraine and Russia. Russia&apos;s Foreign Ministry previously said that it hopes such discussions will &quot;strengthen trust&quot; between Moscow and Washington. The direct engagement between the U.S. and Russia has raised concerns in Kyiv and Europe that Washington is sidelining its allies. Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, has emphasized the administration&apos;s intent to reset relations with Russia, blaming previous U.S. leadership for avoiding direct engagement with Russian President Vladimir Putin.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-us-intelligence-chiefs-reportedly-discuss-reducing-confrontation/	2025-03-12T04:09:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-172750694--1-.jpeg
EU retaliates against new US steel, aluminum tariffs	The European Union announced measures in response to new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, planning duties on over $28 billion worth of U.S. goods, according to an official statement published on March 12. The move follows U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s decision to impose 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, reigniting trade tensions between Washington and Brussels. In response, the European Commission is launching countermeasures to protect businesses, workers, and consumers from what it called &quot;unjustified U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs.&quot; The EU&apos;s countermeasures could affect up to 26 billion euros ($28.3 billion) worth of U.S. goods exports, equivalent to the economic impact of the U.S. tariffs. The retaliatory steps will be introduced in two phases. Previously suspended countermeasures, first imposed during the first Trump term in 2018 and 2020, will lapse on April 1, responding to U.S. tariffs costing 8 billion euros ($8.7 billion) in EU exports. The second phase will introduce new countermeasures on April 13 in response to U.S. tariffs costing the EU 18 billion euros ($19.7 billion) in exports. &quot;We deeply regret this measure. Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business and even worse for consumers. These tariffs are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy,&quot; said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The commission signaled its willingness to negotiate a resolution, saying that the measures could be lifted if an agreement is reached. Trump defended the tariffs as a means to simplify duties on metals and suggested retaliatory measures against countries imposing tariffs on U.S. goods. The dispute dates back to Trump&apos;s first term, when his administration imposed duties on nearly $7 billion of European exports in 2018, citing national security concerns. The EU retaliated with its own tariffs on American products. A temporary truce was reached in 2021 under the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden, with the U.S. replacing the tariffs with a quota system and the EU freezing its countermeasures. Trump&apos;s new tariffs threaten to reignite the trade conflict, with the European Commission warning that such restrictions could disrupt supply chains and raise costs for businesses and consumers. The U.S.&apos;s tariffs threat Ukraine&apos;s industry as well. Steel production is a key sector of Ukraine&apos;s economy, the second-largest source of foreign currency after agriculture.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-announces-response-to-new-us-steel-aluminum-tariffs/	2025-03-12T03:22:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-688109050.jpg
Putin unlikely to accept 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, Reuters reports	Russia is unlikely to agree to a temporary truce in Ukraine proposed by the U.S., feeling it has the upper hand on the battlefield and viewing the ceasefire as a trap, Reuters reported on March 12, citing undisclosed Russian sources. Any ceasefire agreement would have to take Russia&apos;s battlefield advances into account and provide &quot;guarantees&quot; to Moscow, sources told the news agency. Ukraine agreed to the U.S.&apos;s proposal for a 30-day truce during talks in Jeddah on March 11, after which Washington resumed military and intelligence support for Kyiv. The U.S. is expected to discuss the proposal with Russia in the coming days. The Kremlin is yet to comment on the idea, but Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top officials have previously ruled out a temporary ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. Russia continues to occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory and made steady advances in Donetsk Oblast in late 2024. While Russia&apos;s advance in Ukraine&apos;s east has reportedly stalled earlier this year, Moscow&apos;s troops seemed to have made rapid gains in Kursk Oblast, the Russian border region where Ukraine has been fighting since August 2024. One source told Reuters that a ceasefire could weaken Russia&apos;s position, as the West could pin the blame on Moscow should it fail to end the war. Russian nationalist voices and pro-war bloggers have already denounced the ceasefire proposal. Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the international committee in the Russian Senate, said that any deal should be hashed out on Moscow&apos;s terms.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-unlikely-to-accept-30-day-ceasefire-in-ukraine-reuters-reports/	2025-03-12T02:55:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2161636677.jpg
Russia reportedly enters Ukraine-held Sudzha in Kursk Oblast; Kyiv hasn't confirmed	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russian troops have launched an offensive on the Ukrainian-controlled town of Sudzha in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the DeepState monitoring group, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), and the Russian state news agency TASS claimed on March 12. According to DeepState, Russian forces have entered the eastern part of Sudzha and are entrenching their positions. Russian state media outlet TASS published purported drone footage of the town, claiming Russian troops had entered the town center. ISW analysts reported that Russian troops continue to advance within Sudzha itself, as well as north of the town near the settlements of Kazachya Loknya, Yuzhny, Kubatkino, and Ivashkovskyi, and along the border in Ukraine&apos;s Sumy Oblast. The claims could not be immediately verified. The Kyiv Independent has contacted the Ukrainian military command in Kursk Oblast for comment and has been promised an official statement later. Sudzha is located less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Ukrainian border, with the regional capital, Kursk, lying 85 kilometers (53 miles) to the northeast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-reportedly-launches-assault-on-ukrainian-controlled-sudzha-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-03-12T02:21:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166820734.jpg
US resumes sharing intelligence with Ukraine, Gabbard confirms	Tulsi Gabbard, the U.S. director of national intelligence, confirmed on March 12 that the U.S. had resumed sharing intelligence with Ukraine per President Donald Trump&apos;s direction. The move follows U.S.-Ukraine talks in Jeddah on March 11, during which both sides preliminarily agreed on a 30-day ceasefire, and Washington resumed military and intelligence assistance to Kyiv. &quot;Because of @POTUS leadership, we are one significant step closer to ending the bloody war in Ukraine,&quot; Gabbard said on X. &quot;Per the President&apos;s direction, the pause on intelligence sharing with Ukraine has ended.&quot; The U.S. restricted intelligence sharing with Ukraine on March 5, shortly after pausing all military assistance flowing to the country. The steps followed a heated exchange between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28. U.S. intelligence has been crucial for Kyiv in planning precision strikes against Russia, monitoring the movement of Russian troops, and detecting Russia&apos;s aerial strikes. The full impact of the intelligence sharing pause remains unclear. During that short period, Russia achieved a significant breakthrough in Kursk Oblast and launched several deadly aerial strikes against Ukraine. Steve Witkoff, Trump&apos;s envoy for the Middle East, claimed that the restrictions did not concern intelligence needed for defensive purposes.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-resumes-sharing-intelligence-with-ukraine-gabbard-confirms/	2025-03-12T02:09:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203492012.jpg
Trump to invite Zelensky back to White House following Saudi talks	U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 11 that President Volodymyr Zelensky is welcome to return to the White House following talks in Saudi Arabia, where Ukraine agreed to a temporary ceasefire. Trump reiterated that Ukraine had accepted a full 30-day ceasefire proposal during negotiations in Jeddah and expressed hope that &quot;Russia will agree to it.&quot; &quot;We&apos;re going to meet with them (Russia) later on today and tomorrow, and hopefully, we&apos;ll be able to (work) out a deal. I think the ceasefire is very important,&quot; Trump said. When asked if Zelensky would be invited back to the White House, the U.S. president responded, &quot;Sure, absolutely.&quot; The development comes after weeks of strained ties between Kyiv and Washington following a heated Oval Office exchange between Trump and Zelensky on Feb. 28. This clash derailed plans to sign a bilateral mineral resources deal and led to the freeze of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing. In the aftermath, White House officials signaled that Zelensky needed to apologize and commit to peace talks to restore discussions. On March 4, Zelensky called the confrontation &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his willingness to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Following negotiations in Saudi Arabia, Ukraine confirmed its readiness to implement a temporary 30-day ceasefire, contingent on Russia&apos;s adherence to the agreement. The decision marks a significant shift, as Ukrainian officials had previously warned that any pause in fighting would allow Russia to regroup and prepare for future offensives. Talks in Jeddah also resulted in Washington restoring military and intelligence support to Ukraine, reversing Trump&apos;s earlier decision to suspend assistance after the Feb. 28 dispute.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-invites-zelensky-back-to-white-house-following-saudi-talks/	2025-03-12T01:52:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201820195.jpg
Slovakiaâ€™s protests prove the fight for Europe isnâ€™t over	On March 7, tens of thousands of people took to the streets across Slovakia for the third time this year to protest the pro-Russian policies of Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico&#x2019;s government. They voiced concerns that Slovakia is drifting away from the European Union and its transatlantic allies. Their fears are well-founded. Since autumn 2023, a coalition of nationalist, EU-skeptic, and pro-Russian parties has held power in Bratislava. While Fico&#x2019;s left-wing Smer party pushes pro-Russian rhetoric, the Slovak National Party (SNS) promotes a &#x201C;pan-Slavic brotherhood&#x201D; with Moscow. The result is the same: under Fico, Slovakia is moving in a direction similar to Viktor Orb&#xE1;n&#x2019;s Hungary. Fico&#x2019;s government has demonstrated a clear alignment with Moscow. In September 2024, he falsely claimed that Nazi troops were fighting in Ukraine. He was also the first prime minister of an EU member state to grant an interview to the Russian state television channel Rossiya 1. In October 2024, &#x13D;ubo&#x161; Blaha, a European Parliament member of Fico&#x2019;s Smer, traveled to Moscow to &#x201C;apologize to the Russians for EU sanctions,&#x201D; provocatively stating, &#x201C;fascism and war come from the West, while freedom and peace come from the East.&#x201D; Fico met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in December 2024, and he had already accepted Putin&#x2019;s invitation to travel to Moscow in May 2025. In January 2025, a delegation from SNS also visited Moscow, where party chairman Andrej Danko called Putin &#x201C;a very reasonable and pragmatic leader.&#x201D; Concerned about the government&#x2019;s pro-Russian stance, the liberal opposition party Freedom and Solidarity (SaS) proposed enshrining Slovakia&#x2019;s EU membership in the constitution. The response from Fico&#x2019;s camp was both surprising and alarming: Tibor Ga&#x161;par, a former police chief indicted for criminal activity and now a Smer politician, suggested that Slovakia should consider leaving the EU if its rules were to change. Even President Peter Pellegrini, from the coalition partner Hlas, distanced himself from Ga&#x161;par&#x2019;s remarks. While a Slovak exit from the EU may still seem unlikely, many citizens are deeply unsettled by the government&#x2019;s direction. This frustration has fueled mass protests, where demonstrators wave Ukrainian flags and rally under the slogan &#x201C;Peace for Ukraine.&#x201D; Fico, however, has responded with conspiracy theories. When his government faced a no-confidence vote in January 2025 &#x2014; after losing several MPs and potentially its parliamentary majority &#x2014; he called for a closed session, claiming Slovakia&#x2019;s intelligence service (led by the son of Tibor Ga&#x161;par) had warned him of an attempted coup. According to Fico, NGOs active in Ukraine and Georgia were plotting to overthrow him &#x2014; a claim with no evidence, but one that echoed the rhetoric of Viktor Orb&#xE1;n in Hungary. Around the same time, Orb&#xE1;n himself visited Bratislava, further strengthening ties between the two leaders. In the end, Fico managed to block the no-confidence vote, despite his government&#x2019;s fragile majority. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico in Bratislava, Slovakia, on Oct. 1, 2023. (Vladimir Simicek/AFP via Getty Images)Fico&#x2019;s Orb&#xE1;n-like approach extends beyond foreign policy into domestic affairs. Ironically, Fico &#x2014; who pursued anti-Hungarian minority policies in his first term (2006&#x2013;2010) &#x2014; has now become a close ally of Orb&#xE1;n. Even Slovakia&#x2019;s Hungarian minority party aligns with Fico&#x2019;s anti-Ukrainian, pro-Russian stance. Like Orb&#xE1;n, Fico has worked to weaken democratic checks and balances &#x2014; amending criminal law in his interests, restructuring public media to silence critical journalists, and allowing SNS&#x2019;s nationalist culture minister to wage a political war against artists (theater and museum directors have been dismissed and replaced with loyalists). Despite these troubling developments, Slovakia under Fico remains freer and more pluralistic than Orb&#xE1;n&#x2019;s Hungary. The key difference is stability: Orb&#xE1;n has ruled since 2010 with a strong parliamentary majority, whereas Fico&#x2019;s coalition is fragile and divided. Some MPs from his smaller coalition partners, SNS and Hlas, have already left the government, though they have not yet voted against him. Fico&#x2019;s pro-Russian stance has so far been more of a rhetorical tool for domestic politics. Unlike Orb&#xE1;n, he ultimately did not block the EU&#x2019;s decision on Ukraine in early March, as he hopes the European Union will secure gas supplies for Slovakia. Fico&#x2019;s pragmatism can also be explained by the fact that a fully pro-Russian foreign policy and a boycott strategy at the European level would not even be entirely supported within his own coalition &#x2014; particularly by the Hlas party of President Peter Pellegrini. At the same time, the issue of Ukraine &#x2014; again in contrast to Hungary &#x2014; is a key mobilising force for the Slovak opposition. While the Hungarian opposition avoids open and direct confrontation with Orb&#xE1;n on this matter out of opportunism, tens of thousands of people take to the streets in Slovakia to demonstrate in support of Ukraine and against Fico&#x2019;s pro-Russian policies. Political instability and mounting public resistance continue to pressure Fico. On the streets of Slovak cities, the Ukrainian flag has become a symbol of pro-European commitment for many. They are not &#x201C;foreign agents,&#x201D; as Fico claims, but decent citizens of Slovakia who want to avoid the Orb&#xE1;nization of their country.

Maxar reportedly restores Ukraine's access to high-resolution satellite imagery	U.S. aerospace company Maxar Technologies has restored Ukraine&apos;s access to the Global Enhanced GEOINT Delivery (GEGD) service, allowing Kyiv to utilize high-resolution commercial satellite imagery again, Ukrainian media outlet Militarnyi reported on March 12, citing users of the service. Ukraine has relied on such imagery for defense and strategic planning, including tracking Russian troop movements, assessing battlefield conditions, and monitoring damage to Russian infrastructure. According to Militarnyi&apos;s sources, the program&apos;s resumption means Ukraine can again access critical satellite intelligence for defense operations. The move follows U.S.-Ukraine talks in Jeddah on March 11, where Washington agreed to restart key military and intelligence support for Ukraine. On March 7, Militarnyi reported that Maxar had restricted Ukraine&apos;s access to its satellite imagery, citing unnamed users. The company later confirmed the suspension in a statement to the Kyiv Independent, explaining that the restrictions applied specifically to imagery provided through U.S. government programs. CIA Director John Ratcliffe said on March 5 that the U.S. had halted intelligence sharing with Ukraine in a step seen as pressure tactics to push Kyiv toward peace negotiations with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/maxar-technologies-restores-ukraines-access-to-high-resolution-satellite-imagery/	2025-03-12T01:33:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1232955804.jpg
Georgia's ex-President Saakashvili sentenced to 9 more years in prison on embezzlement charges	Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili has been sentenced to an additional nine years in prison for an alleged large-scale embezzlement of state funds, the Tbilisi City Court ruled, as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s Georgian service reported on March 12. Judge Badri Kochlamazashvili found Saakashvili guilty of misappropriating 9 million lari (about $5.4 million at the time) from the state budget between May 2009 and February 2013 for personal expenses, including luxury hotels, cosmetic procedures, and designer clothing. Teimuraz Janashia, former head of the Special Guard Service, was also convicted in the case and fined 300,000 Georgian lari ($108,000) for abuse of office. Both men denied the charges, calling the trial politically motivated. Saakashvili, Georgia&apos;s president between 2004-2007 and 2008-2013, sought to take his country on a pro-Western path but lost elections to the Moscow-friendly Georgian Dream party a few years after the defeat in the Russia-Georgia war in 2008. The politician was detained upon returning to Georgia in 2021 and is currently serving six years in prison on charges of ordering the beating of opposition lawmaker Valery Gelashvili in 2005. He was also given a three-year sentence for abuse of power charges for pardoning four police officers convicted of murder in 2008. The former president, a longtime critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has accused oligrach Bidzina Ivanishvili, the honorary chairman of the Georgian Dream party, of orchestrating his prosecution on Moscow&apos;s orders. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled on May 23 that there were no grounds to believe that Saakashvili&apos;s criminal proceedings were unfair. In February 2023, President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Georgian government was &quot;killing&quot; Saakashvili after photos surfaced showing his deteriorating health and significant weight loss. Saakashvili holds Ukrainian citizenship and served as the governor of Odesa Oblast between 2015 and 2016. The ruling follows mass protests in Tbilisi over the disputed October election results, which saw the Kremlin-friendly Georgian Dream party retain power. Since the election, a number of Western countries have imposed sanctions on Georgia over the perceived democratic backsliding. The political crisis deepened after Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced that Georgia&apos;s EU integration could be delayed until 2028.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-ex-president-saakashvili-sentenced-to-nine-more-years-in-prison-for-embezzlement/	2025-03-12T01:15:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1251132287.jpg
Ukraine, US to start discussing ceasefire details next week, Yermak says	Kyiv and Washington have agreed to begin technical-level discussions on a temporary 30-day ceasefire in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine next week, Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak said on March 11 after talks in Saudi Arabia. &quot;Next week, we have already agreed that at the technical expert level, the teams will start talking about all the details,&quot; Yermak told reporters. The deal marks a surprising shift for Ukraine, which has previously warned that a temporary pause in fighting would allow Russia to regroup and launch further offensives. The proposal would require Moscow to abide by the ceasefire terms. Talks in Jeddah also led to Washington restarting key military and intelligence support for Ukraine, reversing a decision made after the Feb. 28 Oval Office confrontation between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to Yermak, the discussions also covered potential security guarantees for Ukraine, though he acknowledged that negotiations on this front are still ongoing. &quot;We understand exactly what we need. Our American partners understand this. They are sympathetic to this issue, but these conversations continue. Today, we have taken the first step, a very important one. And there is still much work to be done,&quot; he said. Trump has previously refused to commit to security guarantees for Ukraine, saying in February that Europe should take responsibility for Kyiv&apos;s security. Moscow has not publicly responded to the U.S.-backed proposal. Russian nationalist voices and pro-war bloggers have already expressed opposition to a ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. Trump said the U.S. would seek to engage Russian President Vladimir Putin in discussions on the plan this week. &quot;It takes two for tango, as I have already said, so I hope he (Putin) will also agree as well, and I really think that would be 75% of the way, the rest is getting it documented,&quot; Trump said on March 11.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-teams-to-start-ceasefire-technical-discussions-next-week-yermak-said/	2025-03-12T00:22:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-11_11-38-26.jpg
Updated: 14 killed, 33 injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over past day	Editor&apos;s note: The story was updated with the latest casualty figures from Kryvyi Rih. Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least 14 civilians and injured at least 33 over the past day, regional authorities reported on March 12. The casualties included children and Syrian crew members of a merchant vessel in Odesa. At least one person was killed and 10 injured during Russian attacks against Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. A series of explosions were reported in Kryvyi Rih after Russia launched a missile strike against the city early on March 12. A 47-year-old woman was killed, while nine other people were injured, Lysak said. Seven of them have been hospitalized, and three are in serious condition.

Russia, China, Iran hold joint naval drills in Gulf of Oman	China, Iran, and Russia conducted joint naval drills on March 11 in the Gulf of Oman, Iran&apos;s state-affiliated Tasnim news agency reported. The exercises, named Maritime Security Belt 2025, were held near the strategic Strait of Hormuz, a key global shipping route through which a fifth of the world&apos;s traded crude oil passes. China, Iran, and Russia have maintained close ties, with Beijing and Tehran supporting Moscow&apos;s war effort despite Western sanctions. The latest drills come as Russia deepens military cooperation with Iran, which has supplied Moscow with thousands of Shahed attack drones used in strikes against Ukraine. China has become Russia&apos;s largest supplier of dual-use goods &#x2014; components that can be used in weapons production. The three countries have carried out similar exercises in past years, including in 2023 and 2024. The latest joint drills highlight ongoing coordination between the three authoritarian regimes as divisions grow in the West over U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s foreign policy shifts, including reduced military commitments in Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-china-iran-hold-joint-naval-drills-in-gulf-of-oman/	2025-03-11T23:39:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1248343324.jpeg
30-day ceasefire 'not a frozen conflict,' Ukraine's FM says	A 30-day ceasefire plan agreed upon between the U.S. and Ukraine &quot;is not a frozen conflict&quot; but the &quot;beginning of the path toward a just peace,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on March 11. Kyiv agreed to the temporary ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia abides by it. The talks in Saudi Arabia also led to the U.S. restarting key military and intelligence support for Ukraine. &quot;Ukraine is not an obstacle to peace; it is a partner in restoring it,&quot; said Sybiha, who was present at the talks. Ukraine&apos;s agreeing to the proposed truce demonstrates &quot;who is really interested in peace,&quot; he added. The deal is a surprising turnaround for Kyiv. Ukrainian officials have often warned about the dangers of a temporary pause in the fighting, arguing that it will provide Russia with a chance to recover strength and launch further attacks. &quot;The U.S. side will now talk to Russia about its willingness or unwillingness to end the war,&quot; Sybiha noted. In the past, Russia has also ruled out a temporary ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. Russian nationalist voices and pro-war bloggers have already spoken out against the U.S.-backed proposal. U.S. President Donald Trump said that Washington would seek to engage Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin this week to discuss the plan. &quot;It takes two for tango, as I have already said, so I hope he (Putin) will also agree as well, and I really think that would be 75% of the way, the rest is getting it documented,&quot; Trump said on March 11. &quot;We will have a big meeting with Russia tomorrow.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-proposed-ceasefire-not-a-frozen-conflict-ukraines-fm-says/	2025-03-11T23:23:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/483793538_1183688763331503_7338987230649715978_n.jpg

Iceland allocates over $2 million to support Ukrainian energy sector	Iceland will allocate over 2 million euros ($2.17 million) to Ukraine&apos;s Energy Support Fund, the Ministry of Energy reported on March 11. This will bring Iceland&#x2019;s total contributions to Ukraine&#x2019;s energy sector to more than 5.6 million euros ($6.09 million) thus far. According to Ukraine&apos;s Energy Ministry, Iceland made four tranches of contributions between 2023 and 2024. The funds have been used to buy equipment for energy companies in Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions. Herman Halushchenko, Ukraine&#x2019;s Energy Minister, stressed the importance of contributions like these for returning light and heat to the homes of Ukrainians, and for restoring infrastructure that was damaged by Russian attacks. &#x201C;Each contribution of partners to the Energy Support Fund of Ukraine is extremely important,&#x201D; Halushchenko said. &#x201C;We are grateful to Iceland for its support and another contribution to Ukraine&apos;s energy sustainability.&#x201D; The Icelandic parliament, Althing, adopted a resolution on long-term assistance for Ukraine from 2024 to 2028. The resolution aims to support the independence, sovereignty, borders, the safety of civilians, humanitarian aid, and reconstruction work in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/iceland-allocates-over-2-million-to-support-ukrainian-energy-sector/	2025-03-11T22:03:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-549681041.jpg
Von der Leyen welcomes US, Ukraine talks and reaffirms EU support	European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the results of Ukraine&#x2019;s talks with the U.S. in Jeddah, on March 11, and reaffirmed the EU&#x2019;s support. She praised the resumption of U.S. military assistance and intelligence sharing, as well as the initiation of a peace agreement proposal. &#x201C;This is a positive development that can be a step towards a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for Ukraine,&#x201D; von der Leyen said on X. She also added that the EU is looking forward to participating in the negotiation process. &#x201C;The EU is ready to play its full part, together with its partners, in the upcoming peace negotiations,&#x201D; she said. Ukrainian and U.S. delegates met in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11, in which the U.S. delegation proposed a 30-day complete ceasefire, pending Russia&#x2019;s agreement. The ceasefire proposal, along with the U.S. resuming military aid and intelligence sharing, were two major developments during the talks. Along with these topics, the delegations also discussed humanitarian efforts in achieving peace, including the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of detained civilians, and the return of forcibly displaced Ukrainian children.	https://kyivindependent.com/von-der-leyen-welcomes-us-ukraine-talks-and-reaffirms-eu-support/	2025-03-11T20:35:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1258844481.jpg
Russian attacks on Donetsk Oblast kill 4, injure 5	Russian troops launched a series of attacks on March 11 against Donetsk Oblast, killing at least four civilians and injuring five, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Two brothers, aged 11 and 13, were among those killed in the attacks. Additionally, two women, aged 51 and 57, died of severe injuries. Russian forces used FPV drones, artillery, and bombs to carry out the attacks in multiple settlements and cities of Donetsk Oblast, including Rivne village Molocharska village, Pokrovsk, and Rodynske. Some of the injured civilians are under serious condition, including a 14-year old child. Multiple victims suffered from head and neck wounds. &quot;I say this every day: evacuate!&#x201D; Filashkin wrote on Telegram. &#x201C;And every day I am forced to write tragic reports about more deaths.

Poland ready to receive American aid for Ukraine	Poland is prepared to resume the transport of American aid to Ukraine through its territory, according to Minister of National Defense Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz. His comments followed the recent developments in the U.S.-Ukraine talks, including the March 11 decision to lift the suspension on intelligence sharing and military aid. The U.S. has suspended military aid and intelligence to Ukraine after a meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance in the White House that ended in a heated argument. Kosiniak-Kamysz expressed readiness to activate Poland&#x2019;s Jasionka hub, maintaining full operational capabilities for American support. In a TVN24 interview, Kosiniak-Kamysz acknowledged that, after several days of stalled negotiations, a return to talks was a crucial and positive step. &quot;We have to take this at face value, as an important step in returning to talks,&quot; he said. &quot;We are fully prepared to resume American support,&quot; the minister said. Kosiniak-Kamysz emphasized the importance of this development, adding that Trump could now test whether Russia&#x2019;s previous declarations were genuine or merely an attempt to undermine Western unity and solidarity with Ukraine. He noted that, despite the positive signal from the resumption of talks, it was still crucial to approach the situation cautiously.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-ready-to-receive-american-aid-for-ukraine/	2025-03-11T18:18:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161798255.jpg
Trump will talk to Putin soon as Russia flags possible contact with US in coming days	Russia said on March 11 it may engage in talks with the United States in the coming days, following U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s statement that he might speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week. &quot;We do not rule out contacts with U.S. representatives within the next few days,&quot; Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told state news agencies. After Kyiv signaled its willingness to accept Washington&apos;s proposal for an immediate, temporary 30-day ceasefire, extendable by mutual agreement, Trump emphasized the need to engage with Russia, expressing hope that Putin would also agree and that negotiations could move forward. &quot;For tango, it takes two, as I have already said, so I hope he (Putin) will agree as well, and I really think that would be 75% of the way, the rest is just paperwork,&quot; Trump said. &quot;Ukraine has agreed to it, and hopefully Russia will agree to it. We&apos;re going to meet with them later on, today and tomorrow, and hopefully, we&apos;ll be able to wipe out a deal. But I think the ceasefire is very important. If we can get Russia to do it, that&apos;ll be great. If we can&apos;t, we just keep going on, and people are going to get killed, lots of people,&quot; Trump told reporters at the White House. Cease-fire negotiations gained fresh momentum during talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, after previously stalling following a heated confrontation between the Ukrainian and U.S. presidents at the White House. In the wake of that tense exchange, the Trump administration had halted all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. The joint statement issued on March 11 marked a significant development, coming just hours after Russian officials reported that Ukrainian drones had launched the largest attack on Moscow since the war began. The United States agreed to lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine, Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office announced following the meetings.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-will-talk-to-putin-soon-as-russia-flags-possible-contact-with-us-in-coming-days/	2025-03-11T17:41:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183214747.jpg
US restores Ukraine aid following breakthrough talks, senior Ukrainian official says	The United States has resumed security assistance to Ukraine following high-level talks in Saudi Arabia, Deputy Head of the Presidential Office Pavlo Palisa announced on March 11. &quot;I have confirmation that security assistance from the U.S. has been resumed. The agreements are being implemented. The fight continues!&quot; Palisa wrote on Facebook. The announcement follows a meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian delegations in Jeddah, where the two sides sought to find common ground after weeks of strained relations. As one of the key outcomes of the talks, Kyiv confirmed its readiness to accept Washington&#x2019;s proposal for an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, provided that Russia agrees to the terms and implements them simultaneously. Tensions between Ukraine and the U.S. had escalated following a contentious meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Feb. 28. The heated exchange led to a freeze in military and intelligence support from the U.S., raising concerns in Kyiv about America&#x2019;s commitment to Ukraine&#x2019;s defense. The joint statement issued after the Jeddah meeting reaffirmed Ukraine&#x2019;s conditional support for the U.S.-proposed ceasefire, which could be extended beyond 30 days if all parties agree. &quot;The American side understands our arguments and accepts our proposals, I would like to thank President Trump for the constructive nature of the dialogue between our teams,&quot; Zelensky said following the meeting.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-restores-ukraine-aid-following-breakthrough-talks-senior-ukrainian-official-says/	2025-03-11T16:12:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/DSCF7967.jpg
Macron rallies Europe to back Ukraine following ceasefire talks, Le Monde reports	French President Emmanuel Macron urged European and NATO military leaders on March 11 to develop a concrete plan for &quot;credible security guarantees&quot; for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. Speaking at a closed-door meeting in Paris with military chiefs from more than 30 allied nations, Macron emphasized that Europe must &quot;throw its full weight behind Ukraine, and itself,&quot; according to Le Monde. His appeal followed Ukraine&#x2019;s endorsement of a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire and agreement to negotiations with Russia in Jeddah. The meeting included representatives from 34 countries, including Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, but no U.S. officials were present. Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer have taken the lead in forming a &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; to enforce an eventual ceasefire in Ukraine. The French presidency reported that military leaders from European and NATO countries, including the U.K. and Turkey, agreed that security guarantees for Ukraine &quot;should not be separated from NATO and its capabilities.&quot; These guarantees must be &quot;credible and long-term&quot; and should be paired with &quot;unfailing support for the Ukrainian army.&quot; French Defense Minister S&#xE9;bastien Lecornu underscored the importance of planning for Ukraine&apos;s future military needs, adding that: &quot;We will reject any form of demilitarisation of Ukraine.&quot; Concerns over Washington&apos;s shifting stance on Russia and Ukraine have fueled Europe&apos;s push to strengthen its own defenses. Trump&#x2019;s earlier decision to suspend military aid and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, along with his renewed negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, has raised fears that the U.S. may pressure Ukraine into a settlement favoring Russia. European leaders are scrambling to ensure that Ukraine&#x2019;s security does not become a bargaining chip in U.S.-Russia talks. &quot;It is simply a question of looking ahead and thinking about what the Ukrainian army should be in the future,&quot; Lecornu said. Following the military chiefs&#x2019; meeting, defense ministers from Europe&#x2019;s five largest military powers&#x2014;France, the U.K., Germany, Italy, and Poland&#x2014;are set to gather in Paris on March 12. EU and NATO representatives, as well as Ukraine&#x2019;s defense minister, will also take part in discussions focused on &quot;the necessary rearmament of Europe&quot; and continued military support for Kyiv. Macron has also scheduled talks with defense manufacturers later this week to push for increased weapons production, aligning with his call for France to switch to &quot;war economy mode.&quot; Starmer, meanwhile, will host virtual talks on March 15 with leaders of nations willing to back Ukraine&#x2019;s defense. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen recently announced a plan to mobilize approximately 800 billion euro ($843 billion) to strengthen European defense and provide &quot;immediate&quot; military support for Ukraine. France has also pledged to raise its defense spending to around &#x20AC;100 billion annually, doubling the planned 50.5 billion euro for 2025. Turkey, which has NATO&#x2019;s second-largest army, is positioning itself as a key player in regional security. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has backed Ukraine&#x2019;s calls for an aerial and naval truce, signaling his country&#x2019;s readiness to play a leading role in Europe&apos;s evolving security strategy.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-rallies-europe-to-back-ukraine-following-ceasefire-talks/	2025-03-11T15:38:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1977990485.jpg
If Russia refuses, we should sanction the hell out of them' â€” Trump, Sen. Graham, hope Putin agrees to ceasefire	U.S. President Donald Trump hailed Ukraine&apos;s agreement to a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire on March 11 as a significant step forward to a &quot;total ceasefire.&quot; Speaking to reporters at the White House following the announcements from Jeddah, Trump said the focus now shifts to Russia, urging President Vladimir Putin to accept the truce. &quot;Now we have to go to Russia and hopefully President Putin will agree to that also. And we can get this show on the road,&quot; he said. Trump added that if Russia refuses, the war will continue, leading to further loss of life. Trump confirmed that U.S. officials would meet with Russian representatives in the coming days to discuss the ceasefire. He also indicated he expects to speak with Putin later this week, emphasizing, &quot;It takes two to tango.&quot; Senator Lindsey Graham also praised Ukraine&apos;s decision to back the ceasefire, applauding the Trump administration&#x2019;s role in brokering the agreement.

If Russia refuses, we should sanction the hell out of them.&quot; Graham vowed to introduce new congressional sanctions targeting Russia and nations that continue to buy Russian goods, including oil, gas, and uranium. &quot;It is long overdue for Russia to feel overwhelming economic pain as a result of their brutal invasion of Ukraine,&quot; he said. Trump also told reported that Zelensky is welcome back to the White House after their tense meeting in the Oval Office last month. The Feb. 28 meeting had ended in controversy after Trump and Vice President JD Vance criticized Zelensky, accusing him of being disrespectful when he questioned whether Putin could be trusted in negotiations. The disagreement led to a heated exchange, and Zelensky left the White House abruptly, canceling a planned joint press conference with Trump and leaving a critical minerals agreement unsigned. Trump has since expressed mixed views on Ukraine&#x2019;s priorities, ruling out its NATO membership and falsely suggesting that Ukraine started the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/if-russia-refuses-we-should-sanction-the-hell-out-of-them-trump-sen-graham-hope-putin-agrees-to-ceasefire/	2025-03-11T14:31:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2147873245.jpg
Ball is in their court' â€” Rubio on Russia's move toward ceasefire with Ukraine	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio voiced hope on March 11 that Russia would accept the proposal for a temporary ceasefire with Ukraine. &quot;The ball is in their court,&quot; Rubio said during a press conference following the talks with Ukraine in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. After the negotiations with Washington, Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office announced that it was ready to accept the U.S. proposal for a temporary 30-day ceasefire if Russia also complied with the agreement. Rubio noted that if the Kremlin rejects the ceasefire proposal, &quot;then we&apos;ll, unfortunately, know what the impediment is to peace here.&quot; &quot;Ukraine is ready to stop shooting and start talking,&quot; Rubio said, adding that U.S. President Donald Trump has been clear that he wants to stop the war swiftly. Asked about the deadline for the &#x441;onclusion of a truce agreement, Rubio said Washington hopes to do it &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; During the talks, the Ukrainian delegation proposed to implement a partial truce in the sky and at sea, while the U.S. side wanted &quot;to try to do more,&quot; a source close to the Presidential Office told the Kyiv Independent. Russia&apos;s stance toward a partial ceasefire is unclear, the source added. Moscow has repeatedly rejected freezing hostilities along the current front line, believing it has the upper hand on the battlefield. &quot;Within a certain period of time, we will prepare a final agreement on how to end the war. Now, the discussions concern only the first steps,&quot; the source said. Ways to enforce a possible ceasefire also remain uncertain. Kyiv has previously emphasized that firm security guarantees from the U.S. and other partners should be a key part of any cessation of hostilities, arguing that Russia has repeatedly violated multiple ceasefires since the start of its aggression in 2014.	https://kyivindependent.com/ball-is-in-their-court-rubio-on-russias-move-toward-ceasefire-with-ukraine/	2025-03-11T13:26:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193483462.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine is ready for temporary ceasefire if Russia sticks to it; US to restore security, intelligence assistance to Ukraine	Key developments on March 11: Kyiv is ready to accept Washington&apos;s proposal to immediately implement a temporary, 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement, the Presidential Office announced on March 11 after the talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine is ready to take such a step only if Russia adheres to the terms of the ceasefire in the same way. &quot;Ukrainian proposal for this meeting with the Americans was three things: ceasefire in the sky &#x2014; missiles, bombs, long-range drones &#x2014; and ceasefire at sea, as well as measures to establish trust to this process, first of all &#x2013; the release of prisoners,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said following the meeting. &quot;The American side understands our arguments, accepts our proposals, I want to thank President (Donald) Trump for the constructiveness of our teams&apos; conversation,&quot; he added. And today, there was a proposal from the American side to take the first step right away and attempt to establish a complete ceasefire for 30 days, not only regarding missiles, drones, and bombs, not only in the Black Sea but also along the entire front line,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Ukraine accepts this proposal.&quot; Zelensky added that the U.S. &quot;must convince Russia&quot; to abide by it. The president added that as part of the deal, the U.S. agreed to resume intelligence sharing with Ukraine. During the talks, the Ukrainian delegation proposed to implement a partial truce in the sky and at sea, while the U.S. side wanted &quot;to try to do more,&quot; a source close to the Presidential Office told the Kyiv Independent. Russia&apos;s stance toward a partial ceasefire is unclear, the source added. Moscow has repeatedly rejected freezing hostilities along the current front line, believing it has the upper hand on the battlefield. &quot;Within a certain period, we will prepare a final agreement on how to end the war. Now, the discussions concern only the first steps,&quot; the source said. The United States will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine, Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office announced on March 11.The U.S. has suspended military aid and intelligence to Ukraine after a meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance in the White House that ended in a heated argument. The freeze on military aid has drawn criticism even from members of Trump&apos;s own party. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said that pulling aid from Ukraine in the midst of Russia&apos;s war would &quot;be worse than Afghanistan.&quot; U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz confirmed during a joint press conference in Jeddah that Washington will continue to provide military assistance to Ukraine under the so-called Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) program. The delegations also discussed the essential role of humanitarian efforts in achieving peace, including the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of detained civilians and the return of forcibly displaced Ukrainian children.The delegates will determine the composition of their negotiating teams to begin further negotiations to achieve a sustainable peace that will ensure Ukraine&apos;s long-term security, the Presidential Office&apos;s statement read. Ukrainian forces successfully attacked the Moscow Oil Refinery and a Druzhba oil pipeline facility in Oryol Oblast overnight on March 11, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. The statement comes after Russia claimed to have downed over 330 Ukrainian drones in the Moscow, Oryol, and eight other oblasts in a massive drone strike. The attack was carried out by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces in cooperation with the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and military intelligence (HUR), the General Staff said. The operation &quot;struck a number of Russian strategic objects, enabling armed aggression against Ukraine,&quot; the military said. Ukraine has repeatedly targeted industrial and military facilities in Russia&apos;s rear to undermine Moscow&apos;s ability to wage its war. Multiple hits were recorded at the Moscow Oil Refinery, which is capable of processing 11 million metric tons of oil per year and covers 40-50% of Moscow&apos;s gasoline and diesel supplies, according to the statement. Explosions were also reported at the Stalnoy Kon fuel facility in Oryol Oblast. This facility is a key part of the Druzhba oil pipeline infrastructure and ensures oil supplies to the Ust-Luga port in Leningrad Oblast. The facility lies around 170 kilometers (100 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its forces had intercepted a massive strike of 337 Ukrainian drones across multiple regions, including 91 over Moscow Oblast, 126 over Kursk Oblast, 38 over Bryansk Oblast, eight over Oryol Oblast, and others over the Belgorod, Ryazan, Kaluga, Lipetsk, Voronezh, and Nizhny Novgorod regions. This would mark Ukraine&apos;s most extensive drone strike against Moscow and Russia throughout the full-scale war. Russian officials did not report hits against any strategic targets but claimed that civilian sites were damaged across Moscow Oblast. Three people were allegedly killed by drone debris, while 18 were wounded, Moscow claims. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The Ukrainian military said it has &quot;detailed information about the strategic facilities&quot; enabling Russian aggression and &quot;adheres to the norms of international humanitarian law and takes measures to protect the civilian population as much as possible.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin remains unwilling to compromise in peace talks, complicating U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s efforts to secure a settlement, Bloomberg reported on March 10, citing undisclosed Western security officials. Putin has deliberately set &quot;maximalist&quot; demands on territory, peacekeepers, and Ukraine&apos;s neutrality, knowing they will likely be unacceptable to Kyiv and European nations, the outlet wrote. In June 2024, Putin insisted Ukraine must withdraw from the four partially occupied regions &#x2014; Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia &#x2014; as a precondition for negotiations. Despite Trump&apos;s claim on Feb. 24 that Putin would allow European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a deal, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has rejected the idea. Putin, according to Western officials, is prepared to continue the war if his conditions are not met, raising doubts about his seriousness regarding a settlement. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed the claims in a comment for Bloomberg, insisting that Russia remains open to diplomatic negotiations. &quot;Russia is open for peace efforts and prefers to reach our goals through peaceful and diplomatic means,&quot; he told Bloomberg. Russian forces have recaptured 12 settlements and 100 square kilometers (40 square miles) in Kursk Oblast previously held by Ukrainian troops, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on March 11. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. The statement comes after Moscow launched a new offensive in the Russian border region, reportedly achieving a breakthrough south of the key town of Sudzha in an effort to encircle the Ukrainian salient. Russia recaptured the settlements of Agronom, Bogdanovka, Bondarevka, Dmitryukov, Zazulevka, Ivashkovsky, Kolmakov, Kubatkin, Martynovka, Mikhailovka, Pravda, and Yuzhny in recent military operations, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. The DeepState monitoring group confirmed significant territorial losses on Ukraine&apos;s part in Kursk Oblast since Russia launched its offensive last week. The extent of the Ukrainian salient in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast as of March 10, 2025, according to the DeepState monitoring group. (DeepState/OpenStreet Maps)Russian troops and their North Korean allies have also reportedly begun launching attacks in the Sudzha area. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, claimed that there is currently no threat of encirclement as Ukrainian troops are moving to &quot;favorable defense lines.&quot; Syrskyi added that some of the settlements Russia claims to have retaken &quot;no longer exist&quot; as they have been destroyed by Russian fire. Ukraine&apos;s commander-in-chief added that he had decided to reinforce Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast with &quot;the necessary forces and means,&quot; including electronic warfare and drones. Concerns about the Ukrainian operation in Kursk Oblast, ongoing since August 2024, have mounted over the weekend amid reports of Russian advances. The development came shortly after the U.S. cut off military and intelligence support for Ukraine, allegedly to push Kyiv to the negotiating table.

US to 'immediately' resume security assistance, intelligence sharing to Ukraine	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. The United States will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine, Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office announced on March 11. The statement follows the talks between Ukraine and the U.S. in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-immediately-resume-security-assistance-intelligence-sharing-to-ukraine/	2025-03-11T11:29:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204495001.jpg
Ukraine agrees to 30-day ceasefire if Russia abides by it, Kyiv says	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story. Kyiv is ready to accept Washington&apos;s proposal to immediately implement a temporary, 30-day ceasefire which can be extended by mutual agreement, the Presidential Office announced on March 11 after the talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine is ready to take such a step only if Russia adheres to the terms of the ceasefire in the same way. &quot;Ukrainian proposal for this meeting with the Americans was three things: ceasefire in the sky &#x2014; missiles, bombs, long-range drones &#x2014; and ceasefire at sea, as well as measures to establish trust to this process, first of all &#x2013; the release of prisoners,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said following the meeting. &quot;The American side understands our arguments, accepts our proposals, I want to thank President (Donald) Trump for the constructiveness of our teams&#x2019; conversation,&quot; he added. &quot;And today, there was a proposal from the American side to take the first step right away and attempt to establish a complete ceasefire for 30 days, not only regarding missiles, drones and bombs, not only in the Black Sea, but also along the entire front line,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Ukraine accepts this proposal.&quot; Zelensky added that the U.S. &quot;must convince Russia&quot; to abide by it. The president added that as part of this proposal, the U.S. agreed to resume intel sharing with Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-agrees-to-30-day-ceasefire-if-russia-abides-by-it-kyiv-says/	2025-03-11T11:20:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203962358.jpg
US, Ukraine to present joint statement summarizing talks in Saudi Arabia, FT reports	The U.S. and Ukraine will present a joint statement on the talks between the states in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Financial Times (FT) reported on March 11. The news comes as the Ukraine-U.S. negotiations on a potential ceasefire in the war with Russia, as well as restoring U.S. military aid and intelligence, continue. The participants also discussed the minerals deal that collapsed on Feb. 28 after a heated argument between President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance. The talks are not scheduled to continue for a second day, FT reported. Ukraine was expected to propose a ceasefire at sea and in the sky and a ban on long-range strikes during the talks with the U.S., according to Suspilne. The official told the media outlet that such a ceasefire would be &quot;easy to install and to monitor.&quot; The Ukrainian delegation includes Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa. The U.S. delegation is led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-ukraine-to-present-joint-statement-summarizing-talks-in-saudi-arabia-ft-reports/	2025-03-11T11:14:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204495001.jpg
Over 50% of Ukrainians think West holds back military aid in fear of Russia losing war	According to a poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) at the request of the Kyiv Independent, 51.2% of Ukrainians believe that Western countries fear that Russia will lose the all-out war against Ukraine and hold off military aid to Kyiv as a result. The survey, commissioned by the Kyiv Independent, was conducted between Feb. 5 and March 10. Two thousand twenty-nine people took part, and the margin of error stands at 2.1%. According to the poll, 17% of respondents completely agreed with this statement, while 34.2% said they would rather agree. Another 21.3% said they would rather disagreed with the statement. The number of those who strongly disagreed stands at 17.7%, the survey showed. The poll was conducted when U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration took a number of steps widely seen as friendly toward Russia. The U.S. froze intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine soon after a heated argument broke out between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House on Feb. 28. U.S. officials have suggested the pause is &quot;temporary,&quot; without indicating when aid will resume. Given Trump&apos;s rhetoric and policy shift, European officials are considering stepping up support for Kyiv. In 2024, when Russia maintained an initiative on the battlefield, taking advantage of delays in defense aid to Ukraine from Western allies, primarily the U.S., Zelensky said that Western countries &quot;are afraid of Russia losing the war&quot; and would like Kyiv &quot;to win in such a way that Russia does not lose.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/over-50-of-ukrainians-think-west-fears-russias-loss-in-war-and-hold-back-military-aid-poll-shows/	2025-03-11T10:38:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1250459616.jpg
Didn't want to endanger his life' â€” JD Vance on criticism from his cousin who fought in Ukraine	U.S. Vice President JD Vance did not talk publicly about his cousin Nate&apos;s service in Ukraine because he &quot;didn&apos;t want to endanger his life more than it already was,&quot; he told Fox News on March 11. Nate Vance, a former U.S. Marine, defended Ukraine from 2022 to January 2025 as a member of the Da Vinci Wolves First Motorized Battalion, a volunteer unit. Nate Vance harshly criticized U.S. policy regarding Ukraine and condemned the behavior of his cousin and U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28, after which U.S. leaders berated the Ukrainian president for not being &quot;ready for peace&quot; and supposed lack of gratitude. &quot;As far as his criticisms, I have no interest in arguing with him in public, but I do feel the need to address one issue in particular: his failed effort to contact me. I am unsure why Nate felt the need to reach out to my Senate office, rather than to his mom, dad, or sister, all of whom I am in contact with regularly,&quot; JD Vance told Fox News. The vice president added that he &quot;always considered Nate the toughest guy (he) knew&quot; and that he was &quot;always happy to talk to him.&quot; Nate Vance volunteered to fight in Ukraine following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, but left shortly before the U.S. presidential inauguration out of fear of being captured by the Russian army. &quot;It had become complicated to stay. I couldn&apos;t take the risk of being captured,&quot; he said. JD Vance has repeatedly criticized Ukraine and Zelensky in the past, at times repeating Kremlin talking points.	https://kyivindependent.com/didnt-want-to-endanger-his-life-jd-vance-on-criticism-from-his-cousin-former-volunteer-fighter-in-ukraine/	2025-03-11T10:35:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198862659.jpg
France to 'refuse any demilitarization of Ukrainian army,' French defense minister says	France will not accept &quot;any demilitarization of the Ukrainian army,&quot; French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on March 11, The Guardian reported. &quot;Demilitarization&quot; and &quot;denazification&quot; were two insincere excuses that the Kremlin used to invade Ukraine in a war of territorial and ethnocidal aggression in February 2022. The Ukrainian army is &quot;the main guarantee&quot; of Ukraine&apos;s security, Lecornu said in the opening remarks at the Paris Defence and Strategy Forum, which gathered over 30 army chiefs to discuss what Europe and the West can offer in support of Ukraine as part of a peace deal with Russia. The French defense minister added that Europe is facing a &quot;new period&quot; in its history, significantly different from the Cold War and the period of &quot;peace dividends&quot; with several powers fighting for influence. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russia demanded that Ukraine reduce its army to 50,000 personnel. Moscow also sought to ensure that Kyiv &quot;did not develop, produce, purchase, or deploy missile weapons of any kind with a range of over 250 kilometers (156 miles) on its territory.&quot; Ukraine has repeatedly highlighted the need for security guarantees in the event of a ceasefire in the war with Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously stressed the need for a 1.5 million-strong army if Ukraine is not accepted into NATO. The Ukrainian army currently has 880,000 troops, making it the largest in Europe, according to Zelensky.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-to-refuse-any-demilitarisation-of-ukrainian-army-french-dm-says/	2025-03-11T10:31:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1695287073.jpg
Half of Ukrainians say territorial concessions, forfeiting NATO membership in exchange for ending war 'completely unacceptable'	According to a poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) at the request of the Kyiv Independent, 47.1% of Ukrainians consider it &quot;completely unacceptable&quot; to agree to territorial concessions and give up on NATO membership as a prerequisite to ending the war. Only 8.2% said they would &quot;easily agree&quot; to this scenario, while 38.1% of respondents called this option difficult but &quot;generally acceptable.&quot; 6.2% of respondents found it difficult to answer the question, and 0.4% declined to answer. The survey, commissioned by the Kyiv Independent, was conducted between Feb. 5 and March 10. 2,029 people took part, and the margin of error is a maximum of 2.1%. On March 10, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Kyiv would need to make territorial concessions as part of any agreement to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Foreign Ministry said that the country wasn&apos;t officially asked by Washington to agree to territorial concessions. NATO membership has also become increasingly elusive. &quot;You can forget about (NATO membership),&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump previously said. Russian forces continue to occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory. The Ukrainian population under Russian occupation has been subjected to systematic repression, torture, and abuse. President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested that to end the &quot;hot phase of the war,&quot; NATO would have to offer membership to Ukrainian territory under government control, with the invitation recognizing the country&apos;s internationally recognized borders. Bloomberg reported on March 10 that Russian President Vladimir Putin remains unwilling to compromise. Putin has deliberately set &quot;maximalist&quot; demands on territory, peacekeepers, and Ukraine&apos;s neutrality, knowing they will likely be unacceptable to Kyiv and European nations, the outlet wrote.	https://kyivindependent.com/47-of-ukrainians-oppose-to-refuse-from-nato-making-territorial-concession-in-exchange-for-ending-war-poll-shows/	2025-03-11T10:07:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1244707924.jpeg
US to inform Russia of US-Ukraine talks progress in Saudi Arabia, Peskov claims	Moscow is expecting to receive information from Washington on the progress of Ukraine-U.S. negotiations in Saudi Arabia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the Russian news agency Interfax on March 11. Peskov&apos;s statement comes amid the ongoing talks between the American and Ukrainian delegations in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. &quot;Today, there will be U.S.-Ukraine contacts in Jeddah. Somehow, the American side, which is looking for ways to reach a peaceful settlement, will inform us,&quot; Peskov said when asked about the potential meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s Middle East Envoy, Steve Witkoff. Witkoff was also supposed to attend the talks between Washington and Kyiv in Saudi Arabia but missed them. Multiple media outlets reported that Witkoff plans to travel to Moscow for a meeting with Putin. The reported trip to Moscow will follow the March 11 discussions between Ukrainian and U.S. officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Witkoff will join U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz on the American side. Despite being Trump&apos;s envoy for the Middle East, Witkoff has emerged as a leading figure in negotiations regarding Russia and Ukraine. On Feb. 18, he participated in talks with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia, which were held without Ukraine&apos;s participation.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-expecting-us-to-provide-information-on-talks-with-ukraine-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-03-11T08:47:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245735181.jpeg
Ukraine, US discuss potential ceasefire, deal on rare earth during 1st round of talks, media reports	The Ukrainian and American delegations discussed a potential ceasefire in the air and at sea, as well as a minerals deal, during the first round of talks in Saudi Arabia, Suspilne reported on March 11, citing an undisclosed source. Ukrainian and U.S. delegates began talks in Jeddah on March 11. The meeting could shape Washington&apos;s future support for Kyiv and efforts to end the war. Suspilne previously reported that Ukraine would propose a ceasefire at sea and in the sky and a ban on long-range strikes during the talks with the U.S. The official told the media outlet that such a ceasefire would be &quot;easy to install and to monitor.&quot; The mineral resource deal was derailed after a spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the White House on Feb. 28. Before the talks started, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that more details still needed to &quot;be worked out&quot; on the mineral resource deal between Ukraine and the U.S. Following the afternoon break, the second round of the talks started in Jeddah. The Ukrainian delegation includes Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa. The U.S. delegation is led by Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-discuss-potential-ceasefire-deal-on-rare-earth-during-1st-round-of-talks-media-reports/	2025-03-11T08:18:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204495015.jpg
Oil shipments via Druzhba pipeline halted due to Ukrainian drone attack in Russia, Hungary says	Oil supplies through the Druzhba pipeline from Russia to Hungary are halted due to a Ukrainian drone attack on a metering station on Russian territory, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on March 11 on Facebook. The Druzhba pipeline, one of the world&apos;s largest with a capacity of 2 million barrels per day (bpd), is a critical conduit for oil from Russian fields to European refineries. Hungary imports most of its crude oil via the Druzhba pipeline. Ukrainian forces reportedly struck the Druzhba pipeline in Russia&apos;s Oryol Oblast on March 11. Following the attack, Szijjarto said that the oil supply was halted. &quot;Due to the drone attack last night, crude shipments had to be suspended on the Druzhba oil pipeline to Hungary,&quot; Szijjarto said. &quot;I have just talked to the energy minister of Russia, who told me that due to the attack, shipments are not possible now, but works are underway, and if nothing extraordinary happens, then late afternoon or in the early evening, crude shipments to Hungary can resume,&quot; he added. The foreign minister called Ukraine to refrain from attacking the energy infrastructure supplying Hungary, as &quot;Hungary&apos;s energy supply is a matter of sovereignty.&quot; The EU has largely phased out Russian oil imports following Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. However, the Druzhba pipeline&apos;s southern branch remains active under exemptions for certain Central European countries. The northern branch primarily transports Kazakh crude oil to Germany via Poland&apos;s Gdansk port, as Poland ceased importing Russian pipeline oil in early 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/oil-shipments-via-druzhba-pipeline-halted-due-to-ukraines-attack-hungary-says/	2025-03-11T07:58:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--7-.jpg
White House lists Saudi talks with Ukraine, Russia in Trump's first 50 days achievements	The White House has listed the negotiations in Saudi Arabia with Ukraine and Russia as one of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s key achievements on his 50th day in office on March 10. &quot;President Trump has brought Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table through historic peace talks in Saudi Arabia in pursuit of peace,&quot; the statement reads. U.S. officials met with Russian representatives in Riyadh on Feb. 18 and in Istanbul on Feb. 27 to discuss restoring bilateral relations and preliminary peace talks, excluding Ukraine. These discussions were followed by a Ukraine-U.S. meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11. Trump&apos;s overtures to Russia have raised concerns in Kyiv and Europe that the U.S. is sidelining its allies in pursuit of a swift settlement. Tensions between Kyiv and Washington have only escalated after Trump&apos;s heated exchange with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. Trump subsequently froze all U.S. military aid and restricted intelligence sharing with Ukraine, aiming to pressure Kyiv into peace talks. Meeting U.S. delegates in Saudi Arabia, Ukrainian officials are expected to push for the resumption of U.S. support while proposing a ceasefire in the air and at sea as a first step toward a broader peace agreement. Trump said earlier that he is considering imposing sweeping banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and peace deal are reached. The U.S. president claimed his position is based on the fact that Russia is &quot;absolutely pounding&quot; Ukraine, likely referring to Russian advances in Kursk Oblast or the large-scale missile and drone attack on March 7.	https://kyivindependent.com/white-house-highlights-saudi-negotiations-as-trumps-50-first-days-achievement/	2025-03-11T06:39:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2089735306.jpg
Putin unwilling to compromise on Ukraine, sets maximalist demands, Bloomberg reports	Russian President Vladimir Putin remains unwilling to compromise in peace talks, complicating U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s efforts to secure a settlement, Bloomberg reported on March 10, citing undisclosed Western security officials. Putin has deliberately set &quot;maximalist&quot; demands on territory, peacekeepers, and Ukraine&apos;s neutrality, knowing they will likely be unacceptable to Kyiv and European nations, the outlet wrote. In June 2024, Putin insisted Ukraine must withdraw from the four partially occupied regions &#x2014; Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia &#x2014; as a precondition for negotiations. Despite Trump&apos;s claim on Feb. 24 that Putin would allow European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a deal, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has rejected the idea. Putin, according to Western officials, is prepared to continue the war if his conditions are not met, raising doubts about his seriousness regarding a settlement. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed the claims in a comment for Bloomberg, insisting that Russia remains open to diplomatic negotiations. &quot;Russia is open for peace efforts and prefers to reach our goals through peaceful and diplomatic means,&quot; he told Bloomberg. Trump has repeatedly promised a swift end to the war, but efforts toward a deal were derailed after his Feb. 28 confrontation with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House. Following the meeting, Trump halted U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine to pressure Kyiv into negotiations. Ukrainian and U.S. delegations are meeting in Jeddah on March 11 for key discussions that could shape Washington&apos;s future support for Kyiv. Ukrainian officials are reportedly expected to push for the resumption of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing while proposing a ceasefire in the air and at sea as a potential first step toward a peace agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-unwilling-to-compromise-in-peace-talks-setting-maximalist-demands/	2025-03-11T05:53:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1000100420.jpg
Ukraine targets Russian oil facilities in Moscow, Oryol oblasts in mass strike overnight, military claims	Ukrainian forces successfully attacked the Moscow Oil Refinery and a Druzhba oil pipeline facility in Oryol Oblast overnight on March 11, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. The statement comes after Russia claimed to have downed over 330 Ukrainian drones in the Moscow, Oryol, and eight other oblasts in a massive drone strike. The attack was carried out by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces in cooperation with the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and military intelligence (HUR), the General Staff said. The operation &quot;struck a number of Russian strategic objects, enabling armed aggression against Ukraine,&quot; the military said. Ukraine has repeatedly targeted industrial and military facilities in Russia&apos;s rear to undermine Moscow&apos;s ability to wage its war. Multiple hits were recorded at the Moscow Oil Refinery, which is capable of processing 11 million metric tons of oil per year and covers 40-50% of Moscow&apos;s gasoline and diesel supplies, according to the statement. Explosions were also reported at the Stalnoy Kon fuel facility in Oryol Oblast. This facility is a key part of the Druzhba oil pipeline infrastructure and ensures oil supplies to the Ust-Luga port in Leningrad Oblast. The facility lies around 170 kilometers (100 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its forces had intercepted a massive strike of 337 Ukrainian drones across multiple regions, including 91 over Moscow Oblast, 126 over Kursk Oblast, 38 over Bryansk Oblast, eight over Oryol Oblast, and others over the Belgorod, Ryazan, Kaluga, Lipetsk, Voronezh, and Nizhny Novgorod regions. This would mark Ukraine&apos;s most extensive drone strike against Moscow and Russia throughout the full-scale war. Russian officials did not report hits against any strategic targets but claimed that civilian sites were damaged across Moscow Oblast. Three people were allegedly killed by drone debris, while 18 were wounded, Moscow claims. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The Ukrainian military said it has &quot;detailed information about the strategic facilities&quot; enabling Russian aggression and &quot;adheres to the norms of international humanitarian law and takes measures to protect the civilian population as much as possible.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-russian-oil-facilities-in-moscow-oryol-oblasts-overnight-military-claims/	2025-03-11T05:41:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1211156715.jpg
OSCE Secretary General visits Moscow, shown aftermath of Ukrainian drone strikes, Russia says	Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Secretary General Feridun Sinirlioglu, who visited Moscow on March 11, was shown the aftermath of reported Ukrainian drone attacks. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its air defenses intercepted 337 drones across multiple regions, including 74 shot down near Moscow, marking what seems to be Ukraine&apos;s largest drone attack during the full-scale war. Russia itself continues daily attacks on Ukraine with missiles, drones, and guided bombs. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported intercepting 79 of the 126 Russian drones launched overnight on March 11, along with one Iskander-M ballistic missile. Russian officials claimed that three people were killed in Moscow Oblast, including a security guard in Domodedovo and two men who later died in the hospital. Eighteen others, including three children, were injured, according to Russia&apos;s Health Ministry. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the OSCE chief witnessed the damage firsthand, writing on Telegram, &quot;It is impossible to deny the obvious, especially what we have seen with our own eyes.&quot; Meanwhile, Andrey Kartapolov, head of Russia&apos;s State Duma Defense Committee, called for retaliatory strikes on Ukraine using the Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile. The strikes occurred just as Ukrainian and U.S. delegations were set to meet in Saudi Arabia to discuss possible peace terms with Russia. Ukrainian officials reportedly plan to propose a partial truce covering aerial and naval operations, hoping to restore U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing. The OSCE was formed in the 1970s at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which provided a platform for dialogue between the Eastern Bloc and Western Bloc during the Cold War. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov attended the OSCE Ministerial Meeting in Malta in person, the Foreign Ministry announced on Dec. 5.	https://kyivindependent.com/osce-secretary-general-visits-moscow-shown-aftermath-of-ukrainian-drone-strikes/	2025-03-11T05:11:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203925059.jpg
Ceasefire 'has never seemed closer,' Yermak writes but stresses need for security guarantees	Ukraine can achieve lasting peace with U.S. leadership, but this requires increased pressure on Russia and credible security guarantees, Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak wrote in an opinion article published by the Guardian on March 11. &quot;As I arrive in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, a ceasefire in the three-year war the Russian Federation has waged on my country has never seemed closer,&quot; Yermak wrote. Yermak nevertheless stressed that diplomacy alone will not bring about a ceasefire &#x2014; stronger political and financial pressure on Russia is essential to prevent a future resurgence of aggression. &quot;No one wants the current war to end more than our people &#x2014; but a peace must be found that is both just and sustainable,&quot; he added. Yermak outlined key conditions necessary for a sustainable peace, including security guarantees for Ukraine, tougher European sanctions against Russia, and the seizure of Russian frozen assets to support Ukraine. &quot;Europe cannot allow a ceasefire that serves only to allow Russia to rearm, rebuild its forces, and come back for more Ukrainian lands and resources,&quot; he warned. Despite Yermak&apos;s calls for U.S. involvement in security guarantees, President Donald Trump has refused to offer such assurances, saying during his Feb. 28 meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky that Europe should take responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security. Yermak welcomed Europe&apos;s ReArm Europe initiative, which includes up to 150 billion euros ($163 billion) for collective defense spending and an additional 20 billion euros ($21 billion) for Ukraine&apos;s military needs. The official also highlighted the importance of the EU&apos;s recently approved 16th sanctions package of sanctions, which expands export restrictions and targets Russian aluminum imports. The column was published as Ukrainian and U.S. delegates began talks in Jeddah on March 11. The meeting could shape Washington&apos;s future support for Kyiv and efforts to end the war. The Ukrainian delegation includes Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa. The U.S. delegation is led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.	https://kyivindependent.com/lasting-peace-in-ukraine-requires-increased-pressure-on-russia-security-guarantees-yermak-says/	2025-03-11T04:44:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204495015.jpg
Ukrainian serviceman saves stabbing victim in Venice	Editor&apos;s note: The article contains graphic content. A Ukrainian soldier on leave provided first aid to a victim of a stabbing attack in Venice on March 10, saving his life, according to the soldier&apos;s testimony and the Italian media. The incident occurred at 4:37 p.m. on March 10. A young man of a North African origin was stabbed after getting into an altercation with another man in Venice&apos;s historical center, the Corriere del Veneto newspaper reported. The injured man began bleeding and collapsed, while the assailant fled the scene. The vacationing Ukrainian soldier who was passing by aided the victim while other bystanders alerted the authorities, the newspaper wrote. &quot;The boy was lucky that I was nearby with a first aid kit and tourniquets. Otherwise, the s**t would have leaked out by the time the ambulance arrived,&quot; the soldier, who goes by the name Kapitan (Captain) Dvizhukha on social media, wrote. The identity of the victim and the attacker or the motivation behind the attack remain unclear.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-serviceman-saves-stabbing-victim-in-venice/	2025-03-11T04:03:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2161312993--1-.jpg
87% of Ukrainians believe Russia will not stop at occupied territories, survey finds	A vast majority of Ukrainians believe that Russia is determined to destroy Ukraine and will not stop at the territories it currently occupies, according to a survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published on March 11. The survey comes as U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 10 that Ukraine would need to make territorial concessions as part of any agreement to end the war. According to KIIS, 87% of Ukrainians believe that Russia intends to continue its aggression beyond the currently occupied territories. This belief is consistent across all regions, with 80% in the east and south and 89-90% in the west and center agreeing that Moscow will not stop at the current front line. Furthermore, 66% of respondents said that Russia&apos;s ultimate goal is Ukraine&apos;s destruction &#x2014; 28% believe Moscow seeks physical genocide, while 38% say it aims to seize most or all of Ukraine&apos;s territory and eliminate its statehood and national identity. A further 14% believe Russia seeks to occupy all or most of Ukraine and install a puppet government, while 7% think Moscow wants to consolidate control over the partially-occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. The findings align with Russian statements, as Russia&apos;s Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said on Dec. 16, 2024, that Moscow aims to capture the entirety of the four Ukrainian oblasts in 2025. Only 4% of respondents believe that Russia aims to maintain control over its existing territorial gains, and just 3% accept Russia&apos;s claim that it wants to &quot;denazify&quot; and demilitarize Ukraine. The remaining 7% were undecided. The survey was conducted between Feb. 14 and March 4, with 1,029 respondents aged 18 and older interviewed by telephone across all Ukrainian government-controlled regions. The survey results come amid growing concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s push for a swift end to the war could lead to a peace deal on unfavorable terms for Ukraine, potentially leaving it vulnerable to future Russian attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/87-of-ukrainians-believe-russia-will-not-stop-at-occupied-territories-survey-finds/	2025-03-11T03:32:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/kyiv.jpeg
Russian lawmaker proposes Oreshnik strike following Ukraine's mass drone attack	Russia should strike Ukraine using the Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile, said Andrey Kartapolov, head of Russia&#x2019;s State Duma Defense Committee, on March 11. The call for action comes in response to what seems to be the largest Ukrainian drone attack since the start of the full-scale war. &quot;The decision is up to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief (Russian President Vladimir Putin), but I think it would not be unreasonable (to launch the Oreshnik), better even more than one,&#x201D; Kartapolov said, as quoted by Russian state-owned news agency TASS. Kartapolov&#x2019;s comments follow reports from Russia&#x2019;s Defense Ministry that its air defenses intercepted a wave of 337 drones across multiple regions, with 74 reportedly shot down on approach to Moscow. In turn, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported intercepting 79 of the 126 Russian drones and one Iskander-M ballistic missile launched the same night. Russia conducts daily strikes on Ukraine using missiles, drones, and guided bombs. Russia has launched the Oreshnik missile against Ukraine once before, striking Dnipro in November 2024 after Kyiv successfully used U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles to hit a military target on Russian soil. Putin described the Oreshnik strike as a response to Ukraine&#x2019;s use of Western long-range weapons to strike inside Russia. While Putin announced plans for mass production of the Oreshnik, a U.S. official told the Kyiv Independent that Russia likely possessed only a small number of these experimental missiles. Following the November strike, the Moscow Times reported that the Kremlin staged a media blitz around the attack, citing Russian officials who said the campaign was designed to intimidate the West and deter further arms deliveries to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-lawmaker-proposes-oreshnik-icbm-strike-following-ukraines-largest-drone-attack/	2025-03-11T03:04:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2185403348.jpg
Russia claims to recapture 12 Kursk Oblast settlements amid new offensive	Russian forces have recaptured 12 settlements and 100 square kilometers (40 square miles) in Kursk Oblast previously held by Ukrainian troops, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on March 11. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. The statement comes after Moscow launched a new offensive in the Russian border region, reportedly achieving a breakthrough south of the key town of Sudzha in an effort to encircle the Ukrainian salient. Russia recaptured the settlements of Agronom, Bogdanovka, Bondarevka, Dmitryukov, Zazulevka, Ivashkovsky, Kolmakov, Kubatkin, Martynovka, Mikhailovka, Pravda, and Yuzhny in recent military operations, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. The DeepState monitoring group confirmed significant territorial losses on Ukraine&apos;s part in Kursk Oblast since Russia launched its offensive last week. The extent of the Ukrainian salient in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast as of March 10, 2025, according to the DeepState monitoring group. (DeepState/OpenStreet Maps)Russian troops and their North Korean allies have also reportedly begun launching attacks in the Sudzha area. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, claimed that there is currently no threat of encirclement as Ukrainian troops are moving to &quot;favorable defense lines.&quot; Syrskyi added that some of the settlements Russia claims to have retaken &quot;no longer exist&quot; as they have been destroyed by Russian fire. Ukraine&apos;s commander-in-chief added that he had decided to reinforce Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast with &quot;the necessary forces and means,&quot; including electronic warfare and drones. Concerns about the Ukrainian operation in Kursk Oblast, ongoing since August 2024, have mounted over the weekend amid reports of Russian advances. The development came shortly after the U.S. cut off military and intelligence support for Ukraine, allegedly to push Kyiv to the negotiating table.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-to-recapture-12-kursk-oblast-settlements-amid-new-offensive/	2025-03-11T02:55:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167241364.jpg
US 'will not be providing' military aid to Russia, Rubio says	The United States will not provide military aid to Russia, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on March 10 in a curious comment ahead of U.S.-Ukraine talks. Asked whether the Ukrainian delegation would push for renewed military aid during the meeting in Saudi Arabia, Rubio responded, &quot;I can assure you this: We will not be providing military aid to the Russians.&quot; The U.S. has been a key military supporter of Ukraine during the full-scale war. As relations between Kyiv and Washington soured after U.S. President Donald Trump took office, the new administration halted all defense assistance. Regarding the possibility of resuming U.S. military aid to Ukraine, Rubio suggested that the freeze could be lifted if Ukraine committed to peace talks. &quot;I mean, all of that came about because we felt that they were not committed to any sort of peace process or not interested in negotiations,&quot; Rubio said. Ukrainian officials plan to use the Jeddah talks to push for the resumption of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing, Financial Times reported on March 9. U.S. delegates previously held meetings with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 and in Istanbul on Feb. 27, where they discussed restoring bilateral relations and holding preliminary peace talks without Ukraine&#x2019;s participation.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-will-not-be-providing-military-aid-to-russia-rubio-says/	2025-03-11T02:20:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193483462.jpg
BREAKING: Ukraine, US begin key meeting in Saudi Arabia	Ukrainian and U.S. delegates are starting their talks in Jeddah on March 11 in a meeting that will likely have a major impact on Washington&apos;s future support for Kyiv and any effort to end the Russia-Ukraine war. &quot;A meeting of the Ukrainian and American delegations begins in Jeddah,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry announced. The Ukrainian delegation is said to include President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa. The U.S. delegation is led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. The expectations are high as the meeting presents a chance to mend the relations between Kyiv and Washington after a heated exchange between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. Zelensky visited Saudi Arabia on March 10 to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman but will not participate in the talks with U.S. delegates. 0:00/1&#xD7;A Ukrainian delegation, including President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, arrive for talks with U.S. officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11, 2025. (Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry)The televised spat in the White House led to the U.S. suspending all military aid and restricting intelligence support for Ukraine, endangering its ability to resist Russia&apos;s all-out war. Ukrainian officials aim to push for the resumption of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing at the Jeddah talks, the Financial Times reported on March 9. Ukraine will also reportedly propose a ceasefire in the air and at sea as the first step toward a peaceful settlement. While traveling to the meeting, Rubio said that Ukraine would need to make territorial concessions as part of any peaceful settlement. The meeting could also see progress on the minerals deal that has been on hold since the White House clash. &quot;The most important thing that we have to leave here with is a strong sense that Ukraine is prepared to do difficult things, like the Russians are going to have to do difficult things to end this conflict or at least pause it in some way, shape or form,&quot; Rubio told reporters on March 10, according to the New York Times. U.S. officials had previously met with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 and in Istanbul on Feb. 27 to discuss restoring bilateral relations and holding preliminary peace talks without Ukraine&apos;s involvement.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-begin-crucial-meeting-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-03-11T02:03:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204479826.jpg
US has not discussed Russia sanctions relief with EU, Rubio says	The U.S. has not discussed easing sanctions against Russia with the European Union, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on March 10, ahead of a meeting with Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia. Asked whether Washington had engaged in talks with the EU about rolling back sanctions imposed in response to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Rubio said, &quot;We&apos;ve not gotten to that stage.&quot; &quot;Obviously, the Europeans have their own set of sanctions, and we can&apos;t &#x2014; they&apos;ll have to make the decision about what they&apos;re willing to do,&quot; he added. Rubio emphasized that any final resolution to the war would have to involve European leaders &quot;because of their sanctions that they&apos;ve imposed.&quot; The U.S. has the means to increase pressure on Russia if necessary, but Rubio expressed hope that such measures would not be required. On March 7, U.S. President Donald Trump said he is considering imposing additional banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and peace agreement are established. Since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has been subjected to extensive economic sanctions from both the U.S. and the EU. The EU&apos;s sanctions framework includes economic restrictions and a list of over 2,400 individuals and entities subject to asset freezes and travel bans.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-has-not-discussed-russia-sanctions-relief-with-eu-rubio-says/	2025-03-11T01:48:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203802681.jpg
1 killed, 17 injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over past day	At least one person was killed and 17 others injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over the past day, regional officials reported on March 11. Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force intercepted 79 of the 126 Russian drones launched overnight, including Shahed-type attack drones, as well as one Iskander-M ballistic missile. Another 35 drones reportedly disappeared from radars before reaching their targets, likely acting as decoys to overwhelm Ukraine&#x2019;s air defenses. Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare systems, aviation, and mobile fire groups repelled the attack. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian strikes killed one person and injured two in Pokrovsk and injured one in Kostiantynivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Russian shelling and air strikes wounded 11 people in Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. A 61-year-old man was injured in Kharkiv Oblast when a Russian attack drone struck a warehouse roof, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. One civilian was also wounded in Sumy Oblast in a Russian drone strike, the regional military administration said. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, a 79-year-old woman was injured in a Russian attack, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. In Odesa Oblast, a house, a children&#x2019;s toy warehouse, and a fuel tank caught fire in a massive Russian drone assault. Authorities are still clarifying information on casualties, Governor Oleh Kiper said.	https://kyivindependent.com/1-killed-17-injured-in-russian-attacks-against-ukraine-over-past-day/	2025-03-11T01:09:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-11_05-37-11.jpg
Russia's Gazprom faces almost $20 billion in lawsuits from European energy firms	European energy firms have filed lawsuits against Russian energy giant Gazprom totaling 18 billion euros ($19.6 billion) over gas supply cuts, the Moscow Times reported on March 10. The claims stem from Gazprom&apos;s decision to drastically reduce gas deliveries to Europe in 2022 after Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that payments be made in rubles. When European customers refused, Gazprom significantly cut supplies, including through the Nord Stream pipeline. The total amount of claims against Gazprom is nearly equal to its net revenues from gas exports, which include $10 billion from sales to Europe and Turkey, $7 billion from China, and $2 billion from Central Asia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The largest lawsuit was filed by German energy company Uniper, formerly Gazprom&apos;s biggest client in Germany and a co-investor in the Nord Stream 2 project. The company imported 20 billion cubic meters of Russian gas annually and is seeking 14.3 billion euros ($15.5 billion) in damages over losses incurred after Russian supplies were halted. Gazprom has responded with counterclaims in Russian courts, seeking to block legal proceedings outside Russia. The Financial Times reported on March 2 that Matthias Warnig, a former Stasi officer and longtime ally of Putin, has been lobbying the U.S. to support a potential restart of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The pipeline, which was co-financed by five European energy firms, was severely damaged in an apparent sabotage attack in September 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-gazprom-faces-19-5-billion-in-lawsuits-from-european-energy-firms-over-gas-cuts/	2025-03-11T00:38:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1243251198.jpg
Ukrainian delegation on-site ahead of talks with US in Saudi Arabia, Yermak says	A Ukrainian delegation is on-site in Jeddah and preparing for key talks with U.S. officials on how to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine on March 11, Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak said. &quot;Protecting Ukrainian interests, clear vision on how to end the war; we will work effectively with our American partners,&quot; Yermak said on Telegram. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously announced that the Ukrainian delegation would include Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa. Although Zelensky arrived in Saudi Arabia on March 10 for a separate meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, he will not participate in the official negotiations. The U.S. delegation includes Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, and Trump&apos;s special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. The meeting follows heightened tensions between Kyiv and Washington after Zelensky clashed with U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. Shortly after, Washington suspended all military aid to Ukraine, and CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed on March 5 that the U.S. had also halted intelligence sharing, potentially limiting Ukraine&apos;s ability to conduct long-range attacks. Ukrainian officials aim to push for the resumption of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing at the Jeddah talks, Financial Times reported on March 9. According to Suspilne, Ukraine will propose a ceasefire in the air and at sea, along with a ban on long-range strikes, describing it as a step that would be &quot;easy to install and to monitor.&quot; Meanwhile, the U.S. delegation is expected to press Kyiv to accept a partial truce as a foundation for negotiations to end the war, Bloomberg reported on March 10. U.S. officials had previously met with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 and in Istanbul on Feb. 27 to discuss restoring bilateral relations and holding preliminary peace talks without Ukraine&apos;s involvement.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-delegation-preparing-for-talks-with-us-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-03-10T23:47:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1247528162.jpg

Russian air defenses allegedly shot down 69 Ukrainian drones over Moscow overnight on March 11 in what may be the most extensive strike against Russia&apos;s capital during the full-scale war. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claims its forces intercepted 337 drones across multiple regions, including 91 over Moscow Oblast, 126 over Kursk Oblast, and 38 over Bryansk Oblast.

Witkoff to meet Putin in Moscow, media reports	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s Middle East Envoy, Steve Witkoff, plans to travel to Moscow for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the coming days, multiple media outlets reported on March 10, citing sources familiar with the matter. Witkoff previously traveled to Moscow in February for the release of U.S. teacher Marc Fogel from a Russian prison. Witkoff claimed that he spoke directly with Putin for over three hours during his visit. Witkoff is expected to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during an upcoming visit to Moscow, an unnamed source told Bloomberg on March 10. Two people briefed on the plans later confirmed the reports in comments to Reuters. The reported trip to Moscow will follow the March 11 discussions between Ukrainian and U.S. officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Witkoff will join U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz on the American side. There is an &quot;expectation&quot; that the two sides will make &quot;substantial progress&quot; during the talks, Witkoff told Fox News in an interview on March 10. &quot;What&apos;s on the table, what&apos;s important to discuss are obviously security protocols for the Ukrainians, they care about that,&quot; Witkoff said. The talks carry high stakes for Ukraine, as the U.S. has frozen military aid and stopped intelligence sharing with Kyiv. Officials have said the outcome of the talks may determine whether Washington resumes support. Despite being Trump&apos;s envoy for the Middle East, Witkoff has emerged as a leading figure in negotiations regarding Russia and Ukraine. He previously took part in talks with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, held without Ukraine&apos;s participation.	https://kyivindependent.com/witkoff-to-meet-putin-in-moscow-sources-claim/	2025-03-10T22:40:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197640711.jpg
58 drones shot down over Moscow, mayor claims	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Fifty-eight drones were shot down as they approached the city of Moscow in the early hours of March 11, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin claimed. &quot;Emergency services are working at the site of the fallen debris,&quot; Sobyanin said. Eleven drones were shot down over the Ramensky district on the outskirts of Moscow, the mayor claimed. Sobyanin attributed the attack to the Ukrainian military. The Kyiv Independent could not verify Sobyanin&apos;s claims, and Ukraine&apos;s military has not yet commented on the attack. &quot;According to preliminary data, there is no damage or casualties at the site where the debris fell,&quot; Sobyanin said. Domodedovo and Zhukovsky airports in Moscow introduced temporary flight restrictions in response to the drone attack, Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) reported. A residential building was hit in the city of Vidnoye, a suburb of Moscow, local officials claimed. Drones were also shot down over Russia&apos;s Ryazan Oblast and Tula Oblast, according to Russian officials. Ukraine regularly strikes military and industrial targets deep within Russian territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/dozens-of-drones-shot-down-over-moscow-mayor-claims/	2025-03-10T21:50:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2153882832.jpg
Over 30 nations to join Paris talks on Ukraine security	Military officials from over 30 countries will attend discussions in Paris on establishing an international security force for Ukraine, an unnamed French military official told the Associated Press (AP) on March 10. European officials led by the U.K. and France have been developing a &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; to enforce a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. U.S. officials have repeatedly said Europe must bear responsibility for a ceasefire while refusing to offer concrete security guarantees. Representatives from Europe, Asia, and Oceania will meet in person and virtually on March 11, coinciding with a meeting between Ukrainian and U.S. officials on the same day in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine will be represented by a military official in Paris, the French official told the AP, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The U.S. was not invited to the event in an effort to demonstrate to White House officials that Europe can guarantee peace in Ukraine. &quot;It&apos;s not, &apos;This is what we need,&apos;&quot; the official said. &quot;It&#x2019;s more, &apos;What are you bringing to the pot?&apos;&quot; The force could be backed by heavy weaponry and weapons stockpiles that could be quickly delivered to the front line in the event Russia breaks a ceasefire, the official said. The talks will consist of two parts, the source said. In the first part, the U.K. and France will introduce their joint initiative. The second part will involve discussions, giving military officials a chance to share how their countries may contribute to the force. While talks on security guarantees have largely been based in Europe, officials from Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea will participate, the unnamed official said.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-30-nations-will-partake-in-paris-talks-on-ukraine-security/	2025-03-10T21:38:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/UNESCO.jpg
Musk blames X outage on 'massive cyberattack' linked to Ukraine	The social media platform X experienced waves of outages on March 10, which X owner and billionaire CEO Elon Musk attributed to a &quot;massive cyberattack&quot; linked to IP addresses originating in Ukraine. &quot;(W)e&apos;re not sure exactly what happened, but there was a massive cyberattack to try to bring down the ecosystem with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area,&quot; Musk told Fox Business. Musk claimed in a post on X that the attack was carried out &quot;with a lot of resources.&quot; &quot;Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved,&quot; he said. Cybersecurity experts have expressed skepticism of Musk&apos;s claims. Cyberattacks of this type, known as denial of service (DDoS) attacks, can be carried out by small groups or individual hackers. DDoS attacks direct excessive amounts of traffic at a website in order to overload its servers, often causing disruptions to service. An industry source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters that much of the traffic targeting X could be traced to IP addresses in the U.S., Vietnam, Brazil, and other countries. The amount of traffic coming from Ukraine was &quot;insignificant,&quot; the source said. Musk, who purchased X (then Twitter) in 2022, has a history of attributing technical glitches to cyberattacks. He also has a history of making inflammatory remarks and amplifying disinformation about Ukraine. .On the same day as the alleged cyberattack, Musk called U.S. Senator Mark Kelly a &quot;traitor&quot; for sharing details of his visit to wartime Ukraine. In his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), established by U.S. President Donald Trump, Musk has spearheaded the slashing of humanitarian aid to Kyiv and called to shut down U.S.-funded media outlets in Ukraine. These outlets are a waste of &quot;taxpayer money,&quot; responsible for &quot;torching&quot; up to a billion dollars in U.S. funds, Musk said. Musk is currently listed as the world&apos;s richest man alive.	https://kyivindependent.com/musk-blames-x-outage-on-massive-cyberattack-linked-to-ukraine/	2025-03-10T21:13:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202898156.jpg
Zelensky apologized to Trump for Oval Office clash, Witkoff claims	President Volodymyr Zelensky apologized for the heated argument in the White House between him and U.S. President Donald Trump, U.S. Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff said in a television interview with Fox News on March 10. Witkoff is part of a U.S. delegation set to meet Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia on March 11 in the first high-level talks between the two nations since the White House clash. &quot;Zelensky sent a letter to the president. He apologized for that whole incident that happened in the Oval Office. I think that was an important step,&quot; Witkoff said. Top White House officials demanded an apology from Zelensky in the aftermath of the Oval Office clash on Feb. 28. Zelensky issued a conciliatory statement on March 4 calling the incident &quot;regrettable&quot; and saying he was ready to work towards peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; It is not clear whether Witkoff was framing that statement as an apology or referencing other communications between Zelensky and Trump. Witkoff also said that there have been ongoing discussions among Ukrainian, U.S., and European officials since the incident, and expressed optimism that the upcoming talks in Saudi Arabia could revive the collapsed minerals deal between Washington and Kyiv. &quot;I would like to describe it as progress ... I would hope that there&apos;s a deal,&quot; Witkoff said. There is an &quot;expectation&quot; that the two sides will make &quot;substantial progress&quot; during the talks, he said. &quot;What&apos;s on the table, what&apos;s important to discuss are obviously security protocols for the Ukrainians, they care about that .... These are not complicated things,&quot; Witkoff said. &quot;They just need to be put on the table and everybody needs to be transparent about what their expectations are. Then we can begin to have a discussion around how we compromise.&quot; Ukrainian-U.S. relations reached a low point following the White House clash, as Washington paused military aid to Kyiv and stopped sharing critical intelligence. Witkoff claimed earlier in the interview that the U.S. had not stopped sharing intelligence needed for defensive purposes. The freeze on military aid has drawn criticism even from members of Trump&apos;s own party. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said that pulling aid from Ukraine in the midst of Russia&apos;s war would &quot;be worse than Afghanistan.&quot; U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that if the Saudi Arabia talks were successful, Washington might resume military aid to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-apologized-for-oval-office-clash-witkoff-says/	2025-03-10T20:15:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199709214.jpg
Zelensky, Saudi crown prince discuss return of POWs, Ukrainian children	President Volodymyr Zelensky held talks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on March 10, ahead of a planned meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian officials, the Presidential Office reported. Zelensky&apos;s team will remain in Jeddah to meet U.S. delegates and discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement with Russia on March 11. Zelensky is not expected to participate in the negotiations. The two leaders discussed Saudi Arabia&apos;s potential role in mediating the release of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) as well as the return of Ukrainian children who were illegally deported to Russia, the Presidential Office said. The Gulf countries have traditionally played the role of mediators between Russia and Ukraine, particularly in regard to prisoner exchanges. Zelensky and bin Salman also discussed possible security guarantees for Ukraine and strategies for bringing about &quot;a just and lasting peace.&quot; Zelensky spoke to the prince about Ukraine&apos;s plans to bolster defense production and the potential for cooperation with Saudi Arabia in this sector. Ukraine is interested in further developing cooperation with Saudi Arabia in the areas of trade and energy, the Presidential Office said. The leaders discussed the potential for future Saudi investments in Ukraine and Riyadh&apos;s contributions to Kyiv&apos;s reconstruction efforts. Zelensky initially intended to visit Saudi Arabia as part of a Middle East tour in February but delayed the trip due to bilateral U.S.-Russian talks in Riyadh on Feb. 18. The Saudi crown prince &#xA0;reportedly wanted Ukraine represented at that meeting, but was overruled by U.S. and Russian officials. The March 11 U.S.-Ukraine talks mark the first high-level meeting between the two nations since Zelensky&apos;s disastrous visit to the White House on Feb. 28. Following the meeting &#x2014;&#xA0;during which U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Zelensky and accused him of being ungrateful &#x2014;&#xA0;Washington froze military aid and paused intelligence sharing with Kyiv. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 10 that a successful meeting in Jeddah could lead to Washington resuming military aid deliveries. Rubio also said that Ukraine would need to agree to territorial concessions as part of a peace deal. Rubio will take part in the Jeddah talks alongside Trump&apos;s Middle East Envoy, Steve Witkoff, and U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. They will meet with Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff, Pavlo Palisa.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-saudi-crown-prince-discuss-return-of-pows-ukrainian-children/	2025-03-10T19:12:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/zel.jpeg
Musk calls Sen. Mark Kelly a 'traitor' over Ukraine trip, Kelly pushes back	Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur and head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), called Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly a &quot;traitor&quot; in a post on X after the senator shared details of his visit to Ukraine. In a thread on March 9, Kelly posted photos from the trip, emphasizing that while everyone wants the war to end, any agreement must protect Ukraine&#x2019;s security and not serve as a concession to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Musk responded directly to the post, accusing Kelly of betrayal. Kelly, a former Navy pilot and astronaut, swiftly replied, criticizing Musk&#x2019;s stance. &quot;Traitor? Elon, if you don&apos;t understand that defending freedom is a basic tenet of what makes America great and keeps us safe, maybe you should leave it to those of us who do,&quot; he wrote on March 10. Speaking to reporters later, Kelly dismissed Musk as &quot;not a serious guy&quot; and suggested he should &#x201C;go back to building rockets&#x201D; rather than engaging in political matters. The senator also accused Musk of prioritizing the interests of billionaires over the American people, pointing to his influence in government policies, including budget cuts affecting veterans&#x2019; services. During his visit to Ukraine, Kelly met with government officials, embassy staff, and military leaders. He described the trip as emotional, stressing the urgency of delivering munitions and intelligence support to Ukrainian forces. &quot;This is existential for them, and again, over the past week or so, we&apos;ve made it harder for them,&quot; he said, referring to recent U.S. policy shifts. Kelly warned that delays in providing military aid would lead to more Ukrainian casualties, adding, &quot;They will stick with us. We stick with them. They will be there for us in the future, no matter what we need.&quot; Musk&#x2019;s comments come amid heightened tensions in U.S.-Ukraine relations, following a contentious Oval Office meeting between President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. &#xA0; The discussion escalated into a heated exchange, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance blaming Zelensky for the war, despite Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. The meeting ended without an agreement that would have granted the U.S. access to Ukraine&#x2019;s mineral resources&#x2014;an arrangement Kyiv had hoped would secure continued American military support. Kelly, along with other Democratic lawmakers, has been vocal in opposing the Trump administration&#x2019;s shift away from strong U.S. backing for Ukraine. &quot;If we abandon our ally Ukraine, we will be viewed by other countries including our other allies as untrustworthy and in the future we shouldn&apos;t expect their help,&quot; he posted on X.	https://kyivindependent.com/musk-calls-sen-mark-kelly-a-traitor-over-ukraine-trip-kelly-pushes-back/	2025-03-10T17:27:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1674560753.jpg
Ukrainian lawmakers propose George Washington monument in Kyiv	A group of Ukrainian lawmakers has proposed erecting a monument in Kyiv to George Washington, the first president of the United States. A draft resolution for the monument was published on the website of Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, on March 10, under the number 3066. While the full text of the resolution has not been disclosed, it has already been submitted for consideration by parliamentary leadership. The initiative was put forward by lawmakers from the ruling Servant of the People party&#x2014;Oleksandr Kovalchuk, Mariia Mezentseva-Fedorenko, Yevheniia Kravchuk, and Halyna Yanchenko&#x2014;as well as independent MP Mykola Tyshchenko, who was expelled from President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s party in 2023. In an interview with the YouTube channel Superposition, Yanchenko emphasized the importance of strengthening ties between Ukraine and the United States rather than damaging them. She suggested that the monument could serve as a symbolic gesture of goodwill. Potential locations for the statue include sites where monuments to Soviet military figures Mykola Vatutin, a Soviet commander during World War II, and Mykola Shchors, a Bolshevik commander during the Russian Civil War, were previously dismantled.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-lawmakers-propose-george-washington-monument-in-kyiv/	2025-03-10T16:56:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2078569904.jpg
Denmark potentially open to sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine	Denmark is prepared to contribute troops if European peacekeeping forces are needed in Ukraine, Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said on March 10. Following a meeting of Denmark&#x2019;s parliament, the ministers said that the government had clarified its stance and received broad support from multiple parties. &quot;It is important that we in Europe send the right signals both to Putin and to Washington. That is what we are doing today by saying: If it comes to the point where a European presence is needed for a ceasefire or peace agreement to be reached, then Denmark is in principle prepared for that,&quot; Rasmussen said, according to Danish Broadcasting Corporation. According to a poll published by the Ritzau news agency on Feb. 21, about 53% of Danes support sending peacekeepers to Ukraine after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war comes to an end. Despite Denmark&#x2019;s readiness, Poulsen emphasized that no concrete plans have been made at this stage. Any potential deployment would depend on future developments. &quot;We have not made a decision to make a concrete effort. It must depend on how things develop. Therefore, this is an expression of timely care,&quot; he explained, highlighting that Denmark&#x2019;s position remains conditional on the evolving situation in Ukraine. Poulsen does not foresee all of NATO-member countries spearheading a peacekeeping mission but expects several individual states to provide security assurances to Ukraine. &quot;Now the initiative has been taken by the French and British sides to form an overview of what could potentially be needed,&quot; he said, noting ongoing discussions about what such a mission might entail. The specifics of Denmark&#x2019;s potential troop contribution remain unclear, as Poulsen indicated it is too soon to determine which soldiers might be deployed. He also stressed that any commitment to Ukraine must not come at the expense of security in the Baltic region.	https://kyivindependent.com/denmark-potentially-open-to-sending-peacekeeping-troops-to-ukraine/	2025-03-10T15:49:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166322485.jpg
UK to host virtual summit on Ukraine on March 15 as peacekeeping plans advance	U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer will host a virtual summit on March 15 to discuss support for Ukraine, following up on a similar meeting held in London earlier this month. Downing Street confirmed the gathering, which will bring together world leaders to assess the prospects for Ukraine and ongoing military assistance. &quot;You can expect the prime minister to host a second leaders&#x2019; meeting of the coalition of the willing, building on his Lancaster House summit,&quot; Starmer&#x2019;s spokesperson told reporters, referring to the March 2 meeting in London. As the U.K. and France continue discussions on forming a peacekeeping force for Ukraine, they remain the only countries to have publicly committed to sending troops. Other nations are expected to contribute either military personnel or other forms of support, though Russia has shown no willingness to accept such a deployment. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has provided little reassurance regarding a potential American security guarantee for Ukraine. Addressing recent comments from Trump, Starmer&#x2019;s spokesperson pushed back against U.S. president&apos;s assertion that Ukraine &quot;may not survive&quot; the war against Russia. &quot;We&#x2019;ve always said that Ukraine, at the other end of this process, must emerge as a sovereign territory,&quot; the spokesperson added, reinforcing the U.K.&apos;s commitment to Ukrainian independence and territorial integrity. Ongoing diplomatic and military talks between the U.K. and France aim to outline the structure and responsibilities of the proposed peacekeeping force. This week, U.K. Defense Minister John Healey and Chief of the Defense Staff Tony Radakin are scheduled to visit France for separate discussions on Ukraine. In addition, Foreign Secretary David Lammy will meet with G7 counterparts in Canada to further coordinate international support for Kyiv. On March 10, Lammy also spoke with U.S. Seceretary of State Marco Rubio and Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minsiter Andrii Sybiha about &quot;how we keep the process for peace moving forward ahead of discussions in Saudi Arabia.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-to-host-virtual-summit-on-ukraine-on-march-15-as-peacekeeping-plans-advance/	2025-03-10T14:34:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200011633.jpg
Despite Russian-backed Georgescu barred from presidential race, Romania's far-right still aim to win	Protests erupted in downtown Bucharest following the Central Electoral Bureau&apos;s decision to ban Russian-backed far-right politician Calin Georgescu from running in the upcoming re-run presidential elections. Georgescu, who is openly supported by the Russian and the U.S. administrations, said this was a &quot;direct hit against democracy.&quot; Following the announcement on March 9, Georgescu&apos;s supporters began setting the streets of Bucharest on fire and throwing bottles, stones, and firecrackers at the police. Riot police used tear gas in response. In November 2024, the relatively unknown Georgescu surprisingly won the first round of the vote. The result was promptly annulled, citing foreign interference in the election process. In connection to the case, Romania expelled the Russian military attache and his deputy for breaching diplomatic rules of conduct. Now, the Central Electoral Bureau cited technical irregularities in Georgescu&apos;s application, as well as the Constitutional Court&apos;s decisions to cancel the previous round of voting and ban another Russian-backed candidate, Diana Sosoaca. Supporters of far-right presidential candidate Calin Georgescu wave the Romanian flag as they face Romanian gendarmes during a protest near the Central Electoral Bureau in Bucharest on March 9, 2025, after the electoral bureau rejected Georgescu&apos;s candidacy for the re-run of last year&apos;s annulled presidential election. (Daniel Mihailescu/AFP via Getty Images)Georgescu said he would appeal, and the Constitutional Court will have the final say on his expulsion from the race. &quot;The decision was inevitable for the health of democracy, but this democracy will need deep repairs after elections in May,&quot; journalist Magda Gradinaru told Kyiv Independent. &quot;Romania&apos;s secret services failed in the final goal of preventing this crisis and they will need to be reformed (as well),&quot; she added. &quot;It is to be seen who will capitalize on Georgescu&apos;s electoral ban and to what extent social tensions can morph into violent social movements,&quot; said Gradinaru. &quot;This was a short-term solution, but the extremist populist platform remains, as does Russian pressure, social resentment, and tension. So this may just be the beginning of a crisis that Romania will have to manage in a complicated geopolitical context,&quot; she added. The leader of the far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) party, George Simion, said on Sunday evening that &quot;those who organized the &apos;coup&apos; should be skinned alive in the public square.&quot; He called on people to take part in protests in support of Georgescu. On Monday morning, Simion claimed his words were a &quot;metaphor,&quot; and he asked supporters to protest peacefully. Georgescu appeared publicly, holding hands with Simion and Anamaria Gavrila, the leader of another Romanian far-right project, Party of Young People (POT).

(Andrei Pungovschi/Getty Images)Georgescu was expelled from AUR in 2022 after being briefly investigated for declarations in support of Romania&apos;s World War II fascist leaders. Now, Georgescu relies on AUR and POT for support. In the December parliamentary elections, AUR secured second place with 18% of the vote, while POT gained 6.5%. Both remained in opposition. &quot;If Simion runs for president, some of the tension created by Georgescu&apos;s ban will be eliminated,&quot; analyst Oana Popescu Zamfir told Kyiv Independent. Romanian protesters take part in an anti-government rally on March 1, 2025 in Bucharest, Romania. Calin Georgescu, a pro-Russian candidate who won the first round of last year&apos;s election that was subsequently cancelled, was questioned by prosecutors earlier this week about the financing of his campaign. (Andrei Pungovschi/Getty Images)According to her, Simion&apos;s recent radical statements are meant to incentivize Georgescu&apos;s supporters to vote for him. &quot;It&apos;s important for Georgescu to explicitly support Simion,&quot; Popescu Zamfir said. Other candidates Georgescu&apos;s electorate may vote for, according to Popescu Zamfir, include former Prime Minister Victor Ponta, former acting President Crin Antonescu, or businessman and politician Gigi Becali. &quot;If Simion does not run, whoever wins the election will have less legitimacy,&quot; Popescu Zamfir said. The ongoing political crisis began last year with Russian meddling in Romania&apos;s elections and the subsequent rise of far-right politicians and their parties. While not making it into the top five according to most opinion polls, Georgescu suddenly took first place following a two-week viral TikTok campaign that involved working with local influencers. The campaign was artificially boosted, with over 66,000 fake TikTok accounts later banned by the platform. Georgescu has been actively promoting conspiracy theories and has been vocally supporting Russia. He called Ukraine a &quot;fictional state&quot; and claimed that the eventual partition of its territories is &quot;inevitable&quot; in an interview published on Jan. 29. The media also found evidence of Georgescu&apos;s links to paramilitary and fascist leaders, such as mercenary Horatiu Potra, who manages a group of soldiers in Congo. On Dec. 8, when the presidential runoff was scheduled to take place, Potra and 20 other people were detained by the police as they were driving to Bucharest carrying weapons and cash. On Feb. 26, the Romanian Prosecutor General&apos;s Office charged Georgescu with &quot;incitement to actions against the constitutional order&quot; and other crimes in a six-count indictment. The charges also included lying about campaign funding and initiating a fascist organization. According to law enforcement, Georgescu used over 1 million euros of undeclared funds and has been involved in neo-legionarism, a Romanian neo-fascist movement that draws its ideology from the country&apos;s Iron Guard militant group active in the run-up to World War II. Georgescu denied any wrongdoing. Supporters of presidential candidate Calin Georgescu cheer outside the Central Electoral Bureau on March 7, 2025 in Bucharest, Romania. (Andrei Pungovschi/Getty Images)On the same day, the Romanian police found dozens of guns, grenades, 25 kilograms of gold, $3.3 million, and 700,000 Romanian Leu ($152,500) in cash in the homes of Potra and his associates. On March 5, Russian military attache Victor Makovskiy and his deputy, Evgeny Ignatiev, were expelled from Romania. The move was connected to Georgescu&apos;s campaign. The next day, six people were arrested for allegedly being part of a military organization attempting to overthrow the government with help from Russia. &quot;These six people are just the visible tip (of the iceberg),&quot; analyst Armand Gosu told Kyiv Independent. &quot;This is the first time Romania openly accuses the Russian Federation of a plot against its state sovereignty.&quot; &quot;They (Russians) can wait years, even decades, that&apos;s why it&apos;s necessary for the Romanian state to neutralize this (entire) network,&quot; Gosu said. According to Popescu Zamfir, &quot;if eliminating the entire network is not possible, at least beheading these groups would avoid further existential threats.&quot; The rise in disinformation and buildup of far-right groups was missed by the government agency set to protect the country from malicious activity from abroad &#x2014; its intelligence. Independent journalist Victor Ilie from the local investigative project Snoop published a series of articles showing how Kremlin-linked creative agencies based in London pump millions of euros to create and promote conspiracy and far-right content in the Romanian digital space. &quot;While Romanians have been mistrustful of Russia, what confuses a part of the Romanian public now is that the U.S., which was considered the country&apos;s main partner, embraced the Russians, and that Georgescu claims that he is not pro-Russian, but pro-American, pro-Trump,&quot; Gosu said. &quot;It&apos;s very hard to explain that the Americans are not what they once were,&quot; he added. &quot;Now Romania is seen as the EU&apos;s weak link that can easily be broken.&quot; However, swift action against Georgescu and his associates showed that Romanian authorities were still eager to fight back. The crisis had also catapulted some new faces that are now set to challenge the far-right at the ballot, among them acting President Ilie Bolojan and Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan, who are gaining popularity.

Ukraine must make concessions in any peace deal, Rubio says	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 10 that Ukraine would need to make territorial concessions as part of any agreement to end the war. Speaking while en route to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for discussions with senior Ukrainian officials, Rubio emphasized the necessity of compromise from both Ukraine and Russia, stressing that difficult decisions would be required on both sides. &quot;The most important thing that we have to leave here with is a strong sense that Ukraine is prepared to do difficult things, like the Russians are going to have to do difficult things to end this conflict or at least pause it in some way, shape or form,&quot; he told reporters, according to the New York Times. Rubio&apos;s remarks came just over a week after a tense White House meeting between President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The meeting resulted in the Trump administration halting military aid to Ukraine due to disagreements over security guarantees in a proposed deal involving Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources. While Rubio did not specify details of a potential agreement, he made it clear that mutual concessions would be key to any diplomatic resolution. Addressing the military situation, Rubio expressed skepticism about a definitive victory for either side. &quot;I think both sides need to come to an understanding that there&#x2019;s no military solution to this situation,&quot; the secretary of state said. &quot;The Russians can&#x2019;t conquer all of Ukraine, and obviously it&#x2019;ll be very difficult for Ukraine in any reasonable time period to sort of force the Russians back all the way to where they were in 2014.&quot; He also noted that determining Russia&#x2019;s willingness to compromise would be a crucial step in future negotiations. Discussions in Jeddah are unlikely to include Trump&#x2019;s earlier proposal, which suggested that U.S. financial interests in Ukrainian natural resources could serve as compensation for American military support. Rubio also clarified that Ukraine&#x2019;s access to Starlink, the satellite internet service provided by Elon Musk&#x2019;s SpaceX, was never under threat. the U.S. still has leverage over Moscow and is attempting to bring Russia to the negotiating table. He also indicated that the resumption of military aid to Ukraine would be a topic of discussion on March 11.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-must-make-concessions-in-any-peace-deal-rubio-says/	2025-03-10T13:55:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203802681.jpg
Ukraine war latest: No threat of encirclement for Ukrainian troops in Russia's Kursk Oblast, Syrskyi says	Key developments on March 10: Ukrainian units are not currently under threat of encirclement in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on March 10. Syrskyi&apos;s statement follows reports on Russian and North Korean troops launching an attack on the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast. Russian forces have made a breakthrough south of the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast, potentially threatening to cut off some of the Ukrainian positions in the Russian region. Russian troops have destroyed Ukrainian troops&apos; logistics in Kursk Oblast, and Ukrainian soldiers face the risk of encirclement, a Ukrainian soldier and a medic deployed in the region told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity on March 7. &quot;There is currently no threat of encirclement of our units in Kursk Oblast. The units are taking timely measures to maneuver to favorable defense lines,&quot; Syrskyi wrote on Facebook. Ukrainian forces &quot;control the situation&quot; on the border between Sumy and Kursk oblasts, according to Syrskyi. Yet, several settlements on the border no longer exist, as they have been destroyed by Russian attacks, he added. Russia has been suffering heavy losses both in personnel and equipment, according to Syrskyi. Near the village of Plekhove, Russian forces lost an infantry battalion in four days of fighting, he said. Ukraine&apos;s commander-in-chief added that he had decided to reinforce Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast with &quot;the necessary forces and means,&quot; including electronic warfare and drones. Concerns about the Ukrainian operation in Kursk Oblast, ongoing since August 2024, have mounted over the weekend amid reports of Russian advances. The development came shortly after the U.S. cut off military and intelligence support for Ukraine, allegedly to push Kyiv to the negotiating table. A potential loss of the Kursk salient or Russian advances in Sumy Oblast would likely weaken Ukraine&apos;s negotiating position as it prepares for initial rounds of talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia. Russian forces are attempting to establish a foothold near Novenke, a Ukrainian village in Sumy Oblast near the border with Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, State Border Guard spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said on air on March 10. The news comes after Russia reportedly achieved a breakthrough in Kursk Oblast, seeking to encircle the Ukrainian forces fighting there and penetrate the Ukrainian border. &quot;These are small assault units, composed of a few people. They try to penetrate our territory, accumulate forces, and advance further into Ukraine, probably to cut off logistical routes,&quot; Demchenko said on national television. Moscow&apos;s troops have been reportedly trying to push toward Novenke, a village lying 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the regional center, Sumy, for several weeks. Ukrainian artillery and drone units continue attacking Russian troops, preventing them from accumulating forces, the spokesperson added. Ukrainian military intelligence&apos;s (HUR) drones struck the Novokuybyshevsk oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Samara Oblast overnight on March 10, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent, confirming earlier reports. The statement came after Russian and Ukrainian sources reported an attack against the facility earlier the same day. Ukraine has systematically targeted Russian oil refineries, military sites, and warehouses deep behind the front lines to undermine Moscow&apos;s capacity to wage its all-out war. The refinery&apos;s &quot;capacity amounts to 8.8 million metric tons of oil per year, making it one of the 10 largest (refineries) in Russia,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. The plant produces gasoline, diesel fuel, and fuel oil, &quot;which are critically important for transport and military equipment,&quot; the official added. This includes jet fuel used by supersonic aircraft such as Su-27 fighter jets and Tu-22 bombers, the HUR source claimed. Samara Oblast residents reported loud explosions overnight, Astra wrote, adding that a fire was recorded at the Rosneft-run oil facility. According to the HUR source, the facility was hit at around 2 a.m. local time. The refinery was not sufficiently protected by anti-drone defenses, the source added. The city of Novokuybyshevsk lies roughly 900 kilometers (560 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. The facility was previously attacked at least twice in March 2024. &quot;This refinery is strategically important for the Russian military as it ensures a stable fuel supply for military operations,&quot; Kovalenko said. The Russian pro-state agency RBC reported a fire at a warehouse in Novokuybyshevsk that covered an area of 1,500 square meters later the same day, without mentioning a drone attack. No casualties were reported. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its forces had shot down nine Ukrainian drones overnight, including three over Samara Oblast, two each over the Voronezh and Oryol oblasts, and one each over the Belgorod and Kursk oblasts. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The Ukrainian delegation will propose a ceasefire in the sky and at sea during the upcoming talks with the U.S. this week on ending the war with Russia, the Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne reported on March 10, citing a Ukrainian official speaking on condition of anonymity. Ukrainian and U.S. delegations will hold talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 to discuss ending the war with Russia. During the meeting, Ukraine will propose a ceasefire at sea and in the sky and a ban on long-range strikes, the source told Suspilne. The official added that such a ceasefire would be &quot;easy to install and to monitor.&quot; The Ukrainian delegation will also insist on releasing prisoners of war and is ready to sign an agreement on mineral resources with the U.S., according to the source. The mineral resource deal was derailed after a spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the White House on Feb. 28. The U.S. delegation, in turn, will insist that Kyiv agree to a partial truce that would enable negotiations to stop the Russian invasion, Bloomberg reported on March 10. Ahead of the meeting in Jeddah, Trump&apos;s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said on March 10 he expects substantial progress in negotiations with Ukraine. &quot;I think that we&apos;re going over there with an expectation that we&apos;re going to make substantial progress,&quot; Witkoff said in an interview with Fox News. When asked about the possible signing of the mineral resource agreement in Saudi Arabia, Witkoff said, &quot;All the signs are very, very positive.&quot; Witkoff also said that the U.S. and Ukraine would discuss territorial issues, security protocols, and intelligence sharing. The Ukrainian president previously announced that his Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa would take part in the talks. The U.S. delegation will be led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Witkoff.The U.S. officials previously met with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. The two sides discussed restoring bilateral relations and held preliminary peace talks without Ukraine&apos;s participation. The U.S. may resume military aid to Ukraine if there is progress during talks with Kyiv in Saudi Arabia this week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told journalists on March 10 en route to Jeddah, The Guardian reported. &quot;I think the notion of the pause in aid, broadly, is something I hope we can resolve. Obviously, what happens tomorrow will be key to that,&quot; Rubio said. Following President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s clash with U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, Washington suspended all military aid to Ukraine. CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed on March 5 that the U.S. had also halted intelligence sharing, potentially limiting Ukraine&apos;s ability to detect Russian missile strikes and carry out long-range attacks. Speaking about a potential truce, Rubio praised Ukraine&apos;s proposal for a ceasefire in the sky and at sea. &quot;I&apos;m not saying that alone is enough, but it&apos;s the kind of concession you would need to see in order to end the conflict,&quot; he said. Rubio also said that more details still needed to &quot;be worked out&quot; on the mineral resource deal between Ukraine and the U.S. The deal was derailed after the clash between Zelensky and Trump on Feb. 28. Neither Ukraine nor Russia &quot;has the cards&quot; in potential peace negotiations, U.S. President Donald Trump told journalists on March 10 ahead of talks between the U.S. and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia. The Ukrainian and U.S. delegations are to hold talks on March 11 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on ending Russia&apos;s war. The participants are expected to discuss potential ceasefire options and a mineral resource deal between the U.S. and Ukraine. &quot;I say they (Ukraine) don&apos;t have the cards. Nobody really has the cards. Russia doesn&apos;t have the cards. What you have to do is you have to make a deal, and you have to stop the killing. It&apos;s a senseless war, and we are going to get it stopped,&quot; Trump said. Trump&apos;s recent statement contradicts his previous ones, in which he claimed the opposite about Ukraine and Russia. On Feb. 20, Trump said that Russia held &quot;the cards&quot; in any peace talks with Ukraine as they occupy a significant part of Ukrainian territory. Eight days later, the U.S. president told his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, during a heated argument in the White House that he &quot;was not in a good position&quot; regarding the war and did not have &quot;the right cards.&quot; Following the spat in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, the U.S. suspended its military and intelligence aid for Ukraine. The Ukrainian delegation is expected to discuss the resumption of military aid in Saudi Arabia. The delegations will also discuss territorial issues, security protocols, and intelligence sharing, according to Trump&apos;s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff.

Trump says Russia 'doesn't have the cards' in peace talks with Ukraine	Neither Ukraine nor Russia &quot;has the cards&quot; in potential peace negotiations, U.S. President Donald Trump told journalists on March 10 ahead of talks between the U.S. and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia. The Ukrainian and U.S. delegations are to hold talks on March 11 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on ending Russia&apos;s war. The participants are expected to discuss potential ceasefire options and a mineral resource deal between the U.S. and Ukraine. &quot;I say they (Ukraine) don&apos;t have the cards. Nobody really has the cards. Russia doesn&apos;t have the cards. What you have to do is you have to make a deal, and you have to stop the killing. It&apos;s a senseless war, and we are going to get it stopped,&quot; Trump said.

We're ready' â€” Ukraine heads into US peace talks with everything at stake	Kyiv officials will meet their Washington counterparts in Jeddah on March 11 for talks which will impact the future of diplomatic relations between the two countries and likely the future of the war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian side hopes the meeting would help mend ties with the White House and ensure that the future U.S.-led peace process doesn&apos;t pose an existential threat to Ukraine. &quot;The advice for Ukraine is just get yourself aligned with the United States,&quot; Ambassador Kurt Volker, who served as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations in 2017-2019 and U.S. ambassador to NATO in 2008-2009, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This pushback on the U.S&#x2026; is counterproductive,&quot; Volker said. The alignment, however, doesn&apos;t seem an easy task, as the U.S. administration has been publicly attacking Ukraine, calling its leader a dictator, and cutting off vital intelligence sharing that may derail Kyiv&apos;s ability to defend itself. In Jeddah, top of the agenda will likely be the critical minerals deal, the signing of which stalled last month following the disastrous meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Ukraine is still paying the price for what the Trump administration has tried to paint as Zelensky&apos;s unwillingness to engage in peace negotiations and Ukraine&apos;s lack of gratitude for U.S. military aid, which it froze a few days after the White House meeting. Kyiv is entering the talks with a weak hand but is prepared to do what it needs to to get the U.S. back on its side. &quot;We&apos;re ready,&quot; a source in the President&apos;s Office told the Kyiv Independent when asked about the prospect of signing the mineral deal. In an effort to convince the U.S. that Ukraine is serious about peace and in the hope that Washington will resume military aid and intelligence sharing, Kyiv is also reportedly proposing a partial ceasefire covering long-range drone and missile strikes, as well as hostilities in the Black Sea. The U.S., however, may now want to extort more from a weakened Ukraine. Having to offer so much to the U.S. before peace talks with Russia can begin in earnest is being keenly felt in Kyiv. When asked what Ukraine was expecting at the talks in Jeddah, the source in the President&apos;s Office replied: &quot;Finally hearing what the Americans want from the negotiations.&quot; Despite arriving in Saudi Arabia on March 10 for a meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Zelensky won&apos;t be part of Ukraine&apos;s official delegation, which will instead by led by his closest aide Andriy Yermak. Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Colonel Pavlo Palisa make up the rest of the team. The U.S. delegation includes Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, and Trump&apos;s special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. Even if Ukraine can get the U.S. back onside, the negotiations to end the war are still ahead, and Trump&apos;s rhetoric portends anything but an easy path. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy looks on as he arrives at the Special European Council in Brussels on March 6, 2025, to discuss support for Ukraine and European defense. (Nicolas Tucat / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;So many of the things that Trump has said in the last two or three days give you the impression that he thinks Ukraine was going to lose regardless, that the Biden administration wasted a lot of money prolonging (the war), and we just have to get that over with,&quot; Volker said. Nothing that has come out of the White House in recent weeks suggests Trump has any interest in reaching a peace agreement that is in Ukraine&apos;s interests. After Polish President Andrzej Duda said that Ukraine would not survive without U.S. support, Trump was asked in an interview on March 9 if he was &quot;comfortable&quot; with the thought of his actions potentially leading to the destruction of the country. &quot;Well, it may not survive anyway,&quot; Trump said. His assessment of Ukraine&apos;s future came around a month after he flippantly suggested the country &quot;may be Russian someday&quot; in comments that made clear his main interest lay in Kyiv&apos;s mineral wealth and the ability to pay back U.S. military aid. Trump&apos;s transactional approach to negotiations that appear to have little regard for Ukrainian lives, territory, or sovereignty is a major source of concern in Kyiv, and the country as a whole. &quot;The expectations (of the Jeddah meeting) are alarming,&quot; Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, lawmaker from the Holos party, chairman of the parliamentary committee on freedom of speech, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Because recently the U.S. administration has demonstrated a desire not for just peace, but for the fastest possible reconciliation between the victim and the aggressor, without taking into account the interests of the victim.&quot; Yurchyshyn acknowledged that an &quot;optimistic&quot; outcome for the talks would simply be to get relations back on track and for the U.S. to &quot;take into account the interests of Ukraine in the future negotiation process.&quot; But another unavoidable fact of the U.S.-led peace negotiations so far is that Washington has not yet had to truly negotiate with Russia. The much-vaunted first round of talks between Washington and Moscow on Feb. 18 produced little of actual substance &#x2014; restoring embassy staffing for further diplomatic missions, appointing representatives to further the negotiation process, and creating the necessary conditions for restarting U.S.-Russia relations. While repeatedly strong-arming Ukraine into proving it is serious about peace, the White House has said nothing so far about how it plans to make Russian President Vladimir Putin order his armed forces to put down their guns.

(Roberto Schmidt / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;I hope that Trump&apos;s team will explain to our delegation whether or not President Trump has a strategy or a plan with regard to Ukraine and Russian aggression against Ukraine,&quot; Oleksandr Merezhko, the chair of the parliament&apos;s foreign affairs committee, said. What form this plan may take and what concessions the U.S. demands of Russia remain to be seen, but after yet another mass missile attack on Ukrainian cities last week, &quot;Trump&apos;s rage has been intensifying,&quot; Axios reported on March 7, citing an unnamed White House official. Yet on the same day, Trump still stated he found it &quot;more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine&quot; than Russia, something Volker believes could soon change, saying his statement shows he has a &quot;really misguided set of assumptions about what&apos;s happening.&quot; &quot;I think he has some kind of belief that Putin has limited and reasonable demands, which is not the case,&quot; he said. &quot;Putin has unlimited demands, starting with Ukraine, that they should be part of Russia, but then even beyond Ukraine. And I think (Trump) doesn&apos;t quite believe that, at least not yet.&quot; Meanwhile, watching from the sidelines is Europe, so far excluded from peace negotiations despite being the very continent upon which the war is being waged. Until that changes, Brussels faces much the same challenges as Kyiv &#x2014; convincing Trump that Ukraine&apos;s interests need to be considered. &quot;We have reiterated at all levels precisely that it is in Ukraine&apos;s interest, in Europe&apos;s interest, and ultimately also in the U.S. interest to put Ukraine in a position of strength before entering into peace negotiations,&quot; Paula Pinho, chief spokesperson of the European Commission, told the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/were-ready-ukraine-heads-into-us-talks-with-everything-at-stake/	2025-03-10T12:46:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203792484.jpg
US military aid freeze could be 'resolved' during talks with Ukraine this week, Rubio says	The U.S. may resume military aid to Ukraine if there is progress during talks with Kyiv in Saudi Arabia this week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told journalists on March 10 en route to Jeddah, The Guardian reported. Ukrainian and U.S. delegations are set to meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 to discuss a potential ceasefire or peace agreement with Russia and a mineral resource deal between Kyiv and Washington. &quot;I think the notion of the pause in aid, broadly, is something I hope we can resolve. Obviously, what happens tomorrow will be key to that,&quot; Rubio said. Following President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s clash with U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, Washington suspended all military aid to Ukraine. CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed on March 5 that the U.S. had also halted intelligence sharing, potentially limiting Ukraine&apos;s ability to detect Russian missile strikes and carry out long-range attacks. Speaking about a potential truce, Rubio praised Ukraine&apos;s proposal for a ceasefire in the sky and at sea. &quot;I&apos;m not saying that alone is enough, but it&apos;s the kind of concession you would need to see in order to end the conflict,&quot; he said. Rubio also said that more details still needed to &quot;be worked out&quot; on the mineral resource deal between Ukraine and the U.S. The deal was derailed after the clash between Zelensky and Trump on Feb. 28. Zelensky previously announced that his Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa would take part in the talks. Rubio, U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Trump&apos;s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will lead the U.S. delegation.	https://kyivindependent.com/washingtons-cutoff-of-military-aid-could-be-resolved-rubio-says-ahead-of-talks-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-03-10T12:10:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194528244.jpg
US, Ukraine charities see surge in donations after Trumpâ€™s attacks â€“ but stress this doesnâ€™t fill the void	For members of the U.S.-based charity organization Razom for Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s Feb. 28 verbal assault on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky felt like &#x201C;a punch to the gut,&#x201D; as it undermined years of the country&#x2019;s diplomatic support for Ukraine in its ongoing fight against Russian aggression. &#x201C;We weren&#x2019;t alone in this feeling, though &#x2014; soon after, we received an influx of donations from thousands of Americans who were disappointed by the outcome of the meeting,&#x201D; Anastasia Rab, chief advancement officer for Razom, told the Kyiv Independent. In the wake of the confrontation, the Trump administration took unprecedented actions, including suspending military aid and curtailing intelligence sharing, which directly threatens Ukraine&apos;s ability to defend itself. Meanwhile, Trump&#x2019;s attacks on Zelensky seemed to shift blame for the war&#x2019;s duration from Russia to Ukraine itself, further exacerbating tensions. Despite these challenges, volunteer organizations on both sides of the Atlantic are seeing a slight increase in support, as Americans and Ukrainians alike, disheartened by the political setbacks, are more determined than ever to show their solidarity with Ukraine&#x2019;s effort. But these volunteer organizations can only do so much, they stress. Razom for Ukraine was founded in 2014 after the EuroMaidan Revolution and Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, witnessing firsthand the harsh realities of the ongoing war and its toll on Ukrainian civilians and soldiers alike. In the lead-up to Trump&#x2019;s inauguration in January, Razom&#x2019;s members felt what they described as a &#x201C;deep sense of duty and responsibility&#x201D; to step up to the challenges his presidency might present, with donations just one part of their broader effort. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve been working with politicians, press, and constituents on both sides of the (political) aisle to ensure that support for Ukraine continues to be bipartisan, and people have the information and support they need to craft good Ukraine policy,&#x201D; Rab said. Unlike many other organizations, Razom for Ukraine was not impacted by the recent U.S. government cuts to USAID (the United States Agency for International Development). Their nationwide donor base has allowed them to continue carrying out their mission. However, some of the 200 Ukraine-based organizations supported by Razom&apos;s Relief Fund &#x2014; which has helped over one million civilians by providing food, shelter, clean water, psychological support, and other necessities during the full-scale war &#x2014; were impacted by Trump&apos;s freeze on foreign assistance, hindering their work. According to Razom&#x2019;s website, they&#x2019;ve earmarked an additional $1.8 million in funds to make sure that these affiliated organizations are able to continue helping Ukrainian civilians impacted directly by the war. While Razom says it has experienced an uptick in donations from across the U.S. and is on track to meet its fundraising goals ahead of schedule, the organization emphasizes that there are still limits to what they can do. &#x201C;&#x200B;&#x200B;People are clearly stepping up and we&#x2019;re grateful for that engagement, but it&#x2019;s really important to note that this engagement can&#x2019;t compensate for the cut-off in military aid, financial aid, and intelligence sharing of the U.S.,&#x201D; Rab said. Many Americans have been watching the latest events unfold with the understanding that supporting Ukraine is not just an act of solidarity &#x2014; it&#x2019;s more critical than ever. &#x201C;Russia won&apos;t back down, if anything I fear things will continue getting worse. Without U.S. military funding or weapons, I fear the worst is yet to come,&#x201D; Emma Atul, who has spent summers in Ukraine as a volunteer English teacher, told the Kyiv Independent. Though between jobs and unable to donate as often as she&#x2019;d like, she remains committed to promoting the Ukrainian culture she&#x2019;s experienced firsthand and she says that Razom for Ukraine is always a reliable choice for her when it comes to where to donate &#x2014; even a small sum feels like she&apos;s making a difference. &#x201C;The least we as Americans can do is donate to charities and continue writing to our representatives. I may not be Ukrainian or have Ukrainian relatives but Ukraine has a special place in my heart.&#x201D; In Ukraine, where nearly everyone has lost someone to the war or has a loved one fighting on the front line, the latest news from the U.S. has been met with a quiet stoicism &#x2014; a familiar response, though still one that is never easy to bear. The priority of volunteer organizations on the ground in Ukraine remains largely unchanged &#x2014; no matter what happens, they continue to search for ways to help soldiers on the front lines and ease the suffering of civilians. Founded in 2014, Come Back Alive is one of Ukraine&#x2019;s largest and most vital wartime aid organizations, primarily tasked with purchasing weapons and other necessary equipment for the military. However, since 2022, the organization has also been investing in training for the Ukrainian army. &#x201C;This helps to efficiently use the material resources the army already has, as well as to save lives,&#x201D; Head of Partnerships Oleksandra Haivoronska told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;All these years, and not only in times of crisis, we have been trying to work to the fullest and build capacity. That&apos;s why we still evaluate all our projects from the standpoint of &#x2018;What does it give the country?&#x2019; and &#x2018;What does it change on the battlefield?&#x2019;&#x201D; The organization allows the public to track donations on its website. Donations from foreign supporters in particular saw a modest uptick following Zelensky&#x2019;s contentious visit to the White House at the end of February, according to Haivoronska. In the first two months of 2025, Come Back Alive received more than 363,000 donations totaling Hr 545.4 million ($13 million) &#x2014; an increase from the same period last year, when the organization collected Hr 452.6 million ($11 million) from 163,000 donations. The listed currencies of the donations include not only hryvnias but euros and dollars, indicating a global donor base. While some volunteer organizations in Ukraine rely more on grants than donations, they are closely monitoring the shifting dynamics of U.S. support. The Ukrainian Charity Alliance, founded in Kharkiv in 2018, focuses on aiding the most vulnerable groups in Ukrainian society through education, healthcare, social protection, legal assistance, and psychological support. Going into 2025, the organization proactively began strengthening its operational strategies to ensure readiness for the challenges the coming months may bring. &#x201C;We have a plan. We are currently working on a new fundraising strategy, which will be focused on raising funds abroad. We have established a board of trustees and are selecting ambassadors from other countries who will help us with this,&#x201D; Oleksii Kurtsev, director of the organization, told the Kyiv Independent. Though the Ukrainian Charity Alliance was not directly affected by USAID cuts, its team remains &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about the precedent set by the Trump administration&apos;s recent actions, which suggest that international law has faltered and power is now the dominant force in resolving conflicts. &#x201C;We can no longer rely on anyone but ourselves and our trusted partners, with whom we have been working for over three years to bring our shared victory closer,&#x201D; Kurtsev said. &#x201C;A strong global civil society has the power to challenge governments that prioritize only their own interests.&#x201D; Hi there, thanks for reading my latest article. As an American living in Ukraine for many years, it meant a lot to me to see that many of my fellow countrymen were as outraged by Trump&apos;s recent policy turns as I was. Supporting Ukraine is more important than ever, and that includes supporting charities, like the ones I wrote about here.

Ukraine to propose ceasefire at sea, in sky during talks with US this week, media outlet reports	The Ukrainian delegation will propose a ceasefire in the sky and at sea during the upcoming talks with the U.S. this week on ending the war with Russia, the Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne reported on March 10, citing a Ukrainian official speaking on condition of anonymity. Ukrainian and U.S. delegations will hold talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 to discuss ending the war with Russia. During the meeting, Ukraine will propose a ceasefire at sea and in the sky and a ban on long-range strikes, the source told Suspilne. The official added that such a ceasefire would be &quot;easy to install and to monitor.&quot; The Ukrainian delegation will also insist on releasing prisoners of war and is ready to sign an agreement on mineral resources with the U.S., according to the source. The mineral resource deal was derailed after a spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the White House on Feb. 28. The U.S. delegation, in turn, will insist that Kyiv agree to a partial truce that would enable negotiations to stop the Russian invasion, Bloomberg reported on March 10. Ahead of the meeting in Jeddah, Trump&apos;s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said on March 10 he expects substantial progress in negotiations with Ukraine. &quot;I think that we&apos;re going over there with an expectation that we&apos;re going to make substantial progress,&quot; Witkoff said in an interview with Fox News. When asked about the possible signing of the mineral resource agreement in Saudi Arabia, Witkoff said, &quot;All the signs are very, very positive.&quot; Witkoff also said that the U.S. and Ukraine would discuss territorial issues, security protocols, and intelligence sharing. The Ukrainian president previously announced that his Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa would take part in the talks. The U.S. delegation will be led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Witkoff. The U.S. officials previously met with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. The two sides discussed restoring bilateral relations and held preliminary peace talks without Ukraine&apos;s participation.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-propose-ceasefire-at-sea-in-sky-during-talks-with-us-in-saudi-arabia-media-reports/	2025-03-10T10:42:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169777527.jpg
No threat of encirclement for Ukrainian troops in Russia's Kursk Oblast, Syrskyi says	Ukrainian units are not currently under threat of encirclement in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on March 10. Syrskyi&apos;s statement follows reports on Russian and North Korean troops launching an attack on the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast. Russian forces have made a breakthrough south of the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast, potentially threatening to cut off some of the Ukrainian positions in the Russian region. Russian troops have destroyed Ukrainian troops&apos; logistics in Kursk Oblast, and Ukrainian soldiers face the risk of encirclement, a Ukrainian soldier and a medic deployed in the region told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity on March 7. &quot;There is currently no threat of encirclement of our units in Kursk Oblast. The units are taking timely measures to maneuver to favorable defense lines,&quot; Syrskyi wrote on Facebook. Ukrainian forces &quot;control the situation&quot; on the border between Sumy and Kursk oblasts, according to Syrskyi. Yet, several settlements on the border no longer exist, as they have been destroyed by Russian attacks, he added. Russia has been suffering heavy losses both in personnel and equipment, according to Syrskyi. Near the village of Plekhove, Russian forces lost an infantry battalion in four days of fighting, he said. Ukraine&apos;s commander-in-chief added that he had decided to reinforce Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast with &quot;the necessary forces and means,&quot; including electronic warfare and drones. Concerns about the Ukrainian operation in Kursk Oblast, ongoing since August 2024, have mounted over the weekend amid reports of Russian advances. The development came shortly after the U.S. cut off military and intelligence support for Ukraine, allegedly to push Kyiv to the negotiating table. A potential loss of the Kursk salient or Russian advances in Sumy Oblast would likely weaken Ukraine&apos;s negotiating position as it prepares for initial rounds of talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia.	https://kyivindependent.com/there-is-currently-no-threat-of-encirclement-of-ukrainian-units-in-russias-kursk-oblast-syrskyi-says/	2025-03-10T09:19:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2180021122.jpg
Zelensky arrives in Saudi Arabia ahead of Ukraine-US talks	President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 10 to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, The Guardian reported.Zelensky initially intended to visit Saudi Arabia as part of a Middle East tour in February but delayed the trip due to bilateral U.S.-Russian talks in Riyadh on Feb. 18. The Gulf countries have traditionally played the role of mediators between Russia and Ukraine, namely in regard to prisoner exchanges. Following Zelensky&apos;s meeting with the Saudi crown prince, the Ukrainian president&apos;s team will remain in the country on March 11 to meet U.S. delegates and discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement. Zelensky is not expected to participate in the negotiations. Zelensky previously announced that his Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa would take part in the talks.The meeting between the U.S. and Ukrainian delegations will occur after a heated argument between Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance on Feb. 28 in the White House Oval Office.Since that meeting, the U.S. has ended its military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-arrives-in-saudi-arabia-ahead-of-ukraine-us-talks/	2025-03-10T08:30:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156503093.jpg
Navigating the world of Trump and Musk's lies	Just a few years ago, the biggest purveyors of disinformation on the internet were bots, conspiracy theorists and Russian propaganda outlets. Today the world is a very different place and two of the most prominent sources of lies and mistruths are the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and the world&#x2019;s richest man, Elon Musk. The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Chris York sits down with Eliot Higgins, founder and creative director of the investigative outlet Bellingcat, to discuss how we arrived at this point and what can be done about it.	https://kyivindependent.com/navigating-the-world-of-trump-and-musks-lies/	2025-03-10T08:27:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_1275.JPG
Washington considers easing sanctions on Russian oil, Bloomberg reports	Advisers to U.S. President Donald Trump are discussing easing sanctions against Russia, including those imposed on Russian oil, a major source of funding for the war in Ukraine, Bloomberg reported on March 10, citing sources. The news comes as Ukraine and the U.S. are set to hold talks on ending Russia&apos;s war in Saudi Arabia this week. The Trump administration is seeking options to make &quot;a step forward&quot; and encourage the Kremlin to negotiate an end to the war. Easing the price ceiling on Russian oil is allegedly one option under consideration, Bloomberg reported, citing its undisclosed sources familiar with the matter. The oil price cap was approved by G7 countries in 2022 and came into effect in 2023. Currently the cap stands at $60 per barrel. Despite Russia&apos;s ability to sustain a wartime economy through increased military spending and industrial production, experts say it remains vulnerable and needs sanctions relief. The Kremlin has expressed interest in economic cooperation with the U.S., particularly in rare earth metals. Trump has also sought a minerals deal with Ukraine, which has significant lithium and rare earth metal reserves, as a way to offset the billions of dollars in American aid. However, his meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28 ended without an agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/washington-considers-easing-sanctions-over-russian-oil-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-10T08:03:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1258888534.jpeg
Russian woman seeks to adopt abducted Ukrainian child after her son was killed fighting in war, investigation says	A Russian woman, Olga Dorokhina, took a 4-year-old girl from the occupied part of Kherson Oblast and plans to adopt her, according to an investigation by Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne published on March 10. Dorokhina&#x2019;s son was previously killed while fighting against Ukraine, according to the investigation. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, at least 19,500 Ukrainian children have been abducted from occupied territories and transferred to other Russian-controlled areas, Belarus, or Russia itself, according to Ukraine&#x2019;s national database, Children of War. Dorokhina spoke about her trip and the girl&#x2019;s abduction from Ukraine during a conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin at an event, claiming she had &quot;found her daughter&quot; in Kherson Oblast. The child is now under her guardianship. Suspilne&#x2019;s investigative team identified Dorokhina as a native of Yelets, Lipetsk Oblast, Russia, who moved to occupied Simferopol in Crimea in 2016. Her husband, Oleksandr Dorokhin, is a former employee of Russia&#x2019;s Federal Penitentiary Service and a veteran of the Chechen war.

US hasn't stopped sharing defense-related intelligence with Ukraine, Trump's envoy says	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. The U.S. has never stopped sharing intelligence with Ukraine that is needed for defensive purposes, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, told Fox News on March 10. The comments seem to confirm earlier claims in the media that the U.S. freeze on intelligence sharing with Kyiv, instituted on March 5, did not extend to information needed for defense operations. Restrictions on intelligence that could help Ukraine strike Russian targets remain in place, according to the latest information. The issue will be discussed at the U.S.-Ukrainian talks in Jeddah on March 11, Witkoff said before departing for Saudi Arabia. The Trump administration restricted intelligence sharing with Ukraine shortly after freezing all U.S. military assistance flowing to the country, which has faced Russia&apos;s all-out war for more than three years. The steps followed a heated exchange between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28, which underscored Washington&apos;s increasingly hostile stance toward Ukraine as it seeks to restore ties with Russia. According to Witkoff, the U.S. hopes for significant progress with Ukraine this week, which could include the signing of a natural resources deal that has been on hold since the Oval Office spat.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-hasnt-stopped-sharing-defense-related-intelligence-with-ukraine-trumps-envoy-says/	2025-03-10T06:49:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203659271.jpg
Do US-Russia talks on Ukraine mark a reappearance of colonial power play?	The unexpected negotiations between the United States and the Russian Federation that began in Saudi Arabia in February were strange. These off-line discussions in Riyadh, which included foreign ministers and presidential advisors from both countries, focused primarily on the fate of Ukraine and the future of European security. Yet, neither Ukraine nor the European Union, nor any of its member states, were present or in any other way involved in these purely bilateral face-to-face meetings. Other oddities were apparent. A Ukrainian delegation, led by First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, had just met with Saudi Arabian officials in Riyadh on Feb. 16. This delegation was there to prepare for a visit by President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was on a previously planned trip to the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia &#x2014; although the Saudi portion was canceled. Ukraine&#x2019;s president and government officials were physically nearby the American and Russian negotiators, who were discussing the future of the Ukrainian state in Riyadh. The absurdity of this situation in February illustrates the profound changes the international order may be undergoing today. The approaches of Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s inner circle and the Trump administration to Ukraine do not signal a new &quot;multipolar world.&quot; Instead, they reflect a return to the principles of the Yalta system, established during the final months of World War II. The idea of &quot;might makes right&quot; that, in spite of the Allies&#x2019; triumph over the fascist axis, prevailed in 1945 seems to resurface today, as outside powers attempt to divide continental Europe. During talks at Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam in 1943-45, Moscow was granted more East European territory than it had received before and at the start of World War II, in its talks with Nazi Germany. In protocols to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and German-Soviet Border and Friendship Treaty of 1939, Stalin had secured Soviet control over parts of East-Central Europe, including Poland and the Baltic states. But by 1945, the U.S. had handed over the entire eastern portion of the continent to Soviet imperialism, enforced Russification, state terrorism, and colonial exploitation. To show his disrespect for the new international system established in 1945, Stalin smuggled the Soviet &quot;republics&quot; of Ukraine and Belarus as founding members into the United Nations. After the collapse of the German empire in 1945, other European empires, too, lost most of their colonies. By 1989-1991, it seemed that the Russian land empire, in its communist form, had also come to an end. First, the nations of the Soviet bloc or &quot;outer empire,&quot; and then the republics of the Soviet Union&#x2019;s &quot;inner empire,&quot; gained formal independence. However, Moscow&#x2019;s 1945-1991 mockery of international law continued, albeit on a smaller scale, after the breakup of the Soviet Union. For example, without following the regular process of application and accession to the United Nations (as Serbia did after the breakup of Yugoslavia), Russia became a permanent member of the UN Security Council, even though the UN&#x2019;s statute still only mentions the Soviet Union. The Kremlin also managed to gain Western sanctioning for so-called &#x201C;peacekeepers&#x201D; in Moldova and Georgia, whose role was to &quot;keep pieces&quot; of a Russian rump-empire under Moscow&#x2019;s control. For 30 years after 1991, both the U.S. and Western Europe practiced a &quot;Russia First&quot; policy, where the interests of Russia&#x2019;s former colonies were secondary to those of Moscow. This strange policy even meant temporarily expanding the G7 to include Russia, creating a G8 group, which &#x2014; at least in the Kremlin&#x2019;s understanding &#x2014; reinforced Moscow&#x2019;s continued status as a world and imperial power. The most scandalous example of this approach was the (abortive) Russo-German Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project launched after, and in demonstrative disregard of, Russia&#x2019;s annexation of Crimea and covert military intervention in Eastern Ukraine in 2014. (L-R) Then-French Prime Minister Francois Fillon, then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel, then-Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, and then-European Union Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger turn a wheel to symbolically start the flow of gas through the Nord Stream Baltic Sea gas pipeline at a ceremony in Lubmin, Germany, on Nov. 8, 2011. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)In 2022, Germany and other Western European nations finally reversed their &quot;Russia First&quot; stance, finally recognizing the legitimacy and rationality of the interests of Moscow&#x2019;s former colonies. Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia&#x2014;though still partially occupied&#x2014;became candidates for membership in the European Union. The driving force behind this shift was Ursula von der Leyen, the German president of the European Commission, representing a nation that once had its own colonial plans for Ukraine. In contrast, the U.S., which itself began the decolonization process in the 18th century, seems to be today reversing its earlier liberationist stance toward Eastern Europe and its active support for Russia&#x2019;s former colonies breaking free from Moscow&#x2019;s neo-imperial orbit. At least rhetorically, the Trump administration appears to be returning to a Yalta-like approach, where the voices of smaller states are sidelined, and Ukraine&#x2019;s participation in negotiations about its future is unnecessary. Much of this occurs in direct or indirect contradiction to the letter and spirit of the 30-year old security assurances Washington gave Kyiv in the now infamous Budapest Memorandum. In December 1994, this historic document was signed in by Kyiv and the three depositary governments of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), i.e. the U.S., United Kingdom, and Russia in connection with Ukraine&#x2019;s decision to relinquish all of its Soviet-era atomic weapons and sign the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state. Trump&#x2019;s stance also conflicts with the 2008 Bucharest NATO declaration, in which U.S. President George W. Bush entrenched a NATO membership perspective for Ukraine and Georgia, as well as with the 2008 Strategic Partnership Charter and 2024 Bilateral Security Agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine. Time will tell how far this American reversal of its foreign affairs and thus of the overall course of contemporary world history will go.

Russia moves to curb Chinese car imports with higher fees, tighter regulations	Russia is moving to curb the flow of Chinese car imports, a decision that could deal a blow to Chinese manufacturers and traders who have increasingly relied on the Russian market, the Financial Times reported on March 10. China has remained a key economic partner for Russia throughout the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, supplying Moscow with critical dual-use goods and helping to keep its economy afloat amind Western sanctions. Chinese car exports to Russia surged sevenfold in 2023 compared to 2022, as Western sanctions over Moscow&#x2019;s war against Ukraine cut Russia off from brands like Volkswagen, Toyota, and BMW. Automakers in China, facing anti-dumping measures in the U.S., EU, Canada, Turkey, and Brazil, found a lucrative market in Russia, the Financial Times wrote. Chinese brands now account for 63% of the market, while domestic Russian brands have fallen to 29%. In response, Russian authorities have introduced measures to slow the influx. In January, Moscow raised the &quot;recycling fees&quot; for most passenger cars to $7,500, more than doubling the rate set last September. The fees will continue rising by 10-20% annually until 2030. Russian regulators have also blocked the sale of a Chinese truck model over alleged safety violations and warned that more compliance checks may follow. The move comes amid an expected decline in new car sales in Russia, with projections of a 30% drop in 2025 if high interest rates persist, according to Avtovaz CEO Maxim Sokolov. The state-owned Avtovaz is Russia&apos;s largest carmaker, known for its flagship Lada vehicle series. The Russian Central Bank raised its key interest rate to 21% in October 2024 to curb inflation from wartime spending. Despite its growing economic ties with Russia, Beijing insists it remains neutral in Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine and has even sought to position itself as a mediator.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-moves-to-curb-chinese-car-imports-with-higher-fees-tighter-regulations/	2025-03-10T06:23:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-164317197.jpg
5 steps for securing an eastward enlargement of the European Union	Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine is not only about Ukraine&#x2019;s freedom and survival, but also about the future of Europe&#x2019;s hard security. Russia wants to replace the cooperative, democratic security order in Europe, the principles of which were outlined 50 years ago in the Helsinki Final Act, with one where might makes right and Russia is an empire dominating large swathes of Europe. This would pose an existential security threat to the European Union and its member states. The EU&#x2019;s decision to open accession negotiations with Ukraine is a geostrategic investment that could strengthen the European security order and prevent Russia from achieving its ambitions. It does so not only by defending Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereign right to pursue a European path, but also by securing military capabilities and strategic resources for the EU. However, even though Ukraine could contribute to the EU&#x2019;s security in the long term as a full member, it is primarily Europe that must ensure Ukraine&#x2019;s security. NATO membership remains Ukraine&#x2019;s goal &#x2014; it is enshrined in the constitution and supported by a clear majority of Ukrainian citizens. However, there is currently no consensus within NATO on extending an invitation to Ukraine. This could change quickly, and European countries are right to insist that Ukrainian NATO membership would be the best and cheapest option for ensuring security in the North Atlantic area. Nonetheless, the prospects for Ukrainian NATO membership remain distant, so the EU must seriously consider how it can secure its geostrategic investment &#x2014; an EU eastward enlargement &#x2014; without security guarantees under NATO&#x2019;s Article 5. The EU may also face fundamentally new and urgent military challenges in light of U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s expressed ambition to reach a ceasefire deal in Russia&#x2019;s war. While the form of such a deal and the prospects for reaching it are far from certain, any form of ceasefire settlement would need to be followed by credible security assurances to Ukraine. Without this, Ukraine would be defenseless against renewed Russian aggression (as happened after the conclusion of the Minsk agreements). The possibility that EU member states and countries like the U.K. and Norway would have to deploy troops on Ukrainian territory in the case of a ceasefire deal cannot be ruled out. Against this backdrop, the need to step up the EU&#x2019;s hard security is not a distant task that needs to be realized only after Ukraine joins the EU. To secure an eastward EU enlargement and address potentially immediate military challenges, the EU must deliver on its ambition to become a geostrategic actor, both on its own and in close cooperation with NATO. It must show, through deeds, that it has both the political resolve and the capabilities to defend itself and its core interests. Some of the measures needed to achieve that ambition will require deviations from the status quo and reassessments of the EU&#x2019;s role. The feasibility of implementing the required steps to ensure the EU&#x2019;s hard security will not only stem from political desire in European capitals, but also from external circumstances and pressure from the U.S. These factors may provide the sense of necessity that, as in the past, enables EU member states to unite, shape, and reshape European cooperation. First, European policymakers should consider implementing key institutional reforms in foreign and security policy. Currently, the EU&#x2019;s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) remains intergovernmental; since decisions require consensus among member states, EU action can suffer from a lack of timeliness and effectiveness. A move to qualified majority voting (QMV) in the CFSP would enhance the EU&#x2019;s policymaking efficiency and could arguably be done without a Treaty change. QMV has been discussed in the past, but today&#x2019;s geopolitical challenges could provide the impetus to move ahead with it.

(Maxym Marusenko / NurPhoto via Getty Images)The CFSP is also an area that Ukraine and Moldova could be integrated into immediately, for example, by allowing them to participate in key CFSP decision-making forums and by integrating them into EU security initiatives such as the European Defence Agency (EDA) and Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO). Second, the EU&#x2019;s enhanced geostrategic role will require large-scale investments and efforts in security and defense. Defense spending in member states would need to exceed at least 3% of GDP, a significant portion of which would be devoted to military assistance to Ukraine and investments in the Ukrainian defense industry. The European Council conclusions on European defense from March 6 welcomed the European Commission&#x2019;s plans to facilitate increased national defense spending and provide member states with defense loans. They also called on the European Investment Bank (EIB) to adapt its lending practices to the defense industry, re-evaluate the list of excluded activities and increase the volume of available funding. These conclusions outline necessary steps in the right direction. Taking on EU common debt through defense bonds could also offer financial firepower for closing capability gaps and strengthening Europe&#x2019;s defense infrastructure. For such a step to be viable, countries that have traditionally opposed joint debt would need to change their frugal positions. Third, if the EU is to succeed in taking on a new role in world politics, European leaders must improve their strategic communication with citizens. A change in strategic culture in Europe &#x2014; based on an understanding among citizens of, for example, why enlargement is a geostrategic investment, why enlargement needs security, and the urgent military challenges the EU might face &#x2014; will be key to ensuring domestic support for investments in security and defense. Strategic communication with the citizens of EU member states about the concrete contributions that candidate countries can make to the EU&#x2019;s security and economic prosperity as full member states will also play an important role. Fourth, greater and closer cooperation between the EU and NATO will be necessary to ensure effective complementarity and intelligence sharing between the two organizations. One step could be sealing a new partnership between the EU and NATO, under which the EU would use its financial and regulatory tools to help member states fulfill NATO capability requirements and enforce more strictly defined NATO standardization agreements for equipment and ammunition to enhance interoperability. Trilateral exchanges between the EU, NATO, and groups of EU member states on creating military mobility corridors and consolidating multinational military logistics would further strengthen cooperation and could be proactively suggested to the U.S. by European states. Fifth, bearing in mind the possibility of a military operation on Ukrainian territory, European states should ensure they create the structures necessary for its implementation. There is a need to establish a joint military command, along with various staff structures, responsible for planning both the operation itself and potential reinforcements for deployed troops in the event of a crisis. Additionally, logistics and intelligence structures will need to be set up, and the military units that could participate must be identified. Ideally, these would be multinational formations already established within the framework of NATO&#x2019;s joint command in Europe, such as the Multinational Corps Northeast. The question of possible independent military operations by European NATO members, without the participation of the U.S., has arisen several times in NATO&#x2019;s history. These ideas have traditionally been rejected by Washington, partly because of concerns that an increasingly autonomous Europe would undermine U.S. authority in NATO, duplicate NATO resources, and threaten NATO cohesion. If Washington is shifting its approach to Europe&apos;s security, now may be the right time to revisit the idea of establishing European cells within NATO. This would allow Europe to take on the primary responsibility for ensuring Ukraine&#x2019;s (and Europe&#x2019;s) security, while maintaining critical U.S. support within NATO for logistics, airlift, and strategic reconnaissance.

Investigation: We tried to buy American chips as a Russian defense manufacturer â€” and it worked	Despite bans put in place by the U.S. and Europe on the supply of electronic components to Russia, dozens of Russian microelectronics suppliers continue to obtain and resell imported chips to Russian arms manufacturers successfully. Without these Western chips, Russia would not be able to produce key weapons &#x2014; like missiles, drones, and self-propelled howitzers. To prove that this line of supply continues to operate three years into Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, the Kyiv Independent tried ordering American microchips from Russian trading companies, posing as a Russian defense producer. We obtained a list of Russian firms supplying Western microcircuits to the Russian defense industry from leaked emails of the Russian state holding Ruselectronics. The Kyiv Independent obtained access to the leak together with OCCRP. (The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s first investigation based on the leak is available here. The investigation focused on the continued export of Russian weapons during the full-scale war.) We combed through the emails for mentions of the supply of American and European chips to Russia and followed the traces of the described transactions. According to the leaked letters, after the start of the full-scale invasion, companies of the Ruselectronics holding requested large volumes of various American and European chips from Russian suppliers &#x2014; and got confirmation that they could be supplied, despite sanctions. The leaked emails cover the first few months of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Through the emails, the Kyiv Independent identified an ecosystem of companies that came to the aid of Ruselectronics holding by building new supply chains for banned components. Using customs data, we also discovered a huge network of their foreign suppliers, mostly from China and Hong Kong. These records, together with our undercover experiment, prove that American and European-branded chips continue flowing to Russia &#x2014; the country that started the largest war in Europe since World War II. The U.S. and EU imposed sanctions and export restrictions immediately on the first day of Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and some even the day before. The restrictions, among other things, banned American and European chips from entering Russia, whose defense sector relies heavily on their use in producing weapons. Russia wasn&#x2019;t ready for it. From the leaked emails, it&#x2019;s clear that the producers had no significant stockpile of chips. On the second day of the invasion, one Ruselectronics employee emailed notes from an internal meeting to two colleagues. It mentions that &#x201C;delivery times for electronic components had increased, and prices had risen.&#x201D; The letter concludes that the holding would need to buy a year&#x2019;s worth of stock of electronic components. This and other emails suggest that the Russian arms manufacturer wasn&#x2019;t preparing for a protracted war. It didn&#x2019;t have extra stocks of imported chips at the start of the invasion but began procuring them immediately after the start of the invasion, bypassing the fresh restrictions. In April 2022, two months after the start of the invasion, Ruselectronics companies prepared proposals on how to reduce the risks of disruptions in the procurement of electronic components. Among other things, the proposals called for allocating additional funding to create stockpiles of electronic components. But the leaked letters reveal that suppliers faced difficulties procuring the electronics. In March 2022, Elitcom, a Russian supplier of Ruselectronics holding, wrote to say that it would fail to deliver chips produced by the American company Analog Devices on time. The contract for the chips was signed in December 2021, and one of Ruselectronics&#x2019; subsidiaries expected their delivery in May 2022. Elitcom explained that due to the Russian invasion, the American manufacturer had stopped deliveries to Russia, and Analog Devices&#x2019; official distributor &#x201C;did not confirm its readiness&#x201D; to fulfill the contract. But Elitcom had a plan and said it could arrange the supply of the necessary Analog Devices chips, despite sanctions. The company was offering to do so with the help of unnamed &#x201C;foreign partners&#x201D; who confirmed the chips would arrive in September-October 2022, several months later than originally planned. Similar cases occurred across the sector. Around that same time, a Russian electronics supplier, TestKomplekt, emailed a Ruselectronics&#x2019; subsidiary to warn that due to foreign restrictions, it had revised the terms of supply of American-branded chips, such as Analog Devices, Texas Instruments, Microchip Technology, Altera, Maxim Integrated, and others. Not a problem &#x2014; the company was still ready to supply them, but at new prices. The leaked emails contain direct evidence that Russian defense manufacturers can&#x2019;t produce weapons without Western chips, nor can they be substituted with analogs. For example, a sanctioned Ruselectronics&#x2019; subsidiary, the Istok Research and Production Corporation, argued that it needed to purchase certain American chips produced by Analog Devices because Russian and other analogs &#x201C;do not comply with the design documentation&#x201D; of the enterprise. The use of other chips &#x201C;is impossible,&#x201D; an internal note says. &#x201C;For the Russians, this stuff is absolutely critical,&#x201D; explains James Byrne, senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a London-headquartered security think tank. &#x201C;They can&apos;t build missiles without it. It&apos;s not like they&apos;re just going to give up.&#x201D; But the Russian arms manufacturers didn&#x2019;t have to give up the Western chips. There were those willing to supply them. An unobvious but important detail illustrated by the leaked emails is that Russian arms manufacturers don&#x2019;t import Western chips directly from abroad. They didn&#x2019;t do so even before the full-scale invasion. Instead, Russian arms manufacturers buy imported circuits within Russia. Whenever they need electronics, they tap into a vast network of Russian suppliers of imported electronic components like Elitcom or TestKomplekt. The network is a mix of state-owned and private companies that specialize in purchasing American and European chips. Some of them openly advertise the sale of American chips on their websites even now, in 2025, in the fourth year of the Russian war. It was these companies that came to the rescue of the Russian defense industry after the introduction of unprecedented Western export bans and sanctions, setting up workarounds to supply chips to Russia. These companies don&#x2019;t publicly advertise that their clients are Russian defense manufacturers. It is only through internal correspondence and access to contracts, which aren&#x2019;t public, that it becomes clear that these private firms with flashy websites are actually the lifeline of Russian missile production.

(Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)The leaked emails show that after the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine and the imposition of restrictions and sanctions, more than two dozen Russian providers of Western chips responded to Ruselectronics&#x2019; growing demand. Among them were Russian companies Modern Digital Technologies, Imotek, Elsup, AST Components, Orion-Electronika, Altex, Elesar-Grupp, Trade House Alfa-Komplekt ECB, Communication Systems Equipment, RTKT, GC Electromir, MTG, Electronintorg, and others. They confirmed their readiness to supply hundreds of different American-branded chips in response to requests from Ruselectronics&#x2019; subsidiaries in March&#x2013;April 2022. Some Russian chip suppliers took the initiative and approached representatives of Ruselectronics to advertise their capabilities, knowing they would struggle to obtain chips. In March 2022, the Russian design center Kristal wrote a letter to a Ruselectronics representative, informing him that the company had supply channels for imported electronic components from Texas Instruments, Analog Devices, Maxim, Microchip, Micron, NXP, Xilinx (AMD), Qorvo, and Broadcom. Kristal offered a meeting to discuss cooperation. &#x201C;Together with foreign partners, we have access to global distributors of electronic components,&#x201D; Kristal&#x2019;s CEO Leonid Zotov boasted in an email sent on the 19th day of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Who is behind suppliers like Kristal? Among the owners are a retired Russian major general, medium-sized entrepreneurs, a Russian oligarch, as well as employees of companies united in the state-owned Ruselectronics holding, or the Russian state defense corporation, Rostec, itself. For example, Elsup&#x2019;s owner is Vladislav Borodovitsyn. According to his Instagram page, he previously held a position as an employee of a research institute that is jointly controlled by Rostec and the investment company Sistema, owned by Russian oligarch Vladimir Yevtushenkov. Kristal is also controlled by Rostec and oligarch Yevtushenkov. Vladimir Yevtushenkov, Russian oligarch, owner of investment company Sistema. (Dyor/Wikimedia)Electronintorg is part of the state-owned Rostec&#x2019;s subsidiary Ruselectronics. Among the co-owners of AST Components, we found the retired Russian Major General Magomed Tolboev, who was also an aspiring politician, and his son Ruslan. Commercial proposals sent by Russian suppliers at Ruselectronics&#x2019; request included American electronic components used in Russian missiles and other weapons. Among the offers, the Kyiv Independent identified a number of American chips that had been found in Kinzhals &#x2014; Russian ballistic missiles that carry a warhead of nearly 500 kilograms used in strikes on Kyiv and more distant cities, killing civilians. According to the leak, Russian intermediary companies were also ready to supply U.S. chips that are used in Russian Kalibr and R-77 missiles, as well as in the Tornado-G system capable of launching 40 rockets at once and in the Giatsint-S, a tank-mounted gun.

(Source image: Wikimedia, war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua, leaked emails)Although the leaked Ruselectronics&#x2019; emails don&#x2019;t extend beyond May 2022, Russian intermediaries did not exhaust their ability to supply the Russian defense industry with Western chips. The Kyiv Independent managed to obtain Russian tax records from 2024 with a list of contractors for one Ruselectronics&#x2019; subsidiary: the Istok Research and Production Corporation. In 2024, Istok continued to receive supplies from the majority of the Russian providers of imported circuits that we encountered in the leaked emails. The Kyiv Independent decided to try and order American chips through Russian suppliers in February 2025 &#x2014; and was successful. To confirm that the flow of Western chips to Russia is not a fiction, we carried out an undercover experiment. The Kyiv Independent took on the role of an employee of a real Ruselectronics&#x2019; subsidiary, the Almaz research and production enterprise, which produces electronic systems for military equipment. Surprisingly, the most difficult aspect of the experiment was to create an email account with a Russian email service, as they are blocked in Ukraine. When that was done, trying to buy banned Western chips in Russia was easy. The Kyiv Independent prepared a request for a commercial proposal on behalf of Almaz, asking for circuits produced by American-headquartered companies, and sent the request to two dozen Russian suppliers of American chips. Ten of them responded, confirming their ability to deliver the required chips. The Russian companies Imotek, AST Components, Elsup, Altex, RTKT, and Vneshtekhsnab confirmed they were ready to deliver chips in 1.5 to three months. Modern Digital Technologies, Electromir, and Imotek sent their offers, specifying the years of chip production. They included chips from Analog Devices, Texas Instruments, and Atmel manufactured in 2022-2024. One of the Russian companies, Elesar-Grupp, sent a full list of the chips it currently had in its warehouse, indicating their quantity. There were millions of chips of famous American and European brands. The list, provided to the Kyiv Independent when it reached out under the guise of an Almaz employee, included chips from American manufacturers Analog Devices, Texas Instruments, Microchip Technology, Xilinx (AMD), ON Semiconductor, Intel, Dutch NXP, German Infineon, and many others. Among them were those used in Russian missiles and attack drones. In the fourth year of Russia&apos;s full-scale war in Ukraine, those American and European chips are still available to Russian intermediary firms, and through them &#x2014; to Russian arms manufacturers. Due to strict export bans imposed after the start of the full-scale invasion, Western chipmakers have stopped direct deliveries to Russia and banned official distributors from supplying their parts to Russian companies. Instead, Western chips enter Russia through third countries that have not imposed restrictions. The main suppliers of American chips to Russia are China and Hong Kong. Customs data since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 shows that dozens of companies, mainly registered in Hong Kong and China, sent Western chips to Russian electronic component traders cooperating with Ruselectronics holding. The companies are either Chinese providers of Western microelectronics with many years of experience or newly established entities without websites and public contact information. According to ImportGenius, the Hong Kong-based electronic component seller Analog Technology has supplied Western chips to the Russian companies Modern Digital Technologies and Imotek since 2022. Hong Kong-based Analog Technology was established in 2011 and positions itself as a seller of chips &#x201C;of all famous worldwide brands.&#x201D; It supplied all well-known American and European chip brands to Russian firms despite Western export restrictions, according to trade data. Another Hong Kong-based company, Icscan Electronic, registered in 2022, presents itself as a &#x201C;famous international one-stop purchasing service provider of electronic components,&#x201D; and has sold chips of various American brands to Russian Elsup. Chinese Berton Electronics, which claims to be &#x201C;an agent of electronic components of well-known brands,&#x201D; sold Western-branded chips to Russian Modern Digital Technologies. In their turn, Russian companies Elsup, Modern Digital Technologies, Imotek, and other chip traders resold imported circuits to Ruselectronics holding. The following chart provides a glimpse into the scale of the Chinese distribution network of Western chips.

(Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)The data provides insights into the link in the chain that gets U.S. chips into Russia despite export bans. In this chain, Chinese suppliers resell the chips to Russian buyers that then supply them to the Russian defense industry. How many times chips are sold and resold before ending up in a Russian defense company is anyone&#x2019;s guess. According to customs records, American chips are produced in different countries, including the U.S., China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines, and others. In other words, some of these chips were most likely manufactured in American factories located outside the U.S. &#x201C;The key Western producers have several production facilities in countries like China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and a few in Thailand and Taiwan. Some of these are Chinese factories working on license, while others are daughter companies,&#x201D; says Erlend B Bjortvedt, founder of Corisk, an Oslo-based consulting company that explores sanctions and sanction evasion. Bjortvedt adds that &#x201C;this does not reduce their liabilities to follow sanctions&#x201D;. &#x201C;This liability includes daughter companies and U.S. and EU citizens in the management or board of daughter companies abroad,&#x201D; he explains. Further sanctions on foreign companies that help Russia obtain scarce weapons components, as well as increased compliance by Western manufacturers, are two key steps to reduce such supplies, experts say. &#x201C;When a product that is prohibited for sale to Russia, according to U.S. rules, goes from China to Russia, this is not a violation from China&apos;s perspective. However, it would be a violation of sanctions from the U.S. point of view,&#x201D; explains Vladyslav Vlasiuk, Ukraine&apos;s presidential commissioner for sanctions policy. &#x201C;That&apos;s why Chinese companies that supply microelectronics to Russia appear on U.S. sanctions lists,&#x201D; Vlasiuk explains. It is noteworthy that half of the Chinese chip suppliers to Ruselectronics holding identified by the Kyiv Independent, as well as their Russian buyers, are not yet under U.S. sanctions. That is, their activities have not yet been noticed by the authorized U.S. sanctions authorities. The Kyiv Independent reached out to dozens of Chinese companies mentioned in this article for comments, but did not receive any replies by the time of publication. James Byrne of RUSI spoke to the Kyiv Independent about his experience of communicating with chip manufacturers. According to him, they complain that they have limited visibility, meaning they can only see &#x201C;one or two steps down with the chain.&#x201D; &#x201C;If you&apos;re Texas Instruments or Intel, you have large distributors. The distributors sell components to all sorts of entities all over the world. Let&apos;s say you sell to some distributor in Hong Kong, and then they sell to another entity in Hong Kong, and that entity ships them to the Russians. I think it&apos;s a difficult problem to solve, but it doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s impossible.&#x201D; The Kyiv Independent contacted all the Western chipmakers mentioned in the article. Those who responded called the resale of their chips to Russia illicit and unauthorized, condemning it. Reactions from chip manufacturers on third-party supplies to Russia. Part 1. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)Reactions from chip manufacturers on third-party supplies to Russia. Part 2. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)Large manufacturers can tighten control over who they sell banned goods to and refuse risky customers, some of the experts say. &#x201C;Western chips manufacturers have had tremendous growth and profits over the last decades, but they have not invested in compliance and internal investigation,&#x201D; says Erlend B Bjortvedt, who works closely with customs data analysis at Corisk. &#x201C;One company I researched had 60,000 employees but did not see big and obvious red flags in their value chain,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;The loopholes in the digital components industry can be closed by forcing producers to invest in internal control resources through preventive investigations with strong penalties, and by deterring third parties through forceful secondary sanctions of foreign banks,&#x201D; according to Bjortvedt. Until that happens, American and European components make it possible to produce new batches of Russian weapons that attack Ukrainian cities and kill civilians. Hi, this is Alisa Yurchenko, the author of this story. I&#x2019;m writing this note shortly after reading the news that the U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a suspension of military aid to Ukraine &#x2014; a move that will manifest, among other things, that Ukraine might not have the way to protect itself from the Russian missiles. It adds to the bitterness of this moment is the understanding that Russian missiles that have been hitting Ukraine in the past three years would not have been produced if it wasn&#x2019;t for the Western chips and other components. Stories like this can create the wrong impression that export restrictions on critical components to Russia have failed. But they did have some effect. The need for workarounds made the chips 40 percent more expensive for Russian importers. We see it in the leaked emails dating back to the first months of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Another, even more important result is a reduction in Russian imports of digital components and chips after December 2022, according to sanctions analysts. The trade through intermediaries has slowed down, they say. This gives us hope that if the pressure on Western chip sales through China, Hong Kong and other third countries is increased, Russia will not be able to produce missiles and other weapons.

Lukashenko appoints Alexander Turchin as Belarus's new PM	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has appointed Alexander Turchin as the country&#x2019;s new prime minister, state-owned news agency Belta reported on March 10. Turchin, who previously served as head of the Minsk regional executive committee, held key government positions, including chief of staff of the Council of Ministers in 2016 and first deputy prime minister in 2018-2019. After his appointment, Turchin told reporters that Belarus would not see any &quot;significant course correction,&quot; adding that his approach would be one of &quot;evolution without revolutions.&quot; Turchin is replacing Roman Golovchenko, who has held the office of prime minister since June 2020 and was now appointed head of the National Bank. Lukashenko presented the personnel changes as the advent of a &quot;new generation&quot; in Belarusian leadership. Lukashenko, in power since 1994 and widely regarded as Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s close ally, has faced repeated accusations of election fraud. His self-declared victory in the 2020 presidential election, widely denounced as illegitimate, triggered mass protests in Minsk that were brutally suppressed with Moscow&#x2019;s backing. Since then, over 8,000 people have been detained for political reasons, according to the Belarusian human rights group Viasna. On Jan. 26, Lukashenko claimed a seventh term in office in another election widely condemned as neither free nor fair. Though Belarus has not directly participated in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, it has allowed the Kremlin to use its territory as a staging ground for military operations.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-appoints-new-belarus-prime-minister/	2025-03-10T05:48:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/595a60fb-8831-3f7c-fa06-c257a42d8a53.jpg
Ukraine to buy 4.5 million FPV drones in 2025	Ukraine plans to purchase 4.5 million first-person-view (FPV) drones this year as part of a large-scale effort to equip its military with advanced technologies, the Defense Ministry reported on March 10. The total cost of the procurement exceeds Hr 110 billion ($2.6 billion), with Hr 102 billion ($2.4 billion) allocated through the Defense Procurement Agency. FPV drones, which are cost-effective and capable of precise targeting, have proven highly effective in destroying expensive military equipment. The Defense Ministry purchased several thousands of drones in 2023, while the following year, the amount increased to 1.5 million, said Hlib Kanevsky, head of the ministry&apos;s procurement department. Roughly 96% of the allocated sum went to Ukrainian producers and suppliers. Both Ukraine and Russia have increasingly relied on drone warfare, using aerial, naval, and ground-based drones for reconnaissance and combat missions. The number of Russian targets destroyed by Ukrainian drones rose by 22% in February compared to January, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi reported. Kyiv has also been accelerating the production of long-range missile-drone hybrids, with President Volodymyr Zelensky setting a target of at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-buy-4-5-million-fpv-drones-in-2025/	2025-03-10T05:10:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1574618594.jpg
Russia's arms exports plunge by 47% since full-scale invasion's start, SIPRI reports	Russia&apos;s arms exports fell by 47% in 2024 compared to 2022, when Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to a March report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). The decline is attributed to Russia prioritizing weapons production for its own military, the impact of Western sanctions, and increased pressure from the U.S. and its allies on countries purchasing Russian arms, the report said. Since 2022, Western sanctions have targeted Russian banks, energy exports, and dual-use goods, further straining Moscow&#x2019;s arms trade. Over the past five years, Russian arms exports have dropped by 64%, shrinking the country&#x2019;s global market share to 7.8%. While Russia supplied arms to 47 countries between 2018 and 2022, that number dropped to 33 in 2024. Asia and Oceania accounted for 74% of Russian exports, Africa 12%, and Europe 7.4%. India remains Russia&#x2019;s largest buyer, accounting for 38% of sales, followed by China (17%) and Kazakhstan (11%). Russia is still set to deliver arms under deals with India, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. Despite its declining market share, Russia remains one of the world&#x2019;s top three arms exporters, SIPRI noted. The U.S. continues to lead, controlling 43% of global arms exports.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-arms-exports-plunge-by-47-since-full-scale-invasion-sipri-reports/	2025-03-10T04:48:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2006245916.jpg
Russia attempting to gain foothold in Sumy Oblast, Border Guard warns	Russian forces are attempting to establish a foothold near Novenke, a Ukrainian village in Sumy Oblast near the border with Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, State Border Guard spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said on air on March 10. The news comes after Russia reportedly achieved a breakthrough in Kursk Oblast, seeking to encircle the Ukrainian forces fighting there and penetrate the Ukrainian border. &quot;These are small assault units, composed of a few people. They try to penetrate our territory, accumulate forces, and advance further into Ukraine, probably to cut off logistical routes,&quot; Demchenko said on national television. Moscow&apos;s troops have been reportedly trying to push toward Novenke, a village lying 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the regional center, Sumy, for several weeks. The battlefield situation at the Ukraine-Russia border areas of the Sumy and Kursk oblasts as of March 10, 2025, according to DeepState. The village of Novenke marked with a black symbol, the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast marked in blue. (DeepState/Open Street Maps)Ukrainian artillery and drone units continue attacking Russian troops, preventing them from accumulating forces, the spokesperson added. Concerns about the Ukrainian operation in Kursk Oblast, ongoing since August 2024, have mounted over the weekend amid reports of Russian advances. The development came shortly after the U.S. cut off military and intelligence support for Ukraine, allegedly to push Kyiv to the negotiating table. A potential loss of the Kursk salient or Russian advances in Sumy Oblast would likely weaken Ukraine&apos;s negotiating position as it prepares for initial rounds of talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia. Russian forces have begun collapsing the northern part of the Ukrainian Kursk salient, while destroyed bridges complicate Ukraine&apos;s ability to withdraw toward the key town of Sudzha, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think-tank said on March 9. Moscow has also reportedly deployed North Korean troops in the renewed attack in Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-attempting-to-gain-foothold-in-sumy-oblast-border-guard-warns/	2025-03-10T04:33:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204125313.jpg
Ukrainian drones mark 22% increase in Russian target destruction in February, Syrskyi says	The number of Russian targets destroyed by Ukrainian drones increased by 22% in February compared to January, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi reported on March 10, underscoring the importance of unmanned systems on the battlefield. The commander noted that first-person-view (FPV) drones and multi-rotor bombers remain the most effective tools. &quot;Unmanned systems have become one of the most important elements of warfare that save the lives of our soldiers,&quot; Syrskyi said after a monthly meeting on drone development. He stressed the need to introduce a unified standard for unmanned systems in Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces to improve coordination between units. Syrskyi also warned that Russia is rapidly adapting to Ukraine&#x2019;s drone warfare strategies and developing its own technologies, including fiber-optic-controlled drones. &quot;We have no right to lag behind... (Russia) in the technological war and must strengthen ourselves at the expense of our own resources,&quot; he added. Kyiv has significantly expanded domestic drone production over the past year, integrating drones into reconnaissance and combat operations. On Feb. 9, the Defense Ministry launched the &quot;Drone Line&quot; initiative to accelerate their deployment on the battlefield. Ukraine has also developed long-range missile-drone hybrids, such as the Palianytsia and Peklo models, featuring turbojet engines as alternatives to cruise missiles. President Volodymyr Zelensky has set a target of producing at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-drones-february/	2025-03-10T04:14:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2171705016.jpg
US officially closes 83% of USAID programs	The U.S. has officially canceled 83% of U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs, with the roughly 1,000 remaining contracts to be administered by the State Department, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 10. The decision to cancel 5,200 USAID contracts comes after a six-week review of the U.S.&apos;s top foreign aid agency, which the Trump administration accused of waste, fraud, and pushing a &quot;liberal agenda.&quot; Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support to Kyiv. The agency has funded school reconstruction, bomb shelters, critical energy repairs, and civil society initiatives. Elon Musk, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s ally who supposedly oversees the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has led the charge against USAID, laying off staff and attacking the agency in public, often making baseless or false claims about its work. Rubio thanked DOGE for &quot;this overdue and historic reform,&quot; claiming that the aborted contracts have &quot;spent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States.&quot; He did not provide any examples of how USAID programs endangered U.S. interests. The cuts are nevertheless smaller than indicated by a statement from the Trump administration last month, which talked about slashing 90% of all contracts. USAID cuts mark a significant realignment of U.S. foreign policy, which saw the Trump administration adopt increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Ukraine and other partners while seeking to renew ties with Moscow. The mass cancelation of USAID contracts also threatens various Ukrainian organizations and projects across multiple sectors, including energy, education, media, and humanitarian support.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-officially-closes-83-of-usaid-programs/	2025-03-10T03:36:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197486320.jpg
Ukraine arrests Kharkiv resident suspected of bombing, poisoning plot on Russia's behalf	Ukrainian security forces have detained a suspected agent of Russian intelligence who allegedly orchestrated an explosion near a war veteran&#x2019;s home and poisoned a soldier under the guise of providing volunteer aid, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reported on March 10. According to the investigation, the suspect, an IT specialist from Kharkiv, was recruited by Russian intelligence services and tasked with assembling improvised explosive devices (IEDs) containing metal fragments to maximize casualties. She allegedly hid one of the devices in a designated cache, where an accomplice retrieved it and placed it near the home of a Ukrainian army veteran. The explosion injured the veteran, who was later hospitalized. The SBU also accused the woman of poisoning a soldier by lacing food and medicine with toxic substances while posing as a volunteer. The serviceman was hospitalized and is in serious condition. Investigators believe Russian intelligence operatives first approached the suspect before the full-scale invasion when she was visiting relatives in Russia. By early 2025, she was receiving direct instructions from her handlers, the SBU said. Authorities are now investigating her potential involvement in other crimes. The court has ordered her detention without bail while the case proceeds.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-arrest-suspected-russian-agent-in-kharkiv-over-bombing-poisoning-plot/	2025-03-10T03:10:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/c0b50b27d0cf14e59599c06e8af88ab2.jpeg
EU prepares for possible Hungarian veto on Russia sanctions extension, media reports	The European Union is bracing for a potential Hungarian veto on extending sanctions against Russia, which are set to expire on March 15, Euractiv reported on March 10, citing undisclosed sources. EU diplomats were reportedly surprised that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban did not attempt to block the conclusions of the March 6 European Council meeting on Ukraine. The Hungarian prime minister declined to sign the summit&apos;s declaration in support of Ukraine, but the document was nevertheless published with the endorsement of 26 member states. Orban, widely regarded as the EU&apos;s most pro-Russian leader, has repeatedly opposed military aid for Ukraine and warned that Ukraine&apos;s EU membership would &quot;destroy&quot; Hungary. He has maintained ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin despite Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, amplifying Kremlin narratives in Europe. Diplomats suspect Orban&#x2019;s restraint at the summit was linked to the upcoming renewal of EU sanctions on Russia, which require unanimous approval from all 27 member states, Euractiv reported. The Hungarian prime minister has a history of leveraging EU decision-making to extract concessions. He has previously secured exemptions for Russian Patriarch Kirill and the domestic use of Russian oil products. Patriarch Kirill, a Kremlin ally and head of the Russian Orthodox Church, has openly supported Russia&#x2019;s war, yet Budapest has repeatedly blocked EU efforts to sanction him. The EU&apos;s sanctions framework includes economic measures and a list of over 2,400 individuals and entities subject to asset freezes and travel bans. If Hungary blocks the renewal, it could force the EU to negotiate additional compromises or risk a lapse in sanctions enforcement.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-prepares-for-possible-hungarian-veto-on-russia-sanctions-extension-media-reports/	2025-03-10T03:02:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2097682027.jpg
Come to Bucha, JD Vance	During a heated exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, U.S. Vice President JD Vance accused the Ukrainian president of leading &#x201C;propaganda tours&#x201D; of Russia&#x2019;s destruction in the country. Zelensky, in turn, asked Vance if he had ever been to Ukraine. Of course, Vance&#x2019;s criticism of Ukraine is not new. In a New York Times op-ed released in April 2024, Vance argued that America shouldn&#x2019;t help Ukraine, citing the burden of producing weapon systems like 155 mm shells and Patriot missiles. He suggested that the U.S. should pressure Ukraine to surrender territory it has lost to Russia and claimed that supporting Ukraine &#x201C;doesn&#x2019;t add up.&#x201D; Before Vance makes further assumptions and jeopardizes diplomatic relations with Ukraine, I&#x2019;m pleading &#x2014; with all due respect, as a fellow Ohioan &#x2014; for him to do what I did: travel to Ukraine and visit the town of Bucha, located in the suburbs of Kyiv. Bucha is the site of some of the first war crimes committed by the Russian army in Ukraine, uncovered in the initial months of the full-scale war. Seeing Bucha will help Vance understand that this war is about more than just territory; it&#x2019;s a war between good and evil. I&#x2019;m not an aid worker or foreign fighter. My visit to Ukraine was personal. In the early 2000s, as a record executive for Universal Music Group, I helped develop Ukraine&#x2019;s music industry. In May 2023, after more than a year of full-scale war, I traveled to Kyiv to check on my colleagues. I took the Kyiv Express, a 17-hour train from Warsaw to Kyiv. I saw destruction everywhere: bombed-out apartment buildings, malls, and machine gun-riddled cars and homes. Even a statue of the poet Taras Shevchenko had been shot up in the Borodianka town square. One of my colleagues offered to bring me to Bucha. Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw. I visited the site where mass graves were uncovered behind the local church. I spoke with an elderly church worker who survived the massacre by hiding in the basement for days. Listening to her terrifying account and seeing the destruction firsthand made it clear to me: this is a war of good versus evil. Bodies of civilians are seen in Bucha, Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine, on April 2, 2022, after the Russian army&apos;s retreat from the city amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine.

(Ronaldo Schemidt / AFP via Getty Images)Bucha is one of many reasons why Ukraine cannot simply surrender territory to Russia. The war crimes uncovered in Bucha were revealed only after the Russian army was driven out, three months after its occupation. In the territories Vance wants to hand over to Russia, war crimes have been committed daily for over two years &#x2014; including torture, executions, and the kidnapping of children. By suggesting America should pull back from helping Ukraine, Vance risks ignoring these atrocities. As a loyal Republican, Vance would do well to look to former U.S. President Ronald Reagan for inspiration. Reagan confronted evil with steely determination, resulting in the end of the Cold War. For Reagan, American values justified confronting the Soviet Union &#x2014; not excuses like production problems in weapons factories. Reagan, who loved Ohio and won the state&#x2019;s presidential election twice, understood the crucial role Ohio&#x2019;s military bases and weapons manufacturing played in the Cold War. But if Reagan were here today, I believe he would strongly disagree with Vance&#x2019;s policy of weakness. As a fellow Ohioan, I don&#x2019;t understand Vance&#x2019;s weak view of America. I grew up on a family farm in central Ohio, but we were both raised with the same Midwestern values &#x2014; to support good and confront evil. And what the Russian army is doing in Ukraine is among the greatest evils of this century. Both of us learned about Ohio&#x2019;s greatest figures in public schools, from abolitionists Harriet Beecher Stowe and Sojourner Truth to astronauts John Glenn and Neil Armstrong &#x2014; individuals who demonstrated courage and bravery. Most of Vance&#x2019;s constituents in Ohio support Ukraine. The Midwest is the heartland, and Ohioans consider ourselves the heart of America. What happened to your heart, Vance? Come to Bucha, Vance. You may find it there.

Russia expels 2 British diplomats, accuses them of espionage	Russia said on March 10 it had stripped the accreditation of two British nationals linked to the U.K. Embassy in Moscow, accusing them of espionage and &quot;subversive&quot; activities and ordering them to leave within two weeks. The move comes as the latest tit-for-tat move in a diplomatic row between London and Moscow. Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed it had &quot;identified signs of intelligence and subversive work&quot; by a second secretary of the British Embassy in Moscow and the spouse of another British diplomat. The FSB did not provide evidence to support the claims nor revealed further details of the diplomats&apos; alleged activities. The British Embassy denied the allegations as &quot;completely baseless,&quot; independent outlet Meduza reported, citing the Embassy&apos;s spokesperson. The U.K. previously expelled a Russian diplomat in February, while Moscow threw out six U.K. Embassy staff members in September 2024. Tensions between Russia and the U.K. have been mounting since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and London threw its military and political backing behind Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-expels-2-brits-accuses-them-of-espionage/	2025-03-10T02:43:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2170878445.jpg
No US-Russia meetings planned this week, Moscow says, denying media claims	No U.S.-Russia meetings will take place this week, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told Russian state-owned news agency TASS on March 10, disputing claims in the media. &quot;(A meeting) is not planned. Moreover, we received no information from the American side,&quot; Zakharova said in response to a journalist&apos;s question. This comes as CNN reported, citing a source, that the U.S. will hold separate meetings with Ukrainian and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia this week. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. The possible meeting would follow previous rounds of U.S.-Russia talks in Riyadh on Feb. 18 and Istanbul on Feb. 27. The news came amid U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s push for a swift settlement to the war, raising concerns that Washington is sidelining Ukraine and European allies in the process. Ukrainian and U.S. delegations are set to meet in Jeddah on March 11 to discuss a potential peace agreement with Russia and negotiations on a critical minerals deal. U.S. officials will reportedly assess Ukraine&#x2019;s willingness to mend ties with Washington following a contentious Oval Office exchange between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28. The fallout from that meeting led to the suspension of all U.S. military aid to Ukraine, worth billions, and a halt in intelligence sharing, potentially hampering Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to detect Russian missile strikes and conduct long-range attacks. The Financial Times reported that Ukraine is expected to push for the restoration of U.S. military and intelligence support at the March 11 meeting. As part of its negotiating position, Kyiv is reportedly prepared to propose a partial ceasefire covering long-range drone and missile strikes, as well as hostilities in the Black Sea, in hopes of securing renewed U.S. backing. Trump told reporters on March 9 that he expects Ukraine to sign the long-debated critical minerals deal with the U.S. but also wants to see indications that Kyiv is prepared for peace. Zelensky and European leaders have repeatedly stressed that security guarantees, including long-term U.S. support, must accompany any ceasefire agreement. Washington has yet to provide such assurances. Following his meeting with Trump, Zelensky reaffirmed Ukraine&#x2019;s commitment to working with the U.S. toward a negotiated settlement.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-us-meeting/	2025-03-10T02:11:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1237721878.jpg
Ukraine, German arms maker seek to triple IRIS-T air defense supply	Ukraine has signed a memorandum with German defense manufacturer Diehl Defense to triple the supply of IRIS-T air defense systems and missiles, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on March 9. The deal comes as Ukraine faces intensified Russian aerial assaults, including Russia&#x2019;s strike on Feb. 23, which marked the single largest drone attack since the start of the full-scale invasion. &quot;The signed agreement paves the way for large industrial projects that will strengthen the capabilities of Ukraine&apos;s air defense,&quot; Umerov wrote on Facebook. The IRIS-T is a modern surface-to-air missile system capable of countering aircraft, helicopters, drones, and cruise missiles. Germany has been a key supplier of the system, with outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announcing an order for 17 additional IRIS-T systems for Ukraine last September. In late December, President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed that Ukraine had received Germany&#x2019;s sixth IRIS-T battery.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-diehl-defense-sign-deal/	2025-03-10T01:12:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1241457826.jpeg
6 killed, 22 injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over past day	At least six people were killed and 22 others injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over the past day, regional officials reported on March 10. Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force said it had intercepted 130 of the 176 Russian drones launched overnight, including Shahed-type attack drones. Another 42 drones reportedly disappeared from radars before reaching their targets, indicating they were likely decoys meant to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defenses. Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare systems, aviation, and mobile fire groups repelled the attack. In Donetsk Oblast, three civilians were killed &#x2014; two in Pokrovsk and one in Zoria. Six others were wounded, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. Three more civilians &#x2014; a woman and two men &#x2014; were killed in Kharkiv Oblast by an explosive device dropped from a Russian drone, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Another woman was injured in the attack. In Kherson Oblast, nine people were injured, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a 56-year-old woman was hospitalized and is in moderate condition as a result of a Russian attack, and an 18-year-old girl was treated at the scene, Governor Serhii Lysak said. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, a 16-year-old boy and two men, aged 65 and 67, were wounded. A 79-year-old woman was also injured in an artillery strike, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-over-past-day-2/	2025-03-10T00:29:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-10_05-31-36.jpg

Half of global population descended from ancient group in what is now Ukraine, DNA research shows	Half of the human beings alive today are descended from the Yamnaya culture, a group that lived in what is now Ukraine 5,000 years ago, according to new DNA research led by David Reich, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School, the Wall Street Journal reported on March 8. Around 4 billion people can trace their ancestry to the Yamnaya, a community of cattle herders who lived in the areas that make up the modern-day Ukraine and expanded dramatically across Europe and Asia, the research shows. Researchers identified the village of Mykhailivka, lying in the Russian-occupied part of Kherson Oblast, as the genetic birthplace of the Indo-European peoples who spread across the European continent and West Asia in waves of migrations. The equestrian culture, dubbed Yamnaya after the pits (yama in Ukrainian and Russian) in which they buried their dead beneath mounds called kurgans, is seen as a shared ancestor to various ancient peoples, including the Romans, Celts, Persians, and Macedonians. The new DNA research analyzed remains of 450 prehistoric individuals from 100 sites across Europe and 1,000 previously known ancient samples, reinforcing earlier theories on the spread of the Yamnaya culture based on archeological and linguistic evidence. The ongoing Russian occupation of the Yamnaya culture&apos;s cradle undercores the damage wrought to Ukraine&apos;s cultural heritage by Moscow&apos;s war. As of February, 485 Ukrainian cultural sites have been confirmed as damaged during the war, including two archeological sites. Russia has also consistently looted Ukrainian artifacts from Crimea, Donbas, and elsewhere since 2014, transporting many to Russian museums.	https://kyivindependent.com/half-global-population-descended-from-ancient-group-who-lived-in-ukraine-new-dna-research-shows/	2025-03-10T00:20:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1437004229.jpg
Ukraine to push for resumption of US military, intelligence support at Saudi talks, FT reports	Ukrainian officials will push for the resumption of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing at upcoming talks in Saudi Arabia, the Financial Times reported on March 9, citing its undisclosed sources. Ukrainian and U.S. delegations are set to meet in Jeddah on March 11 to discuss a potential peace agreement with Russia and negotiations on a critical minerals deal. As part of its strategy, Kyiv is reportedly prepared to propose a partial ceasefire covering long-range drone and missile strikes, as well as hostilities in the Black Sea, in hopes that progress in talks will prompt Washington to lift its freeze on military and intelligence support. Following President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s heated meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, Washington suspended all military aid to Ukraine, worth billions. CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed on March 5 that the U.S. had also halted intelligence sharing, potentially limiting Ukraine&apos;s ability to detect Russian missile strikes and carry out long-range attacks. Two European officials told the FT that Ukraine views making progress in ceasefire talks as a necessary step to regaining U.S. support. A U.S. official told Reuters that the Jeddah meeting will serve as a test of Ukraine&#x2019;s willingness to make concessions to Russia in pursuit of a peace deal. Trump told reporters on March 9 that he expects Ukraine to sign the critical minerals deal with the U.S. but also wants to see signals that Kyiv is prepared for peace. Zelensky and European leaders have repeatedly emphasized that security guarantees, including long-term U.S. support, must accompany any ceasefire agreement. Washington has not offered such assurances. Following his Oval Office meeting with Trump, Zelensky struck a conciliatory tone, reaffirming Ukraine&#x2019;s commitment to working with the U.S. toward a peace agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-push-for-resumption-of-us-military-aid-intelligence-sharing-at-saudi-talks-ft-reports/	2025-03-09T23:50:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1494251171-1.jpeg
Drones reportedly attack 'one of 10 largest' Russian oil refineries	Drones attacked the Novokuybyshevsk oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Samara Oblast overnight on March 10, the independent Telegram channel Astra and a Ukrainian official claimed. Ukraine has systematically targeted Russian oil refineries, military sites, and warehouses deep behind the front lines to undermine Moscow&apos;s capacity to wage its all-out war. Samara Oblast residents reported loud explosions overnight, Astra wrote, adding that a fire was recorded at the Rosneft-run oil facility. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. The refinery&apos;s &quot;capacity amounts to 8.8 million metric tons of oil per year, making it one of the 10 largest (refineries) in Russia,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. The plant produces gasoline, diesel fuel, and fuel oil, &quot;which are critically important for transport and military equipment,&quot; the official added. The city of Novokuybyshevsk lies roughly 900 kilometers (560 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. &quot;This refinery is strategically important for the Russian military as it ensures a stable fuel supply for military operations,&quot; Kovalenko said. The Russian pro-state agency RBC reported a fire at a warehouse in Novokuybyshevsk that covered an area of 1,500 square meters later the same day, without mentioning a drone attack. No casualties were reported. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its forces had shot down nine Ukrainian drones overnight, including three over Samara Oblast, two each over the Voronezh and Oryol oblasts, and one each over the Belgorod and Kursk oblasts. On March 9, a Ukrainian drone reportedly attacked an oil depot in Cheboksary in Russia&apos;s Chuvashia Republic, marking the first strike against the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-reportedly-attack-russian-refinery-in-samara-oblast/	2025-03-09T23:33:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-630457640.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 886,320 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 886,320 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on March 10. This number includes 1,190 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,292 tanks, 21,400 armored fighting vehicles, 40,071 vehicles and fuel tanks, 24,271 artillery systems, 1,311 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,102 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 28,603 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-885-130-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022-2/	2025-03-09T23:13:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1258556806.jpeg
Lammy vows to unfreeze billions for Ukraine from Russian oligarch's Chelsea FC sale	U.K. Foreign Minister David Lammy vowed on March 9 to unfreeze billions of dollars of revenue earned from Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich&apos;s sale of the Chelsea Football Club (FC) and send the funds to Ukraine. Abramovich was forced to sell Chelsea FC once sanctions were enacted against him following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Abramovich and U.K. officials previously promised the funds from the sale would go to Ukraine. &quot;I&apos;m frustrated that it hasn&apos;t happened, is the truth &#x2014; and that money needs to be distributed, it needs to be used,&quot; Lammy told the Financial Times (FT) on March 9. 2.3 billion pounds ($2.97 billion) are currently frozen in a U.K. dedicated trust as officials decide how to obtain and utilize the funds. &quot;I&apos;m determined to see that money get out the door and to do all I can to bring that about,&quot; Lammy said. There are legal complexities, but Lammy said his &quot;first instinct is not litigation&quot; because of how long it could take. The U.K. government previously reported that the funds intended to help Ukraine remained in limbo due to a disagreement between U.K. officials and Abramovich. Ukraine&apos;s European allies are rushing to increase support following a military aid pause from the U.S. The U.K. has promised to deliver more military aid to Kyiv this year than ever before.	https://kyivindependent.com/lammy-vows-to-unfreeze-billions-for-ukraine-from-formerly-oligarch-owned-chelsea-fc/	2025-03-09T21:57:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2197755073.jpg
US to assess if Ukraine ready for 'realistic peace' at upcoming meeting, Reuters reports	The U.S. delegation that is set to meet with its Ukrainian counterpart on March 11 will assess if Ukraine is ready for a &quot;realistic peace,&quot; Reuters reported on March 10, citing unnamed officials. Ukrainians and U.S. officials will meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to discuss the framework of a peace agreement with Russia and continue talks on a critical minerals deal. The U.S. delegation will reportedly be looking for hints Ukraine is committed to improving ties with Washington following a heated argument between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 28. &quot;We want to see if the Ukrainians are interested not just in peace, but in a realistic peace,&quot; an unnamed U.S. official said. As part of their assessment, U.S. officials want to see whether or not Ukraine is ready to make concessions to Russia in order to end the war. &quot;You can&apos;t say &apos;I want peace,&apos; and, &apos;I refuse to compromise on anything,&apos;&quot; an unnamed official said. &quot;If they are only interested in 2014 or 2022 borders, that tells you something,&quot; another official said. Earlier on March 9, NBC News reported that the Trump administration did not plan to resume intelligence sharing and providing military aid until Zelensky indicated he was willing to make territorial concessions to Russia as part of a peace deal. The U.S. froze military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine in the days following the Oval Office clash. Trump told reporters on March 9 that the U.S. was &quot;just about&quot; to lift the pause on intelligence sharing. He also said he was optimistic about the Saudi Arabia talks. &quot;We&apos;re going to make a lot of progress, I believe, this week,&quot; he said. The delegation will be led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Trump&apos;s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. The officials previously met with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. The two sides discussed restoring bilateral relations and held preliminary peace talks without Ukraine&apos;s participation.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-will-assess-if-ukraine-ready-for-realistic-peace-at-upcoming-meeting-reuters-reports/	2025-03-09T20:44:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199704911.jpg
JD Vance's cousin, former volunteer fighter in Ukraine, condemns VP's 'ambush' of Zelensky	Nate Vance, the cousin of U.S. Vice President JD Vance and a volunteer fighting on Ukraine&apos;s front lines, said he is &quot;disappointed&quot; in his relative&apos;s stance on Ukraine. Vance, a former U.S. Marine, defended Ukraine from 2022 to January 2025 as a member of the Da Vinci Wolves First Motorized Battalion, a volunteer unit. &quot;Being your family doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m going to accept you killing my comrades,&quot; Vance said in an interview with Le Figaro published on March 9. Vance&apos;s remarks come at a low point in U.S.-Ukrainian relations, as Washington has halted intelligence sharing and military aid to Kyiv. The freeze followed a contentious meeting in the Oval Office between U.S. President Donald Trump, Vice President Vance, and President Volodymyr Zelensky. &#xA0; Nate Vance said he was disappointed in how his cousin treated Zelensky during the meeting. &quot;When (JD Vance) criticized aid to Ukraine, I thought it was because he needed to appeal to his electorate, that it was part of the political game,&quot; Vance said. &quot;But what they did to Zelensky was an ambush of absolute dishonesty.&quot; The vice president&apos;s continued distrust of Zelensky is unjustified, as are his views on Ukraine, Vance said. &quot;I thought I was going to choke ... His own cousin was on the front lines. I could have told him the truth, without pretense, without personal interest. He never tried to find out more.&quot; Vance said he tried to get in touch with his cousin several times with no success. &quot;I left messages at his office. I never heard from him,&quot; he said. Vance volunteered to fight in Ukraine following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, but left shortly before the U.S. presidential inauguration out of fear of being captured by the Russian army. &quot;It had become complicated to stay. I couldn&apos;t take the risk of being captured,&quot; he said. JD Vance has criticized Ukraine and Zelensky in the past, at times repeating Kremlin talking points. Protestors confronted the vice president for his treatment of Zelensky on several occasions following the Feb. 28 meeting.	https://kyivindependent.com/cousin-of-jd-vance-decries-vps-stance-on-ukraine/	2025-03-09T20:12:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201826980.jpg
US has 'just about' lifted pause on intelligence sharing with Ukraine, Trump tells media	The United States has &quot;just about&quot; ended its freeze on intelligence sharing with Kyiv, U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on March 9. CIA Director John Ratcliffe announced on March 5 that the U.S. had halted intelligence sharing with Ukraine, amid the fallout of the White House argument between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The move followed Washington&apos;s decision to immediately freeze all military aid to Ukraine. According to Reuters, when asked whether the U.S. would end the suspension of intelligence sharing, Trump told reporters, &quot;We just about have. We just about have.&quot; Trump also said he was optimistic about the upcoming talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia. Delegations will meet in the city of Jeddah on March 11 to discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. The meeting comes at a low point in U.S.-Ukrainian relations, with Washington exerting enormous pressure on Kyiv to accept a peace deal regardless of security guarantees. The pause on intelligence sharing has left Ukraine&apos;s civilians more vulnerable to deadly Russian aerial attacks. The New York Times (NYT) reported on March 6 that the freeze could affect crucial warnings about incoming Russian drones and missiles. In the days after the freeze went into effect, Russia carried out missile attacks on the cities of Kryvyi Rih and Dopropillia, killing 15 people and injuring over 80. According to Zelensky, Russia launched nearly 1,200 aerial bombs, almost 870 attack drones, and over 80 missiles at Ukraine over the past week. &#xA0; The U.S. has not indicated when it will resume sharing intelligence or providing military aid. The Saudi Arabia talks will be an opportunity for the U.S. to assess Ukraine&apos;s readiness to make concessions to Russia in order to advance a peace deal, U.S. officials told Reuters. Trump told reporters on March 9 that he believes Ukraine will sign a deal on critical minerals with the U.S., but that he also wants to see indications that Kyiv is ready for peace. &quot;They will sign the minerals deal but I want them to want peace ... They haven&apos;t shown it to extent they should,&quot; he said. Zelensky and European leaders have repeatedly stressed the importance of security guarantees backed by U.S. support to ensure the success of any future ceasefire agreement with Russia. The U.S. has not offered to provide any such assurances. In a conciliatory statement issued after the Oval Office meeting, Zelensky reiterated his willingness to work with the U.S. towards a peace agreement. &quot;Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-has-just-about-lifted-pause-on-intelligence-sharing-with-ukraine-trump-tells-media/	2025-03-09T19:34:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203694542.jpg
Ditching Ukraine would 'be worse than Afghanistan,' Republican senator says	The U.S. cannot cut off aid to Ukraine while it fights against Russia, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on March 9. The U.S. froze intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine soon after a heated argument broke out between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House on Feb. 28. U.S. officials have suggested the pause is &quot;temporary,&quot; without indicating when aid will resume. &quot;If we pull the plug on Ukraine, it&apos;d be worse than Afghanistan. I don&apos;t think (Trump) has any desire to do that,&quot; Graham said in a television interview on March 9. Until a ceasefire is reached, the U.S. must continue to assist Ukraine with military aid and intelligence sharing, the U.S. Senator continued. &quot;I am worried about cutting off intelligence and weapons to Ukraine as long as the fighting is going on,&quot; Graham said. The U.S. senator added he will introduce legislation to sanction Russia&apos;s banking and energy sectors &quot;next week&quot; in a bid to bring Moscow to the negotiating table. &quot;If they don&apos;t engage in ceasefire and peace talks with the administration, we should sanction the hell out of them,&quot; Graham said. Trump previously claimed he is considering imposing extensive tariffs and banking sanctions on Russia until a peace agreement is reached. &quot;Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely &apos;pounding&apos; Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large-scale banking sanctions, sanctions, and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and final settlement agreement on peace is reached,&quot; Trump said on March 7. Trump&apos;s administration has faced scrutiny for its mounting hostility towards Ukraine, a longstanding ally, alongside increasingly friendly attitudes toward Russia. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/ditching-ukraine-would-be-worse-than-afghanistan-us-senator-says/	2025-03-09T18:10:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1838188594.jpg
Ukraine 'may not survive,' Trump says	Ukraine &quot;may not survive&quot; Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion with or without American support, U.S. President Donald Trump told the right-wing media outlet Fox News in an interview on March 9. Trump&apos;s administration has faced scrutiny for its decision to stop providing critical military aid and intelligence to Kyiv &#x2014; a move that has been celebrated by the Kremlin. Fox News correspondent Maria Bartiromo questioned Trump about a statement from Polish President Andrezj Duda, who said in a previous interview with Fox that Ukraine would not survive without U.S. support. &quot;Are you comfortable with that? The fact that you walked away, and Ukraine may not survive?&quot; Bartiromo asked. &quot;Well, it may not survive anyway,&quot; Trump said. Trump then pivoted to his preferred talking points on the war in Ukraine &#x2014;&#xA0;the failures of former U.S. President Joe Biden, and Trump&apos;s belief that the war would not have started if he had won the 2020 presidential election. In the same interview, Trump accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of not being grateful for American assistance and claimed that he&apos;d been &quot;tougher&quot; on Russia &quot;than anybody&apos;s ever been.&quot; &#xA0; Trump did not directly address his decision to freeze military aid, nor did he say when or under what conditions the U.S. might resume weapons shipments. The decision to halt aid and intelligence sharing came immediately after the collapse of a natural resources deal between the U.S. and Ukraine, something the White House has touted as an essential way for the U.S. to &quot;recoup&quot; the money it has sent Kyiv throughout the full-scale war. While negotiations have resumed, NBC News reported earlier on March 9 that Trump will not unfreeze military aid even if the deal goes through. Trump wants to see a change in Zelensky&apos;s stance toward peace talks and a willingness to make territorial concessions to Russia, senior officials said. U.S. and Ukrainian delegations are planning to meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 to discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz suggested on March 5 that Trump may lift the pause on military aid once peace negotiations are arranged and confidence-building measures are taken, Reuters reported. Despite its insistence on forging a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, Washington has not agreed to provide Kyiv with any security guarantees following a potential ceasefire. Trump has also previously expressed ambivalence regarding Ukraine&apos;s ongoing sovereignty. In a Feb. 10 interview with Fox News, he said Ukraine &quot;may be Russian someday.&quot; &#xA0;Trump stressed that no matter the war&apos;s outcome, the U.S. wants its money back.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-may-not-survive-trump-says/	2025-03-09T17:47:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201520423.jpg
Nobody has been tougher on Russia,' Trump says	&quot;Nobody has been tougher on Russia,&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump told Fox News on March 9, in repsonse to criticisms that his administration has been friendly to the Kremlin. Trump&apos;s claim comes amid a U.S. freeze on intelligence sharing and military aid to Kyiv, as the full-scale war enters its fourth year and Russian forces intensify their assaults in eastern Ukraine. &quot;I think I&apos;ve been very tough to Russia,&quot; Trump told the right-wing media outlet Fox News in an interview. &quot;Tougher than anybody&apos;s ever been to Russia, if you think about it.&quot; Instead of responding to the current freeze on aid to Kyiv or Washington&apos;s apparent support of Russian demands, Trump focused on his actions during his first term as president. In particular, he repeated his claim that he &quot;stopped&quot; Russia&apos;s construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. During his first term, Trump signed off on a Congressional measure imposing sanctions against any businesses that contributed to the completion of the undersea pipeline, built to funnel Russian gas into Europe. &#xA0; &quot;I&apos;m the one that put sanctions on Russia,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I&apos;m the one that gave the javelins against Russia. I&apos;ve been very tough.&quot; Trump had little to say about the present state of affairs between the U.S., Russia, and Ukraine, though earlier in the interview he accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of not being grateful to the U.S. When asked if he was comfortable with risking Ukraine&apos;s very survival by withdrawing U.S. support, Trump did not give a firm answer. &quot;It may not survive anyway,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/nobody-has-been-tougher-on-russia-trump-says/	2025-03-09T17:03:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Trump.png
Starlink will 'never' shut off its terminals in Ukraine, Musk says	Starlink will never shut off its satellite internet terminals in Ukraine, U.S. billionaire Elon Musk said in a post to social media on March 9. Previously, European officials voiced concern Starlink could cut off Ukraine&apos;s access to its internet service, which is crucial to the war effort. Musk and top White House officials clashed with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski over the legitimacy of such concerns earlier on March 9. &quot;To be extremely clear, no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals,&quot; Musk said in a post to his social media platform, X. Ukraine&apos;s front line would collapse if it were not for Starlink internet access, Musk claimed, saying that the Russian army can &quot;jam&quot; all other forms of communication. &quot;We would never do such a thing or use it as a bargaining chip,&quot; the tech billionaire said. Poland will look for alternative suppliers if SpaceX turns out to be an unreliable provider of Starlink satellite internet for Ukraine, Sikorski said earlier in the day. His remarks drew swift criticism from Musk and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Sikorski should &quot;say thank you because without Starlink, Ukraine would have lost this war long ago and Russians would be on the border with Poland right now,&quot; Rubio said. &quot;Be quiet, small man. You pay a tiny fraction of the cost,&quot; Musk added to Rubio&apos;s remarks. Poland provides half of Ukraine&apos;s total 42,000 Starlinkk terminals, at a cost of about $50 million per year, according to Sikorski. Fears that Ukraine could lose Starlink access arose after Reuters reported on Feb. 21 that the U.S. had threatened to cut off service if Kyiv did not sign a deal on critical natural resources.

Zelensky not grateful for US aid, Trump claims	U.S. President Donald Trump accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of being ungrateful for American military assistance in an interview with Fox News on March 9. Washington stopped providing military aid and intelligence to Kyiv in the wake of a contentious White House meeting on Feb. 28, during which Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance berated Zelensky for not sufficiently thanking the United States. In an interview with the conservative media outlet Fox News, Trump again lambasted Zelensky&apos;s supposed lack of gratitude and blamed former U.S. President Joe Biden for liberally dispensing funds to Ukraine following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;(Zelensky) took money out of this country under Biden like candy from a baby,&quot; Trump claimed. &quot;It was so easy. With that same attitude. I just don&apos;t think he&apos;s grateful.&quot; Trump did not say whether or not he would resume U.S. military aid to Ukraine. U.S. officials, including a senior member of the Trump administration, reportedly told NBC News that Trump does not plan to resume aid and intelligence sharing, even if Kyiv and Washington sign a deal on critical minerals. Trump wants to see a change in Zelensky&apos;s approach to peace talks with Russia and a willingness to make concessions &#xA0;&#x2014;&#xA0;including surrendering Russian-occupied territories to Moscow, officials said. Following the Oval Office confrontation and military aid freeze, Zelensky issued a statement expressing his readiness to participate in peace negotiations and &quot;work under President Trump&apos;s strong leadership.&quot; U.S. and Ukrainian delegations are planning to meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 to discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. An agreement betweenthe U.S. and Ukraine on natural resources remains stalled as Trump seeks a &quot;bigger, better deal,&quot; CBS News reported on March 4. In the meantime, the pause on U.S. intelligence sharing has left Ukrainian cities more vulnerable to Russian aerial strikes. The New York Times (NYT) reported on March 6 that the freeze could affect crucial warnings about incoming Russian drones and missiles. In the week following the freeze, Russia has launched deadly missile strikes on Kryvyi Rih and Dopropillia, killing 15 people and injuring over 80.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-not-grateful-for-us-aid-trump-claims/	2025-03-09T15:52:26-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203672195.jpg
Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh wins gold at European Athletics Indoor Championships	Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh claimed the gold medal at the European Athletics Indoor Championships in Apeldoorn, Netherlands, on March 9. Mahuchikh won the competition by clearing 1.99 meters, Suspilne reported. The 23-year-old high jumper won gold at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games in the women&apos;s high jump event following a jump of 2.00 meters on Aug. 4. Mahuchikh, originally from Dnipro, currently holds the world record for women&apos;s high jump at 2.10 meters and was named world champion in the event in August 2023. She also took home the title of Europe&#x2019;s women&apos;s Athlete of the Year at the 2024 European Athletics Golden Tracks Awards ceremony. On March 8, 23-year-old Oleh Doroshchuk also won gold in the men&#x2019;s high jump division of the same competition, by clearing 2.32 meters.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-high-jumper-yaroslava-mahuchikh-wins-gold-at-european-athletics-indoor-championships/	2025-03-09T14:51:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164919585.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Trump won't resume Ukraine military aid after signing minerals deal; Kursk situation 'difficult but under control'	Key developments on March 8-9: U.S. President Donald Trump has privately made it clear to his aides that he will not resume providing military aid and intelligence to Ukraine even if Kyiv and Washington sign a minerals deal, NBC News reported on March 9, citing an unnamed Trump administration official and another American official. U.S. and Ukrainian delegations are planning to meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 to discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. Trump wants to see a change in President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s stance toward peace talks with Russia and a willingness to make concessions such as giving up occupied territories to Russia, the sources told NBC News. The U.S. president also reportedly wants Zelensky to make some steps toward elections in Ukraine and possibly step down. The news comes amid rising tensions between Ukraine and the U.S., as Trump escalates pressure on Zelensky to expedite a peace process. The tensions culminated in a confrontation during a meeting in the White House Oval Office on Feb. 28 after Zelensky had flown to the U.S. to sign a minerals agreement with the U.S. After being insulted by Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, Zelensky returned to Ukraine without signing the deal. Since that meeting, Washington has halted its military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. Previously, Trump called Zelensky a &quot;dictator,&quot; echoing Russian narratives about the democratically elected Ukrainian leader&apos;s legitimacy. Elections are banned in Ukraine during martial law, which has been in force since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Politico reported that Trump&apos;s team has been leading secret talks with former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko and another opposition leader, Yuliia Tymoshenko. The two opposition leaders reportedly tried to position themselves as more flexible partners for the U.S. than Zelensky. Following the Oval Office clash, Zelensky&apos;s approval rating has risen to 68%, according to a poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology published on March 7. Ukrainian troops had repelled an attack by Russian sabotage and assault groups that used a gas pipeline to gain a foothold on the outskirts of Sudzha in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on March 8, releasing footage of the engagement. The announcement came amid reports that Russian forces had made a breakthrough south of the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha and tried to breach the Russia-Ukraine border in Sumy Oblast earlier this week. Ukrainian troops fighting in Kurks Oblast told the Kyiv Independent on March 7 that Russia had destroyed their supply chains for ammunition and food, and they faced encirclement. After Ukrainian airborne assault troops spotted the Russian forces, they launched missile, artillery, and drones to stop the assault, the General Staff said. &quot;At the moment, Russian special forces are being detected, blocked and destroyed. Enemy losses in the Sudzha area are very heavy,&quot; the military claimed on the evening of March 8. 0:00/1:301&#xD7;The footage shared on March 8, 2025, purporting to show Ukrainian forces repelling a Russian attack in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast (Ukraine&apos;s Air Assault Forces/Telegram) Ukrainian troops repelled 44 Russian attacks in Kursk Oblast over the past day, the General Staff said in its latest update on March 9. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The press service for Kursk military command told the Kyiv Independent on March 8 that &quot;the most large-scale&quot; Russian assault operations have occurred in the direction from the settlement of Korenevo toward Sudzha, as well as in the areas of Novoivanovka, Malaya Loknya, and south of Sudzha. The Ukrainian military described the situation as &quot;difficult&quot; but under control, saying that Russia involved North Korean soldiers in the attack. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, the Russian military claimed. Kyiv has sought to maintain its position in the Russian border region as leverage for possible peace talks. A Ukrainian drone attacked an oil depot in Cheboksary in Russia&apos;s Chuvashia Republic on the morning of March 9, Governor Oleg Nikolaev reported. Russian Telegram channels claimed that this is the first drone attack on Chuvashia since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. The Burevestnik oil depot lies over 900 kilometers (559 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Nikolaev said that the oil depot was under reconstruction. No casualties were reported. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, overnight, Russian air defense shot down 52 drones over Belgorod Oblast, 13 over Lipetsk Oblast, nine over Rostov Oblast, eight over Voronezh Oblast, three over Astrakhan Oblast, one over Ryazan Oblast, one over Kursk Oblast and one over Krashodar Krai. The Russian Telegram channel Astra reported that Ukrainian drones also targeted oil refineries in Lipetsk and Ryazan oblasts. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The Ukrainian military has not commented on Russian reports. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones since 2022. France will provide Ukraine with 195 million euros ($211 million) in military aid using the interest accrued from frozen Russian assets, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu told La Tribune in an interview published March 8. The additional aid &quot;will enable the delivery of 155-mm shells as well as AASM gliding bombs which arm the Ukrainian Mirage 2000s ,&quot; Lecornu said. Lecornu added that France is accelerating the transfer of older equipment to Ukraine, including tanks and armoured vehicles. In October 2024, Group of Seven (G7) countries came to an agreement that pledged to provide Ukraine with almost $50 billion loan backed by the revenue from foreign Russian assets. The announcement from France comes just days after the United Kingdom signed an agreement with Kyiv on March 1 to provide Ukraine with a loan worth 2.26 billion pounds ($2.84 billion) backed by frozen Russian assets. The loan will go towards &quot;purchasing defense equipment according to Ukraine&apos;s needs,&quot; the U.K. Finance Ministry said. While Western countries have frozen $300 billion in Russian assets, they can only access the annual income generated by these funds, approximately $3.2 billion. These profits will back the $50-billion loan to Kyiv, while the vast majority of the assets are frozen in European countries. France, one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters, has taken steps alongside the U.K. in recent months to provide European leadership in supporting Ukraine, amid Kyiv&apos;s tumultuous relationship with the Trump administration. Trump has repeatedly called for European countries to step up to support Ukraine, including providing additional aid funding, lambasting the previous Biden administration for sending too much aid funding to the embattled nation. On March 4, Trump halted military aid shipments to Ukraine following a heated exchange with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on March 2 that a number of European nations, including the U.K. and France, are developing a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; that will include &quot;planes in the air and boots on the ground&quot; in an effort to negotiate a successful ceasefire in Ukraine. Reuters reported on March 6, citing diplomatic sources, that France and the U.K. aim to finalize a peace plan with Ukraine &quot;in days&quot; to present to the United States. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced his delegation to represent Ukraine in upcoming talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia on March 8. Along with Andriy Yermak, Zelensky&apos;s chief of staff, Zelensky wrote on X that Ukraine will also be sending Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Deputy Head of the Presidential Office Pavlo Palisa. Zelensky wrote that he would travel to Saudi Arabia on March 10 and would meet with the Crown Prince, while the Ukrainian military and political delegation would stay for a meeting with the American team the following day. The U.S. delegation will reportedly include U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. The scheduled talks come amid rising tensions between Ukraine and the United States, as U.S. President Donald Trump escalates pressure on Zelensky to expedite a peace process. The tensions culminated in a confrontation during a meeting in the White House Oval Office on Feb. 28 after Zelensky had flown to the U.S. to sign a mineral and natural resources agreement with the U.S. After being insulted by Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, Zelensky returned to Ukraine without signing the deal. Since that meeting, the United States has ended its military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, resulting in significant troop losses on the frontlines. The losses have been particularly sharp in the Kursk region that Ukraine has occupied since August 2024, where ten thousand troops are now facing encirclement. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz suggested on March 5 that Trump may lift the pause on military aid once peace negotiations are arranged and confidence-building measures are taken, Reuters reported. The U.S. continues to share some intelligence with Ukraine to assist with defense operations, but not for attacks on Russian troops, CNN reported on March 7, citing two anonymous defense officials. According to the sources, Washington aims to avoid being seen as directly supporting strikes on Russia. However, the U.S. is not withholding information that could enhance Ukraine&apos;s defensive capabilities. The significant cutting back on U.S. intelligence sharing to Ukraine is part of the Trump administration&#x2019;s position to pressure Kyiv into quick negotiations with Russia. The sources also confirmed that Starlink, which the Ukrainian military relies on, is still operating in Ukraine as before. Starlink is owned by SpaceX, a company belonging to billionaire Elon Musk. Musk, a key ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, has drawn scrutiny at home and abroad over his repeated inflammatory comments regarding Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-62/	2025-03-09T13:12:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/Kurskaja.jpg
Romanian far-right candidate Calin Georgescu barred from running in presidential election	Romania&apos;s electoral bureau has disqualified far-right candidate Calin Georgescu from running in the presidential election re-run, multiple Romanian channels announced on March 9. The bureau noted that the reasoning behind their decision would be posted to their website shortly. The repeat elections are set for May 8 and 22 after the first round in November was annulled due to allegations of Russian interference favoring Georgescu. The Romanian foreign intelligence agency (SIE) reported that &quot;aggressive Russian hybrid attacks, including cyberattacks, information leaks, and sabotage&quot; contributed to Georgescu&apos;s unexpected victory. Georgescu was detained by police on Feb. 26 and charged by prosecutors for alleged crimes related to the country&apos;s recent elections. He filed his candidacy on March 7 in Bucharest, after which the bureau had 48 hours to either approve or deny it. Georgescu&#x2019;s supporters condemned the disqualification move as politically motivated, and several dozen people gathered outside the election bureau, chanting &quot;Freedom&quot;, while briefly attempting to break through the security barrier. The right-wing leader spoke out on X about the bureau&apos;s decision, accusing Romania of being under tyranny. &quot;Europe is now a dictatorship, Romania is under tyranny!&quot; he wrote. Tech billionaire Elon Musk shared multiple posts that were critical about the decision, and commented on it too. &#x201C;This is crazy!&#x201D; Musk wrote. The disqualification can be challenged in court if Georgescu chooses to do so. Georgescu, a pro-Russian candidate has previously referred to Ukraine as a &quot;fictional state.&quot; He has said that if elected president, he would ban Ukrainian grain exports through Romania and halt further military aid to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/romanian-far-right-candidate-calin-georgescu-barred-from-running-in-presidential-election/	2025-03-09T12:15:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2191257472.jpg
Rubio, Musk clash with Polish FM over Starlink in Ukraine, accuse him of 'just making things up'	Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Elon Musk sharply responded to Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski on March 9, dismissing Sikorski&#x2019;s concerns about Starlink being cut off in the future, and urging him to be thankful for the assistance thus far. Earlier on March 9, Sikorski stated that Poland will look for alternative suppliers if SpaceX turns out to be an unreliable provider of Starlink satellite internet for Ukraine. Rubio responded and claimed that Sikorski was &quot;just making things up.&#x201D; &#x201C;No one has made any threats about cutting Ukraine off from Starlink,&#x201D; Rubio said. &#x201C;And say thank you because without Starlink, Ukraine would have lost this war long ago and Russians would be on the border with Poland right now.&quot; Musk responded as well, claiming that Poland only pays a &#x201C;small fraction&#x201D; of the cost for Ukraine&#x2019;s Starlink access, even though Warsaw provides half of the total of Ukraine&#x2019;s 42,000 terminals, at about $50 million per year, according to Sikorski. &#x201C;Be quiet, small man. You pay a tiny fraction of the cost,&#x201D; Musk said. &#x201C;And there is no substitute for Starlink.&#x201D; Previously on March 9, Musk claimed that the entire front line in Ukraine would collapse if he shut off Starlink services. Both Musk and Rubio have made remarks against Ukrainian officials and Kyiv&#x2019;s position in recent weeks. On March 5, Rubio said that Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine is a &quot;proxy war&quot; between Moscow and Washington. He then blamed President Volodymyr Zelensky for &quot;undermining&quot; Trump&apos;s plan in the peace negotiations thus far, following the heated exchange that took place at the White House in late February. Musk has also made similar statements, and he has amplified Russian disinformation, criticizing Zelensky&#x2019;s position frequently, and calling for &#x201C;immediate peace,&#x201D; while refraining from criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin for starting the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/rubio-musk-clash-with-polish-fm-over-starlink-in-ukraine-accuse-him-of-just-making-things-up/	2025-03-09T10:55:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1813800965.jpeg
Poland will seek alternatives if Musk cuts Ukraine's Starlink access, Sikorski says	Poland will look for alternative suppliers if SpaceX turns out to be an unreliable provider of Starlink satellite internet for Ukraine, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said on March 9 in response to tech billionaire Elon Musk&apos;s remarks. Warsaw helps Ukraine maintain its Starlink access, having provided half of the total of the country&apos;s 42,000 terminals. Starlink has played a crucial role in securing communications in wartime Ukraine. Earlier on March 9, Musk claimed that the entire front line in Ukraine would collapse if he shut off Starlink services. Sikorski said that Starlink services for Ukraine are paid for by the Polish Digitization Ministry at the cost of about $50 million per year. &quot;The ethics of threatening the victim of aggression apart, if SpaceX proves to be an unreliable provider we will be forced to look for other suppliers,&quot; he wrote on X. Polish Deputy Prime Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski said on March 5 that cutting Starlink access for Ukraine would lead to an international crisis between Poland and the U.S. If Musk cuts off Ukraine&apos;s Starlink access, Gawkowski said, he would be effectively terminating a corporate contract with a European Union nation. The U.S. has threatened to cut off Ukraine&#x2019;s access to Starlink if Kyiv doesn&#x2019;t agree to a critical minerals deal, Reuters wrote in late February, citing sources. Musk denied these reports back then. The planned signing of the agreement was disrupted after a clash between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. In early March, Washington halted U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing for Ukraine in an attempt to push Kyiv to peace talks with Moscow. As concerns about Starlink&apos;s availability have grown, Ukrainian officials said Kyiv was working on alternatives to the U.S. service. French satellite operator Eutelsat Communications is in talks with the EU to possibly replace Starlink in Ukraine. Musk, who Trump has tasked with eliminating &quot;fraud&quot; and &quot;waste&quot; from the government budget, has called for shutting down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), an organization that provides vital humanitarian aid to Ukraine. He has also amplified Russian disinformation and mocked Zelensky for calling Ukraine an independent country.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-will-seek-alternatives-if-musk-cuts-ukraines-starlink-access-sikorski-says/	2025-03-09T08:43:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202862123.jpg
US Secret Service shoots armed man near White House	U.S. Secret Service officers opened fire on an armed man near the White House in Washington on March 9, the Secret Service reported. At the time of the incident, U.S. President Donald Trump was at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, according to CBS News. Local police shared they received information about a &quot;suicidal individual&quot; possibly traveling from Indiana, in the northeast of the country. The Secret Service members spotted a man and his car not far from the White House around midnight. As the officers approached, he brandished a firearm. An &quot;armed confrontation&quot; followed, with the suspect being shot by Secret Service. He was taken to a local hospital and his condition is unknown. No casualties among the Secret Service employees were reported. Trump was previously targeted in an assassination attempt on July 13 during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. Later in the fall, the U.S. Secret Service opened fire after seeing an armed individual at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, while Trump was playing golf. Trump was unharmed, and the FBI launched the investigation into the incident as another assassination attempt against him.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-secret-service-shoots-armed-man-near-white-house/	2025-03-09T07:50:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204146985.jpg

Russia, China, Iran to hold joint naval drills in Gulf of Oman	China, Russia, and Iran will hold the Security Belt 2025 joint maritime exercises in the Gulf of Oman this month, the Chinese Defense Ministry announced on March 9. Both China and Iran have supported Russia during its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, helping it sustain its war effort despite the West&apos;s sanctions. The cooperation between these authoritarian regimes appears to continue to deepen as the West is growing more divided due to U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s U-turn in foreign policy. The new drills will start on March 11 in the port of Chabahar, located in southeast Iran, the Tasnim news agency reported. The three countries are planning to practice countering maritime targets, rescue operations, and maneuvering. The exercises are aimed at deepening &quot;the mutual trust and pragmatic cooperation between the participating countries&apos; armies,&quot; the Chinese ministry said. The three countries conducted similar joint naval exercises in the past, including in 2023 and 2024. Beijing has remained a key ally of Moscow throughout the invasion, deepening economic ties and becoming Russia&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods &#x2014; components that are used for manufacturing weapons. Russia has also strengthened its ties with Iran, in particular deepening the level of military cooperation between Moscow and Tehran. Iran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed attack drones used in attacks against Ukrainian cities.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-china-iran-to-hold-joint-naval-drills-in-gulf-of-oman/	2025-03-09T06:42:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1248343324.jpeg

Russia launched nearly 1,200 bombs, 870 drones, over 80 missiles against Ukraine this week, Zelensky says	Russian forces launched nearly 1,200 aerial bombs, nearly 870 attack drones, and more than 80 missiles of various types against Ukraine this week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 9. The weapons that Russia used against Ukraine this week contained more than 82,000 foreign components, Zelensky said. &quot;Every day, we work with our partners to ensure that decisions are made to provide life-saving support: air defense systems, investments in our defense production, and the strengthening of sanctions against Russia,&quot; he added. Russia carried out a large-scale aerial attack overnight on March 7, launching 67 missiles of various types and 194 drones against gas and energy infrastructure across Ukraine. Also this week, Russia struck a hotel in Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, killing six people and injuring over 30 others, including children. Multiple attacks on Dobropillia in Donetsk Oblast late on March 7 killed 11 people and injured almost 50, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. The attacks took place shortly after the U.S. halted its military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv. Experts who spoke to The Kyiv Independent earlier this week said that the main burden of the U.S. intelligence cutoff will be felt by Ukrainian civilians, as it threatens Ukraine&apos;s ability to detect on time Russian aerial strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Ukrainian officials said they are working on alternatives with foreign partners.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launched-nearly-1-200-bombs-870-drones-over-80-missiles-against-ukraine-this-week-zelensky-says/	2025-03-09T05:09:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203966472.jpg

Ukrainian front line 'would collapse' if Starlink is turned off, Musk claims	U.S. tech billionaire Elon Musk claimed on March 9 that the entire front line in Ukraine would collapse if he shut off Starlink satellite internet services. Starlink internet terminals have played a crucial role in securing communications in the war in Ukraine. Last year, Ukraine said that approximately 42,000 terminals were in operation across the military, hospitals, businesses, and aid organizations. The U.S. has threatened to cut off Ukraine&#x2019;s access to Starlink if Kyiv doesn&#x2019;t agree to a critical minerals deal, Reuters wrote in late February, citing sources. Musk denied these reports back then. The planned signing of the agreement was disrupted after a clash between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office.

In a post on X, Musk, a close ally of Trump, proposed to impose sanctions &quot;on the top 10 Ukrainian oligarchs, especially the ones with mansions in Monaco.&quot; This was in reaction to a post by Republican Senator Mike Lee, who called for cutting funding for Ukraine. One social media user wrote that Musk ignores the fact that Russia is an aggressor and Ukraine is a victim in the all-out war. &quot;I literally challenged (Russian President Vladimir) Putin to one on one physical combat over Ukraine, and my Starlink system is the backbone of the Ukrainian army. Their entire front line would collapse if I turned it off,&quot; Musk replied. Musk described Russia&apos;s full-scale war as &quot;years of slaughter in a stalemate,&quot; adding that Ukraine would &quot;inevitably lose.&quot; &quot;Anyone who really cares, really thinks, and really understands, wants the meat grinder to stop. Peace now!&quot; he wrote. As concerns about Starlink&apos;s availability escalated, Ukrainian officials said the country was working on alternatives to the U.S. service. French satellite operator Eutelsat Communications is in talks with the European Union to possibly replace Starlink in Ukraine. Musk, who Trump has tasked with eliminating &quot;fraud&quot; and &quot;waste&quot; from the government budget, has called for shutting down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), an organization that provides vital humanitarian aid to Ukraine. He has also amplified Russian disinformation and mocked Zelensky for calling Ukraine an independent country.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-front-line-would-collapse-if-starlink-is-turned-off-musk-claims/	2025-03-09T03:18:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202932520.jpg
Ukrainian drone reportedly attacks oil depot in Russia's Chuvashia for first time	A Ukrainian drone attacked an oil depot in Cheboksary in Russia&apos;s Chuvashia Republic on the morning of March 9, Governor Oleg Nikolaev reported. Russian Telegram channels claimed that this is the first drone attack on Chuvashia since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. The Burevestnik oil depot lies over 900 kilometers (559 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Nikolaev said that the oil depot was under reconstruction. No casualties were reported. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, overnight, Russian air defense shot down 52 drones over Belgorod Oblast, 13 over Lipetsk Oblast, nine over Rostov Oblast, eight over Voronezh Oblast, three over Astrakhan Oblast, one over Ryazan Oblast, one over Kursk Oblast and one over Krashodar Krai. The Russian Telegram channel Astra reported that Ukrainian drones also targeted oil refineries in Lipetsk and Ryazan oblasts. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The Ukrainian military has not commented on Russian reports. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones since 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drone-reportedly-attacks-oil-depot-in-russias-chuvashia-for-first-time/	2025-03-09T01:12:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Cheboksary__View_of_downtown.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 6, injure 34 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed six people and injured 34 others over the past day, regional authorities said on March 9. Ukrainian forces downed 73 out of the 119 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Thirty-seven drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are usually decoys. Russia launches them alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. Two people were killed in the cities of Pokrovsk and Siversk in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Another 23 people were injured in the region over the past day. A 41-year-old man was killed as a result of Russian shelling of the Kivsharivka village in Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. A Russian first-person view (FPV) drone attacked a car near the town of Bohokhudiv, injuring a 36-year-old man. Another drone strike injured a 46-year-old man in Kupiansk, Syniehubov said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 40 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Three people were killed, and nine others injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-6-injure-39-over-past-day/	2025-03-09T00:13:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-08_17-17-07.jpg

Ukrainian partisans sabotage railway line in occupied Crimea, group claims	The Atesh partisan group sabotaged a railway line linking parts of occupied Crimea with the front line in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, disrupting Russian supply lines, the group claimed via Telegram on March 9. An operative burned down a relay cabinet near the village of Stolbove in occupied Crimea, Atesh said, posting undated video footage of the alleged sabotage. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the group&apos;s claims. The operation aimed to disrupt Russian military logistics, Atesh reported. The targeted railway connected occupied Crimea with parts of occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast. 0:00/1&#xD7;Purported footage of a sabotage of a railway cabinet relay near the village of Stolbove in occupied Crimea.

The Atesh movement regularly commits sabotage attacks on Russian territory and in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. The group reported a similar action against a railway in occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast on Nov. 16. In October 2024, Russian troops reportedly renewed their attack in the Zaporizhzhia sector. Kyiv previously warned of a potential Russian push in the southern region, just as Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-partisans-sabotage-railway-line-in-occupied-crimea-group-claims/	2025-03-08T21:27:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-08_14-52-05.jpg
US vetos G7 proposal to establish task force on Russia's 'shadow fleet,' Bloomberg reports	The United States vetoed a Group of Seven (G7) proposal to establish a joint task force that would tackle sanctions evasion related to Russia&apos;s &apos;shadow fleet,&apos; Bloomberg reported on March 8. The move aligns with the Trump administration&apos;s efforts to soften its stance on Russia in international institutions as well as in joint statements. Trump, who has called on both Russia and Ukraine to make concessions to end the war, has repeated Kremlin narratives ahead of formalized peace negotiations. The shadow fleet refers to aging and largely uninsured oil tankers that Russia uses to transport oil above the $60 per barrel price cap that the EU, the U.S., and G7 countries imposed in December 2022 as part of the effort to cut Moscow&apos;s fossil fuels revenue. In recent months, shadow fleet vessels have been suspected of sabotage operations in the Baltic Sea, causing major damage to undersea cables. In addition to vetoing the task force, the United States has sought to ease rhetoric used towards Russia, pushing, in a joint G7 draft statement, to remove the word &quot;sanctions,&quot; as well as citing Russia&#x2019;s &quot;ability to maintain its war&quot; in Ukraine by replacing it with &quot;earn revenue,&quot; Bloomberg reported. The final joint statement has not been finalized ahead of next week&apos;s G7 meeting in Canada and is subject to change. The wording in the G7 statement aligns with previous moves by the U.S. at international institutions. On Feb. 24, the day of the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, the U.S. voted against a resolution at the UN General Assembly condemning Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, with 93 countries voting in favor and 18 against. The General Assembly later passed a separate U.S. resolution marking the third anniversary of the invasion. That resolution also received 93 votes in favor but avoided directly calling Russia the aggressor. A few days later, the United States abstained from signing a statement by members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) condemning Russian aggression on Feb. 26, breaking from its Western allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-vetos-proposal-to-establish-g7-task-force-on-russias-shadow-fleet-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-08T20:27:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182537136.jpg
Australia considering joining 'coalition of the willing' for Ukraine amid talks with Starmer	Australia is considering joining the European-led coalition of the willing to support a lasting ceasefire in Ukraine, a statement issued by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Stamer&apos;s office read on March 8. Starmer announced on March 2 that a number of European nations, including the U.K. and France, are developing a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; that will include &quot;planes in the air and boots on the ground&quot; in an effort to secure a successful ceasefire in Ukraine. Following a phone call with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Starmer&apos;s office said that the U.K. prime minister &quot;welcomed Prime Minister Albanese&#x2019;s commitment to consider contributing to a coalition of the willing for Ukraine.&quot; Responding to reporters questions on March 3, Albanese said Australia was &quot;ready to assist&quot; with &quot;proposals going forward&quot; on Ukraine, hinting that his government would be open to contributing to a joint force. The U.K. and France have spearheaded the idea of deploying European peacekeepers in Ukraine to monitor a potential ceasefire. Despite the progress on talks, Starmer warned that for any coalition to succeed, Europe must &quot;have strong U.S. backing.&quot; Starmer did not specify which other countries would participate in the coalition, but added that &quot;a number of countries have indicated they want to be part of the plan we&apos;re developing.&quot; A U.K. official confirmed on March 6 that talks were being held with about 20 countries consisting of &quot;largely European and Commonwealth partners&quot; &#x2014; without specifying the participants. Thus far, a number of countries have expressed openness to joining the coalition, including Canada, Ireland, and Turkey, among others. The Kremlin has consistently maintained that it will not accept Western troops on the ground in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/australia-considering-joining-coalition-of-the-willing-for-ukraine-following-talks-with-starmer/	2025-03-08T19:07:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1257670533.jpeg
France to provide $211 million in military aid to Ukraine backed by frozen Russian assets	France will provide Ukraine with 195 million euros ($211 million) in military aid using the interest accrued from frozen Russian assets, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu told La Tribune in an interview published March 8. The additional aid &quot;will enable the delivery of 155-mm shells as well as AASM gliding bombs which arm the Ukrainian Mirage 2000s ,&quot; Lecornu said. Lecornu added that France is accelerating the transfer of older equipment to Ukraine, including tanks and armoured vehicles. In October 2024, Group of Seven (G7) countries came to an agreement that pledged to provide Ukraine with almost $50 billion loan backed by the revenue from foreign Russian assets. The announcement from France comes just days after the United Kingdom signed an agreement with Kyiv on March 1 to provide Ukraine with a loan worth 2.26 billion pounds ($2.84 billion) backed by frozen Russian assets. The loan will go towards &quot;purchasing defense equipment according to Ukraine&apos;s needs,&quot; the U.K. Finance Ministry said. While Western countries have frozen $300 billion in Russian assets, they can only access the annual income generated by these funds, approximately $3.2 billion. These profits will back the $50-billion loan to Kyiv, while the vast majority of the assets are frozen in European countries. France, one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters, has taken steps alongside the U.K. in recent months to provide European leadership in supporting Ukraine, amid Kyiv&apos;s tumultuous relationship with the Trump administration. Trump has repeatedly called for European countries to step up to support Ukraine, including providing additional aid funding, lambasting the previous Biden administration for sending too much aid funding to the embattled nation. On March 4, Trump halted military aid shipments to Ukraine following a heated exchange with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on March 2 that a number of European nations, including the U.K. and France, are developing a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; that will include &quot;planes in the air and boots on the ground&quot; in an effort to negotiate a successful ceasefire in Ukraine. Reuters reported on March 6, citing diplomatic sources, that France and the U.K. aim to finalize a peace plan with Ukraine &quot;in days&quot; to present to the United States.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-to-provide-211-million-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-using-interest-from-frozen-russian-assets/	2025-03-08T17:18:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/03/GettyImages-1243421817.jpeg
Dagestan, Chechnya block Telegram messaging app	Authorities in Russia&#x2019;s Dagestan and Chechnya have blocked the Telegram messaging app, Russian state media TASS reported on March 8. The ban was implemented in response to &#x201C;security concerns,&#x201D; as authorities warned that groups could use the app to coordinate unrest. Dagestan&apos;s Minister of Digitalisation, Yuri Gamzatov, pointed to the October 2023 antisemitic riot at Makhachkala airport as an example of Telegram being used to organize violence. Anton Nemkin, a member of Russia&#x2019;s State Duma, argued that Telegram&#x2019;s content moderation is weak, allowing extremist material to spread unchecked. The Russian government has been escalating attempts to control online communications, blocking the messaging app Signal, reportedly planning to block WhatsApp, and curbing access to YouTube. &quot;Telegram needs to reconsider its approach to content moderation,&#x201D; he said. Gamzatov suggested that the app could be unblocked in the future, but encouraged users to switch to other platforms. Dagestan and Chechnya have seen a number of terrorist attacks by members of the Islamic State as well as clashes with security forces over the past years. Both republics are located in the North Caucasus region of Russia. The app, founded by Russian businessman Pavel Durov, was banned from being used by officials of Ukraine&#x2019;s Verkhovna Rada on their work devices in October 2024. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said in an interview published on Sept. 7 that the app is &quot;harmful&quot; and a &quot;threat to our national security,&quot; following the arrest of Durov in France. He faces 12 charges from the French authorities, including crimes related to child pornography, drug trafficking, money laundering, and withholding crucial information from investigators.	https://kyivindependent.com/dagestan-and-chechnya-block-telegram-messaging-app/	2025-03-08T15:36:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168240257.jpg
Large fire affecting critical infrastructure reported in Zaporizhzhia Oblast following Russian drone attack	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A large fire erupted at a critical infrastructure facility in Zaporizhzhia Oblast following a Russian drone attack, regional Governor Ivan Federov said on March 8. As a result of the strike, gas supplies have been limited in the region, Federov added. Russia has regularly launched missiles targeting various regions of the country. Russian forces have continuously targeted Ukraine&apos;s critical infrastructure as Russia continues to test Ukrainian resolve in the harsh winter months. Amid the U.S. pause on sharing intelligence with Kyiv, the New York Times reported on March 5, citing undisclosed U.S. and Ukrainian officials, that the pause affects warnings against Russian drones and missiles striking Ukrainian military and civilian targets. 0:00/1&#xD7;A fire is shown burning at a critical infrastructure facility in Zaporizhzhia Oblast on March 8, 2025 following a Russian drone attack on the region. (Zaporizhzhia Oblast Military Administration)No information was immediately available on the full extent of the damage, or whether any casualties were sustained in the attack. No details were provided on the location of the facility. Multiple explosions were heard between 10:30 p.m. and 11 p.m. local time, amid the reported threat of Russian drone attacks. Russian forces separately launched missiles towards eastern regions of the country on the evening of March 8. The attack on Zaporizhzhia Oblast comes just one day after Russia launched a mass strike against various regions of Ukraine targeting energy and gas infrastructure across the country. In the attack, Russian missiles struck critical infrastructure in Ternopil, Poltava, and Ivano-Frankivsk oblasts. Zaporizhzhia Oblast, situated on Ukraine&apos;s front line, is the target of near daily Russian drone, missile, and glide bomb attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/large-fire-affecting-critical-infrastructure-reported-in-zaporizhzhia-oblast-following-russian-drone-attack/	2025-03-08T14:27:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-08_17-13-15.jpg
Sweden to allocate $2.2 million in support of Ukrainian women	Sweden will provide over $2 million (22.5 million Swedish kronor) to support Ukrainian women, the Swedish Embassy in Ukraine announced on March 8. According to the embassy&#x2019;s post on X, the funding aims to &#x201C;empower women in Ukraine&#x201D; and support their contributions to the country&#x2019;s defense and recovery. &#x201C;On March 8, we pay tribute to the Ukrainian women who bravely defend their country, and all of Europe, as military and humanitarian workers, entrepreneurs and political leaders,&#x201D; the post said. The funding initiative will be through UN-Women, the embassy added. This comes soon after Sweden announced a military aid package to Ukraine worth over $1.2 billion, on Jan. 30. It was Sweden&apos;s largest tranche of military assistance since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/sweden-to-allocate-2-2-million-in-support-of-ukrainian-women/	2025-03-08T11:27:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2156168873.jpg
Russian troops reportedly attack Sudzha in Kursk Oblast as Ukraine's logistical routes are cut off	Russian and North Korean troops have launched an attack on the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the Ukrainian battlefield monitoring group DeepState and Yury Butusov, chief editor of the news site censor.net, reported on March 8. Multiple Russian pro-war Telegram channels claimed on March 8 that Russian troops have launched a large-scale offensive in Kursk Oblast and are storming Sudzha. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims, and the Ukrainian authorities have not commented on them. Russian forces have recently intensified efforts to break through to Sumy Oblast and cut off logistical routes of the Ukrainian salient in bordering Kursk Oblast. Russian forces have destroyed Ukrainian troops&apos; logistics in Kursk Oblast, and Ukrainian soldiers face the risk of encirclement, a Ukrainian soldier and a medic deployed in the region told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity on March 7. Butusov wrote on Facebook on March 8 that Russian troops had used a gas pipeline to approach Ukrainian positions in Sudzha in Kursk Oblast. He added that the troops are being &quot;liquidated.&quot; DeepState confirmed that Russian troops had tried to attack Sudzha through a pipeline but reported that the results of the operation are unknown. According to DeepState, North Korean troops are rapidly advancing near Sudzha, acting as the main offensive force and also bearing the heaviest casualties. &#x201C;The situation in the buffer zone in Kursk Oblast continues to intensify and requires immediate decisions from the (Ukrainian) command,&#x201D;Butusov said. Kyiv has sought to maintain its position in the Russian border region as leverage for possible peace talks. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, the Russian military claimed.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-soldiers-use-gas-pipeline-to-advance-closer-to-ukrainian-positions-in-sudzha-deepstate-reports/	2025-03-08T09:57:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/Kurskaja.jpg

Zelensky names delegation for meeting with US in Saudi Arabia	President Volodymyr Zelensky announced his delegation to represent Ukraine in upcoming talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia on March 8. Along with Andriy Yermak, Zelensky&apos;s chief of staff, Zelensky wrote on X that Ukraine will also be sending Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Deputy Head of the Presidential Office Pavlo Palisa. Zelensky wrote that he would travel to Saudi Arabia on March 10 and would meet with the Crown Prince, while the Ukrainian military and political delegation would stay for a meeting with the American team the following day. The U.S. delegation will reportedly include U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. The scheduled talks come amid rising tensions between Ukraine and the United States, as U.S. President Donald Trump escalates pressure on Zelensky to expedite a peace process. The tensions culminated in a confrontation during a meeting in the White House Oval Office on Feb. 28 after Zelensky had flown to the U.S. to sign an mineral and natural resources agreement with the U.S. After being insulted by Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, Zelensky returned to Ukraine without signing the deal. Since that meeting, the United States has ended its military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, resulting in significant troop losses on the frontlines. The losses have been particularly sharp in the Kursk region that Ukraine has occupied since August 2024, where ten thousand troops are now facing encirclement. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz suggested on March 5 that Trump may lift the pause on military aid once peace negotiations are arranged and confidence-building measures are taken, Reuters reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-names-delegation-for-meeting-with-u-s-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-03-08T06:46:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164821112.jpg
US to stop participating in future military exercises in Europe, Swedish media reports	The United States has notified its allies that it does not plan to participate in military exercises held in Europe beyond those already scheduled in 2025, Swedish media outlet Expressen reported on March 7. Sources told Expressen that this will affect several exercises currently in the &quot;drawing board&quot; phase that will be held in Sweden. &#xA0; Since his inauguration in January, U.S. President Donald Trump has signaled that he wants to pivot American security priorities away from Europe and focus on China and the Indo-Pacific Region. He shocked allies with recent moves including ending military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, excluding European allies from peace talks held with Russia in Saudia Arabia, and has repeatedly pressuring NATO allies to increase their defense spending. In response, a rattled Europe has begun preparing itself for a world order in which the United States cannot be relied on. EU member states agreed to free up what could amount to an unprecedented 800 billion euros ($867 billion) for defense spending. The United States regularly carries out joint operations with European allies each year to increase cooperation and test troop readiness.	https://kyivindependent.com/u-s-to-stop-participating-in-future-military-exercises-in-europe-swedish-media-reports/	2025-03-08T05:57:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1241165969.jpg
Miniature universes:' The personal spaces of women at war (Photos)	War has long been framed as the domain of men, reinforced by language, imagery, and tradition. But after Russia invaded Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in 2014, Ukrainian women took up arms, proving that in the fight for national sovereignty, it is not gender but loyalty to one&#x2019;s country that defines a soldier. Photographer Marisya Myanovska&#x2019;s series &#x201C;Zone of Seismic Activity&#x201D; captures the role of women in Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces &#x2014; where over 70,000 women now serve today &#x2014; not only through the stark symbols of war, such as unexploded shells and combat uniforms, but also through intimate moments of daily life on the front lines. Her images challenge traditional narratives, revealing the unseen, the overlooked, and the undeniable presence of women in war. On International Women&#x2019;s Day, the Kyiv Independent presents excerpts from Myanovska&#x2019;s photo series to show that Ukrainian women defending their country against Russian aggression are not only counted but seen. A person&#x2019;s personal space is a miniature universe &#x2014; fragile in war, always on the brink of disappearing. Just like the universe itself. - In August 2024, I traveled to the combat zone to document how war reshapes women&apos;s lives. &#xA0; I followed three female service members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kharkiv and Donetsk areas: Oksana &quot;Ksena&quot; Rubanyak, an unmanned aerial vehicles platoon commander; Andriana &quot;Malysh&quot; Arekhta, a weapons operator in a Special Operations Forces unit; and Yulia &quot;Kuba&quot; Sidorova, a combat medic with the 92nd Separate Mechanized Brigade. I slept beside them, brushed my teeth next to them, accompanied them to positions, and shared conversations over coffee. Yet, they rarely spoke of combat, focusing instead on moments when they could simply be themselves. &#xA0; In war, personal space is unstable. Solitude is rare. Boundaries shrink &#x2014; to a car, a sleeping bag, or, if lucky, a restroom, a shower, or a clearing in the forest. The closer to the &quot;zero line,&quot; the more space collapses inward, leaving only the refuge of one&#x2019;s own body. &#xA0; My project explores the fragile personal space of women in war &#x2014; its boundaries, its instability, and its connection to the ever-changing front lines. - Marysia Myanovska	https://kyivindependent.com/beyond-the-battlefield-exploring-womens-personal-spaces-in-ukraines-war-photos/	2025-03-08T05:44:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/updDSCF7439.jpg
Ukrainian drones attacked Russian oil refinery in Leningrad Oblast, military intelligence source says	Drones attacked an oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Leningrad Oblast overnight on March 8 in an operation carried out by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR), a HUR source told the Kyiv Independent. According to the HUR source, the drones attacked the Kirishinefteorgsintez enterprise in the Kirishsky district of Russia&apos;s Leningrad Oblast. Alexander Drozdenko, governor of Leningrad Oblast, said on Telegram that Russian air defense shot down one drone as it was approaching and the other was shot down overhead. &quot;When the debris fell, the external structure of one of the tanks was damaged,&quot; he said, adding that there were no victims. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify either party&apos;s claim. The oil refinery is located more than 800 kilometers from the border of Ukraine and is one of the largest oil refineries in Russia. Ukraine&apos;s ability to strike deep in Russian territory has been threatened by the recent end to military intelligence sharing from the United States. The United States stopped its intelligence sharing on March 5 as U.S. President Donald Trump escalates his pressure on Ukraine ahead of expected peace talks. CNN reported that while some information sharing has continued for defense operations, Washington does not want to be seen as supporting strikes on Russian troops. Ukraine has regularly used long-range drone strikes to target Russia&apos;s oil refinery facilities, as energy exports have been a key source of funding for Russia&apos;s invasion.

â€˜Transformations after victory would be too lateâ€™ â€” An interview with Ukraineâ€™s social policy minister	Since Russia began its full-scale invasion more than three years ago, the demands on social services have multiplied. Millions are internally displaced, the number of people with disabilities has risen by 10%, and more than 13,000 children have been orphaned. Populations who were already vulnerable are often hit harder by the burdens of war. At the same time, it has become difficult to provide services in large swathes of the country because of Russian strikes and fighting. The government is facing a budget deficit in the tens of billions as the country covers mounting defense costs to pay for its survival, leaving most social services &#x2014; like other non-defense expenditures &#x2014; to be paid for by international donors. Oksana Zholnovych was appointed Ukraine&#x2019;s social policy minister in July 2022, shortly after the full-scale invasion began. The Kyiv Independent recently spoke with her about how the war has affected her work, what she predicts will be the biggest challenges for the ministry after the war ends, and disability services in Ukraine today. Oksana Zholnovych, Ukraine&#x2019;s social policy minister. (Courtesy)Editor&#x2019;s note: This interview has been translated from Ukrainian and edited for length and clarity. The Kyiv Independent: Can you tell us about how the war changed the work of the Social Policy Ministry? What have been the biggest challenges? Zholnovych: Obviously, the challenges have changed significantly. But the group of people who need support has stayed with us. At the same time, there&#x2019;s a huge number of internally displaced people &#x2014; almost 4 million &#x2014; and the number of people with disabilities has risen by 300,000. We immediately realized that we had to transform almost all of our tools. To expect transformations after victory would be too late; the entire social system would fall to pieces. Everything we are doing now is aimed at radically improving the system and creating new stable mechanisms that will work efficiently and more effectively after the war. The Kyiv Independent: When you think about the future, what do you see as the main post-war focuses that your ministry should be preparing for? Zholnovych: The very first focus is to help people balance their mental health. Each of us is under a lot of stress. Some are fighting, some are waiting for relatives to return from the war, and some have already lost them and live in grief. Some went abroad to protect their family, and they&#x2019;ll return and will need to be reintegrated. Some lost their homes and have been forced to completely rebuild their lives from scratch in a new place. We&#x2019;ve already formed 200 &#x201C;Resilience Centers.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s important for us that in each community, there is this center where people will feel they&#x2019;re not alone. They&#x2019;ll understand how to cope with their pain and will form new support circles. In this way, we strengthen societal cohesion. The second is to work with people with disabilities. Today, unfortunately, only 16% of people (in Ukraine) with disabilities are employed, while in the European Union, it&#x2019;s 50%. More young people have disabilities now. Young, active people who don&#x2019;t want to just receive some small financial support and stay at home. We need to provide them with socialization, work, and employment so that they continue to feel socially engaged. The third focus is demographic strategy. To rebuild, we will need a large number of human hands and resources. We need them now for defense, too. We&#x2019;ve approved a demographic strategy and will implement it step by step in terms of returning Ukrainians, stimulating the birth rate, and improving the lives of our people. The fourth focus is undoubtedly older adults, one of the largest groups. We are an aging nation, and we need to help them have decent lives in retirement. The Kyiv Independent: Have you noticed any changes in the attitudes of Ukrainians towards those with disabilities? Zholnovych: It&apos;s a really complicated process. The most difficult thing is changing stereotypes. On the one hand, we see that people have begun to talk much more about a barrier-free environment, that public institutions should be equipped so that people with disabilities can enter, and that public transport should be available for people with disabilities. But we still see cases when, for example, neighbors oppose building a ramp to a building. There is still a lot of stigma against people with mental disorders. We still have a lot of work to do in this area. But I see very positive trends. For the military, the issue of accessibility and barrier-free environments is critical. They understand that they or their brothers may find themselves in such a situation.

(Chris McGrath/Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Ukraine has come under criticism by human rights groups for placing orphans and children and adults with disabilities in institutions. One of the requirements for Ukraine&#x2019;s integration into the EU is ending this practice. How is your office handling this issue? Zholnovych: We adopted a resolution (in Nov. 2024) in which we very clearly stated that every child should grow up in a family environment, and that has prompted big changes. It&apos;s not just looking at children who are already in boarding schools and finding them adoptive parents or foster families but also understanding why those children end up there. Prevention is important. Looking at poverty, we&#x2019;ve significantly digitized programs aimed at supporting people in poverty, housing and communal subsidies, and rental subsidies for internally displaced people. And now we&#x2019;re working on creating basic social assistance. We&#x2019;re also improving social support because, in many cases, a social worker is needed to help a family escape poverty. We&#x2019;ve (also) offered a whole range of support for families that have a child with a disability. We&#x2019;re introducing an early intervention service from the first days when it is discovered that a child is disabled, we&#x2019;ve launched a pilot program to expand inclusive education for children with complex disorders who aren&#x2019;t yet covered by education, and we&#x2019;ve introduced a supported accommodation service for those with disabilities who are over 18. We&#x2019;re still working on providing mechanisms so parents understand that if their child has a disability, then their path will be secured, and there&#x2019;s no need to send them to a boarding school. The Kyiv Independent: International adoptions are on hold, but domestic adoptions are still ongoing. What trends has your ministry seen? Zholnovych: This past year, we set a record for children adopted by Ukrainians. There&#x2019;s more empathy. People&#x2019;s desire to provide love to a child who has lost their parents is growing. I consider this our small victory. We also strengthened tools so that children, if they&#x2019;re temporarily removed from their family, even for a short time, don&#x2019;t end up in a boarding school but immediately go to a foster family.

(Ozge Elif Kizil/Anadolu via Getty Images)We added a paid assistant for these families, increased their salaries, and gave them the opportunity to rest, because this wasn&apos;t happening before. We&#x2019;ve already increased the number of foster families by a third. We already have positive results from the actions we&#x2019;ve started, but we&#x2019;re at the beginning of the road. The Kyiv Independent: Since the full-scale invasion, the budget for your ministry has been paid for by international donors. How does that affect your operations? Zholnovych: All the funds we earn as a state, they&#x2019;re all directed to support the military and defense. None of our soldiers are paid for with international expenses. But the social services remain uncovered (by Ukrainian funds). Pensions are provided at the expense of domestic taxpayers because we have a pension fund, but the support of people with disabilities, the low-income, children from orphans, other different types of support, these are international resources. It&#x2019;s very important that the people who help us understand that we are grateful for this support. Without it, a large number of people simply would not be able to survive. We understand that international support is not easy now; there are no additional sources of resources, so our budget is at about the same level as last year. We try to use these resources responsibly, not just consuming them but also using them for transformations &#x2013; to break old, ineffective mechanisms and create new ones that are high-quality and will strengthen our social policy after the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/transformations-after-victory-would-be-too-late-an-interview-with-ukraines-social-policy-minister/	2025-03-08T04:15:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/upd_GettyImages-2123709297.jpg
Ukraine considers Kursk withdrawal amid fears of encirclement of 10,000 troops, Telegraph reports	Ukraine&apos;s forces are considering a withdrawal from Kursk, with 10,000 Ukrainian troops at risk of encirclement after Russia broke through key defense lines and disrupted supply chains, The Telegraph reported on March 8. The Telegraph&apos;s report comes as several recent media reports warn that Ukraine&apos;s occupation of Russian territory in Kursk is increasingly at risk of encirclement after Russian breakthroughs. Ukrainian troops speaking on the condition of anonymity told the Kyiv Independent on March 7 that Russia had destroyed their supply chains for ammunition and food and they faced encirclement. One said the breakthrough happened in the last few days. A source in President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s office told Time that operations in the Kursk region have been most affected by the recent halt in intelligence sharing from the United States. The United States stopped its intelligence sharing on March 5 as U.S. President Donald Trump escalates his pressure on Ukraine ahead of expected peace talks. &#xA0; A withdrawal ahead of peace talks would be a severe blow to Ukraine&apos;s bargaining position. Zelensky has said that Ukraine&apos;s occupation of Kursk is likely to play a crucial role in potential future negotiations. According to the Telegraph, North Korean troops played an important role in the offensive that destroyed supply lines in Kursk. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in August 2024. After a January report that North Korean troops had pulled back, they were reportedly redeployed to Kursk last month. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, capturing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) and marking the first foreign invasion of Russia since World War II. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, the Russian military claimed.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-considers-kursk-withdrawal-amid-fears-of-encirclement-of-10-000-troops-telegraph-reports/	2025-03-08T01:45:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/Kurskaja.jpg
Russian drone strike kills 3 civilians, injures 7 in Kharkiv Oblast	A Russian drone strike on a meat processing plant in Kharkiv Oblast killed three civilians and injured seven others, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said on March 8. A fire broke out on the site after four Shahed drones struck the plant around 2 a.m., Syniehubov wrote on Telegram. The three civilians killed were all men, according to the Telegram post. Overnight, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported 145 drones and decoy drones were launched from Russia. Two ballistic missiles and a cruise missile were also launched. Also overnight, a strike on Donetsk Oblast killed 11 and injured 30 people. A halt on intelligence sharing from the United States has raised fears that Ukraine&apos;s ability to issue vital alerts about incoming Russian and drones may be harmed. However, the U.S. continues to share some intelligence with Ukraine to assist with defense operations, but not for attacks on Russian troops, CNN reported on March 7.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-strike-kills-3-civilians-injures-7-in-kharkiv-oblast/	2025-03-08T00:43:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-08-10_22_47.jpeg
Ukraine destroys 2 diesel trains in Russia, military intelligence source say	Two diesel trains were disabled in Russia as a result of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) operations, a military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on March 8. According to the HUR source, a train being used for transporting weapons and military equipment from Russia to occupied Ukraine was destroyed on the night of March 5-6 in the city of Voronezh. Another train was set on fire early on Feb. 19 the Orekhovo-Zuyevsky district of Moscow&apos;s region. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Voronezh is located approximately 465 kilometers (289 miles) south of Moscow and around approximately 279 kilometers (173 miles) northeast of Kharkiv. Ukrainian military intelligence and partisans within Russia have claimed responsibility for destruction of Russia trains multiple times in December, including two trains set ablaze near Moscow and the destruction of a train in Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-destroys-two-trains-in-russia-military-intelligence-source-claims/	2025-03-08T00:14:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1237502911.jpg
US shares intelligence with Ukraine for defense, not for attacks on Russian troops, CNN reports	The U.S. continues to share some intelligence with Ukraine to assist with defense operations, but not for attacks on Russian troops, CNN reported on March 7, citing two anonymous defense officials. According to the sources, Washington aims to avoid being seen as directly supporting strikes on Russia. However, the U.S. is not withholding information that could enhance Ukraine&apos;s defensive capabilities. The significant cutting back on U.S. intelligence sharing to Ukraine is part of the Trump administration&#x2019;s position to pressure Kyiv into quick negotiations with Russia. The sources also confirmed that Starlink, which the Ukrainian military relies on, is still operating in Ukraine as before. Starlink is owned by SpaceX, a company belonging to billionaire Elon Musk. Musk, a key ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, has drawn scrutiny at home and abroad over his repeated inflammatory comments regarding Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-continuing-to-share-some-intelligence-with-ukraine-solely-for-defense-purposes-cnn-reports/	2025-03-07T23:41:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2149305400.jpg

Russian national who killed two Ukrainian soldiers in Germany sentenced to life imprisonment	A 58-year-old Russian national has been sentenced to life imprisonment by a Munich court for murdering two Ukrainian soldiers in Germany last year, German television news channel N-Tv reported on March 7. The court ruled that the severity of the crime makes the man unlikely to qualify for early release. The victims, aged 36 and 23, were being treated for war injuries in Murnau, Bavaria. The Russian man admitted to the killings, which happened after an argument about the war broke out at a bar between him and the two soldiers. Due to the argument, the Russian citizen felt &quot;violated in his national pride,&quot; Deutsche Welle reported, citing the Central Office for Combating Extremism and Terrorism of the Munich Public Prosecutor. &quot;Now, in a sober state, I deeply regret what happened,&quot; the 58-year-old suspect said at the start of his trial. There have been multiple instances of crimes against Ukrainian citizens abroad since the start of the full-scale invasion began in 2022. Two Ukrainian basketball players, aged 17 and 18, were killed in Germany on Feb. 2024 after being attacked with knives. In another incident also in early 2024, a 15-year-old Ukrainian boy received severe head injuries and was taken to the hospital after his attacker allegedly made xenophobic remarks before the attack. The boy survived the attack.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-national-who-killed-two-ukrainian-soldiers-in-germany-sentenced-to-life-imprisonment/	2025-03-07T21:22:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1703764954.jpg
Slovakia is Europe' â€” thousands of protestors take to the streets against Fico's pro-Kremlin agenda	Thousands of protestors gathered on March 7 in more than 40 cities across Slovakia targeting the government of Prime Minister Robert Fico, Slovak media Aktuality reported. In Bratislava&#x2019;s Freedom Square, protesters chanted &#x201C;shame&#x201D; and called Fico a traitor, declaring that &#x201C;Slovakia is Europe.&#x201D; Fico&apos;s government has faced criticism for its perceived alignment with Russian interests, and his administration has repeatedly criticized Western aid to Ukraine. Demonstrators accused Fico of distancing from the European Union, and for strengthening ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. &quot;Robert Fico chose Putin, Slovakia chooses Europe,&quot; the protest organizers said. Protesters also condemned remarks by Fico&#x2019;s chief advisor, Erik Kalinak, who recently suggested that Russia&#x2019;s defeat of Ukraine would give Slovakia a &#x201C;reliable neighbor.&#x201D; Numerous large-scale protests have occurred in Slovakia in the past few months following Fico&#x2019;s remarks and visit in Dec. 2024 with Putin in Moscow. In Jan. 2025 hundreds of thousands of protestors took to the streets, chanting similar slogans including &#x201C;Enough of Fico.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/slovakia-is-europe-thousands-of-protestors-take-to-the-streets-against-ficos-pro-kremlin-agenda/	2025-03-07T19:29:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/slovakia-protest.jpg
Poland to introduce large-scale military training for all adult males, PM Tusk announces	Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced plans on March 7 to implement large-scale military training for all adult men to strengthen the country&#x2019;s reserve forces. In a speech to the Sejm, Poland&#x2019;s parliament, he noted that this initiative was in response to growing security threats from Russia. &#x201C;If Ukraine loses the war or if it accepts the terms of peace, armistice, or capitulation in such a way that weakens its sovereignty and makes it easier for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin to gain control over Ukraine, then, without a doubt &#x2014; and we can all agree on that &#x2014; Poland will find itself in a much more difficult geopolitical situation,&#x201D; Tusk said. He also said that he would like to increase the size of the Polish army from the current amount of 200,000 soldiers to 500,000, noting that Russia&#x2019;s army has around 1.3 million soldiers and Ukraine&#x2019;s has around 800,000. &quot;We will try to have a model ready by the end of this year so that every adult male in Poland is trained in the event of war, so that this reserve is comparable and adequate to the potential threats.&quot; Poland has been a key ally of Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, providing extensive military aid, including tanks, heavy equipment, and ammunition.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-to-introduce-large-scale-military-training-for-all-adult-males-pm-tusk-announces/	2025-03-07T18:44:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202961314.jpg
Drones target Bryansk Oblast in overnight attack	Drones have reportedly struck the town of Starodub in Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast in an overnight attack on March 7. Starodub is located about 130 kilometers (80 miles) from the regional capital of Bryansk and about 32 kilometers (20 miles) from the border with Ukraine. Six drones attacked the industrial facility in Starodub, according to local governor Alexander Bogomaz. A military food ration factory was targeted in the overnight attack, local officials claimed. Ukraine&apos;s &quot;Peklo&quot; drones hit the factory, local media reported. Seven explosions were heard and a fire broke out in the military factory following the strikes, locals claimed. &quot;A production facility is on fire on the territory of one of the processing plants. Residents have been evacuated from the nearest houses to ensure safety,&quot; Bogomaz said. Ukraine regularly strikes military targets on Russian territory in an effort to reduce Russia&apos;s fighting power in its war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-target-bryansk-oblast-in-overnight-attack/	2025-03-07T17:44:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1247673607.jpg
Russian attack on Dobropillia in Donetsk Oblast kills 4, injures 18	Russian forces launched multiple strikes on Dobropillia, a city in Donetsk Oblast, late on March 7, resulting in casualties and injuries, according to the head of the Donetsk Regional Military Administration. At least 4 people have been killed and 18 were injured, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin reported, noting that more people could be trapped under the rubble. Some four apartment buildings have been damaged, the official statement said. Dobropillia is located 94 kilometres north west from Russian-occupied Donetsk, the administrative center of the oblast. First responders have been dispatched to the site of the attack and search and rescue operation continues. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s decision to halt intelligence sharing with Kyiv has sparked concerns in Ukraine that Russian missile strikes could now strike the cities without prior warning. The New York Times reported on March 6 that the freeze on intelligence sharing could hinder vital alerts about incoming Russian drones and missiles. Trump made the announcement amidst a sharp decline in relations between Kyiv and Washington, as he pressures Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to agree to his proposed peace talks with Russia. Shortly after the freeze on March 5, a Russian Iskander ballistic missile struck a hotel in Kryvyi Rih, killing four people and injuring at least 30, hammering home what&apos;s at stake when Russian missiles are not intercepted.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-dobropillia-in-donetsk-oblast-kills-4-injures-18/	2025-03-07T17:02:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1407293310.jpg
Discussions with Trump team currently 'most intensive work to date,' Zelensky says	Work is underway with U.S. officials to &quot;accelerate peace,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an evening address on March 7. Ukrainian and U.S. delegations are preparing to meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days following a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Zelensky that ended in a heated argument on Feb. 28. &quot;The agenda is clear &#x2013; peace as soon as possible, security as reliable as possible. Ukraine is committed to the most constructive approach,&quot; Zelensky said. A minerals deal that was poised to be signed on Feb. 28 is likely among the topics both sides are discussing. &quot;Next week there will be a lot of work here in Europe, with (the U.S.) in Saudi Arabia &#x2013; we are preparing a meeting to accelerate peace and strengthen the foundations of security,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine continues to work with its allies who want to see peace in the embattled nation, the leader added. &quot;Today, throughout the day, the most intensive work to date has been ongoing with President Trump&apos;s team at various levels &#x2013; with many phone calls,&quot; Zelensky said. A White House official on March 3 announced a &#x201C;pause&#x201D; on U.S. weapons aid to Ukraine following the Feb. 28 meeting between Trump and Zelensky. Critics have argued an extended pause in military aid to Ukraine could have a devastating effect on Ukraine&apos;s fight against Russian aggression. &quot;I do not think we should be pausing our efforts. It&#x2019;s the Ukrainians who are shedding blood,&quot; Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee Susan Collins said.	https://kyivindependent.com/discussions-with-trump-team-currently-most-intensive-work-to-date-zelensky-says/	2025-03-07T16:30:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/photo_2024-01-29_14-15-42.jpg
Putin might consider conditional truce in Ukraine, Bloomberg reports	Russian President Vladimir Putin is reportedly considering a truce in Ukraine if certain conditions are respected, Bloomberg reported on March 7. Russian and U.S. officials met in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 for preliminary talks regarding ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine and restoring bilateral relations. Russian officials have repeatedly offered ultimatums to Ukraine rather than concessions for negotiations. Russia is open to a temporary peace settlement in Ukraine if progress will be made towards a final peace plan, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter. The Kremlin insists on organizing the framework of a pottential peacekeeping mission in Ukraine. This includes deciding what countries would take part in a peacekeeping force, a person familiar with the topic told Bloomberg. Russia first voiced its openness to a conditional truce at the Saudi Arabia summit on Feb. 18 between top U.S. and Russian officials, various people told Bloomberg asking not to be named. For armed fighting to stop there needs to be a clear understanding of a final peace plan, it&apos;s structure, and its principles, two people with an understanding of the matter said to Blooomberg. On March 4, President Volodymyr Zelensky proposed a truce in the sky and sea as well as prisoner of war (POWs) releases as a first step to establishing peace. U.S. and Ukrainian officials are due to meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days following a White House meeting between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 28 that ended with a heated arguement between the two leaders. On March 7 Trump said he is considering implementing sweeping sanctions and tariffs against Russia until a ceasefire and peace plan is reached. The U.S. leader also accused Ukraine of being more difficult to deal with than Russia, despite acknowledging &quot;Russia is bombing the hell out of Ukraine.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/conditional-truce-being-considered-by-putin-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-07T15:10:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2161636677.jpg
Voice of America correspondent Ostap Yarysh fired in DOGE crackdown	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Ukrainian correspondent Ostap Yarysh was dismissed from his role at Voice of America (VoA) on March 7 reportedly following a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) inspection. U.S. billionaire Elon Musk has previously called for the shutdown of U.S.-funded media outlets Radio Free Europe and Voice of America. Yarysh joined the VOA&apos;s Ukrainian service in 2019, covering Donald Trump&apos;s impeachment, the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 presidential election, and its aftermath. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, he has reported on U.S. military aid to Ukraine. &quot;Word gets around quickly. My friends and family found out before I could even tell them,&quot; Yarysh wrote on social media on March 7. &quot;In short, yes&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve ended (my) cooperation with Voice of America. I&#x2019;ll share more details later,&quot; he added. Yarysh was dismissed from the Voice of America during a DOGE inspection, Head of Detector Media Nataliia Ligachova said. On Feb. 9 Musk called for publically funded media to be &quot;shut down.&quot; &quot;It&#x2019;s just radical left crazy people talking to themselves while torching $1B/year of U.S. taxpayer money,&quot; Musk said. The New York Times reported on Feb. 28 that the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees VoA, launched an investigation into journalists who had spoken out against President Donald Trump&#x2019;s policies. As part of the probe, senior VoA journalist Steve Herman was placed on extended leave. He told the New York Times that he had received a letter saying the investigation was examining whether his &quot;social media activity has undermined VoA&#x2019;s audiences&#x2019; perceptions of the objectivity and/or credibility of VoA and its news operations.&quot; Additionally, anonymous sources told the New York Times that in recent months, VoA had either toned down or entirely withheld coverage that was critical of Trump and his administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/voice-of-america-correspondent-ostap-yarysh-fired-in-doge-crackdown/	2025-03-07T13:31:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/YARYSH-1.jpg
Russiaâ€™s history of violating ceasefire agreements in Ukraine	As U.S. President Donald Trump continues to push for a swift end to the war in Ukraine, fears are mounting that Kyiv could be forced to accept a peace deal on unfavorable terms, and that will leave it vulnerable to future Russian attacks. The fears aren&apos;t unfounded. After Russia invaded Ukraine&apos;s east with the use of proxies and annexed Crimea in 2014, Moscow violated multiple ceasefire deals 25 times, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a meeting with Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. &quot;We will not agree to a ceasefire without security guarantees. A document is not enough. We need a strong army. Russian soldiers fear ours, but if we have empty stockpiles, we won&apos;t have anything to defend ourselves with,&quot; Zelensky said. The Trump administration has ramped up the pressure on Ukraine to quickly negotiate an end to the war. But given Russia&apos;s history of violating ceasefire agreements, Zelensky has continued to look for firm guarantees from both the U.S. and European partners to protect against any renewed Russian aggression. &#xA0; &quot;If (Trump) can at least get a ceasefire, then he can claim credit, even if Russia violates it every day and no peace deal is ever agreed,&quot; Jenny Mathers, senior lecturer in the department of international politics at Aberystwyth University, told the Kyiv Independent.But Russia is likely uninterested in a ceasefire, said Stephen Hall, assistant Professor in Russian and post-Soviet politics at the University of Bath. &quot;(It) wants Ukrainian neutrality, &apos;denazification,&apos; and &apos;demilitarization,&apos; and all of these things that they&apos;ve been saying for the last three years.&quot;If it were to agree to any ceasefire in Ukraine through negotiations with Trump, &quot;it will only be to build up their forces and then carry the war on,&quot; Hall said. By launching the war in eastern Ukraine in 2014, Russia first and foremost violated the 1997 Russian-Ukrainian Treaty of Friendship, that &quot;confirmed the inviolability of borders&quot; between the two countries, and according to which Russia was obliged to respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine. After the start of the war in 2014, the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine, which included representatives of Ukraine, Russia, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, was formed. The Normandy Format, which Ukraine, Germany, Russia, and France chaired, was also created at this time. Following the signing of the Minsk Protocol, also known as Minsk-1, a ceasefire began at 6 p.m. on Sept. 5, 2014. The next day, Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council announced that Russian troops had fired at Ukrainian positions at least 10 times after the ceasefire was declared.

(Vasily Maximov/AFP via Getty Images)In February 2015, a document on the implementation of the Minsk agreements, also known as Minsk-2, was signed, which included a ceasefire starting Feb. 15. The agreement lasted only a few minutes, as Russian units fired on a Ukrainian checkpoint near Zolote in Luhansk Oblast, according to Ukraine&apos;s military. Since the signing of the Minsk Agreements, Russia violated the ceasefire several times a year from 2016 to 2022. The two sides tried to conclude truces on more than one Christmas and New Year holidays, the start of the school year, or the harvest. None of them lasted. On July 21, 2019, a &quot;harvest&quot; truce came into effect. Following the start of the ceasefire, one violation occurred when Ukrainian positions were shelled. A year later, a &quot;full and comprehensive ceasefire&quot; was declared in eastern Ukraine on July 27, 2020. Within 30 minutes, Russian forces attacked the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, according to Ukrainian military reports. In October 2020, the number of Russian attacks increased, and an extraordinary meeting of the Trilateral Contact Group was convened. It agreed to extend the &quot;full and comprehensive ceasefire.&quot; The agreement again did not last long. &quot;I will be absolutely flabbergasted if the Russians (conclude a ceasefire) and they actually uphold it,&quot; Hall told the Kyiv Independent. Trump has repeatedly claimed that he wants a swift end to the war between Ukraine and Russia. In the meantime, he has suspended military aid and U.S. intelligence to Ukraine, putting the war-torn country under even greater threat. &quot;The U.S. is taking steps to reduce Ukraine&apos;s capacity to wage war in an effort to persuade Ukraine&apos;s political and military leadership that they have no hope of victory &#x2014; however that might be defined by Kyiv &#x2014; and must instead agree to whatever terms are offered by Russia via Washington,&quot; Mathers said. According to Mathers, Trump is &quot;showing blatant favoritism&quot; to Russia by ruling out Ukraine&apos;s ability to join NATO or revealing his eagerness to restore economic and diplomatic relations with Moscow. &quot;It is pretty clear that if Trump gets his way, Kyiv will feel that it has no choice except to agree to a ceasefire that would, in fact, be a surrender,&quot; Mathers said. Given the uncertainty over further U.S. assistance and potential security guarantees, the Ukrainian government has increasingly called on its European partners to invest in their defense and help Ukraine.

(Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images)The Trump administration&apos;s actions have also forced Europe to review its approach to defense funding. Ursula von der Leyen on March 4 presented the ReArm Europe plan to strengthen Europe&apos;s defense capabilities. The EU agreed to mobilize up to 800 billion euros ($867 billion) for defense spending on March 7. Mark Temnycky, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council&apos;s Eurasia Center, believes that sending European troops to Ukraine could provide the necessary defense against any future Russian attacks. International support for Ukraine&apos;s defense innovation and manufacturing capabilities would also act as a future deterrent, according to Temnycky.	https://kyivindependent.com/neglecting-security-guarantees-trump-fast-tracking-efforts-to-persuade-ukraine-to-ceasefire-with-russia/	2025-03-07T13:25:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1187447613.jpg
â€˜We will adaptâ€™ â€” Ukraineâ€™s soldiers say after US intel cut	Days after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a pause in sharing U.S. intelligence, the Ukrainian military has reported little effect from that decision on the front. The pause is likely to have a higher toll on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, experts and military officials say. The U.S. stopped sharing intelligence with Ukraine on March 5, soon after freezing all military assistance in an effort to pressure Kyiv into quick negotiations with Russia. Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, said the Ukrainians had &quot;brought this on themselves,&quot; for not cooperating in peace talks. U.S. aerospace company Maxar Technologies has also reportedly restricted Ukraine&apos;s access to its satellite imagery, according to the Ukrainian media outlet Militarnyi. Ukrainian officials said they are working on alternatives with foreign partners. French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu confirmed that France is continuing to provide its intelligence to Ukraine. &#x201C;There is nothing unique about the United States&#x2019; intelligence capabilities. It is possible to replace them,&#x201D; Mykhailo Samus, military expert and director of the New Geopolitics Research Network, told the Kyiv Independent. A satellite image shows a convoy of Russian troops near Ivankiv, Ukraine, heading toward Kyiv on Feb. 28, 2022. (2022 Maxar Technologies)Effects on battlefieldSeveral soldiers and commanders fighting across the front said that the intelligence cutoff has little to no effect on their battlefield operations. At the tactical level, the Ukrainian army has a range of means to get its own intelligence, mostly from drone surveillance. Other sources include the Ukrainian-made situational awareness system Delta, praised by NATO after testing in 2024, and regular reconnaissance operations. &#x201C;My drones give me the intelligence,&#x201D; said &#x2018;Spys,&#x2019; an artilleryman fighting in Kursk Oblast who is being identified by callsign only for security reasons. According to Samus, American intelligence may have had only a sporadic impact on the frontline. &#x201C;I am convinced that the frontline will cope without intelligence from our U.S. partners,&#x201D; said Yurii Fedorenko, commander of the elite unmanned systems regiment &#x201C;Achilles&#x201D; fighting in Kharkiv Oblast. Yaroslav &quot;Strilok,&quot; a soldier of the Achilles Strike Drone Battalion, carries a first-person view drone at positions near Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, on Dec. 8, 2025. (Aria Shahrokhshahi/The Kyiv Independent)However, both military and experts agree that &#x201C;there&#x2019;s never too much intel&#x201D; when it comes to battlefield operations. &#x201C;Ukraine has managed to develop the production of intelligence tools that allow us to cover a certain operational depth,&#x201D; Fedorenko said. &#x201C;But in war, it is important to control the enemy at all stages, from production and logistics to the areas of concentration, and then to the front line,&#x201D; he added. Since early 2024, Ukraine has regularly conducted drone strikes deep within Russia and Russian-controlled territories, hitting military and strategic targets such as oil refineries. The strikes have helped to slow down Russia&#x2019;s frontline logistics and reduce Moscow&apos;s gas and oil exports that fuel its war effort. The U.S. intelligence cutoff is unlikely to threaten the planning of those operations by restricting Ukraine&#x2019;s access to satellite images, as &#x201C;Ukraine has its own satellites,&#x201D; Samus said. Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR) confirmed that Ukraine&#x2019;s crowdfunded satellite had taken over 4,000 images of Russian facilities, used to cause &quot;billions of dollars&quot; in losses to Russia. &#x201C;We still have good intel from our own means,&#x201D; Samus said, &#x201C;And we have (Ukrainian-made) drones that can &#x201C;see&#x201D; at least a couple hundred kilometers deep (into Russia).&#x201D; A soldier who asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive matters told the Kyiv Independent that his unit sometimes seeks intel from HUR, which is consistently better and more up-to-date than the intel available within the Ukrainian Armed Forces. As of this publication, HUR hasn&apos;t responded to a request for comment. The main burn of the intelligence cutoff will be felt by Ukrainian civilians, experts said, as it threatens Ukraine&apos;s ability to detect on time Russian aerial strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. &#x201C;The air defense system does not rely on satellite information, but on information from long-range radars,&#x201C; Viktor Kevliuk, a retired military officer and defense expert, told the Kyiv Independent. Radars are usually turned off to avoid detection by the enemy, he said. But they are turned on to monitor the air situation at long distances when satellites warn of enemy launches of cruise missile carriers or ground- and sea-based ballistic missiles. &#x201C;The U.S. actions deprive the Ukrainian Defense Forces of knowing in advance about the beginning of an air attack,&#x201D; Kevliuk added. The U.S. Airborne Warning &amp; Control System (AWACS) planes used radars that worked 400-500 kilometers deep within Russia, Samus said. He underscored that Ukraine&#x2019;s European partners have the same electronic reconnaissance capabilities and might share this information.

(Vlada Liberova/Libkos via Getty Images)As an alternative, Ukraine can fill up the gap in this intelligence with two Swedish-provided ASC 890 aircraft that were included in a Swedish military aid package for Ukraine last May. &#x201C;They would detect (enemy activity) 300 kilometers into Russian territory, including the activity of Iskander (ballistic missile systems), strategic aviation, and so on,&#x201D; Samus added. A Swedish official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Kyiv Independent that the planes are scheduled to arrive in Ukraine later this year. It leaves concerns about the harm to civilians that Russian attacks could inflict until then. &#x201C;Take the Oreshnik, for example,&#x201D; said Myroslav Hai, an officer in the Ukrainian army. Russia launched its nuclear-capable &#x2018;Oreshnik&#x2019; missile against Ukraine on Nov. 21. &#x201C;U.S. intelligence knows when Russia is planning something very bad for our cities. And if they were to withhold this information, it just means that more Ukrainian civilians will die,&#x201D; Hai told The Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;This is not the first time that the U.S. have taken such steps,&#x201D; Fedorenko said, citing months-long delays in military aid and selective provision of intelligence about Russia in the past. During the full-scale war, Ukraine has managed to overcome many changes and difficulties, and it will adapt to the U.S. intelligence cutoff, soldiers said. &#x201C;We will endure,&#x201D; &#x2018;Bart,&#x2019; a special forces sniper fighting in the Pokrovsk direction who is being identified by callsign only, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Russia is running out of breath here.&#x201D; Ukrainian soldiers of the 93rd Brigade take part in combat drills outside Pokrovsk, Ukraine, on Feb. 13, 2025. (Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu via Getty Images)The pause in intelligence sharing is just the latest of a series of striking measures taken by the the U.S. administration that are working in Russia&#x2019;s favor, filling Ukrainians with disappointment about its once-ally. &#x201C;It will not surprise me if (Trump) starts giving intelligence to (the Russians),&#x201D; &#x2018;Bart&#x2019; added. &#x201C;(The U.S.) has sided with Russia and are allowing it to use its weapons more effectively,&#x201D; Samus said. &#x201C;They used to be called the leader of the democratic world, but not anymore. Now they are people who make decisions that facilitate war crimes,&#x201D; he added. &#x201D;This is a catastrophe for the United States, not for us.&#x201D; Toma Istomina contributed reporting.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-will-adapt-ukraines-soldiers-say-after-us-intel-cut/	2025-03-07T12:55:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202285720.jpg
Ukraineâ€™s DTEK gas production facilities shut down after Russian attack	Ukrainian energy company DTEK&apos;s gas production facilities in Poltava Oblast were attacked by Russia on the morning of March 7, forcing them to halt operations due to the damage, the company reported. DTEK is Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy company, and its facilities have been repeatedly targeted since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion as Moscow looks to destroy Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure. Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least two people and injured 24 others over the past day, regional officials said on March 7. In Poltava Oblast, debris from a downed aerial target hit a house, injuring two people, including a child, Governor Filip Pronin said. Ukraine&apos;s main gas production facilities are in front-line regions like Kharkiv and Poltava, making them vulnerable to Russian attacks. Strikes on gas infrastructure have repeatedly reduced production, at times by 40%. Before the full-scale war, Ukraine produced 52 million cubic meters of gas daily but needed 110&#x2013;140 million cubic meters in winter, covering the gap from storage. Russian strikes have reduced domestic production, forcing Ukraine to increase imports. In February, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said the country would need at least 1 billion cubic meters of imported gas by the end of 2025. Ukraine imported 560 million cubic meters of gas from Europe in February, nearly matching the total of 700 million cubic meters for the previous heating season. Bloomberg reported on March 4 that Ukraine plans to import 3.5 billion cubic meters for the next winter. Ukraine&apos;s gas import plans come as Europe faces high competition and rising prices while working to replenish low gas reserves. At the start of 2025, Ukraine halted its transit agreement to transport Russian gas to European customers through its pipelines, as the deal expired at the end of 2024 and was not renewed.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-dtek-gas-production-facilities-shut-down-after-russian-attack/	2025-03-07T12:41:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2147953046.jpg
Ukraine signs LNG deal with Polandâ€™s Orlen amid Russian attacks	Ukraine&apos;s largest state-owned energy company, Naftogaz, and Poland&apos;s petroleum refineries company, Orlen, have signed a contract for the supply of approximately 100 million cubic meters (mcm) of liquefied natural gas (LNG), Naftogaz announced on March 7. As Russia continues targeting Ukraine&#x2019;s energy grid&#x2014;specifically its gas infrastructure&#x2014;domestic gas production has declined due to Russian strikes, forcing Ukraine to increase imports. The gas supply agreement was formalized alongside a strategic cooperation document on LNG supply, Naftogaz said. &quot;Partnering with ORLEN strengthens energy security, diversifies supply routes, and accelerates Ukraine&apos;s integration into the European gas market,&quot; said Roman Chumak, CEO of Naftogaz. The gas will come from an LNG shipment delivered to a terminal in Klaipeda, Lithuania. From there, it will be transported through Lithuania and Poland before reaching Ukraine via the Drozdovychi interconnector, where Naftogaz will receive it. Robert Soszynski, vice president of Polish ORLEN, described the cooperation agreement as &quot;mutually beneficial.&quot; &quot;Our relationship will be based on commercial terms, but securing an additional gas source is also crucial for Ukraine&#x2019;s security,&quot; he said. On Feb. 11, Russia launched a combined missile and drone attack on Ukraine, primarily targeting Poltava Oblast and damaging Naftogaz production facilities in the region. Before the full-scale invasion, Ukraine produced 52 million cubic meters (mcm) of gas per day but required 110-140 million mcm in winter, covering the shortfall from storage. Russian attacks have since reduced Ukraine&#x2019;s domestic gas output, increasing its reliance on foreign purchases. Ukraine plans to import about 3.5 billion cubic meters of gas for the upcoming heating season due to ongoing Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure, Bloomberg reported on March 4. At the start of 2025, Ukraine halted its agreement with Russia to transport Russian gas to European customers via Ukrainian pipelines. The deal expired at the end of 2024 and was not renewed.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-signs-lng-deal-with-polands-orlen-amid-russian-attacks/	2025-03-07T12:25:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2147892507.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukrainian troops' logistics in Kursk Oblast destroyed, they face risk of encirclement, sources say	Key developments on March 7: Russian forces have destroyed Ukrainian troops&apos; logistics in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, and Ukrainian soldiers face the risk of encirclement, a Ukrainian soldier and a medic deployed in the region told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity on March 7. The confirmation came after several media reported that Russian forces had made a breakthrough south of the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast. The Ukrainian battlefield monitoring group DeepState has confirmed a push deep into Ukrainian positions toward the Ukrainian state border in Sumy Oblast. A Ukrainian soldier fighting in Kursk Oblast described the situation in the Russian region as &quot;critical,&quot; warning that Ukrainian troops in the region face the threat of encirclement. He added that Ukrainian soldiers based in the region would like to withdraw. According to the source, all bridges in the vicinity of Sudzha have been destroyed, and Ukrainian troops are cut off from ammunition and fuel supplies. The Ukrainian medic stationed in Kursk Oblast told the Kyiv Independent that Russia&apos;s breakthrough happened about three days ago, and Russian troops control all the roads. According to DeepState, &quot;the most critical situation&quot; is on the border of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast and Ukraine&apos;s Sumy Oblast. Russian troops are trying to push on Ukrainian positions near the villages of Zhuravka and Novenke in Sumy Oblast, DeepState reported. Russia has also intensified its attacks near the village of Kurilovka near the border with Sumy Oblast, some 5 kilometers (3 miles) south of Sudzha, DeepState said in its latest update on March 7. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Earlier in the day, the spokesperson of the Ukrainian group of forces in Kursk Oblast declined to comment on the situation in the Russian region. Russian forces have recently intensified efforts to break through to Sumy Oblast and cut off logistical routes of the Ukrainian salient in bordering Kursk Oblast. Kyiv has sought to maintain its position in the Russian border region as leverage for possible peace talks. Moscow&apos;s troops have almost reached the Ukrainian border south of Ukrainian positions in Sudzha, meaning that at least some areas have been cut off from the main salient, the independent Russian outlet Agentstvo reported on March 7, citing an expert from the Conflict Intelligence Team. &quot;Difficult battles continue in the border area of Sumy Oblast; Russian assault units are attempting to break through and move toward a highway from Yunakivka (in Sumy Oblast) to Sudzha in Kursk Oblast,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &quot;(Ukraine&apos;s) Defense Forces are fighting and dealing significant casualties to Russian troops,&quot; Kovalenko claimed, without confirming a Russian breakthrough. The prominent Russian pro-war channel Two Majors also reported on the advance, claiming that Moscow&apos;s troops have penetrated up to 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) deep into Ukrainian positions. U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 7 that he is considering imposing sweeping banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until there is a ceasefire and peace agreement. According to Trump, his statement is based on the fact that Russia &quot;is absolutely &#x2018;pounding&#x2019; Ukraine on the battlefield&quot; - a possible reference to Russia&apos;s recent advances in Kursk Oblast or Russia&apos;s large-scale missile and drone attack on Ukraine on March 7. &quot;Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely &apos;pounding&apos; Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large-scale banking sanctions, sanctions, and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and final settlement agreement on peace is reached,&quot; Trump wrote on the Truth Social media platform. &quot;To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. Thank you!&quot; Shortly after his inauguration, Trump threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions on Russia to force their hand in negotiations, saying &quot;we can do it the easy way or the hard way.&quot; In the following weeks, Trump instead lashed out at Ukraine, claiming President Volodymyr Zelensky was &quot;not ready for peace&quot; and halting military aid to Ukraine and intelligence sharing with Kyiv. U.S. President Donald Trump said at a press briefing on March 7 that he finds it more difficult to deal with Kyiv than with Moscow but admitted that &quot;Russia is bombing the hell out of Ukraine.&quot; When asked during the press briefing why the U.S. wouldn&apos;t provide more air defense to Ukraine instead of halting military aid, Trump replied that he has to know &quot;they want to settle.&quot; &quot;If (the Ukrainians) don&apos;t want to settle, we&apos;re out of there,&quot; he said. &quot;I think he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) is doing what anybody else would do. I think he wants to get (the war) ended, but he&apos;s hitting them harder than ever, which is what anybody would be doing in his place,&quot; Trump added. The U.S. president also said he wants Russia&apos;s full-scale war to end before making any security guarantees to Ukraine. On the contrary, Kyiv insists on security guarantees before reaching a peace deal with Russia. Ukraine&apos;s French-provided Mirage 2000 fighter jets took part in repelling a Russian air attack on Ukraine for the first time on March 7, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Russia launched a large-scale aerial assault overnight, firing 67 missiles of various types and deploying 194 drones. Ukraine&apos;s air defenses intercepted 34 missiles and 100 drones, with anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare systems, and mobile fire groups contributing to the effort. Fighter jets, including F-16s and French Mirage 2000s, were also deployed. Russia targeted energy and gas infrastructure across the country, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said. At least two people were injured as a result of the attacks after a Russian missile damaged two residential buildings in Poltava Oblast, injuring one adult and one child. No information was immediately available as to the status of their injuries. Russia initially launched a series of missiles around 4 a.m. local time, targeting various regions in the country&apos;s far west. A second series of missiles entered Ukrainian airspace around 6 a.m. The aftermath of a Russian attack on Ukraine overnight on March 7, 2025. (State Emergency Service)Explosions were reported in the western city of Ternopil around 5 a.m. local time, following the first series of attacks, Suspilne reported. Later in the morning, explosions were heard in the front line city of Kharkiv around 6:30 a.m. Ternopil Oblast Regional Governor Viacheslav Nehoda reported that a critical infrastructure facility in the region had been struck with a Russian missile. Although no injuries were reported, Nehoda added that gas supplies may be interrupted as a result of the attack. Critical infrastructure facilities were also targeted in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, though no damage or casualties were reported, according to Governor Svitlana Onyshchuk. Russia struck already the sixth facility of the DTEK energy company in Odesa Oblast in the past two and a half weeks, the company said. Critical infrastructure facilities were also targeted in Chernihiv Oblast, with at least one of them suffering damage, according to Governor Viacheslav Chaus. Several EU members have pledged to provide up to 15 billion euros ($16.3 billion) in additional aid for Ukraine, European Council President Antonio Costa said at a summit on March 6. EU leaders met in Brussels to discuss plans for boosting Europe&apos;s defense capabilities and support for Ukraine amid the seismic foreign policy shifts in the U.S. Ukraine&apos;s President Volodmyr Zelensky also took part in the meeting. The summit concluded without additional EU aid packages for Ukraine as the discussed 20-billion-euro tranche ($22 billion) was dropped from the final declaration. Kyiv needs more support now than ever, as the Trump administration has frozen all military assistance flowing to the country. As any EU-wide assistance package is under threat of being blocked by Hungary&apos;s Moscow-friendly leader, Viktor Orban, top EU officials suggested that further aid should be provided through a &quot;coalition of the willing.&quot; &quot;Immediately, member states can increase their support thanks to the increased fiscal space,&quot; Costa said at a press conference in Brussels. During the summit, EU leaders unanimously agreed on a new defense initiative that could mobilize up to 800 billion euros ($867 billion) through loans and loosening fiscal rules for government spending. &quot;Several member states have already announced their pledges up to 15 billion euros. Today, we have also tasked the Council to work urgently on further initiatives to address Ukraine&#x2019;s pressing military and defense needs,&quot; Costa said, without naming the countries. &quot;This is a tipping point for Europe. And today, we have shown that the European Union is rising to the challenge,&quot; the European Council president said.

Republicans urge Trump to resume military, intelligence assistance to Ukraine	Republican lawmakers are calling on President Donald Trump to resume U.S. military and intelligence assistance to Ukraine, the Hill reported on March 7. The Trump administration halted U.S. military aid to Ukraine and intelligence sharing with Kyiv earlier this week following a heated exchange between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28. The decision is intended to put pressure on Zelensky in peace talks with Russia. Shortly after U.S. halted intelligence-sharing, Russia launched another large-scale aerial attack on Ukraine overnight on March 7, launching 67 missiles of various types and 194 drones. Ukraine&apos;s air defenses intercepted 34 missiles and 100 drones, the Air Force said. Republicans say that Trump had the right to temporarily suspend weapons supplies to Kyiv in order to assess the war, put pressure on NATO allies, and to create a window for peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, according to the Hill. But some warned that an excessively long pause in military aid could have a devastating effect on Ukraine&apos;s combat capabilities and undermine its leverage in talks with Moscow. &quot;I do not think we should be pausing our efforts. It&#x2019;s the Ukrainians who are shedding blood,&quot; said Susan Collins, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee. She called the suspension of U.S. military aid a &quot;critical time for Ukraine.&quot; Some Republicans also urged Trump to immediately resume intelligence sharing with Ukraine. John Cornyn, a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that the intelligence that Ukrainians received from the U.S. &quot;has been essential for them to be able to stay in the fight.&quot; Senator Thom Tillis warned that a pause in aid to Ukraine &quot;could be helpful to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,&quot; but he didn&apos;t oppose the stoppage if it was a short-term &quot;negotiating tactic.&quot; Senate Majority Leader John Thune also suggested that a pause in U.S. military aid would be temporary and could be part of talks. The halt in military aid leaves over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition undelivered to Kyiv, while the pause in intelligence sharing affects warnings against Russian drones and missiles striking Ukrainian military and civilian targets, Ukrainian and U.S. officials told the New York Times.	https://kyivindependent.com/republicans-call-on-trump-to/	2025-03-07T11:36:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202741274.jpg
In Kyiv, Trump's intel freeze raises fears of Russian missiles striking without warning	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s decision to pause sharing intelligence with Kyiv has raised fears in major Ukrainian cities that Russian missile attacks could now occur without any warning. &quot;It will be a catastrophe,&quot; Oleh Yeremenov, a fourth-year film directing student, told the Kyiv Independent on the streets of Kyiv on March 6. &quot;If missiles just start hitting out of nowhere&#x2026; people will panic.&quot; According to the New York Times (NYT) on March 6, the intelligence-sharing freeze could affect crucial warnings about incoming Russian drones and missiles. Trump announced the move amid sharply deteriorating relations between Kyiv and Washington, as he strong-arms Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into acquiescing to his plans for peace talks with Russia. Compounding the problem, the U.S. has also frozen military aid to Ukraine, meaning crucial air defense interceptor missiles could be in short supply until it resumes.

(The Kyiv Independent) Shortly after the freeze on March 5, a Russian Iskander ballistic missile struck a hotel in Kryvyi Rih, killing four people and injuring at least 30, hammering home what&apos;s at stake when Russian missiles are not intercepted. &quot;They don&apos;t think about the consequences this will have,&quot; &#xA0;Stanislav Khmel, a Kyiv resident who is currently unemployed, said. &quot;I think this will result in more casualties for us, for our people.&quot; In the early hours of March 7, Russia launched a mass aerial attack at civilian energy infrastructure in cities across the country, firing cruise missiles from bomber aircraft, ballistic missiles, as well as nearly 200 kamikaze drones. Ukraine&apos;s air raid alert system, as well as Telegram monitoring channels that the public rely on to know what has been launched and where it is headed, all worked as normal, suggesting Kyiv still has access to intelligence on missiles launched from Russian aircraft. But several successful hits were recorded, with explosions reported in Poltava, Kharkiv, Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Odesa oblasts. With both the military and intelligence freezes still in place, concerns are rising that the death and destruction caused by Russian strikes could worsen significantly. People interviewed by the Kyiv Independent said their lives &#x201C;hinge on&#x201D; accurate air raid threat data, and the timely sounding of alerts. &quot;Maybe I will be the one who won&apos;t have time to react, and a drone will hit me, my building, or the building of my family or friends,&quot; barista Andrii Horbulia &#xA0;said. Despite Zelensky calling the now infamous Oval Office clash with Trump &quot;regrettable&quot; on March 4, and talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials scheduled for next week, there have been no clear signals from the White House about when the intelligence and aid freezes will be lifted.

In Kyiv, Trump's intel freeze raises fears of Russian missiles striking without warning	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s decision to pause sharing intelligence with Kyiv has raised fears in major Ukrainian cities that Russian missile attacks could now occur without any warning. &quot;It will be a catastrophe,&quot; Oleh Yeremenov, a fourth-year film directing student, told the Kyiv Independent on the streets of Kyiv on March 6. &quot;If missiles just start hitting out of nowhere&#x2026; people will panic.&quot; According to the New York Times (NYT) on March 6, the intelligence-sharing freeze could affect crucial warnings about incoming Russian drones and missiles. Trump announced the move amid sharply deteriorating relations between Kyiv and Washington, as he strong-arms Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into acquiescing to his plans for peace talks with Russia. Compounding the problem, the U.S. has also frozen military aid to Ukraine, meaning crucial air defense interceptor missiles could be in short supply until it resumes.

Trump accuses Ukraine of being 'more difficult to deal with' than Russia	U.S. President Donald Trump said at a press briefing on March 7 that he finds it more difficult to deal with Kyiv than with Moscow but admitted that &quot;Russia is bombing the hell out of Ukraine.&quot; Earlier in the day, Trump said that he is considering imposing sweeping banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until there is a ceasefire and peace agreement. He added that &quot;Russia is absolutely &apos;pounding&apos; Ukraine on the battlefield right now.&quot; When asked during the press briefing why the U.S. wouldn&apos;t provide more air defense to Ukraine instead of halting military aid, Trump replied that he has to know &quot;they want to settle.&quot; &quot;If (the Ukrainians) don&apos;t want to settle, we&apos;re out of there,&quot; he said. &quot;I think he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) is doing what anybody else would do. I think he wants to get (the war) ended, but he&apos;s hitting them harder than ever, which is what anybody would be doing in his place,&quot; Trump added. The U.S. president also said he wants Russia&apos;s full-scale war to end before making any security guarantees to Ukraine. On the contrary, Kyiv insists on security guarantees before reaching a peace deal with Russia. Trump has long promised to bring about a swift end to Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, though progress towards such a deal was disrupted after he ejected President Volodymyr Zelensky from the White House on Feb. 28 and claimed Ukraine was &quot;not ready for peace.&quot; Following the clash, Trump halted military aid to Ukraine, including intelligence sharing with Kyiv, as part of an effort to pressure Kyiv into quick negotiations with Moscow. U.S. and Ukrainian delegations are planning to meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 to discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement. Meanwhile, Zelensky has proposed a &quot;truce in the sky&quot; banning missiles, long-range drones, and bombs targeting civilian infrastructure, as well as a &quot;truce at sea&quot; as the first steps towards the de-escalation. Trump&apos;s March 7 threat to impose sanctions on Moscow and his statement on Russia &quot;pounding&quot; Ukraine comes amid Russian aerial attacks against Ukraine in recent days. As Russia kept launching drones and missiles at Ukraine, &quot;Trump&apos;s rage has been intensifying,&quot; Axios reported on March 7, citing an unnamed White House official. Russia launched another large-scale aerial attack on Ukraine overnight on March 7, launching 67 missiles of various types and 194 drones. Ukraine&apos;s air defenses intercepted 34 missiles and 100 drones, the Air Force said.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-accuses-kyiv-of-being-more-difficult-to-deal-with-says-russia-bombing-the-hell-out-of-ukraine/	2025-03-07T10:34:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203345473.jpg
How Europe is gearing up for a new world order	In a city usually synonymous with bloated bureaucracy, not all official gatherings are worth the fuss. The emergency EU summit on March 6, however, was one to remember. EU member states agreed to unlock what could amount to an unprecedented 800 billion euros ($867 billion) for defense spending amid mounting signs the U.S. is no longer a reliable ally, and the defense of Ukraine is falling squarely on their shoulders. &quot;Europe is finally waking up and hearing the alarm bells,&quot; one senior European diplomat with knowledge of the discussions told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;These kinds of discussions wouldn&apos;t have happened two or three weeks ago, let alone two or three months ago.&quot; The impetus for the emergency summit were the recent actions of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has become increasingly hostile toward Ukraine and Europe, as he seeks what appears to be a rapprochement with a newly-emboldened Kremlin. Speaking at the summit, European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen summed up the crisis facing Europe, describing it as a &quot;watershed moment&quot; where Europe faces a &quot;clear and present danger.&quot; While the EU is trying to step up to meet the moment, another alliance of nations from Europe and beyond is also taking shape. With the U.S. receding from its role as a guarantor of European security and pulling vital intelligence and military support from Ukraine, Europe is preparing to fend for itself. &quot;It&apos;s like a nightmare we want to wake up from,&quot; an EU official told the Kyiv Independent at the Brussels summit. The Trump administration&apos;s about-turn away from more than eighty years of U.S. global leadership has prompted the outline for a new alliance of nations to secure peace for Ukraine and Europe. Led by France and the U.K., the so-called &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; could be made up of a mix of EU states, other European countries, and like-minded partners including Canada and Australia. &quot;The wider the better&quot; said the EU official, &quot;if we can count on Norway and the U.K., why not?&quot; they added, in a sign that Brexit now appears to be a distant memory.

(Nicolas Tucat/AFP via Getty Images)Paris has proposed a path to peace that would start with a one-month truce in the air and at sea. French President Emmanuel Macron said this would give Russia a chance to prove it is serious about peace. Crucially, this plan also received support from President Volodymyr Zelensky at the meeting of EU leaders on March 6 &#x2014; paving the way for a wider plan to be formulated with the help from U.K. and Ukraine which will then be presented to the U.S. and, eventually, Russia. But how any peace deal might be enforced remains a topic of debate among coalition leaders. &quot;There is no problem finding willing countries, the problem is figuring out what and how to enforce,&quot; another senior EU diplomat told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Discussions won&apos;t be concrete until we know what there is to enforce.&quot; Coalition countries have so far pledged varying levels of support to a future peacekeeping force for Ukraine. Speaking at a press conference alongside U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 27, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that together, the countries were &quot;ready to support Ukraine with troops on the ground and planes in the air.&quot; The U.K. and France have clearly said they would send troops to Ukraine to uphold a peace deal. Around ten other countries, including Spain, Portugal, Australia, Denmark, Canada, and Turkey, said they could be open to sending peacekeepers, while others, including the Netherlands and Ireland, committed logistical and technological support to the plan. New steps to support Ukraine have already been taken in the short term &#x2014; Norway announced it would more than double its support this year, the U.K. will give Ukraine an additional $2 billion for air defense, and Franco-British Starlink competitor Eutelsat is in discussions with Ukraine on reducing its dependence on Elon Musk&apos;s technology. The next step will be a meeting next week, convened in Paris by President Macron, of military chiefs from countries willing to commit troops to enforce peace in Ukraine in an effort to coordinate and draw up a potential peacekeeping mission. The EU, for its part, does not have authority or responsibility over defense, but it can provide financial assistance. EU leaders&apos; meeting in Brussels on March 6 took steps towards a dramatic long-term transformation of European defense, pledging to &quot;substantially increase expenditure on Europe&apos;s security and defense&quot; and tasking the European Commission to find more money and more financial tools to help member states quickly ramp up military spending. &quot;Russia is leading a hybrid war against our democracies. It seeks to uproot the world we have, a world of peace which we built since the end of the Cold War,&quot; French Europe Minister Benjamin Haddad told the Kyiv Independent at the meeting. &quot;We will define the areas in which we&apos;re lacking, be it ammunition, drones, or cyber, and then figure out common European financing to support member states in making those investments,&quot; he added. One of the ways it plans to support this surge in defense spending is through a 150 billion euro ($162 billion) fund from which member states can borrow money to spend on collective European defense, or to support Ukraine. The leaders also endorsed another crucial step for the EU &#x2014; getting out of the way. The bloc will loosen its debt rules, allowing member states to dramatically increase their defense spending by borrowing more. Should all EU states decide to ramp up defense spending by 1.5% of GDP on average, these new rules could mean an additional 650 billion euros ($705 billion) spent on defense in the EU over four years. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk didn&apos;t mince his words on the sense of urgency. &quot;There is no doubt that the war in Ukraine, the new approach of the American administration to Europe, and the arms race started by Russia pose completely new challenges to us,&quot; Tusk told reporters at the meeting. &quot;Europe must join this arms race and win it.&quot; EU leaders also made another significant move highlighting this new sense of urgency &#x2014; ignoring Hungary. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban chose not to support the bloc&apos;s statement of intent on continued support for Ukraine on the battlefield, in peace talks, and beyond. Rather than trying to convince Orban, the 26 other EU leaders decided to crack on without him. &quot;Hungary has always made things difficult; it&apos;s good that the rest said, &apos;We don&apos;t buy it; you go your own way.&apos; It&apos;s just more pragmatic to ignore Prime Minister Orban,&quot; the EU diplomat said. That sentiment was echoed by European Council President Antonio Costa. &quot;Hungary is isolated,&quot; he said at the end of the meeting. &quot;We respect Hungary&apos;s position, but it&apos;s one of 27. And 26 are more than one.&quot; (L-R) Cyprus&apos; President Nikos Christodoulides speaks with Hungary&apos;s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, EU Commission Vice-President Kaja Kallas, and Poland&apos;s Prime Minister Donald Tusk before an EU summit in Brussels, Belgium, on March 6, 2025. (Thierry Monasse/Getty Images)The Hungarian leader lashed out after the meeting, aligning himself with Trump and accusing other EU leaders of wanting to &quot;continue the war (in Ukraine) as long as it takes.&quot; This sets up another clash between Budapest and the 26 other member states in the coming weeks. Not having Hungary on board at this meeting made little practical difference, but upcoming debates about renewing sanctions against Russia, continuing to freeze Russian assets, or new support packages for Ukraine could still see Hungary grinding the EU to a halt. That, and the fact the EU is fundamentally not designed to tackle defense issues, means the future of European military rearmament, and Ukrainian survival, will rely on the commitment of individual EU countries, and allies further afield. In a clear sign of the importance of these new partnerships, the presidents of the European Commission and European Council, as well as the EU&apos;s top diplomat Kaja Kallas, convened a video call with the leaders of the U.K., Turkey, Canada, Norway, and Iceland to debrief them on the EU&apos;s new plans. As Europe gears up for this new reality, EU officials speaking to the Kyiv Independent were stoic, &quot;The spirit of our discussions is that Europe will have to go it alone. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/how-europe-is-gearing-up-for-a-new-world-order/	2025-03-07T10:15:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202965061.jpg
Belarus Weekly: Belarus, Russia ratify security pact, expanding nuclear umbrella, military integration	Belarus and Russia ratified the Union State Security Pact, expanding the nuclear umbrella and military integration. Belarusian dictator Aleksandr Lukashenko invites U.S President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and Russian President Vladimir Putin to Minsk for peace talks. Belarus criminalizes sharing information on military movements and expands in absentia prosecution of exiled opponents. Local media reported that a stray drone crashed into power lines in Belarus, causing outages in Mazyr. Belarus hits record low in the Freedom House report, ranking 192-194 out of 207 globally. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko have concluded the ratification of the Union State security guarantees, expanding Russia&#x2019;s nuclear umbrella over Belarus and deepening the military integration of the two countries. The Union State security pact was signed on Dec. 6, stipulating that Russian nuclear weapons can be used against an aggressor state &#x2014; even ones that don&#x2019;t have nuclear weapons themselves. Putin signed the law ratifying the agreement on Feb. 28, after speedy consideration in Russia&#x2019;s State Duma in February. Belarus&#x2019;s Lukashenko signed the ratification law on March 4, his press office reported. The pact will enter into force after the sides exchange ratification documents. The security pact signing comes on the same day the Russian parliament ratified another agreement postponing Belarus&#x2019;s repayment of about $800 million in Russian state loans. Opposition politician Pavel Latushka, formerly an official in the Belarusian foreign ministry, linked the two ratifications. &#x201C;Lukashenko got himself into debt with Russia, and now he&#x2019;s paying with the country&#x2019;s national sovereignty,&#x201D; Latushka said. Beyond expanding the Russian &#x201C;nuclear umbrella&#x201D; to cover Belarus, Article 5 of the agreement provides for the establishment of Russian military bases and stationing of Russian troops on the territory of Belarus &#x201C;to prevent and repel acts of aggression.&#x201D; However, the implementation of this provision would require a separate agreement between Minsk and Moscow. Russia has been pushing to establish an air base in Belarus since 2015. The treaty also obliges the parties to &#x201C;support&#x201D; each other in the event of a threat to their constitutional orders &#x2014; allowing each to potentially intervene to suppress public protests in either of the two countries. The Union State security agreement lasts for ten years and is automatically extended, unless one of the parties declares its intention to withdraw six months in advance. According to NATO estimates, Belarus hosted up to 30,000 Russian troops in the buildup to the Russian attack on Kyiv in February-March 2022, in the pretense that they were taking part in the &#x201C;Union Determination-2022&#x201D; military drills. Following Russian forces&#x2019; withdrawal from the northern front, the number of Russian troops in Belarus gradually fell, with just about 2,000 soldiers now being left, according to the Belarusian Hajun monitoring project. In September 2025, Belarus is to host up to 13,000 troops for the Zapad-2025 (West-2025) exercises. The Russian-Belarusian plans to hold the exercises have sparked concern among Ukrainian officials. Minsk is prepared to host the leaders of the United States, Ukraine, and Russia for talks on ending Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, Lukashenko, a staunch Moscow ally, said in an interview on March 4. Lukashenko&#x2019;s remarks came shortly after the United States imposed an immediate freeze on military aid to Ukraine, in a move the White House claimed was meant to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into entering peace negotiations. In an interview with U.S. Internet media personality Mario Nawfal, Lukashenko reiterated his praise for U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he was willing to help achieve his goal of brokering peace between Kyiv and Moscow. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s only 200 kilometers from the Belarusian border to Kyiv &#x2013; half an hour by plane,&#x201D; Lukashenko told Nawfal. &quot;You are welcome to come. We will sit down here. We&#x2019;ll come to an agreement quietly, without noise, without shouting. So tell Trump: I&#x2019;m waiting for him here, along with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and Zelensky. We&#x2019;ll sit down and calmly negotiate. If you want to make a deal.&#x201D; The Kremlin has already backed the proposal. &#x201C;This issue has not been raised or discussed in any way. But, of course, Minsk is the best place for us. It is our main ally, so it is the best place for negotiations,&#x201D; Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. In the early days of Russia&#x2019;s all-out invasion, negotiations between Ukraine and Russia were held in Belarus but were later moved to Istanbul. Minsk has repeatedly attempted to get a seat at the negotiating table, at the same time requiring &#x201C;security guarantees&#x201D; for itself. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhiy Tykhyi said, &#x201C;Belarusian officials have the right to claim a fair hearing in the process of bringing the aggressor and his accomplices to international legal responsibility for the crime of aggression against Ukraine.&#x201D; Belarus previously hosted talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 2014 and 2015, which led to the signing of the Minsk Agreements. The agreements were meant to stop Russia&#x2019;s war in eastern Ukraine, but both of the documents were ultimately violated by Russia. Two days before launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Putin declared that the Minsk Agreements &#x201C;no longer existed.&#x201D; Lukashenko has been trying to make himself noticed by Trump, rushing to congratulate him on winning the U.S. presidential elections even before the results were confirmed, and promising to nominate President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Following the failure of the rare earth metals deal with Ukraine on Feb. 28, Lukashenko ordered his ministers to look into the issue of mining rare earth metals in Belarus. Updates to the criminal code in Belarus have introduced prison sentences of up to three years for the &#x201C;unauthorized sharing of information&#x201D; about the deployment of military units and their movement within the country, Human Rights watchdog Viasna reported on Feb. 28. The changes to the code also broaden the category of offenses that can be subject to in absentia prosecution. Since Russia unleashed its all-out invasion of Ukraine, Belarusians have been reporting the movement of Russian troops, and sharing footage and information on Russian troop locations with independent media and open-source intelligence projects. Ninety-three Belarusians have been sentenced on &#x201C;extremism&#x201D; charges for doing so. The updated criminal code, which entered into effect on March 2, essentially outlaws sharing any form of content featuring the military in Belarus during wartime, emergencies, or counter-terrorist operations &#x2014; unless the authorities have already shared such information. Violations are punishable by up to three years of imprisonment, or six years, if premeditated and committed by a group, and causing significant damage, the amended code reads. The updated criminal code also introduces the new status of &#x201C;a president who ceased to fulfill his duties&#x201D; and criminalizes violence, threats, and libel against him. According to the current constitution, the incumbent, Alexander Lukashenko, can be &#x201C;re-elected&#x201D; once more and rule until 2035. Although there are no apparent signs of an impending transition of power, the Belarusian authorities have established an extra-governmental body &#x2014; the All-Belarus People&#x2019;s Assembly, which is headed by Lukashenko &#x2014; to which the dictator could &#x201C;retire&#x201D; after leaving the presidency, while still wielding considerable influence. A stray Russian attack drone crashed into high-voltage power grid lines at a thermal power plant on Feb. 27, causing the most significant damage by a drone in Belarus so far, Flagshtok, a local news outlet in the Homiel region, has reported. Russian drone incursions into the Belarusian airspace have risen sharply since July 2024. At least 395 drones were recorded flying over the country in the second half of the year, and this year 94 were spotted in January alone. The Belarusian authorities don&#x2019;t comment on the incidents, and never publicly objected to them with their ally &#x2013; Moscow. On the morning of Feb. 27, residents of Mazyr, Homiel Oblast, about 45 kilometers from the border with Ukraine, were cut off from heating and hot water supplies. Local state energy company Homielenergo attributed the problem to a breakdown in the rather old heat supply system, without elaborating on the cause. Heating and hot water supplies were restored after a full day of repair work. According to Flagshtok&#x2019;s sources, the drone crashed into the high-voltage lines of a thermal power plant, triggering its automatic protection system, which led to a full shutdown of the plant, which is located south of the Mazyr Oil Refinery &#x2014; a strategic object reportedly protected by Belarusian air defenses. Restarting the plant caused a fault in the piping system. On the same night, another drone crashed and set fire to a farm building in Ziabrauka, a village next to a military airfield in the Homiel Oblast. Residents reported the sound of gunfire and a blast at around 4 a.m. Belarus ranked 192-194th out of 207 countries and territories worldwide on the level of political and civil liberties, according to global human rights watchdog Freedom House&#x2019;s Freedom in the World report, which was published on Feb. 26. The Freedom in the World report, first published in 1973, tracks the condition of political rights and civil liberties around the globe. According to its authors, global freedom declined in 2024 for the 19th consecutive year, and Belarus received some of the &#x201C;worst aggregate scores&#x201D; for political rights and civil liberties. The country scored just seven points out of 100, sharing its position with Azerbaijan and Myanmar. Hundreds of Belarus opposition supporters take part in a march in Warsaw, Poland on Jan. 25, 2025.

According to the recent estimates by Belarusian opposition People&#x2019;s Anti-Crisis Management initiative, up to 3,500 Ukrainian children from Russia-occupied Ukrainian territories were transported to Belarus. Belarus is also one of the most repressive countries for lawyers. Over the past four years, up to 27% of Belarusian lawyers were disbarred or lost their licenses after representing political prisoners in courts, U.S. government-funded broadcaster RFE/RL reported, citing the International Observatory of Lawyers.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-belarus-russia-ratify-security-pact-expanding-nuclear-umbrella-military-integration/	2025-03-07T09:36:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2190761497.jpg
Ukrainian troops' logistics in Kursk Oblast destroyed, they face risk of encirclement, sources say	Russian forces have destroyed Ukrainian troops&apos; logistics in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, and Ukrainian soldiers face the risk of encirclement, a Ukrainian soldier and a medic deployed in the region told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity on March 7. The confirmation came after several media reported that Russian forces had made a breakthrough south of the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast. The Ukrainian battlefield monitoring group DeepState has confirmed a push deep into Ukrainian positions toward the Ukrainian state border in Sumy Oblast. A Ukrainian soldier fighting in Kursk Oblast described the situation in the Russian region as &quot;critical,&quot; warning that Ukrainian troops in the region face the threat of encirclement. He added that Ukrainian soldiers based in the region would like to withdraw. According to the source, all bridges in the vicinity of Sudzha have been destroyed, and Ukrainian troops are cut off from ammunition and fuel supplies. The Ukrainian medic stationed in Kursk Oblast told the Kyiv Independent that Russia&apos;s breakthrough happened about three days ago, and Russian troops control all the roads. According to DeepState, &quot;the most critical situation&quot; is on the border of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast and Ukraine&apos;s Sumy Oblast. Russian troops are trying to push on Ukrainian positions near the villages of Zhuravka and Novenke in Sumy Oblast, DeepState reported. Russia has also intensified its attacks near the village of Kurilovka near the border with Sumy Oblast, some 5 kilometers (3 miles) south of Sudzha, DeepState said in its latest update on March 7. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Earlier in the day, the spokesperson of the Ukrainian group of forces in Kursk Oblast declined to comment on the situation in the Russian region. Russian forces have recently intensified efforts to break through to Sumy Oblast and cut off logistical routes of the Ukrainian salient in bordering Kursk Oblast. Kyiv has sought to maintain its position in the Russian border region as leverage for possible peace talks. Moscow&apos;s troops have almost reached the Ukrainian border south of Ukrainian positions in Sudzha, meaning that at least some areas have been cut off from the main salient, the independent Russian outlet Agentstvo reported on March 7, citing an expert from the Conflict Intelligence Team. &quot;Difficult battles continue in the border area of Sumy Oblast; Russian assault units are attempting to break through and move toward a highway from Yunakivka (in Sumy Oblast) to Sudzha in Kursk Oblast,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &quot;(Ukraine&apos;s) Defense Forces are fighting and dealing significant casualties to Russian troops,&quot; Kovalenko claimed, without confirming a Russian breakthrough. The prominent Russian pro-war channel Two Majors also reported on the advance, claiming that Moscow&apos;s troops have penetrated up to 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) deep into Ukrainian positions. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, the Russian military claimed.	https://kyivindependent.com/logistics-is-gone-russia-breaches-ukrainian-positions-in-kursk-oblast-sources-confirm/	2025-03-07T09:30:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166312696.jpg
Trump's increasing support for Russia leaves Zelensky with fewer options to secure U.S. backing	As Washington continues to pressure Kyiv intro submission, President Volodymyr Zelensky stands at a painful crossroads &#x2014; agree to U.S. demands or chart a course without Washington, pinning Ukraine&apos;s hopes for survival on Europe alone. Neither option seems reassuring for Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s constant verbal attacks against Zelensky and Ukraine and the halt in U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv have brought U.S.-Ukrainian relations to a record low. In the most recent blow, U.S. aerospace company Maxar Technologies has allegedly restricted Ukraine&apos;s access to its satellite imagery. Kyiv has relied on high-resolution satellite images for defense and strategic planning, tracking Russian troop movements, assessing battlefield conditions, and monitoring Russian infrastructure damage. With the U.S. actively obstructing Kyiv&apos;s ability to defend against Russia, European leaders have promised to fill the gap and step up their support for Ukraine. Despite that, analysts say Washington&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s war effort remains crucial, and Europe cannot fully replace the U.S. in the near future. Zelensky has attempted to slow down the U.S. pivot toward Russia, praising Trump&apos;s leadership and reiterating Ukraine&apos;s commitment to peace in a March 4 statement. The U.S. and Ukraine have scheduled a round of talks on ending the war with Russia in Saudi Arabia for next week. Yet, the U.S. has not resumed its military aid or intelligence cooperation, and U.S. officials have continued to verbally attack Ukraine. &quot;It is impossible to know Trump&apos;s mind, which in any event often changes,&quot; Roland Paris, a professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We can only judge his actions. To date, he has brought U.S. policy on Ukraine into alignment with that of Russia. Unless there is genuine pushback in the United States against this remarkable turnabout in U.S. policy, I would expect Trump to continue on the path he has already been following.&quot; As Trump is increasingly siding with Russia on all major issues, Zelensky may be tempted to break relations with the U.S. and rely exclusively on Europe. Following an emergency summit on March 6, the EU agreed to mobilize up to 800 billion euros ($867 billion) for defense spending amid fears that the U.S. might scale down its presence on the continent. The ReArm Europe initiative, proposed by the European Commission, includes a 150-billion-euro loan ($162 billion) covered by unused budget funds and a step to loosen fiscal rules and free up 600 billion euros ($650 billion) in government spending. But analysts say that relying only on Europe would be a very risky option. &quot;This would be a real disaster,&quot; Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We need Europe in the negotiation process for balance, but severing relations with the U.S. is dangerous for us.&quot; He said that Ukraine still depends on U.S. military aid, including Patriot air defense systems, reconnaissance satellites, and intelligence data, none of which Ukraine is receiving at the moment. &quot;If we go into conflict with the Americans, we will be pushing them toward closer ties with Russia,&quot; Fesenko added.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)If there is a conflict with the U.S., Washington may block not only free-of-charge aid but also the sale of U.S. weapons to Ukraine, as well as exert economic pressure and impose sanctions on Kyiv, Fesenko said. William Wohlforth, a professor focusing on international relations at Dartmouth College, also said that &quot;repairing relations with the Trump administration is a priority because, even if Washington does not provide direct assistance to Ukraine in the near term, its indirect help is needed even if European states take the lead.&quot; &quot;If it has the political will, Europe is probably capable of providing a multinational military force to help secure Ukraine in event of a ceasefire,&quot; he added. &quot;But I doubt very much that is possible without all sorts of U.S. indirect assistance: intelligence, logistics, organization. It makes sense for Ukraine to push for this European role but not in a way that suggests antagonism to the U.S.&quot; Charly Salonius-Pasternak, lead researcher at the Center on U.S. Politics and Power at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, said that it might be possible for Ukraine to rely exclusively on Europe&apos;s support in the long term. But it&apos;s impossible in the short run, he added. Experts say that, to improve relations with the U.S., Zelensky should be more subtle in his relations with Trump and focus on practical issues rather than rhetoric. &quot;What Zelensky and Ukrainian officials should not do is carry out a war of words with Donald Trump,&quot; Daniel Hamilton, a foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It is pointless. (Trump&apos;s) tactic is disorientation and distraction. Don&apos;t be distracted by his words or insults. Focus on your own interests and the role the United States may still be able to play to advance those interests. Stick to the specifics of the issues.&quot; Michael O&apos;Hanlon, a foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution, also said that Zelensky should &quot;avoid getting into verbal spats with the American president and vice president because to some extent it&apos;s what they thrive on&quot; but should not &quot;hesitate to express differences of opinion clearly and calmly.&quot; Several top U.S. officials, including U.S. State Secretary Marco Rubio, urged Zelensky to apologize to Trump after their clash during a meeting in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. Zelensky was berated by Trump and Vice President JD Vance and was told to leave the White House soon after. Analysts say that Zelensky should try to mend relations with Trump, but an outright apology or unilateral concessions would be seen as weakness. &quot;If (Zelensky) apologizes in a humiliating way, it will only lead to negative consequences,&quot; Fesenko said. &quot;Then, we will simply be crushed, oppressed, and forced to comply with whatever they dictate. We will lose the remnants of our independence.&quot; (Collage) US President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky meet in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, U.S. on Feb. 28, 2025. (Saul Loeb / AFP / Getty Images)He argued that the &quot;right tone must be found, and we must act extremely carefully &#x2014; as if walking through a minefield.&quot; Volodymyr Dubovyk, head of Odesa National University&apos;s Center for International Studies, also said that an outright apology from Zelensky &quot;would mean that Ukraine&apos;s position is weakening and softening.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s exactly what they want,&quot; he added. Fesenko and Dubovyk said that Zelensky should not seek a new personal meeting with Trump because it is unlikely to be productive. &quot;I think the very optics of (such meetings) is already negative, and so there&apos;s no need for them to meet physically again,&quot; Dubovyk said. Instead of a direct meeting between Zelensky and Trump, future contacts with the U.S. should be handled by professional negotiators, experts say. &quot;I think we already have enough experience to know that personal meetings with Trump don&apos;t work out,&quot; Mykhailo Minakov, head of the Ukrainian Research Program at the Kennan Institute, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Right now, we need to take a bit of a pause on direct personal contacts (between Zelensky and Trump) and focus on rebuilding at least some level of trust between the teams and restoring communication between the two camps.&quot; One of the stumbling blocks in U.S.-Ukrainian relations has been the issue of security guarantees. Zelensky has urged the U.S. to provide security guarantees to Ukraine before any ceasefire deal could be reached. The U.S. has been reluctant to provide them and insisted that a ceasefire deal should precede any discussion on security guarantees. O&apos;Hanlon said that Zelensky should &quot;recognize that Ukraine will likely get some outside security backstop, and continue to express hope that the United States will be part of any such arrangement, but recognize too that Kyiv is not in a position to &apos;demand&apos; it.&quot; Fesenko argued that, if Zelensky keeps insisting on security guarantees as a precondition for a ceasefire, relations with the U.S. are unlikely to improve. He said that &quot;this specific demand triggered a highly negative reaction from both Trump and Vance.&quot; &quot;They have no intention of providing us with any direct or official security guarantees,&quot; he added. &quot;Therefore, in my opinion, there is no sense in banging our heads against a locked door, only to end up with more bruises and an even deeper conflict with the U.S.&quot; On March 4, Zelensky attempted to mend relations with the U.S. Without apologizing directly, he wrote a conciliatory post on X (Twitter) expressing his gratitude to Trump and &quot;reiterating Ukraine&apos;s commitment to peace.&quot; He also proposed &quot;the release of prisoners and truce in the sky &#x2014; ban on missiles, long-range drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure &#x2014; and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same.&quot; Zelensky also said that Ukraine was ready to sign a mineral resources deal with the U.S. at any time and that he saw it as &quot;a step toward greater security and solid security guarantees.&quot; The deal would open the way for the U.S. to gain a cut of Ukrainian natural resources through a joint investment fund as payback for the country&apos;s support for Kyiv. The agreement was to be signed in Washington on Feb. 28 but the clash between Zelensky and Trump derailed the process. Two days after Zelensky proposed a bilateral ban on the use of missiles, Russia launched a massive missile attack against Ukraine, targeting the country&apos;s energy system and killing civilians. Wohlforth argued that Zelensky&apos;s statement is &quot;an effort to move beyond (the White House clash with Trump) and position Ukraine as ready to make moves toward a ceasefire agreement even if the security guarantee issue is not yet resolved.&quot; &quot;Zelensky did say the (White House) incident was &apos;regrettable,&apos; so essentially saying &apos;let&apos;s move on,&apos;&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;His proposal for limiting some elements of the conflict is an attempt to show he is not blocking explorations for peace.&quot; Peter Rough, a senior fellow at Hudson Institute, told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;Zelensky&apos;s post was a smart move&quot; that &quot;lowered the temperature ahead of Trump&apos;s address to Congress and removed some of the poison from the relationship.&quot; During his speech in Congress on March 4, Trump indicated that he had read Zelensky&apos;s post and said that he &quot;appreciated&quot; it. O&apos;Hanlon argued that it sounded &quot;like President Trump is ready to move on and that he liked what he heard from President Zelensky.&quot; Hamilton also said that Trump &quot;did respond positively to Zelensky&apos;s statement.&quot; However, analysts argue that Trump&apos;s rhetoric itself does not mean anything, and everything depends on what action he will take. The U.S. halted military aid to Ukraine and intelligence sharing with Kyiv on March 4 and has not resumed either aid or intelligence cooperation since then. Meanwhile, the U.S.-Ukrainian negotiations on the mineral resource deal intensified in recent days, but so far, it has not been signed.

(Andrew Harnik / Getty Images)Fesenko said he believes Ukraine should set the resumption of military aid as a condition for signing the mineral resource deal. Hamilton said that there are &quot;mixed signals&quot; and &quot;with some decisions being overtaken by events, so it&apos;s unclear even within (Trump&apos;s) administration where things are really going.&quot; Bettina Renz, a professor of international security at Nottingham University, said that &quot;considering Trump&apos;s inconsistency and often contradictory approach, I would not read too much into what he said about Ukraine in his Congress speech.&quot; &quot;At this point, it remains uncertain whether President Trump will take a more cooperative approach towards achieving peace in Ukraine that does not almost exclusively favor Russian interests and would come at devastating expense to Ukraine,&quot; she told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;If such a cooperative approach, which will include Ukraine&apos;s full involvement in any negotiations, is not forthcoming, the relationship between the United States and Ukraine &#x2014; and also Europe &#x2014; will not improve anytime soon.&quot; If Trump&apos;s administration remains unwilling to maintain at least some level of support for Ukraine, as things stand, Zelensky will be left with little option but to place his hope in Europe&apos;s faltering efforts to keep Kyiv afloat.	https://kyivindependent.com/what-options-does-zelensky-have-as-relations-with-us-hit-record-low/	2025-03-07T08:55:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202563551.jpg
Von der Leyen seeks to give Ukraine access to EU single market as part of peace deal, Telegraph reports	European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wants to grant Ukraine privileged access to the EU single market as part of a final peace deal, The Telegraph reported on March 7, citing an unnamed senior EU official. Asked whether von der Leyen is ready to stretch EU rules to their limit for Ukraine, the unnamed senior EU official told the Telegraph that &quot;it&#x2019;s already going in that direction.&quot; Such a move could bring a boost to Ukraine&apos;s war-torn economy with the country&apos;s defense industry as a key element of the EU plan, the Telegraph reported. Tariff-free access to Ukrainian weapons will bring Kyiv funds while increasing the arsenals of EU countries, according to the newspaper. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that Ukraine currently produces about a third of the needed weapons, aiming to produce 50%. According to the EU plan, Brussels will choose which sectors to open to Ukraine and which to keep closed, the newspaper reported. Ukraine applied for EU membership at the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. The country has made quick progress, achieving candidate status within months, with the initial negotiations formally launching in June 2024. Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said in 2023 that Kyiv was seeking to ensure full integration into the EU&apos;s single market before joining the bloc. Kyiv will open two or three negotiation clusters in the first six months of 2025 under Poland&apos;s rotating presidency, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in January.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-proposes-to-give-ukraine-access-to-single-market-as-part-of-peace-deal-telegraph-reports/	2025-03-07T08:13:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1246951382.jpg
Russia proposes to build drone factory in Belarus to 'ensure security'	Russia has proposed building a drone factory in neighbouring Belarus, Belarusian state media reported on Mar. 6. Kremlin Deputy Chief of Staff Maxim Oreshkin made the announcement during a trip to Minsk where he met Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko at a drone exhibition. &quot;It&#x2019;s very important that Belarus has its own [drone] production facilities, which would strengthen both its economy and national security,&quot; Oreshkin said. &quot;We are ready to build the plant,&quot; Lukashenko said in response. The plant is expected to produce up to 100,000 units per year but no details were given about the type of drone or if they would be for military use. Oreshkin said that drone production will strengthen the Belarusian economy, including agriculture, logistics, and power generation, and increase GDP. &quot;It is vital for Belarus to have production facilities that will make not only the economy, but also the security sphere of the country truly sovereign,&quot; he added. While at the exhibition, the pair were given a demonstration of &#xA0;an &#x2018;artistic&#x2019; drone which painted a mural. Belarusian state media described it as &quot;the largest art object (ever) created by a drone.&quot; Currently Russia uses around 100 to 200 kamikaze drones per attack against Ukraine which occur on a daily basis, but Russian forces plan to increase their capabilities to 500, Vadym Skibitskyi, the deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), said on March 3. &#xA0; Russia also plans to increase the number of sites from which drones will be launched, he added. Belarus is one of Russia&apos;s staunchest allies and part of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was launched from its territory. Belarus is currently under U.S. and European sanctions for supporting Russia&apos;s invasion and the detention of political prisoners.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-proposes-to-build-drone-factory-in-belarus-to-ensure-security/	2025-03-07T07:32:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2187908233--1-.jpg
Trump says he considers sanctioning Russia because it's 'pounding' Ukrainian troops	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 7 that he is considering imposing sweeping banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until there is a ceasefire and peace agreement. According to Trump, his statement is based on the fact that Russia &quot;is absolutely &#x2018;pounding&#x2019; Ukraine on the battlefield&quot; - a possible reference to Russia&apos;s recent advances in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely &apos;pounding&apos; Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large-scale banking sanctions, sanctions, and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and final settlement agreement on peace is reached,&quot; Trump wrote on the Truth Social media platform. &quot;To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. Thank you!&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-considering-large-scale-banking-sanctions-tariffs-on-russia-until-peace-deal-reached/	2025-03-07T06:55:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182537136.jpg
UK volunteer after surviving Russian strike on Kryvyi Rih â€” 'Trump, Vance, come see Ukraine for yourselvesâ€™	A team of foreign volunteers had just finished dinner at a cozy hotel restaurant in Kryvyi Rih &#x2014; a city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast where they had recently arrived to bring locals humanitarian aid &#x2014; when a notification on their phones suddenly made the atmosphere tense. A Russian ballistic missile was heading toward the city. &quot;We decided to go to the shelter, but we did not have enough time,&quot; British volunteer Karol Swiacki told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We stood up and made a few steps, but then there was a big hit, loud noise, and a huge explosion. And then dust all over. There was so much dust that we couldn&apos;t breathe or see anything.&quot; The powerful blast from the strike, which occurred around 10 p.m. on March 5, heavily damaged the five-story hotel. As a result of the attack, five people were killed and 32 were injured, including two children aged 13 and 17, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Apart from the hotel, the missile strike also damaged 14 apartment buildings, a post office, almost two dozen cars, a cultural center, and 12 shops, the governor said. &quot;We saw the damage that (the missile) had done, not only to the hotel, it was all on fire,&quot; Swiacki recalls. &quot;People were screaming. There were people with blood on their faces, dead people.&quot; &quot;People died in front of our eyes. It was a nightmare. We were in hell.&quot; Sitting roughly 70 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the nearest front line, Kryvyi Rih remains a frequent target of Russian missile attacks. With a population of about 660,000, it is the second-largest city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelensky. &quot;Just before the strike, volunteers from a humanitarian organization checked into the hotel &#x2014; citizens of Ukraine, the U.S., and the U.K.,&quot; Zelensky said after the attack. &quot;They survived because they managed to escape their rooms.&quot; Swiacki, who heads the U.K.-based NGO Ukraine Relief, says that all of the eight people he was with were fortunate enough to escape injury in the deadly attack. &quot;(After the explosion) we tried to get out of the hotel and went through the broken windows. It was so dangerous, we didn&apos;t know if it would collapse,&quot; Swiacki recalls.

(Karol Swiacki / Ukraine Relief NGO)&quot;But when we saw it from outside, oh my God&#x2026; We realized the reason for that big explosion: a missile.&quot; Swiacki says that if they had been in their rooms when the missile struck the hotel, they likely would have been killed. &quot;Everything was smashed. It was just an absolute disaster,&quot; he says. Originally from Poland, Swiacki dropped his career in entertainment shortly after the full-scale invasion started, launching the non-profit: &quot;I remember my grandma&apos;s stories of what Russians were doing to our people in Poland, so I understand what it means.&quot; &quot;I am fully aware of what this war is about. This has nothing to do with peace. They want to destroy Ukraine, take it over, and break the nation completely. This is an absolute disgrace,&quot; Swiacki says. Since Feb. 24, 2022, Swiacki and his team have delivered over five tons of humanitarian aid across Ukraine, as well as power generators, wheelchairs for people with disabilities, medical beds, and other essential supplies. Karol Swiacki (L) and Igor Logvinov (R) in Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine, on March 6, 2025. (Karol Swiacki / Ukraine Relief NGO)During their latest trip to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, they brought sports equipment and other items to support Ukrainian children affected by the war. Swiacki says the attack on Kryvyi Rih destroyed three of their cars parked outside the hotel. His team was able to recover the equipment from the &quot;smashed van&quot; and plan to deliver it to the children soon. &quot;We&apos;re continuing to support Ukraine. Many people would say we should stop, but no, it works the other way around. We will never stop and are stronger than ever,&quot; he says. The attack on Kryvyi Rih took place amid the Trump administration&apos;s decision to freeze military aid and limit intelligence sharing to Ukraine &#x2014; affecting warnings about Russian drones and missiles targeting Ukrainian military and civilian sites. Swiacki says he wishes U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance would come and see the war for themselves. &quot;Please come to Ukraine and see it yourself,&quot; he says. &quot;People are dying here.&quot; Overnight on March 7, just two days after the Kryvyi Rih attack, Russia launched at least 67 missiles of various types and 194 attack and decoy drones against Ukraine, targeting energy and gas infrastructure across the country. &quot;We need air defense all over Ukraine to stop these killings. No one can defend against these rockets without air defense,&quot; Swiacki says. &quot;I hope the West will finally wake up,&quot; he adds. Hi! Daria Shulzhenko here. I wrote this piece for you. Since the first day of Russia&apos;s all-out war, &#xA0;I have been working almost non-stop to tell the stories of those affected by Russia&#x2019;s brutal aggression.

US Chamber of Commerce in Russia readies proposals on sanctions relief	The American Chamber of Commerce in Russia (AmCham Russia) is preparing a report for the U.S. government recommending easing certain sanctions against Russia, pro-Kremlin outlet RBC reported on March 7, citing chamber chief Robert Agee. The proposed recommendations focus on lifting restrictions on the aviation and banking industries, investments, and luxury goods shipments. Agee argued that such measures would help American businesses regain &quot;lost market share&quot; and &quot;reduce operational costs in Russia.&quot; AmCham is a business association that represents U.S. companies operating in Russia. It promotes economic engagement despite strained relations between the two countries. This development follows U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s statement on Feb. 25 that sanctions on Russia will be lifted &quot;at some point&quot; but not before a peace deal is reached. His administration has renewed diplomatic contact with Moscow, engaging in direct talks on the war in Ukraine, the reopening of embassies, and economic cooperation. The primary focus of the chamber&apos;s request concerns the aviation sector, particularly the supply of spare parts and aircraft maintenance. Additionally, AmCham Russia seeks to lift the U.S. investment ban imposed in 2022, which currently allows only maintenance operations but prohibits new investments. Another key area of concern is the banking sector, with Agee saying that lifting financial restrictions would facilitate cross-border payments and &quot;ease the cost of doing business.&quot; The chamber also advocates removing restrictions on luxury goods, including cosmetics, perfumes, clothing, and footwear priced above $300 per unit. Despite these discussions, Trump extended some existing sanctions on Russia until March 6, 2026, according to a decree published in the Federal Register on Feb. 28. Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed his Cabinet of Ministers on Feb. 21 to prepare for the return of Western companies, saying Russian firms should have &quot;certain advantages&quot; over those re-entering the market. Sanctions against Russia remain a key tool of international pressure, Ukraine&apos;s Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said on Feb. 19. Stefanishyna expressed uncertainty regarding the U.S. position and its next steps but appeared confident in the EU&apos;s commitment to upholding sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/amcham-russia-to-urge-us-to-ease-sanctions-on-aviation-banking-investments/	2025-03-07T05:49:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1259010576.jpg
Ukraine wasn't officially asked by US to make territorial concessions, Foreign Ministry says	Ukraine has not received any official proposals for territorial concessions as part of potential peace talks with Russia from the U.S. or other partners, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry&apos;s spokesperson said on March 7. &quot;We have not received such proposals,&quot; spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said during a press briefing, downplaying the significance of &quot;certain formulations that could be heard in the media.&quot; The Trump administration has said that both Kyiv and Moscow will have to make concessions for a successful peace deal and called Ukraine&apos;s prospects to return to pre-2014 borders &quot;unrealistic.&quot; Russian forces continue to occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory. The Ukrainian population under Russian occupation has been subjected to systematic repression, torture, and abuse. &quot;We don&apos;t focus on emotions or verbal clashes right now. Diplomacy does its work, mostly quietly, outside the cameras&apos; reach,&quot; Tykhyi said. The comments come ahead of a meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian delegations in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11, which will concern the framework for a potential peace agreement. This would mark the first high-level meeting between the two sides since the heated exchange between President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance in the White House on Feb. 28. The clash soured the relationship between the two countries, leading to Washington freezing military and intelligence support for Ukraine. According to Tykhyi, the meeting in Saudi Arabia will concern bilateral ties, strategic partnership, and a path toward peace. He reiterated that Ukraine is ready to sign a natural resources agreement with the U.S. but did not confirm whether the deal will be signed next week. The deal&apos;s signing has been on hold since the televised quarrel between Zelensky and Trump last week. Bloomberg reported that the U.S. is newly linking the deal&apos;s signing to Ukraine committing itself to a quick truce.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-partners-made-no-official-proposals-on-ukraines-territorial-concessions-foreign-ministry-says/	2025-03-07T05:43:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2166117545.jpg
Zelensky to visit South Africa on April 10 for talks with President Ramaphosa	President Volodymyr Zelensky will visit South Africa on April 10 to meet with the country&apos;s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and discuss efforts to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, Bloomberg reported on March 7. &quot;The visit is a continuation of ongoing engagements held by President Ramaphosa with President Putin and President Zelensky on an inclusive peace process that will provide a path to peace between Russia and Ukraine,&quot; said Ramaphosa&apos;s spokesperson, Vincent Magwenya. South Africa, the continent&apos;s largest economy, has maintained a neutral stance in the war while deepening its economic and political ties with Moscow. The country is a member of the BRICS group alongside Russia and China and conducted joint naval drills with both nations while resisting Western calls to distance itself from the Kremlin. Ramaphosa previously led a peace initiative in 2023 alongside leaders from five other African nations, but the effort failed to yield concrete results. During a visit to Kyiv on June 16, 2023, he presented a 10-point peace plan as part of the African Peace Mission. Zelensky&apos;s rare upcoming visit is part of a diplomatic outreach to Africa as Kyiv seeks broader global support before upcoming peace negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-visit-south-africa-on-april-10-for-talks-with-president-ramaphosa-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-07T05:11:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/rama.jpg
The case against European rearmament	Inducting Ukraine into NATO after forcing Russia back behind its pre-2014 borders has been the only strategic aim EU leaders have allowed themselves to contemplate since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion three years ago. Alas, well before U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s re-election, this aim slipped into the realm of infeasibility. The writing had been on the wall for a while. First, Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s war economy proved a godsend to his regime. Second, even Trump&#x2019;s predecessor, Joe Biden, was terminally unwilling to push for Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership, leading the country down the garden path with vague promises. And, third, there was strong bipartisan opposition in the United States to the idea of NATO troops fighting alongside Ukrainians. So, in a display of breathtaking hypocrisy, the many &#x201C;Putin is the new Hitler&#x201D; speeches never resulted in a commitment to fight alongside the Ukrainians until Putin&#x2019;s army was defeated on the ground. Instead, a cowardly West kept sending weapons to the exhausted Ukrainians so that they could defeat the &#x201C;new Hitler&#x201D; on its behalf &#x2014; but on their own. Inevitably, and despite gallant fighting by increasingly outgunned and outnumbered Ukrainian soldiers, European leaders&#x2019; sole strategic aim turned to dust &#x2014; a reality that would have become undeniable regardless of who won the U.S. presidency last November. Trump merely brought it forward with a brutality reflecting his long-held contempt not just for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but also for the European Union itself. And so, lacking any Plan B, a Europe weakened by a two-decades-long economic slump is now struggling to respond to Trump&#x2019;s Ukraine policy. After the Munich Agreement in 1938, Winston Churchill famously proclaimed that Neville Chamberlain had been &#x201C;given the choice between war and dishonor. You chose dishonor, and you will have war.&#x201D; In their angst not to make the same mistake, EU leaders are about to repeat it, in reverse: their war-until-victory approach will give way to the humiliating peace that Trump will gleefully impose on them, and on Zelensky&#x2019;s government, when they eventually come begging. While it is undoubtedly true that Europe must either rise to the occasion or disintegrate, the question is: Rise how? What&#x2019;s really wrong with Europe? What is the EU missing the most? It beggars belief that Europeans cannot recognize the answer staring us in the face: Europe is missing a proper Treasury, the equivalent of the State Department, and a Parliament with the power to dismiss what passes as its government (the European Council). Even worse, there is still no discussion of how to plug these gaping holes in Europe&#x2019;s institutional architecture. The EU has always dreaded the beginning of any Ukraine peace process precisely because it would expose the bloc&#x2019;s nakedness. Who would represent Europe at the negotiating table, even if Trump invited us to join? Even if the European Commission and Council could wave a magic wand to conjure a large, well-armed EU army into existence, who would have the democratic authority to send it into battle to kill and be killed? Moreover, who can raise enough taxes to ensure the EU army&#x2019;s permanent combat-readiness? The EU&#x2019;s intergovernmental decision-making means that no one has the democratic legitimacy to make such decisions.

(Justin Tallis/Pool/AFP via Getty Images)When Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, recently announced her new ReArm Europe initiative, sad memories of the incompetent Juncker Plan, Green Deal, and Recovery Plan came flooding back. Large headline figures were again being tossed about, only to be exposed on closer scrutiny as smoke and mirrors. Does anyone seriously expect France to increase its already-unsustainable public-finance deficit to fund weaponry? Absent the institutions to enact military Keynesianism, the only way Europe can rearm is by shifting funds from its crumbling social and physical infrastructure &#x2014; further weakening a Europe already reaping the bitter harvest of popular discontent, which is fueling the rise of far-right forces across the continent. And for what? Does anyone believe that Putin will be deterred by a Europe that may have a few more shells and howitzers but is drifting further away from the prospect of the federal governance needed to decide matters of war and peace? ReArm Europe will do nothing to win the war for Ukraine. It will, however, almost certainly drive the EU deeper into its pre-existing economic slump &#x2014; the underlying cause of Europe&#x2019;s weakness. To keep Europeans safe in the face of the twin challenges posed by Trump and Putin, the EU must embark on its own multi-pronged Peace Now process. First, the EU must reject outright Trump&#x2019;s predatory effort to grab Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources. Then, after floating the prospect of relaxing sanctions and returning $300 billion in frozen assets (which cannot simultaneously be used as a bargaining chip and for Ukraine&#x2019;s reconstruction), the EU should commence negotiations with the Kremlin, offering the prospect of a comprehensive strategic arrangement within which Ukraine becomes what Austria was during the Cold War: sovereign, armed, neutral, and as integrated with Western Europe as its citizens desire. Third, instead of a permanent stand-off between two large armies along the agreed border, the EU should propose a demilitarized zone at least 500 kilometers (310 miles) deep on each side, the right of return of all displaced people, a Good Friday-style agreement for the governance of disputed areas, and a Green New Deal for the war-torn areas, jointly financed by the EU and Russia. All outstanding issues should be addressed in negotiations held under the auspices of the United Nations. Lastly, the EU should use the prospect of relaxing tariffs on Chinese goods (green tech, in particular) and sanctions on technology exports to open negotiations with China with a view to a new security arrangement that reduces tensions and enlists the Chinese to the goal of safeguarding Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty. If we truly want to strengthen Europe, the first step is not to rearm. It is to forge the democratic union without which stagnation will continue to erode Europe&#x2019;s capacities, rendering it unable to rebuild what is left of Ukraine once Putin is finished with it.

Russia reportedly breaks through in Kursk Oblast; military hasn't confirmed	Russian forces have made a breakthrough south of the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha, potentially threatening to cut off some of the Ukrainian positions in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Agentstvo and Ukrainska Pravda reported on March 7. An undisclosed military source deployed in Kursk Oblast told the Ukrainska Pravda outlet that Russian forces have broken through Ukrainian defenses south of Sudzha and that the defenders are trying to stabilize the situation. Ukrainian forces are trying to contain the Russian advance to prevent a partial or complete encirclement, the source claimed. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The spokesperson of the Ukrainian group of forces in Kursk Oblast declined to comment. Russian forces have recently intensified efforts to break through to Sumy Oblast to cut off the Ukrainian salient in bordering Kursk Oblast. Kyiv has sought to maintain its position in the Russian border region as leverage for possible peace talks. Russian forces have almost reached the Ukrainian border south of Ukrainian positions in Sudzha, meaning that at least some areas have been cut off from the main salient, the independent Russian outlet Agentstvo reported, citing an expert from the Conflict Intelligence Team. &quot;Difficult battles continue in the border area of Sumy Oblast; Russian assault units are attempting to break through and move toward a highway from Yunakivka (in Sumy Oblast) to Sudzha in Kursk Oblast,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &quot;The Defense Forces are fighting and dealing significant casualties to Russian troops,&quot; Kovalenko claimed, without confirming a Russian breakthrough. The estimated Russian advance in Kursk Oblast as of March 7, 2025, according to DeepState. Ukrainian positions in Kursk Oblast marked in blue. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Ukrainska Pravda&apos;s source claimed that the breakthrough occurred between March 5 and 6 and was the result of a gradual and systematic Russian campaign in the area. The Ukrainian battlefield monitoring group DeepState seems to confirm a Russian advance, indicating a push deep into Ukrainian positions toward the Ukrainian state border in Sumy Oblast. DeepState marked the village of Kurilovka, lying some 5 kilometers (3 miles) south of Sudzha, as a contested area as of March 6. The monitoring service reported further advances the following day. The prominent Russian pro-war channel Tw Majors also reported on the advance, claiming that Moscow&apos;s troops have penetrated up to 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) deep into Ukrainian positions. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, the Russian military claimed. Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000 in Kursk Oblast, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 6. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said last November that the incursion thwarted Russia&apos;s plans to invade Sumy Oblast in an attempt to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-reportedly-attempting-a-breakthrough-south-of-sudzha-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-03-07T04:30:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2182865870.jpg
Trump's cryptic Russia comment 'probably just bluster,' experts say	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s claim to be the only person who knows why Russia wants to &quot;make a deal&quot; and end the war in Ukraine is &quot;probably just bluster,&quot; experts have told the Kyiv Independent. Speaking to reporters in the White House on March 6, Trump addressed his ongoing &#x2014; and controversial &#x2014; efforts to end the fighting and bring both Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table. &quot;I think what&#x2019;s going to happen is Ukraine wants to make a deal because I don&#x2019;t think they have a choice,&quot; he said. &quot;I also think that Russia wants to make a deal because in a certain different way &#x2014; a different way that only I know, only I know &#x2014; they have no choice,&quot; Trump cryptically added. Trump did not elaborate, and his comments left observers baffled as to what he might be referring to. &quot;No clue,&quot; former U.K. Defense Attache in Moscow, John Foreman, told the Kyiv Independent when asked for his thoughts. &quot;Unless he&#x2019;s referring to intel about discussions in Moscow about how long they can keep at it, the real state of the Russian army or economy, or (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&#x2019;s health,&quot; he added. Jenny Mathers, a Russian political expert and lecturer at the U.K.&apos;s Aberystwyth University, dismissed the comments as &quot;probably just bluster to make Trump look like he is getting something out of his conversations with Putin.&quot; &quot;Trump is always claiming unique abilities, so it is not too surprising that he is claiming some unique knowledge. I seriously doubt that Putin is confiding secret Russian weaknesses or strategy to Trump,&quot; she added. But like Foreman, Mathers did also keep open the possibility that Trump was referring to possible U.S. intelligence reports that &quot;reveal Russian weaknesses.&quot; &quot;But that does not fit well with Trump&#x2019;s eagerness to offer up front concessions to Moscow before peace talks even begin,&quot; she added. The Kremlin is reportedly growing increasingly concerned by the state of Russia&apos;s economy amid Western sanctions and soaring inflation caused by record wartime spending. Moscow has reactivated a special economic commission initially created during the Covid-19 pandemic to monitor struggling industries and implement relief measures, The Moscow Times reported on Feb. 11, citing Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak. Meanwhile on the battlefield, Russian advances have slowed in recent weeks, with Ukraine even making small gains in some areas. The 25th Separate Airborne Brigade reported on Feb. 26 that Ukrainian troops had regained control of the village of Kotlyne, near Pokrovsk. Kotlyne and Pokrovsk are connected by the T 0406 highway, which also leads to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. As for Putin&apos;s health &#x2014; rumors of ill-health have periodically surfaced at various points during Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, but nothing definitive has yet been confirmed.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-cryptic-russia-comment-probably-just-bluster-experts-say/	2025-03-07T04:11:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203672195.jpg
Germany should reduce reliance on US arms amid geopolitical shifts, Airbus Defense and Space CEO says	Germany should reduce its dependence on U.S. defense manufacturers amid shifting political signals from Washington, the CEO of Airbus Defense and Space, Michael Schollhorn, warned in an interview with Augsburger Allgemeine, published on March 7. Schollhorn emphasized that Berlin should prioritize European defense companies, particularly as Germany&apos;s likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has announced plans to raise hundreds of billions of euros for defense and infrastructure. &quot;If we continue to buy off-the-shelf products from the United States with this higher defense spending, we are cementing our dependence on others,&quot; Schollhorn said. The business executive added that Denmark may already realize that purchasing U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets was a questionable decision, mainly &quot;if they actually had to defend Greenland.&quot; Schollhorn&apos;s remarks follow U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s controversial statement on March 4, in which he once again expressed interest in acquiring Greenland through purchase or force. Schollhorn argued that Europe&apos;s defense industries must collaborate more closely instead of competing individually. &quot;We need not only an increase in defense spending at the national level but also a coordinated approach among key European countries,&quot; he said. The comments come amid growing scrutiny of Trump&apos;s foreign policy, as the U.S. president has echoed Kremlin narratives, sidelined Kyiv and Europe in direct talks with Moscow, and accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of prolonging Russia&apos;s war. On March 6, Trump also cast doubt on Washington&apos;s commitment to defending its NATO partners, saying that the U.S. will not protect those that fail to meet defense spending targets. During a meeting with Zelensky on Feb. 28, Trump said that Europe should take responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security and refused to offer U.S. guarantees. Washington has since frozen all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, a move widely seen as an attempt to pressure Kyiv into negotiations with Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-should-lessen-reliance-on-us-weapons-amid-shifting-politics-airbus-defense-chief-says/	2025-03-07T04:09:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1257482771.jpg
Trumpâ€™s aid cuts could trap Eastern Europe in a disinformation bubble	Georgia is in a grim state. Once vibrant, welcoming, and hopeful, it has become a country where peaceful protesters are beaten and journalists are branded as traitors. Over the past year, the ruling Georgian Dream party has stifled civil society and media with its foreign agent law, extended its reign for another four years through a rigged election, and announced it would &#x201C;suspend&#x201D; efforts to join the EU. In the Georgia of 2025, war is called peace, and slavery is called freedom. Disinformation is the Georgian government&#x2019;s weapon of choice, including pushing Russian narratives about the brutal, full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Like its anti-democratic counterparts in Hungary, Belarus, and Azerbaijan, the Georgian government has identified the media as the primary obstacle to consolidating authoritarian rule. A long campaign of discreditation, financial strangulation, and intimidation of donors has taken its toll. The voices of independent journalists are fading, and with new legislation poised to de facto outlaw independent outlets, the final blow may be near &#x2014; a kiss of death carried on Russia&#x2019;s breath. The sudden termination of U.S. aid funding came as a shock to an already struggling independent media landscape. I co-founded OC Media in 2017 to inform both local and international readers about the Caucasus &#x2014; from Grozny to Tbilisi, Yerevan to Baku. Providing a progressive voice, where facts matter and showing an alternative to state media narratives, has always been our guiding principle. But it&#x2019;s clear these principles are not shared by the Trump administration, whose cuts cost us $250,000 in expected funding for 2025 &#x2014; 80% of our core operational budget. Nearly every online media outlet in Georgia was affected, and I expect many, or even most of them, to close in the coming weeks and months. This is a pattern repeating across Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia; reports suggest these cuts could devastate Ukraine&#x2019;s media landscape as well. If nothing changes, we risk surrendering the media space to those who can afford it: the oligarchs, authoritarian governments, and, perhaps most concerning of all, Russia. This could leave our region in a disinformation bubble, where Russian-backed narratives, including those that seek to blame Ukraine for being invaded, proliferate. Without independent outlets like OC Media, the overwhelming support Georgian society has for Ukraine may be buried under the weight of pro-government media. Part of this vulnerability in the media is certainly our own fault. For years in Georgia, we in the media have relied too heavily on donor aid, neglecting other potential sources of revenue. But it doesn&#x2019;t have to be this way. People attend an opposition rally against election results outside the parliament in Tbilisi, Georgia, on Oct. 28, 2024. (Mirian Meladze / Anadolu via Getty Images)Last summer, I visited Kyiv for the first time since Russia&#x2019;s brutal full-scale invasion began, to learn from our colleagues at the Kyiv Independent, who have survived revolutions, wars, and the most insidious propaganda &#x2014; the kind that turns victims into aggressors. The Kyiv Independent has pioneered a model many thought impossible in our region: creating a media outlet fully funded by its readers, independent of U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s tantrums or the whims of institutional donors. Their approach has shown that self-sufficiency is not just an ideal &#x2014; it is essential for our survival. We launched our own membership program almost a year ago, as the Georgian government pushed ahead with its Russian-style foreign agent law. But it was only on the brink of collapse that our membership truly gained traction. Today, I am proud to say that 10% of our core budget now comes from reader support &#x2014; something few believed possible in the Caucasus. This is just the beginning. If readers choose to support the media they rely on, then perhaps we can fight back against a world where the president of the most powerful country in the world calls the leader of a defending nation a dictator. I know Georgians deserve better. My government has chosen the path of disinformation and repression, but independent media remains a lifeline &#x2014; for Georgians, for Ukrainians, and for all those who can still tell the victim from the aggressor. During my trip to Kyiv last summer, beyond the usual shock of air raid sirens and the echoes of explosions, what struck me most was the resilience of a people under siege &#x2014; and the crucial role Ukrainian media have had in defying disinformation, both at home and abroad. Now, across Eastern Europe, independent media is in deep crisis. Yet despite our borders, our histories, and our governments, our struggle is the same. The Kyiv Independent is leading the way with its reader-funded model, and OC Media is proud to follow. We have been overwhelmed by the support we have already received in donations and membership sign-ups to help us survive. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m asking you to join the Kyiv Independent, OC Media, and other media outlets across the region in this fight &#x2014; before we lose our ability to resist the authoritarian disinformation tide, as so many already have.

Ukraine receives $970 million from UK under G7 loan covered by Russian assets	Ukraine has received 752 million pounds ($970 million) as the first installment of the U.K.&apos;s contribution to the G7 loan covered by frozen Russian assets, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on March 7. The U.K. has pledged to lend Ukraine 2.26 billion pounds ($2.9 billion) in three equal installments as part of the G7&apos;s Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration scheme, worth $50 billion in total. &quot;The funds will go towards strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities,&quot; Shmyhal said on X. &quot;I am grateful to (British Prime Minister) Keir Starmer, the U.K. government and our G7 partners for the mechanism to make Russian money work for Ukraine.&quot; At the onset of the full-scale war in 2022, the G7 countries immobilized some $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets. The $50 billion loan, shouldered mainly by the U.S. and the EU, will be funneled to Ukraine&apos;s defense needs and recovery and repaid by proceeds from the frozen assets. &quot;We expect all sovereign assets of the Russian Federation to be confiscated and transferred to benefit our country in the future,&quot; Shmyhal noted.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-receives-970-million-from-uk-under-g7-loan-covered-by-russian-assets/	2025-03-07T03:52:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1258928921.jpeg
Zelensky to meet Saudi Crown prince on March 10	President Volodymyr Zelensky said he would travel to Saudi Arabia on March 10 and meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman before talks with U.S. partners. Zelensky initially intended to visit Saudi Arabia as part of a Middle East tour in February but delayed the trip due to bilateral U.S.-Russian talks in Riyadh on Feb. 18. The Gulf countries have traditionally played the role of a mediator between Russia and Ukraine, namely in regard to prisoner exchanges. Following Zelensky&apos;s meeting with the Saudi crown prince, the Ukrainian president&apos;s team will remain in the country on March 11 to meet U.S. delegates and discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement. This would mark the first high-level meeting between the two sides since the heated exchange between Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance in the White House on Feb. 28. The televised clash derailed plans for the signing of a natural resources agreement and preceded the U.S. freezing all military and intelligence support for Kyiv amid ongoing hostilities with Russia. &quot;Ukraine is most interested in peace. As we told (President Donald Trump), Ukraine is working and will continue to work constructively for a swift and reliable peace,&quot; Zelensky said on X. Top U.S. officials signaled that Zelensky&apos;s recent statements on a peaceful resolution of the war have been received positively in the White House and might lead to the resumption of military aid. Ukraine has repeatedly voiced readiness for peace but stressed that any ceasefire would be short-lived without clear security guarantees to deter Russian aggression. The Trump administration has refused such commitments and instead called upon Europe to take responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-meet-saudi-crown-prince-on-march-10/	2025-03-07T03:32:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/zelensky_saudi.jpeg
Zelensky's approval rating jumps to 68% after Trump clash, poll shows	President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s approval rating has risen to 68% following his heated exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump, according to a poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology published on March 7. The most significant jump came after the Feb. 28 Oval Office meeting, which ended in a public dispute over security guarantees for Ukraine and the cancellation of the U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement signing. Before the diplomatic spat, a February 2025 survey showed that 57% of Ukrainians trusted Zelensky, while 37% did not, resulting in a trust-distrust balance of +20%. Between Feb. 14 and March 4, trust in Zelensky increased to 68%, with the share of those who do not trust him dropping to 29%, improving his net approval rating to +38%. Tech billionaire Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump, took to X on March 6 to claim that if Ukraine were to hold an election, &quot;Zelensky would lose by a landslide.&quot; Trump had earlier accused Zelensky of being a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; while blaming his administration for prolonging the war. Trump&apos;s claim ignores the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. As a result, Zelensky&apos;s term has been extended, which constitutional lawyers argue is permitted under Ukrainian law. The poll, conducted via telephone interviews, surveyed 1,029 adult Ukrainian citizens residing in government-controlled territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelenskys-approval-rating-jumps-after-trump-clash-poll-shows/	2025-03-07T03:10:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201823899.jpg
Maxar Technologies reportedly restricts Ukraine's access to satellite imagery	U.S. aerospace company Maxar Technologies has restricted Ukraine&apos;s access to its satellite imagery, the Ukrainian media outlet Militarnyi reported on March 7, citing unnamed users of the service. Kyiv has relied on high-resolution satellite images for defense and strategic planning, tracking Russian troop movements, assessing battlefield conditions, and monitoring Russian infrastructure damage. The alleged move follows the U.S. decision to halt intelligence sharing with Ukraine, a shift confirmed by CIA Director John Ratcliffe on March 5. According to Militarnyi, the restriction was imposed under an order from U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration, with the State Department allegedly prohibiting U.S. companies from providing satellite data to Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent was unable to verify the claims and has contacted Maxar Technologies for confirmation but has yet to receive a response. Ukraine&apos;s cyber community Cyberboroshno also reported the restriction, claiming that free access to satellite reconnaissance had been cut off. &quot;According to our information, at least private companies can buy already ordered (satellite) images through the provider,&quot; Cyberboroshno wrote on Telegram. Washington has also frozen military aid to Kyiv as part of a broader effort to pressure President Volodymyr Zelensky into peace talks with Russia. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on March 6 that Kyiv is working on alternatives to counter the loss of U.S. intelligence, including potential cooperation with European partners.	https://kyivindependent.com/maxar-technologies-reportedly-restricts-ukraines-access-to-satellite-imagery/	2025-03-07T02:14:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1245430860-167062044924mwa.jpg
EU members pledge $16 billion in additional support for Ukraine, Costa says	Several EU members have pledged to provide up to 15 billion euros ($16.3 billion) in additional aid for Ukraine, European Council President Antonio Costa said at a summit on March 6. EU leaders met in Brussels to discuss plans for boosting Europe&apos;s defense capabilities and support for Ukraine amid the seismic foreign policy shifts in the U.S. Ukraine&apos;s President Volodmyr Zelensky also took part in the meeting. The summit concluded without additional EU aid packages for Ukraine as the discussed 20-billion-euro tranche ($22 billion) was dropped from the final declaration. Kyiv needs more support now than ever, as the Trump administration has frozen all military assistance flowing to the country. As any EU-wide assistance package is under threat of being blocked by Hungary&apos;s Moscow-friendly leader, Viktor Orban, top EU officials suggested that further aid should be provided through a &quot;coalition of the willing.&quot; &quot;Immediately, member states can increase their support thanks to the increased fiscal space,&quot; Costa said at a press conference in Brussels. During the summit, EU leaders unanimously agreed on a new defense initiative that could mobilize up to 800 billion euros ($867 billion) through loans and loosening fiscal rules for government spending. &quot;Several member states have already announced their pledges up to 15 billion euros. Today, we have also tasked the Council to work urgently on further initiatives to address Ukraine&#x2019;s pressing military and defense needs,&quot; Costa said, without naming the countries. &quot;This is a tipping point for Europe. And today, we have shown that the European Union is rising to the challenge,&quot; the European Council president said.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-members-pledge-16-billion-in-additional-support-for-ukraine-costa-says/	2025-03-07T02:07:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/DSC07805------.jpg
French-made Mirage 2000 jets join Ukraine's defense against Russian strike for the first time	Ukraine&apos;s French-provided Mirage 2000 fighter jets took part in repelling a Russian air attack on Ukraine for the first time on March 7, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Russia launched a large-scale aerial assault overnight, firing 67 missiles of various types and deploying 194 drones. Ukraine&apos;s air defenses intercepted 34 missiles and 100 drones, with anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare systems, and mobile fire groups contributing to the effort. Fighter jets, including F-16s and French Mirage 2000s, were also deployed. French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu confirmed on Feb. 6 that the first Mirage 2000-5s pledged to Kyiv had arrived in Ukraine. The jets were part of a military aid package announced by French President Emmanuel Macron in June 2024, which included pilot training. Macron did not disclose the total number of aircraft France would supply. The Mirage 2000, a fourth-generation supersonic fighter, was first introduced by Dassault Aviation in the 1970s. The Mirage 2000-5 variant, introduced in 1999, features upgraded avionics, improved air-to-air and air-to-ground combat capabilities, and an advanced sensor and control system. The deployment of Mirage 2000 jets marks a significant step in Ukraine&apos;s air defense strategy as it continues to strengthen its capabilities against ongoing Russian attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/frances-mirage-2000-jets-first-join-ukraines-defense-against-russian-air-assault-air-forces-report/	2025-03-07T01:29:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2157350567.jpg
US 'not going to defend' NATO members missing defense spending goals, Trump says	U.S. President Donald Trump cast doubt on Washington&apos;s commitment to defending its NATO partners on March 6, saying that the U.S. will not protect those that fail to meet defense spending targets. &quot;If they don&apos;t pay, I&apos;m not going to defend them. No, I&apos;m not going to defend them,&quot; Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. The statement follows an article from NBC News that Trump is considering reducing U.S. commitments to NATO and recalibrating engagement to favor members that allocate a set percentage of their gross domestic product (GDP) to defense. &quot;They should be paying more,&quot; the U.S. president added. Trump has long demanded that NATO allies increase their military spending. He previously called for the alliance to raise its benchmark from 2% to 5% of the GDP. As of 2024, 24 of NATO&apos;s 32 members meet the current 2% target, with Poland (4.12%), Estonia (3.43%), and the U.S. (3.38%) leading the way. Several nations, including Italy, Canada, and Spain, still fall short. Some NATO members are discussing raising the spending level to 3% by 2030. Trump&apos;s remarks follow his declaration from last year that he would endorse Russia to &quot;do whatever the hell they want&quot; to NATO countries failing to meet defense criteria, a statement widely seen as undermining NATO&apos;s collective-defense principle. The comments come amid heightened scrutiny of Trump&apos;s foreign policy, as he has echoed Kremlin narratives, engaged in direct negotiations with Moscow while sidelining Kyiv, and accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of prolonging the war. Trump has also refused to offer security guarantees to Ukraine, saying during his Feb. 28 meeting with Zelensky that Europe should take responsibility for Kyiv&apos;s security. Washington has since frozen all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, a move widely seen as an attempt to pressure Kyiv into peace talks with Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-not-going-to-defend-nato-members-missing-spending-goals-trump-says/	2025-03-07T01:03:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192427196.jpg
Hungary to hold poll on Ukraine's EU accession, Orban says	Hungary will carry out an opinion survey on Ukraine&apos;s potential accession to the European Union, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced on March 7, according to Politico. &quot;We have the so-called national consultation scheme, which we use regularly to collect the opinion of the people, so we will use the same scheme just now,&quot; Orban told reporters after an emergency summit of EU leaders in Brussels. Orban, widely regarded as the EU&apos;s most pro-Russian leader, has repeatedly opposed military aid for Ukraine and warned that Ukraine&apos;s EU membership would &quot;destroy&quot; Hungary. He has maintained close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin despite Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, amplifying Kremlin narratives in Europe. Since 2010, Orban&apos;s government has held more than a dozen so-called national consultations on issues such as migration and LGBTQ rights. These referendums are non-binding letter campaigns sent to Hungarian voters with questions framed to align with the government&apos;s position. The political opposition and civil society groups have criticized these consultations as propaganda tools, pointing to their leading wording and low participation rates. For instance, a 2023 consultation on EU migration policy asked Hungarians if they supported Brussels&apos;s creation of &quot;migrant ghettos&quot; in Hungary. Less than 20% of voters participated, but 99% of those who did responded &quot;no.&quot; &quot;For the first time, Hungarians have a chance in Europe to decide whether they support Ukraine&apos;s EU membership or not,&quot; Hungary&apos;s government spokesperson Balazs Orban posted on X. Ukraine applied for EU membership in 2022 and was granted candidate status within months. Accession talks began in June 2024, with European leaders setting 2030 as a target for Ukraine&apos;s potential entry. Like all EU members, Hungary holds veto power over further progress, allowing Budapest to delay or block Ukraine&apos;s accession.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-to-hold-national-consultation-on-ukraines-eu-accession-orban-says/	2025-03-07T00:29:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190226673.jpg
2 killed, 24 injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over past day	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least two people and injured 24 others over the past day, regional officials reported on March 7. Russia carried out a mass missile and drone attack overnight, targeting infrastructure facilities in the Ternopil and Ivano-Frankivsk oblasts, according to officials. A Russian ballistic missile attack on Kharkiv injured eight people and damaged more than 30 houses, officials reported. Two of the injured were hospitalized. In Donetsk Oblast, 12 civilians were wounded, including six in Sloviansk, two in Kramatorsk and Bahatyr each, and one in Myrnohrad and Kostiantynivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian airstrikes killed two people and wounded one, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. In Poltava Oblast, debris from a downed aerial target struck a house, injuring two people, including a child, Governor Filip Pronin said. A 66-year-old man was wounded in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where 19 houses and apartments were damaged, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. Russia also carried out a large drone attack on Odesa Oblast, with officials still assessing potential casualties, Governor Oleh Kiper said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-over-past-day/	2025-03-06T23:38:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-07_07-36-52.jpg
EU leaders sideline Hungary as they pledge continued support for Ukraine	Twenty-six EU member states denounced Russian aggression and pledged continued support for Ukraine in a joint resolution issued at an emergency summit on March 6, despite Hungary dissenting. The lack of consensus on the declaration, which stopped short of committing concrete steps in support of Ukraine, underscores the persistent differences between Moscow-friendly Budapest and the rest of the bloc. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban can still block major decisions that require an anonymous vote, such as the six-month extension of sanctions against Russia. Speaking ahead of the summit, the EU&apos;s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, suggested that European countries might seek to push forward new support for Ukraine through a &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; to avoid Hungary&apos;s veto. &quot;The European Council reaffirms its continued and unwavering support for Ukraine&#x2019;s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders,&quot; the statement reads. The 26 EU members committed to several principles in pursuing a just peace in Ukraine, namely, Kyiv and Europe&apos;s participation in any negotiations, no ceasefire without a subsequent comprehensive peace agreement, security guarantees for Ukraine, and respect for Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The U.S.&apos;s outreach to Russia and bilateral talks on Ukraine in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 sparked concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump might seek to cut a deal with the Kremlin while sidelining Kyiv and Europe. &quot;Achieving &#x2018;peace through strength&#x2019; requires Ukraine to be in the strongest possible position, with Ukraine&#x2019;s own robust military and defence capabilities as an essential component,&quot; the statement reads. The declaration came as the EU agreed to mobilize up to 800 billion ($860 billion) for defense spending amid fears that the U.S. might scale back its presence on the continent. The Trump administration&apos;s decision to freeze military aid for Ukraine and intelligence sharing also highlighted Europe&apos;s growing role in sustaining Ukrainian resistance against Russian aggression. Despite this, the proposal to commit a new 20-billion-euro package ($22 billion) was dropped from the text of the declaration. The document reaffirmed that the EU would continue providing Ukraine with already pledged support in 2025, including 12.5 billion euros ($13.5 billion) under the Ukraine Facility and 18.1 billion ($19.6 billion) as part of the G7 loan covered by frozen Russian assets. To ensure the support of Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, the declaration also included calls on the European Commission, Slovakia, and Ukraine to &quot;intensify efforts towards finding workable solutions to the gas transit issue.&quot; Fico, who has adopted increasingly anti-Ukraine rhetoric but avoided blocking steps on the EU level in Orban&apos;s fashion, has repeatedly lambasted Kyiv over ending the transit of Russian gas through its territory to Slovakia and other EU countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-pledges-continued-support-for-ukraine-despite-hungarys-opposition/	2025-03-06T23:27:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203003580--1-.jpg
Russia lashes out against France's nuclear umbrella proposal	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed on March 6 that French President Emmanuel Macron&apos;s recent comments on nuclear deterrence pose a threat to Russia, according to the state news agency TASS. During a televised address on March 5, Macron said he was open to extending France&apos;s nuclear umbrella to protect European allies amid growing uncertainties caused by the U.S.&apos;s foreign policy shifts. France and the U.K. are the only two European nations with nuclear arsenals. Macron made it clear that no decision has been taken so far. Lavrov claimed that Macron is &quot;preparing to use nuclear weapons against Russia,&quot; without providing evidence and despite the French leader not making such a statement directly. &quot;Of course, it&apos;s a threat against Russia,&quot; Lavrov claimed. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov echoed Lavrov&apos;s remarks, calling Macron&apos;s comments &quot;very confrontational&quot; and accusing France of escalating tensions. &quot;Moreover, France is already ready to use its nuclear weapons for security and the like. It&apos;s already such a nuclear rhetoric; it&apos;s a claim to nuclear leadership in Europe,&quot; Peskov said. Macron&apos;s statements come as European leaders push for increased defense spending and military aid to Ukraine amid concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump may not defend Europe if Russia attacks. Polish and Lithuanian leaders welcomed the French leader&apos;s proposal that Paris could extend its nuclear umbrella. Russia has been accused of waging a broader hybrid war against Europe, including acts of sabotage on the continent. Western intelligence agencies have warned that Moscow may seek to launch a large-scale war on Europe within the next five years.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-is-preparing-to-use-nuclear-weapons-against-russia-lavrov-claims/	2025-03-06T22:49:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1485172048.jpg
Ukraine struck Russian command post in Kherson Oblast, stronghold in Kursk Oblast on March 5	Ukrainian forces carried out precision strikes against a Russian command post in the occupied town of Oleshky in Ukraine&apos;s Kherson Oblast and a stronghold in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast on March 5, the Ukrainian military said on March 7. The attacks took place on the same day as the U.S. stopped sharing intelligence with Ukraine, which potentially undermines Kyiv&apos;s ability to carry out precision strikes. The statement did not specify whether the attacks occurred before the intelligence-sharing pause. Ukrainian forces reportedly attacked the command post of the 17th Tank Regiment of the 70th Motorized Rifle Division of the Russian Armed Forces stationed in the Russian-occupied part of Kherson Oblast. Russia was pushed back from the western part of Kherson Oblast during Ukraine&apos;s surprise counteroffensive in the fall of 2022 but continues to hold territory east of the Dnipro River. The March 5 strikes also targeted a stronghold of the 2nd company of Russia&apos;s 177th Separate Naval Infantry Regiment in Plekhovo in Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian forces have been fighting in the Russian border region since launching their incursion in August 2024 to draw Moscow&apos;s troops from Donbas and thwart Russian plans for further offensives. &quot;These strikes are part of an ongoing campaign of fire engagements aimed at reducing the military potential of the Russian Armed Forces on the way to liberating the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine,&quot; the General Staff said in its statement. &quot;The Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine remains fully prepared to conduct precision strikes to degrade the capabilities of the Russian Armed Forces in waging an aggressive war against the Ukrainian people.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-struck-russian-command-post-in-kherson-oblast-stronghold-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-03-06T22:26:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1068947954-1667598365khqfs.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 882,950 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 882,950 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on March 7. This number includes 1,150 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,264 tanks, 21,334 armored fighting vehicles, 39,678 vehicles and fuel tanks, 24,124 artillery systems, 1,306 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,096 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 28,024 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-882-950-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-03-06T22:10:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1239116213-1660056573zl72q.jpg
Defense Secretary Hegseth hails UK for 'stepping up' as European leader on Ukraine amid shifting US foreign policy	During a meeting with his counterpart on March 6, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth hailed the United Kingdom for &quot;stepping up&quot; in taking a lead among European allies to support Ukraine. &quot;We are in the middle of a dynamic security environment, where on (the European) continent, President (Donald) Trump is calling on our European allies to take the lead, and you have done just that, sir,&quot; Hegseth told U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey during a press briefing in Washington. Hegseth further commended the U.K. for chairing the latest meeting of the Ukraine defense contact group: &quot;And that&apos;s, again, the United Kingdom stepping up,&quot; Hegseth added. Hegseth&apos;s comments come amid shifting political dynamics within the United States as the Trump administration has ruled out sending its own troops to Ukraine as a security guarantee for the embattled nation &#x2014; instead encouraging European allies to take the lead in securing Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability. &quot;You challenged us to step up on Ukraine, on defense spending, on European security. And I say to you that we have, we are, and we will further,&quot; Healey responded to Hegseth during the press briefing. Healey&apos;s comments come during the U.K. Defense Secretary&apos;s visit to the United States to discuss plans for peace in Ukraine. The meeting occurred as EU leaders were meeting in Brussels to discuss additional support for Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on March 2 that a number of European nations, including the U.K. and France, are developing a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; that will include &quot;planes in the air and boots on the ground&quot; in an effort to negotiate a successful ceasefire in Ukraine. Reuters reported on March 6, citing diplomatic sources familiar with the matter, that France and the U.K. aim to finalize a peace plan with Ukraine &quot;in days&quot; to present to the United States. The comments from Hegseth come amid a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy, with Trump echoing Kremlin narratives and accusing President Volodymyr Zelensky of prolonging the war. In recent days, the United States has significantly distanced itself from Ukraine by halting military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv. The move follows a heated exchange in the Oval Office on Feb. 28 in which Zelensky and Trump got into an argument in front of reporters. Following the tense exchange, European leaders reaffirmed their support for Zelensky and Ukraine on Feb. 28 with EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas stating that &quot;Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It&apos;s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-defense-secretary-hegseth-hails-uk-for-stepping-up-on-ukraine/	2025-03-06T21:15:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/gettyimages-2203022644-612x612.jpg
Russia launches missile attack targeting critical infrastructure in various regions of Ukraine	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russian forces launched missiles at various regions of Ukraine overnight on March 7, targeting energy and gas infrastructure across the country, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said. Halushchenko did not immediately say where critical infrastructure has been hit but noted &quot;rescuers and energy workers&quot; are on-scene to provide emergency restoration work. Russia initially launched a series of missiles around 4 a.m. local time targeting various regions in the country&apos;s far-west. A second series of missiles entered Ukrainian airspace around 6 a.m. Explosions were reported in the western city of Ternopil around 5 a.m. local time, following the first series of attacks, Suspilne reported. Later in the morning, explosions were heard in the front line city of Kharkiv around 6:30 a.m. Air defenses were active in all regions of Ukraine amid the missile threats. No information was immediately available as to the extent of the damage or whether there are any casualties. Russia has regularly launched missiles targeting various regions of the country. Russian forces have continuously targeted Ukraine&apos;s critical infrastructure as Russia continues to test Ukrainian resolve in the harsh winter months. Amid the U.S. pause on sharing intelligence with Kyiv, the New York Times reported on March 5, citing undisclosed U.S. and Ukrainian officials that the pause affects warnings against Russian drones and missiles striking Ukrainian military and civilian targets.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-missile-attack/	2025-03-06T20:40:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-76096673.jpg
Ukraine brought halts to military aid, intelligence sharing 'on themselves,' Kellogg says	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, suggested on March 6 that Ukraine was to blame for the U.S. halting military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv, saying that the embattled nation &quot;brought it on themselves.&quot; The Trump administration halted U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing for Ukraine this week following a heated exchange between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28. The decision are likely intended to put pressure on Zelensky in peace talks The halt in military aid leaves over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition undelivered to Kyiv, while the pause in intelligence sharing affects warnings against Russian drones and missiles striking Ukrainian military and civilian targets, Ukrainian and U.S. officials told the New York Times. &quot;The best way I can describe it is sort of like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across the nose,&quot; Kellogg said during a panel at the Council on Foreign Relations. &quot;You got their attention.&quot; Zelensky issued a statement on March 4 in which he called the Oval Office clash &quot;regrettable&quot; and affirmed commitment to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s leadership, after the White House questioned Zelensky&apos;s commitment to peace. &#x201C;Trump had a real question about whether President Zelensky was committed to the peace process, and he said let&#x2019;s pause,&#x201D; CIA Director John Ratcliffe said on March 5. Kellogg&apos;s comments come following his visit Kyiv on Feb. 20 where he lauded the &quot;positive discussions&quot; he held with Zelensky. &quot;Extensive and positive discussions with (Zelensky), the embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war, and his talented national security team,&quot; Kellogg wrote on X following the meeting. Earlier in the day on March 6, Kellogg said that the Istanbul talks can&apos;t serve as the basis for a Ukraine-Russia peace deal. The Istanbul agreements refer to negotiations between Ukraine and Russia held in Turkey in late March 2022, which outlined potential terms for a peace deal.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-brought-halts-to-aid-freeze-intelligence-sharing-on-themselves-kellogg-says/	2025-03-06T19:50:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1247741520.jpg
Norway to increase aid for Ukraine to $7.8 billion in 2025	Norway&apos;s parliamentary leaders agreed on March 6 to increase aid for Ukraine by 50 billion Norwegian krone ($4.6 billion) to a total of 85 billion Norwegian krone ($7.8 billion) in 2025. &quot;We are increasing support because there is a need for it, and it is a solid contribution to peace and stability in Europe,&quot; Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St&#xF8;re said following the agreement. &quot;It is a very, very high amount. It is needed in the defense struggle that Ukraine is in.&quot; Norway initially planned to allocate $2.1 billion for military aid to Ukraine in 2025 Although it was not immediately clear as to where the additional funds would be disbursed, Norwegian media outlet NRK reported that where the aid will be dictated by Ukraine&apos;s need. Norway has been one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters in Europe. Previously, St&#xF8;re announced on in December 2024 that the Nordic country will provide 2.7 billion Norwegian kroner ($242 million) to bolster Ukraine&apos;s navy and help it deter Russian threats in the Black Sea. Speaking to reporters about the new aid on March 6, St&#xF8;re also criticized actions taken by the Trump administration over the last week, including halting U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing for Ukraine. &quot;Ukraine is in a dramatic defensive battle against a sustained Russian attack. The changes in the United States have weakened support for Ukraine,&quot; St&#xF8;re said, adding that the situation was &quot;very sad.&quot; As the Nordic country&apos;s support for Ukraine continue, Norway previously pledged a new funding mechanism for Ukraine, the &quot;Norwegian model,&quot; meant to complement an existing &quot;Danish model&quot; of defense spending. The Danish model aims to purchase arms from Ukrainian manufacturers rather than providing materiel shipments.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway-to-increase-aid-to-ukraine-to-8-billion-in-2025/	2025-03-06T18:38:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1623063883.jpg
NATO could extend Article 5 protection to Ukraine without membership, Italian PM says	Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni suggested on March 6 that NATO could extend Article 5 protections to Ukraine without granting Kyiv membership in the alliance. The collective defense principle enshrined in NATO&apos;s Article 5 commits member nations to come to the defense of any other member state in the event of an attack. &quot;We need to think about more durable solutions&quot; than just sending European peacekeepers to Ukraine, Meloni said on the sidelines of the EU leaders&apos; meeting in Brussels. &quot;It&#x2019;s a different thing than entering NATO, but it implies extending the coverage that NATO countries have also to Ukraine,&quot; she added. European countries, led mainly by the U.K. and France, are developing a coalition of the willing to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Various countries outside the EU including Canada, Australia, and Ireland have voiced their openness to partake in such a mission. NATO allies reaffirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible&quot; path toward NATO membership in July 2024, although member states have yet to provide Ukraine with a formal invitiation, despite numerous calls to do so. Meloni&apos;s comments come as the clearest indication of her position on Ukraine&apos;s potential security guarantees. The Italian prime minister, who has served potential conduit between European allies and the Trump administration, will not likely find support for the proposal in the United States. The U.S. has thus far welcomed the idea of European peacekeeping troops monitoring a potential ceasefire in Ukraine but has fallen short of offering concrete security guarantees. Meloni&apos;s comments in Brussels comes as European leaders have failed to say how Europe would provide lasting security guarantees without U.S. backing, amid steps taken by the U.S. to distance itself from Ukraine. When asked how Europe might provide security guarantees to Ukraine without a U.S. backstop, both European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen dodged specifics and pivoted to praising the Ukrainian military. &quot;The best security guarantee are the Ukrainians themselves,&quot; Costa said, highlighting the fact that Ukraine has been fighting Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion for over three years.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-could-extend-article-5-protection-to-ukraine-without-membership-italian-pm-says/	2025-03-06T17:43:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/DSC07739------.jpg
Best security guarantee is the Ukrainian army' â€” EU leaders dodge specifics on long-term peace plan	The European Union reaffirmed its &quot;continued and unwavering support&quot; for Ukraine at a special summit in Brussels on March 6, but failed to say how Europe would provide lasting security guarantees without U.S. backing. EU leaders convened in Brussels to discuss European and Ukrainian defense amid U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s decision to halt military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv. When asked how Europe might provide security guarantees to Ukraine without a U.S. backstop, both European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen dodged specifics and pivoted to praising the Ukrainian military. &quot;The best security guarantee are the Ukrainians themselves,&quot; Costa said, highlighting the fact that Ukraine has been fighting Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion for over three years. &quot;We stand for Ukraine since day one, and we will continue, and we will continue even after the war,&quot; he said. The EU plans to &quot;explore our capabilities in the treaty framework to contribute for security guarantees,&quot; Costa said, without describing any specific proposals. He reiterated that security guarantees are not only essential for peace in Ukraine, but for the security of all Europe and the restoration of the &quot;international rules-based order.&quot; Von der Leyen backed up Costa&apos;s remarks regarding Ukraine being its own best security assurance. &quot;(T)he best security guarantee is the Ukrainian army,&quot; she said. President Volodymyr Zelensky attended the special European Council, addressing EU leaders and meeting with Costa and von der Leyen. In his address, he said Ukraine needs &quot;a comprehensive agreement on security guarantees&quot; in order to accept a peace deal with Russia. In a statement released at the conclusion of the summit, the EU pledged to provide &quot;enhanced political, financial, economic, humanitarian, military, and diplomatic support to Ukraine&quot; while &quot;stepping up pressure on Russia.&quot; The statement also emphasizes the EU&apos;s commitment to deepening cooperation with Ukraine&apos;s defense industry and Armed Forces. &quot;A Ukraine capable of defending itself effectively is an integral part of any future security guarantees,&quot; it reads. In their remarks at the close of the summit, both von der Leyen and Costa were measured in their remarks regarding the U.S. shifts in foreign policy under the Trump administration. When asked how Europe might respond to increasing U.S. hostility, von der Leyen reiterated that a &quot;peace through strength&quot; was in everyone&apos;s best interests, including Trump&apos;s.	https://kyivindependent.com/best-security-guarantee-is-the-ukrainian-army-eu-leaders-dodge-specifics-on-long-term-peace-plan/	2025-03-06T15:58:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202554405.jpg
We've made a lot of progress' â€” Trump says US on track to peace deal with Ukraine, Russia	The United States has &quot;made a lot of progress&quot; with both Ukraine and Russia in recent days, U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 6. Trump has long promised to bring about a swift end to Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, though progress towards such a deal was disrupted after he ejected President Volodymyr Zelensky from the White House on Feb. 28 and claimed Ukraine was &quot;not ready for peace.&quot; Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House, Trump was once again optimistic about ending the war, saying his team had made progress over the past couple days. &quot;I will say that we&apos;ve made a lot of progress with Ukraine and a lot of progress with Russia over the last couple of days and it&apos;d be great to bring (the war) to an end,&quot; he said. Trump said that a quick end to the war would mean &quot;we don&apos;t have to talk that way, about nuclear&quot; &#x2014;&#xA0;a reference to French President Emmanuel Macron&apos;s recent statement about potentially extending nuclear protection to France&apos;s allies in Europe. &quot;It&apos;d be great if everybody would get rid of our nuclear weapons,&quot; Trump added. Trump also claimed that during his first term as U.S. president he got &quot;very far along a process with Russia&quot; towards a nuclear disarmament agreeement, despite the difficulties of what he called &quot;the Russia Russia Russia hoax.&quot; The Trump team came under investigation during his first term in office for potentially illegal ties with Russia. The special counsel report found evidence of &quot;extensive criminal activity,&quot; though it did not find evidence that Trump was directly working for, or had ever been recruited by, Russian security services. While Trump did not share details on the type of &quot;progress&quot; made with Russia and Ukraine, his remarks coincide with Zelensky&apos;s announcement that U.S and Ukrainian officials would meet for talks next week. Trump&apos;s envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said the delegates would discuss a framework for a potential peace agreement in Saudi Arabia. The resumed cooperation comes after Zelensky issued a conciliatory statement calling the White House confrontation &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirming his willingness to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Trump read Zelensky&apos;s words aloud during his address to Congress on March 4, saying he appreciated the statement and had received &quot;strong signals&quot; that Russia was also ready to make a peace deal. Trump did not directly discuss the decision to freeze military aid to Kyiv in the address.	https://kyivindependent.com/weve-made-a-lot-of-progress-trump-says-us-on-track-to-peace-deal-with-ukraine-russia/	2025-03-06T14:17:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201360456.jpg
No decision yet on revoking legal status of Ukrainian refugees in US, Trump says	The White House has not come to a decision yet regarding the legal status of 240,000 Ukrainian refugees currently living in the United States, U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on March 6. Earlier in the day, Reuters reported that the administration is planning to revoke the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) of these Ukrainians, potentially paving the way for their deportation. Trump said he had not made a decision on the matter yet, but planned to do so &quot;pretty soon.&quot; He also claimed that his administration did not want to hurt refugees from Ukraine. &quot;We&apos;re not looking to hurt anybody and we&apos;re certainly not looking to hurt them,&quot; Trump said. &quot;And I&apos;m looking at that, and there were some people that think that&apos;s appropriate and some people don&apos;t, and I&apos;ll be making a decision pretty soon. But we&apos;re not looking to hurt them. Especially Ukrainians. They&apos;ve gone through a lot.&quot; According to four undisclosed sources who spoke to Reuters, the plan to revoke TPS predates Trump&apos;s public argument with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28 and is part of the administration&apos;s broader crackdown on the more than 1.8 million people staying in the U.S. on humanitarian grounds. Later in the day, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed the report as &quot;fake news,&quot; claiming that no decision had been made. Trump, who campaigned intensively on promises to deport millions of migrants, began rolling back protections for Ukrainian and other refugees mere days after returning to the White House. In late January, the administration suspended the Uniting for Ukraine program, which allowed Ukrainians to stay in the U.S. for up to two years. The program also granted refugees the right to work and receive health insurance. Over 6 million Ukrainian citizens fled their homes in the wake of Russia&apos;s all-out invasion in 2022. Around 5.2 million remain abroad, with the vast majority receiving protection in EU countries. Trump&apos;s decision on TPS could affect 240,000 Ukrainian refugees in the U.S. The administration has come under scrutiny for its treatment of Ukraine, a longstanding ally, in contrast to its increasing warmth towards Russia. In recent days, the White House has frozen all military aid shipments and stopped intelligence sharing with Kyiv. Zelensky said on March 6 that the U.S. and Ukraine have resumed cooperation and that delegations will meet for talks next week.	https://kyivindependent.com/no-decision-yet-on-revoking-legal-status-of-ukrainian-refugees-in-us-trump-says/	2025-03-06T13:25:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194444069.jpg
US ready to go 'all in' on sanctions against Russia, treasury secretary says	The United States is prepared to go &quot;all in&quot; on sanctions against Russia in order to pressure Moscow to the negotiating table, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on March 6. Bessent&apos;s remarks come shortly after Reuters reported that the White House is considering a plan to ease sanctions against Russia as part of a deal to end the war in Ukraine. Speaking at the Economic Club of New York, Bessent criticized former U.S. President Joe Biden for imposing &quot;egregiously weak sanctions&quot; on Russia and said the current administration was prepared to enact harsher restrictions to gain leverage in upcoming talks. &quot;A major factor that has enabled the Russian war machine&apos;s continued financing was the Biden administration&apos;s egregiously weak sanctions on Russian energy, stemming from worries about upward pressure on U.S. energy prices,&quot; Bessent said. While Biden did impose sweeping restrictions on Russia&apos;s oil sector in the last month of his term, Bessent criticized the former president for taking such belated action. He said the increased sanctions would remain in effect and that U.S. President Donald Trump was willing to threaten more severe penalties. &quot;This administration has kept the enhanced sanctions in place and will not hesitate to go &apos;all in&apos; should it provide leverage in peace negotiations,&quot; he said. The Trump administration has faced outcry for its abrupt policy shift on Ukraine and its apparent friendliness towards the Kremlin. The reported plan to lift sanctions comes as the White House has canceled military aid to Ukraine and stopped intelligence sharing with Kyiv. Bessent&apos;s remarks seemed tailored to deflect some of this criticism, portraying the Biden administration as soft on Russia and emphasizing Trump&apos;s willingness to take a hard line. Sanctions on Moscow &quot;will be used explicitly and aggressively for immediate maximum impact,&quot; Bessent said. The treasury secretary also said the U.S. planned to intensify sanctions against Iran, which has supplied Russia with Shahed drones and short-range ballistic missiles, used in attacks on Ukrainian cities. &quot;We are going to shutdown Iran&apos;s oil sector and drone manufacturing capabilities,&quot; Bessent said. Shortly after his inauguration, Trump threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions on Russia to force their hand in negotiations, saying &quot;we can do it the easy way or the hard way.&quot; In the following weeks, Trump instead lashed out at Ukraine, claiming President Volodymyr Zelensky was &quot;not ready for peace&quot; and withholding critical U.S. support. Zelensky announced on March 6 that U.S. and Ukrainian delegations have resumed cooperation and will hold talks next week.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-ready-to-go-all-in-on-sanctions-against-russia-treasury-secretary-says/	2025-03-06T12:49:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203649352.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine, US delegations to meet next week, Zelensky announces	Key developments on March 6: Ukraine and U.S. delegations have resumed work and are scheduled to meet next week, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced at the Special European Council on March 6. &quot;Ukraine is not only ready to take the necessary steps for peace, but we are also proposing what those steps are,&quot; Zelensky said, expressing hope for a &quot;meaningful&quot; dialogue with U.S. officials. Senior White House Fox News Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich wrote on X that the talks are set for March 11 and will involve Andriy Yermak, Zelensky&apos;s chief of staff. The U.S. delegation will reportedly include U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. &quot;The idea is to get down a framework for a peace agreement and an initial ceasefire as well,&quot; Witkoff later said outside the White House. He added that discussions are ongoing to finalize the meeting&apos;s location, with Riyadh or Jeddah under consideration. According to Axios, the meeting will take place on March 12. The announcement follows rising tensions between Kyiv and Washington after a heated Oval Office exchange between Zelensky, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance on Feb. 28. The dispute derailed a planned bilateral deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources and led to Trump freezing all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. An agreement on Ukraine&apos;s mineral resources remains stalled as Trump seeks a &quot;bigger, better deal,&quot; CBS News reported on March 4. White House officials publicly indicated that Zelensky must issue an apology and demonstrate a commitment to peace talks for discussions to resume. On March 4, Zelensky called the White House clash &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his willingness to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Waltz suggested on March 5 that Trump may lift the pause on military aid once peace negotiations are arranged and confidence-building measures are taken, Reuters reported. The Istanbul talks can&apos;t serve as the basis for a Ukraine-Russia peace deal, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said on March 6. &quot;The Istanbul accords happened 30 days after the invasion, and the demands in Istanbul were fairly significant on a very weakened Ukraine,&quot; Kellogg said at the Council on Foreign Relations discussion. He described the agreements as a starting point for future negotiations but doubted they represented a fair framework for all parties. The Istanbul agreements refer to negotiations between Ukraine and Russia held in Turkey in late March 2022, which outlined potential terms for a peace deal. They included Ukraine adopting a neutral status, abandoning NATO aspirations, imposing military restrictions, and delaying negotiations over Russian-occupied Crimea&apos;s status for 10-15 years. Trump&apos;s envoy emphasized that conditions today differ significantly from those in 2022. He also noted that the Trump administration aims to reset U.S.-Russia relations, criticizing previous U.S. leadership for avoiding direct engagement with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kellogg&apos;s remarks follow U.S.-Russian talks in Istanbul on Feb. 27 and an earlier round in Riyadh on Feb. 18, which are part of Washington&apos;s push for a swift peace settlement. Trump expressed interest in meeting Putin, marking a stark departure from his predecessor, U.S. President Joe Biden, who had refused to engage with the Russian leader since the full-scale invasion began. Earlier, U.S. envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff suggested that the 2022 Istanbul agreements could serve as a foundation for a future Ukraine-Russia peace treaty. Despite his role as Trump&apos;s special envoy, Kellogg has been sidelined in recent peace efforts and excluded from both the Saudi and Turkish negotiations. Analysts suggest this may be due to his perceived pro-Ukraine stance and alleged Russian objections to his involvement. Military experts proposed to deploy European air forces to protect Kyiv and other non-front-line Ukrainian cities from Russian aerial attacks, the Guardian reported on March 6, citing the so-called Sky Shield plan. The plan could potentially work as part of the &quot;truce in the sky&quot; proposed by President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier this week, preventing missiles, long-range drones, and bombs from targeting civilian infrastructure. The project&apos;s supporters said it could be a European-led air defense zone involving 120 fighter jets that will operate separately from NATO. According to the plan, developed by former British Air Force planners in cooperation with Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, the protection zone would cover Ukraine&apos;s three operational nuclear power plants, as well as the cities of Odesa and Lviv in Ukraine&apos;s south and west. The country&apos;s east, where the fierce battles are ongoing in Donetsk Oblast, was not included in the zone. According to the authors, this step can be more tangible than the deployment of ground troops as peacekeepers. In February, the Washington Post reported that up to 30,000 European troops could be deployed in Ukraine after a potential ceasefire. Among those who supported the Sky Shield plan are Philip Breedlove, former NATO supreme commander in Europe, Polish ex-President Aleksander Kwasniewski, and Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania&apos;s former foreign minister. European defense ministries have considered the plan, but their leaders have been reluctant to authorize patrolling Ukrainian skies while Russia&apos;s full-scale war is ongoing, the Guardian wrote. In light of the U.S. policy shift and suspension of military aid to Ukraine, the initiative can be revisited, the news outlet noted. Yet, Western partners still fear an escalation if an aircraft from either side is attacked or shot down. Russian forces regularly launch drones and missiles against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, inflicting heavy civilian casualties. A Russian missile strike against a hotel in Kryvyi Rih late on March 5, carried out shortly after the U.S. paused vital intelligence sharing, killed four people and injured over 30. According to figures released by Kyiv, U.N. statistics, and open-source data published by BBC Russia, the total death toll of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers, as well as Ukrainian civilians, stood at over 148,000 as of mid-February. Ukraine has not yet received detailed information on U.S. intelligence-sharing restrictions but is already exploring alternatives, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on March 6, Interfax-Ukraine reported. &quot;We are already working on alternatives, including requesting (assistance) from Germany if necessary,&quot; Umerov said at a press conference in Berlin, following talks with German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. Washington cut off intelligence-sharing with Kyiv on March 5, following its decision to freeze all military aid to Ukraine as part of an effort to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine on U.S. terms. The intelligence cutoff threatens Ukraine&apos;s ability to track Russian military movements and detect aerial strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Reports suggest the U.S. may have also prohibited allies like the U.K. from passing on intelligence obtained through American sources. U.S. officials have indicated the pause could be temporary and contingent on progress toward peace talks. France has continued to provide military intelligence to Ukraine, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on March 6, according to BFM TV. European leaders are expected to discuss additional support for Ukraine and increased defense spending at an EU summit in Brussels on March 6. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Brussels for the emergency meeting, which was convened to address Europe&apos;s security strategy amid growing concerns over Washington&apos;s shifting foreign policy. The U.S. pause on sharing intelligence with Kyiv affects warnings against Russian drones and missiles striking Ukrainian military and civilian targets, the New York Times reported on March 5, citing undisclosed U.S. and Ukrainian officials. The U.S. stopped sharing intelligence with Ukraine on March 5, shortly after it froze all military assistance as part of an effort to pressure Kyiv into quick negotiations with Russia on U.S. terms. Russian forces regularly launch drones and missiles against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, inflicting heavy civilian casualties. A Russian missile strike against a hotel in Kryvyi Rih late on March 5, carried out shortly after the intelligence sharing pause, killed four people and injured at least 30. According to figures released by Kyiv, U.N. statistics, and open-source data published by BBC Russia, the total death toll of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers, as well as Ukrainian civilians, stood at over 148,000 as of mid-February. A senior Ukrainian official told the NYT that the pause in intelligence sharing would make it more difficult for Ukrainian forces to strike Russian targets. Kyiv still has access to other satellite imagery, they added. Valerii Kondratiuk, the former Ukraine&apos;s spy chief, said that intelligence sharing primarily involves the exchange of satellite images. While European companies have their own satellites, they are not focused on military movements, he added. Some unnamed U.S. officials voiced hope that any pause in intelligence sharing would be short and have little practical impact. A senior Trump administration official told the NYT the original plan was to suspend military and intelligence sharing for a week or two as part of a campaign to put pressure on President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to the NYT, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has a &quot;sizable presence&quot; in Ukraine, with some of its officers deployed in the country to help Ukraine with targeting. The CIA has also helped set up at least three secret signals intelligence collection bases that Ukraine uses to intercept Russian communications to reduce their reliance on U.S. intelligence, the newspaper reported.

â€˜He betrayed every one of usâ€™ â€“ US soldiers in Ukraine speak out after Trumpâ€™s military aid halt	Editor&#x2019;s note: In accordance with the security protocols of the Ukrainian military, soldiers featured in this story are identified by first names and callsigns only. American volunteer soldiers fighting in Ukraine say that they feel &#x201C;betrayed&#x201D; by their own country after the U.S. halted military aid and stopped sharing intelligence with Kyiv in early March. &#x201C;(U.S. President Donald Trump) betrayed every one of us,&#x201D; a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, who goes by the callsign Goldfish, told the Kyiv Independent. A few days after the heated Oval Office clash during President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s visit to Washington on Feb. 28, Trump froze the delivery of all U.S. military aid to Ukraine, worth billions, in a move to push Kyiv into peace talks with Russia. CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed on March 5 that the U.S. has also halted intelligence sharing with Ukraine, which could affect Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to identify Russian targets, as well as to defend itself from missile strikes. The American soldiers who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said they were &#x201C;horrified&#x201D; by their country&#x2019;s recent decisions and the ensuing consequences on the ground in Ukraine. With many of them fighting in Ukraine since 2022, they say watching their country take a major U-turn in Ukraine policy and soften toward Russia has been hurtful and deeply offensive, especially after losing comrades one after another to the war, including many Americans. &#x201C;Never have I ever thought that I would be listening to any U.S. public figure &#x2013; let alone the president &#x2013; openly declare support for an aggressor,&#x201D; Goldfish, a 33-year-old Alaskan currently serving with the 25th Airborne Brigade, said. &#x201C;If we stand here now on the side of the oppressor, literally telling Ukraine, either submit or cease to exist, that&apos;s not peace &#x2013; that&#x2019;s subjugation.&#x201D; U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office in Washington, D.C., U.S. on Feb. 10, 2025. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)While the exact number of U.S. volunteer soldiers fighting in various units in Ukraine is unknown to the public, at least 50, including about 40 U.S. military veterans, were killed in action as of February 2024, according to the American defense online publication Task &amp; Purpose. A 2025 CNN investigation revealed that more than 20 are missing in action on the front line. Understanding the significance of U.S. military aid and the immense sacrifice that Ukraine has already made to defend its country, some American fighters hoped that Trump wouldn&#x2019;t abandon Ukraine like that, soldier Levi Perez, 36, said. &#x201C;Deep down in our very souls, we knew it was coming,&#x201D; Perez, an Alaskan who goes by his callsign Joker, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Our reputation for the foreseeable future is pretty much gone,&#x201D; he said, noting that other Western countries are losing trust in the U.S. and may turn away from further political and economic ties. Perez and a few other American soldiers in Ukraine are convinced that Trump and his team&#x2019;s hasty moves are making the possibility of World War III inevitable, especially with China likely eyeing the moment to invade another sovereign nation. &#x201C;We are beyond the point of control (where we can avoid World War III) because Russia is not going to retreat completely, they won&apos;t give back the stolen territory, and Ukraine won&apos;t let them keep the territory,&#x201D; Perez said, referring to the roughly 20% of the Ukrainian land that Russia occupies. A surge in the Ukrainian troop losses is expected with the U.S. military aid freeze and the intelligence sharing halt, the American soldiers say. A former police officer from a southern city in the U.S. currently serving in the Ukrainian military says that he&#x2019;s most worried about the bans&#x2019; potential cost especially on the civilian lives. &#x201C;The civilians are going to suffer exponentially, almost more, because now with the lack of intelligence, we don&apos;t have as much information about rocket and drone strikes coming from Russian territory,&#x201D; the police officer-turned-soldier, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to his unit&#x2019;s protocols, told the Kyiv Independent. The most terrifying part is seeing how the U.S.&#x2019; next steps will impact Ukraine and its people, because &#x201C;Ukrainian people are incredible,&#x201D; according to a fellow American soldier, who goes by the callsign Gimli. &#x201C;The nightmare that keeps me up the most is whether my country will ever recover,&#x201D; Gimli, a 33-year-old former U.S. army serviceman from Washington, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Or if Trump and the Kremlin have completely crippled the future of my country.&#x201D; Gimli and other American soldiers said they had a completely different vision of their country&#x2014;a democratic nation they believed had always tried to do the right thing despite setbacks and to help the world as &#x201C;defenders of freedom.&#x201D; Now, they say they feel humiliated. &#x201C;I accepted the fact that I just may not have a country to go back to because I&#x2019;m not going to go back and live under a fascist regime,&#x201D; he said, adding that he hopes that &#x201C;the Ukrainians can forgive my people someday.&#x201D; The American soldiers interviewed said their hopes were now hanging on Europe to step up its support for Ukraine in what could be its darkest months to come. Goldfish, who received a near fatal injury in embattled Donetsk Oblast in the summer of 2023, said that &#x201C;Europe is the sleeping tiger in this war.&#x201D; &#x201C;I always thought it would be Russia that would just poke too far towards Europe or make too many threats. But it wasn&apos;t,&#x201D; Goldfish said. &#x201C;It was America that poked the tiger and woke it up.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-soldiers-in-ukraine-trumps-military-aid-halt/	2025-03-06T11:59:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2197496691.jpg
Eutelsat in talks with EU to possibly replace Starlink in Ukraine, CEO confirms	French satellite operator Eutelsat Communications is in advanced talks with the European Union to possibly replace tech billionaire Elon Musk&apos;s Starlink in Ukraine, Bloomberg reported on March 6. &quot;Everyone is asking us today, &apos;Can you replace the large number of terminals of Starlink in Ukraine,&apos; and we are looking at that,&quot; Eutelsat CEO Eva Berneke told Bloomberg. Eutelsat, which already operates in Ukraine, has thousands of terminals deployed, although not all are connected to the network. Starlink has played a vital role in Ukraine&apos;s battlefield communications, with around 42,000 terminals providing service to the military, medical facilities, businesses, and aid organizations. Berneke said the company is in discussions with suppliers to provide both military-grade and standard terminals and would need &quot;a couple of months&quot; to supply 40,000 units. Concerns over Starlink&apos;s availability escalated after the U.S. paused military aid to Ukraine on March 3. Reuters reported that U.S. officials have raised the possibility of restricting Ukraine&apos;s access to Starlink. Musk, who owns Starlink and has close ties to U.S. President Donald Trump, denied the intention to turn off the terminals. Eutelsat&apos;s proposal combines OneWeb&apos;s low Earth orbit satellites, positioned around 1,200 kilometers (746 miles) above the surface, with its geostationary satellites at 35,000 kilometers (21,748 miles). The dual-constellation approach could provide essential connectivity for Ukraine&apos;s military, including for drone operations that have inflicted significant losses on Russian forces. OneWeb already provides services to Ukraine through a German distributor, but scaling up would require European governments to approve procurement and integration plans. The European Commission is assessing ways to help Ukraine secure satellite communications in case Starlink access is restricted, Politico reported on March 3.	https://kyivindependent.com/eutelsat-in-talks-with-eu-to-possibly-replace-starlink-in-ukraine-ceo-confirms/	2025-03-06T11:37:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1775225270.jpg
Ukrainian, US delegations to discuss peace framework in Saudi Arabia, Witkoff says	Ukrainian and U.S. delegations are set to discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement next week in Saudi Arabia, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, told reporters on March 6. &quot;The idea is to get down a framework for a peace agreement and an initial ceasefire as well,&quot; Witkoff said outside the White House. He added that discussions are ongoing to finalize the meeting&apos;s location, with Riyadh or Jeddah under consideration.

Earlier, on March 5, Yermak wrote on Telegram that he and Waltz had discussed &quot;further steps toward a just and lasting peace. &quot; Tensions between Kyiv and Washington escalated following a heated Oval Office exchange between Zelensky, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance on Feb. 28.

As protests engulf Serbia, President Vucic looks for support East and West	Editor&apos;s Note: Following a number of attacks against peaceful protestors in Serbia, the Kyiv Independent agreed to not publish the last names of people who gave comments for this story. BELGRADE, Serbia &#x2014; Thousands of protestors walked 300 kilometers on March 1 from Belgrade to the southern city of Nis to rally support for an anti-corruption protest that took aim at the ruling party. Serbia&apos;s Russia-friendly President Aleksandar Vucic has often used a Kremlin playbook to discredit the protests that occasionally rise in a country balancing between Russia and the West. Such a balancing act has been increasingly difficult to maintain. Nis, the country&apos;s third largest city home to 250,000, has long been President Vucic&apos;s core voting stronghold along other cities and towns further away from the capital. Yet, residents who greeted the arriving protesters said they were tired of their ruling party and wanted to listen to what young people have to say. The Serbian protests began in November after a train station roof in the town of Novi Sad collapsed, killing 15 people. This roof had been hastily reconstructed in 2024 with Chinese and state funds and a procurement procedure widely viewed as corrupt. Students took to the streets, demanding accountability and justice for the victims. They used a bloody hand symbol to highlight how corruption in Serbia cost lives. Vucic had been actively blaming the upheaval on the West, saying that foreign forces have been attempting to spark a &quot;Ukrainian-style revolution in Serbia.&quot; The protestors, however, aren&apos;t pro-Ukrainian or anti-Russian, and are united primarily by their opposition to the current government rather than broader ideological takes. Protests in Serbia have gone on for over 100 days in 60 different settlements. Students, farmers and businesses continue to strike in support. Universities, some of which are now closed, are used as base-camps for democratic decision-making among the students. Alexander, a student who took part in daily marches, said the protesters remain hopeful. &quot;We really feel like we can change something this time,&quot; he said.

(Andrej Isakovic / AFP via Getty Images)The movement follows a pattern. Students announce a mass rally in a Serbian city, then walk to that location for days. Along the way they talk to locals to gather support for the movement. A taxi driver in Nis on March 1 said his views had changed since seeing the protestors in the flesh, rather than on state TV where they are routinely denigrated. &quot;In the Balkans, children are always taught to listen to their elders. But now we are listening to them. They are teaching us to stand up for our rights,&quot; he said. The pro-democracy movement is changing Serbia&apos;s image. Protesters seek respect for the rule of law, a free press and, fair elections, and an end to widespread corruption. So far, the protests have prompted Vucic to publicly oust Prime Minister Milos Vucevic and Transport Minister Darko Glisic, both of whom remain in their place as they await a vote in parliament. Arrests of several company heads and policemen in what Vucic has called a &quot;fierce fight against corruption&quot; had also taken place. Protestors, however, show a deep skepticism towards Vucic&apos;s proposed anti-corruption measures which are widely seen to be a last ditch attempt to cling to power. Students interviewed by the Kyiv Independent expressed deep frustration with the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), blaming it for the country&apos;s lack of media freedom, rigged elections, and neglect of public services and civil liberties. Andjela, 22, a student protestor, said, &quot;The whole ruling party should resign. They&apos;ve shown they are unfit to run the country. We haven&apos;t had free elections in my lifetime. It&apos;s unsafe here, incomes are low, prices are high, and criminals go unpunished, including the thugs who beat up students.&quot; A woman holds a placard reading &quot;Smells like corruption spirit&quot; during a demonstration in Belgrade, Serbia, on Jan. 24, 2025.

(Andrej Isakovic / AFP / Getty Images)The latest election, in 2023, was seen as being widely rigged, with 50,000 voters from the Republika Srpska, a ethnic Serbian enclave of Bosnia, were bussed to Belgrade to sway the vote. Mass protests followed, but they led to no change. A year later, a new protest movement was built on years of unresolved discontent. In the aftermath of the Kosovo War of 1999, a mass student-led movement called OTPOR brought down the country&apos;s autocrat, Slobodan Milosevic. Srecko Mihailovi&#x107;, a veteran protester of the OTPOR movement, said that he&apos;s been on marches for 30 years and hopes he won&apos;t be doing it to the grave. &quot;We&apos;ve had the same president for 10 years, this is not normal,&quot; he said. &quot;But we need to show that Serbia isn&apos;t Vucic.&quot; Vucic&apos;s response to the protests has been chaotic. The president claimed, without evidence, that outside forces are behind the protests and has accused the West of trying to incite a revolution. At the same time, Vucic had told EU leaders that &quot;Putinists&quot; are trying to stir up trouble to deepen the country&apos;s ties with Russia. On Jan. 20, Serbian police detained 14 foreign nationals at an NGO summit in Belgrade. Such tactics have been used by the ruling party since 2012. State tabloids bully critics of the government, illegally publish their personal data online, and incite violence against those who oppose the government. Authorities have also been linked to hooligan groups that stir up trouble during protests to justify police action. A similar tactic was used during the 2013-14 EuroMaidan Revolution in Ukraine, when the pro-Kremlin government employed thugs to fight with protesters, coining the term Titushky.

(Tadija Anastasjevic / AFP / Getty Images)Andjela, who took part in protests, noted that this year&apos;s protesters are alert for provocateurs. A protester was beaten up, while other students were rammed with cars and hospitalized, she said. &quot;We are careful in case it escalates and more of our students end up in the hospital,&quot; Andjela added. At present, there doesn&apos;t seem to be a solution to the political crisis. Student protesters know their government&apos;s playbook well, so they tread carefully. They appeal to patriotism and wave only Serbian flags to avoid appearing influenced by outsiders. So far, the careful approach has united support across societal sectors, including the rural population, who were once Vucic&apos;s core base. Farmers brought tractors to protect students, blocking key Belgrade bridges. The rallies have also gained international support from students in the U.S., Austria, Croatia, and vocal celebrity support from tennis superstar Novak Djokovic and Madonna. The countrywide solidarity has reduced citizens&apos; fears of government-sponsored attacks, threats to family members, and job losses, which previously weakened protests in 2012, 2020, and 2023. Boris, an engineering student taking part in protests, said, &quot;This time we don&apos;t fear the government. They should fear us.&quot; The question remains what would follow were the government to call a snap election to ease the crisis. Boris said that he would like to see an interim government of &quot;democracy experts and professionals&quot; in place who could create the conditions for fair, free elections. At present, students do not have a plan to back a political candidate. They have distanced themselves from opposition parties as they view them as part of the system they are up against. Up until now, the official opposition had been fragmented and cautious. Opposition party members &quot;have nothing to do with the organization&quot; and support the protests &quot;as civilians only,&quot; said lawmaker Borko Stefanovic, deputy president of the Party of Freedom and Justice. &quot;The regime could misuse this, saying the opposition is behind the protests. But the students lead.&quot; A fight broke out between opposition and ruling party members in the Serbian National Assembly over the Novi Sad train station tragedy in Belgrade, Serbia, on Nov. 25, 2024. (Filip Stevanovic / Anadolu / Getty Images)On March 4, some unconventional action was taken in parliament. Lawmaker Radomir Lazovic of the Green-Left front voiced support for the protestors and launched fireworks in the Serbian parliament, which hospitalized three people. A brawl ensued between opposition and ruling party members. &quot;A clear message was sent that we do not accept the institutional violence of the Serbian Progressive Party, which has been carried out for years. The only agenda item at the Serbian parliament sitting can be the fulfillment of students&apos; demands,&quot; Lazovic said. Yet, a new election might not be the solution the protestors are hoping for. &quot;No elections would work under current conditions and without a free press. Vucic would steal and rig another election,&quot; Stefanovic said. The countrywide support for change in Serbia, however, doesn&apos;t mean those on the street agree on policy and their country&apos;s alignment. Though EU leaders expressed admiration and support, the absence of EU flags in the crowd is deliberate. Potestors see their cause as a local concern they must deal with within-country. An IPSOS poll in December 2024 revealed that only 46% of Serbs would support EU membership in a referendum. Many protesters feel the EU and U.S. leaders have emboldened Vucic following years of hostilities in the region. Many also dislike the West for their handling of the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s. The EU has worked with Vucic on ammunition exports, with $800 million in Serbian ammunition ending up in Ukraine through Western intermediaries. In July 2024, the Serbian government granted the EU access to its large lithium reserves. This also sparked thousands of Serbs to come out in protest, citing environmental concerns. Vucic has also gained favor with U.S. President Donald Trump by allowing his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to build a hotel in central Belgrade on top of a war memorial. Residents of Belgrade viewed the proposal with hostility. Anti-Western sentiments have long united Serbia with Russia, even though the Serbian population continues to migrate west for education and work. This connection dates back to the 19th century when the Russian Empire helped secure Serbia&apos;s independence from the Ottoman Empire. It was also bolstered by a common religion and church ties. Today, the bond is fuelled by anger over NATO&apos;s 1999 bombing of Belgrade to end President Milosevic&apos;s war against Kosovo. Serbia, backed by Russia, still claims Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008. Serbia maintains a broad conservative, Orthodox streak with strong anti-LGBTQ+ views. Many Serbs see Western nations as too &quot;liberal.&quot; In contrast, many who came of age during the 1990s view Russian President Vladimir Putin as &quot;a strong leader&quot; pushing back against the West. A 2023 poll by the Henry Jackson Society showed that over 61% of Serbs reported no change in their positive views on Russia since the start of the all-out war in Ukraine, and 21.7% said their support for Russia has increased.

Z t-shirts and Putin mugs are sold in central markets. Serbian and Russian flags and &quot;Zajedno (together)&quot; signs are widespread. Since 2022, mercenaries from far-right groups have been traveling to Russia to fight against Ukraine. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Serbia has welcomed up to 300,000 Russians fleeing the war. When these Russians share anti-Putin views, it can prompt strong reactions from the locals. Nino, who owns a cigar lounge in Belgrade, said, &quot;God has given us the gift of these liberal Russians. We&apos;ll show them the true path and send them back home, more Russian than ever!&quot; But attitudes in the capital, Belgrade, have shifted as an influx of wealthy Russian IT-workers has slowly undermined the imagined &apos;Slavic Orthodox brotherhood.&quot; Many Belgraders now resent recent Russian immigrants for not integrating, driving up housing prices and gentrifying the city with expensive shops and restaurants packed by foreigners. Students protesting in the streets say neither the EU nor Russia will do anything to help them. While many still express emotional ties to Russian culture, they say they do not wish to live in a Putin-style political system.	https://kyivindependent.com/as-protests-engulf-serbia-president-vucic-struggles-to-play-both-sides/	2025-03-06T10:49:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2183585364.jpg
BREAKING: Ukraine, US delegations resume work, to meet next week, Zelensky announces	Ukraine and U.S. delegations have resumed work and are scheduled to meet next week, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced at the Special European Council on March 6. &quot;Ukraine is not only ready to take the necessary steps for peace, but we are also proposing what those steps are,&quot; Zelensky said, expressing hope for a &quot;meaningful&quot; dialogue with U.S. officials. Senior White House Fox News Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich wrote on X that the talks are set for March 11 and will involve Andriy Yermak, Zelensky&apos;s chief of staff. The U.S. delegation will reportedly include U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. According to Axios, the meeting will take place on March 12. The announcement follows rising tensions between Kyiv and Washington after a heated Oval Office exchange between Zelensky, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance on Feb. 28. The dispute derailed a planned bilateral deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources and led to Trump freezing all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. An agreement on Ukraine&apos;s mineral resources remains stalled as Trump seeks a &quot;bigger, better deal,&quot; CBS News reported on March 4. White House officials publicly indicated that Zelensky must issue an apology and demonstrate a commitment to peace talks for discussions to resume. On March 4, Zelensky called the White House clash &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his willingness to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Waltz suggested on March 5 that Trump may lift the pause on military aid once peace negotiations are arranged and confidence-building measures are taken, Reuters reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-delegations-to-meet-next-week-zelensky-announces/	2025-03-06T09:58:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202968684.jpg
The war continues because of Russia' â€“ Zelensky's full speech at European Council	Editor&apos;s note: This is the transcript of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s address to the Special European Council released by the President&apos;s Office on March 6. President Costa! President von der Leyen! Dear colleagues, glad to see you all. I&#x2019;ve already spoken to many of you these days and weeks, and I am grateful for your support. Ukrainians really appreciate that in a time of such great emotions in global politics, European integrity is preserved, and Europe is really trying to do the right thing. First. I want to inform all of you that our teams &#x2013; Ukraine and America &#x2013; have resumed work. We hope that next week we will have a meaningful meeting. Ukraine has been seeking peace since the very first second of the war, and we have always said that the only reason why the war continues is because of Russia. Ukraine is not only ready to take the necessary steps for peace, but we are also proposing what those steps are. And I ask you to support us in this &#x2013; support Ukraine and those European leaders who are helping to pave the way for peace. We see several steps now. Everyone needs to make sure that Russia, as the sole source of this war, accepts the need to end it. This can be proved by two forms of silence that are easy to establish and monitor, namely, no attacks on energy and other civilian infrastructure &#x2013; truce for missiles, bombs, and long-range drones, and the second is truce on the water, meaning no military operations in the Black Sea. The next step is basic trust to the circumstances in which the negotiations are taking place. Ukrainians, all Europeans, Americans, every human heart in the world that does not agree with the war &#x2013; we all need to feel that the Russians are not deceiving us. The release of prisoners can be a means of establishing basic trust. And this should be based on the understanding that any truce and any form of trust building measures can only be a prologue to a full and fair settlement, to a comprehensive agreement on security guarantees and an end to the war. Let me emphasize once again that Ukrainians do really want peace, but not at the cost of giving up Ukraine. Is Russia capable of giving up the war &#x2013; this is the question that any negotiations must answer. And please be sure that Ukraine will share all the details of peace plans and talks&#x2019; process to all of Europe, every European nation that helps must be on board on the path to peace. Second. I urge you to continue to support the position that any issues related to Ukraine&#x2019;s security should be resolved with Ukraine&#x2019;s participation, just as any issues related to the security of your nations or any issues related to the security of our entire Europe should be resolved with your participation. Only this can guarantee peace on the continent and respect for the interests of all European states. That is why we are trying to ensure that European interests are represented. Anything that affects the security of Europe should be resolved with the participation of Europe. Third. I thank you for your determination to help us defend Ukraine. Every day and every night we have to protect lives. Russian ballistic missiles continue to strike our cities. The shelling at the front continues. Russian sabotage groups are still trying to enter our territory across the border in Sumy and Kharkiv regions. Moscow is not reducing its investment in death, increasing its army, and making no pauses in trying to overcome sanctions. Russia now has 220 brigades with war experience. In five years, they will bring this number to 300. We need to respond to this by taking care of lives now, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. I welcome the European Commission&#x2019;s efforts to re-arm Europe and the Rearm Europe Plan is the right initiative. The defense funds under this European Plan should strengthen all parts of Europe, and I call for a significant part to be allocated to arms production in Ukraine &#x2013; our industrial capabilities are the fastest and most relevant to the current security threats. I welcome the efforts of my European colleagues &#x2013; and this is not just about the EU, but about Europe in a broad sense &#x2013; to increase national defense spending and modernize national armies. Everyone in Europe needs this. When we agree on the format of the Armed Forces of Europe, this format will rely on the strength of national armies and on the experience of deploying partner contingents in Ukraine, which is what we are now working on. I also welcome the investments of all partners in the defense industry &#x2013; in Ukraine and in your countries, the industrial base of Europe must grow. Europe should become the place where the most technologically advanced and effective weapons in the world are produced, and this is not a fantasy if Europeans really set themselves this goal. And a few more things. I&#x2019;m grateful to you for the 16th EU sanctions package, and we must continue this pressure. We need a 17th sanctions package. The sanctions should work until Russia stops the occupation. I know that a special European financial instrument for Ukraine&#x2019;s resilience is being developed, please speed up this work. In all these circumstances, it is needed to speed up the work of our teams in the negotiations on Ukraine&#x2019;s membership in the EU. As of now, the work on clusters is actually blocked without any rational reason. We need common sense, we need to unblock the work on clusters, and this can be done at the leadership level. Thank you.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelenskys-full-speech-at-european-council/	2025-03-06T09:46:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/5ab191f76b8eff4926200ac7d107cf74_1741277568.jpeg
â€˜Peaceâ€™ with Russia already means a steady stream of hybrid attacks on the US and Europe	With every day of the new White House administration that passes, the chances of Russia being brought in from the cold on the international stage after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine appear to be increasing. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s ongoing Kremlin charm campaign has seen Ukraine and Europe sidelined in peace negotiations, reports that sanctions against Moscow could be lifted, and even accusations from top Democrats that the U.S. is actively siding with Russia. Experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent say the U.S.&apos;s new stance ignores one crucial thing &#x2014; Vladimir Putin&apos;s Russia does not, and never has wanted, truly peaceful relations with the West and has been engaged in a hybrid war with it for decades. Putin&#x2019;s hybrid assaults on the West have included assassinations abroad, the egregious jailing of foreigners in Russia, the funneling of weapons and facilitation of corruption, and, of course, an infamous army of hackers who carry out cyberattacks. Conflict with the West is &quot;the foundation of (Putin&#x2019;s) rule now,&quot; John Foreman, CBE, a former UK defence attach&#xE9; in both Kyiv and Moscow, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;If you&apos;ve got the foreign bogey &#x2014; you know, Anglo-Saxons, the predatory West, fascist Ukrainians, puppet states and all that &#x2014; that&apos;s the justification for why you have to be in power indefinitely, why Russian freedoms are being crushed and why there&apos;s no free media.&quot; Foreman was stationed in Moscow in the immediate aftermath of the poisoning of Soviet defector Sergey Skripal in Salisbury, an event he says sealed U.K. hostility towards the Russian government after a long history of hybrid attacks on NATO members. Regardless of Trump&#x2019;s planned peace deal with Russia, that campaign, he said, &quot;will endure, because the wider conflict with the West and with Ukraine is about dividing us to achieve political goals.&quot; &quot;So why would Putin stop that?&#x201D; Lauri Luht is currently Estonia&#x2019;s cyber attach&#xE9; in Kyiv. He recalled waking up during a 2007 cyber attack to find government websites, including that of the border service for which he worked at the time, shut down and an email inbox choked with junk. Those attacks &#x2014; which struck as Estonia removed a Soviet monument from Tallinn &#x2014; were one of the first times Russian actors had weaponized cyberspace for geopolitical aims. A distributed-denial-of-service attack like the 2007 hit on Estonia is almost quaint today. In subsequent years, Russia&#x2019;s cyber arsenal has &quot;grown so vicious,&#x201D; Luht said. &quot;And the problem, of course, is that the best cyber attacks still remain invisible,&quot; Luht told the Kyiv Independent. Like Foreman, he sees no reason to think Russia will stop. &quot;Ukraine is the primary focus of Russia right now, but that doesn&apos;t mean that they don&apos;t have others in their focus,&quot; Luht said. &quot;The (cyber) attacks which are carried out against Ukraine today might be already happening or might happen tomorrow against others.&quot; Trump&apos;s warming relations with Russia threaten NATO&#x2019;s fundamental protections, said Dr. Jan Kallberg, a research scientist and associate professor at West Point. &quot;I believe the Russians, energized by the internal belief that Trump will save them, will start testing Article 5 in a systematic manner to trigger a slippery slope undermining NATO,&quot; Kallberg told the Kyiv Independent. Kallberg added this could take many forms but used the hypothetical example of false Kremlin claims of Norwegian border guards crossing the border into Russia. In this example, Russian forces could open fire on actual Norwegian guards manning the border, prompting Norway to invoke Article 5. Kallberg said it&apos;s unlikely that NATO would declare war on Russia over such an incident, so faith in NATO as a reliable defensive mechanism would be thrown into question. &quot;Five to ten of these provocations and Article 5 is undermined. Then Russia has succeeded,&quot; he said. Trump&#x2019;s current courting of Putin for a peace deal neglects that Russian agents have obliquely attacked the U.S. and NATO with relative impunity for almost 20 years. Russia has shown little respect for NATO and its Article 5, nor for the borders, security, or interests of any country that is not Russia. Below is an incomplete timeline of Putin-era hybrid attacks on NATO nations. The total number of such attacks will never be known &#x2014; Western computer systems silently fall victim to Russian cyber gangs every day. A Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) agent who investigated organized crime, Litvinenko fled Russia for the U.K. after growing critical of Putin. He was later poisoned by FSB agents in London with polonium-210, leading to a slow and painful death and Putin&#x2019;s first major hybrid incursion into the West. Alexander Litvinenko is pictured in the Intensive Care Unit of University College Hospital in London, U.K., on Nov. 20, 2006, in this image made available on Nov. 25, 2006. The 43-year-old former KGB spy, who died on Nov. 23, 2006, accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of poisoning him. Litvinenko died after radioactive polonium-210 was found in his body. Russia&apos;s foreign intelligence service denied any involvement in the case. (Natasja Weitsz / Getty Images)2007: Estonia cyber attackThree years after joining NATO, Estonia relocated a Soviet statue from the center of Tallinn. A massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack roiled the country&#x2019;s digital infrastructure for almost a month, an attack that was subsequently connected to pro-Kremlin but formally independent cyber gangs. The Russian Air Force ran training missions over the Baltic Sea, 35 kilometers from the Swedish border, including a simulated attack on military targets in and around Stockholm.

(Louai Beshara / AFP via Getty Images)2016-2020: Arms to Taliban; bounty on U.S. soldiers in AfghanistanReports from U.S. intelligence in 2020 revealed evidence of a Russian campaign to pay the Taliban for killing U.S. soldiers. While the CIA at the time said it had &#x201C;low to moderate confidence&#x201D; in that intel, 2025 investigations from Germany&#x2019;s Der Spiegel and Russian dissident outlet the Insider identified individuals involved in a scheme to pay $200,000 per dead soldier. Russian agent Maria Butina used affairs with well-connected conservatives like political operative Paul Erickson and Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne to infiltrate Republican groups like the National Rifle Association. After pleading guilty to acting as an unregistered agent, she served a year and a half in jail. Today, Butina is a member of Russia&#x2019;s parliament. As part of a broader cyber campaign against the West, Russian government actors hacked the Democratic National Convention&#x2019;s servers as well as then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s campaign staff, releasing tens of thousands of emails through WikiLeaks. The hack followed a public statement from then-candidate Donald Trump calling on anyone who could to get a hold of Clinton&#x2019;s emails, which would lead Trump to spend subsequent years denying collusion with Moscow. Montenegro&#x2019;s NATO accession was rife with Russian threats of &quot;active measures&quot; to stop the longtime Balkan ally from joining the block. In 2016, Montenegrin authorities accused 13 Montenegrins, Serbians, and Russians of planning an armed coup, though those charges were dropped in 2024. During the Battle of Khasham, around 500 pro-Assad forces, including Wagner mercenaries, attacked 40 U.S. Special Forces who had turned a derelict oil refinery into an outpost while fighting ISIS. U.S. airstrikes killed 200-300 members of the Syrian coalition, while taking no casualties.

DarkSide, a ransomware gang believed to be based in Russia, hit the networks behind an oil pipeline that paralyzed energy supplies along the U.S. East Coast. An arms channel between Russia and Iran has for years provided Russian weapons to Iran-backed militant groups ranging from Hezbollah in Lebanon to the Houthis in Yemen, which have at various points targeted U.S bases and embassies as well as Western shipping in the Gulf of Aden. Rockets like Russia&#x2019;s Grad have been particular favorites. Iran, in turn, provides Russia with weapons that it uses to attack Ukraine.

The Russian government reportedly planned to assassinate Armin Paperger, CEO of Rheinmetall, one of the largest weapons makers in Europe, over the firm&#x2019;s supply of weapons to Ukraine.

Ukraine working on alternatives to US intelligence, defense minister says	Ukraine has not yet received detailed information on U.S. intelligence-sharing restrictions but is already exploring alternatives, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on March 6, Interfax-Ukraine reported. &quot;We are already working on alternatives, including requesting (assistance) from Germany if necessary,&quot; Umerov said at a press conference in Berlin, following talks with German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. Washington cut off intelligence-sharing with Kyiv on March 5, following its decision to freeze all military aid to Ukraine as part of an effort to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine on U.S. terms. The intelligence cutoff threatens Ukraine&apos;s ability to track Russian military movements and detect aerial strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Reports suggest the U.S. may have also prohibited allies like the U.K. from passing on intelligence obtained through American sources. U.S. officials have indicated the pause could be temporary and contingent on progress toward peace talks. France has continued to provide military intelligence to Ukraine, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on March 6, according to BFM TV. European leaders are expected to discuss additional support for Ukraine and increased defense spending at an EU summit in Brussels on March 6. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Brussels for the emergency meeting, which was convened to address Europe&apos;s security strategy amid growing concerns over Washington&apos;s shifting foreign policy.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-working-on-alternatives-to-us-intelligence-defense-minister-says/	2025-03-06T09:14:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1648100666-1.jpg
China's envoy calls Trump's treatment of Europe 'appalling'	China&apos;s special envoy for European affairs, Lu Shaye, criticized U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s treatment of European allies, calling it &quot;appalling,&quot; the South China Morning Post reported on March 6. &quot;When you look at how the Trump administration has implemented a brazen and domineering policy toward Europe, treating its allies in this way, honestly, from a European perspective, it&apos;s quite appalling,&quot; Shaye said. The Chinese diplomat also stressed that the Ukraine peace deal should not be dictated solely by the U.S. and Russia, adding that &quot;various proposed solutions should be subject to equal discussion, rather than being dictated by a select few.&quot; Shaye&apos;s comments follow U.S.-Russia talks held in Istanbul on Feb. 27 and an earlier round in Riyadh on Feb. 18, as Washington seeks a swift settlement to the war. The negotiations, which excluded Kyiv and Europe, have raised concerns that the U.S. is sidelining key allies. Trump&apos;s shift in U.S. foreign policy has drawn scrutiny, as he has echoed Kremlin narratives and accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of prolonging the war. Trump has aligned his policy with the Kremlin&apos;s agenda and has so far refused to offer any security guarantees to Ukraine. Washington has also frozen all military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv in an effort to pressure Zelensky into negotiations with Moscow. Beijing has remained a key ally of Moscow throughout the invasion, deepening economic ties and becoming Russia&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods &#x2014; equipment the military uses in its war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinas-envoy-says-trumps-treatment-of-europe-appalling/	2025-03-06T08:39:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2159810856.jpg
The Czech weapons giant replacing the Kalashnikov in Ukraineâ€™s army	The Russian-made Kalashnikov still prevails as the main small arm in Ukraine&#x2019;s military. A Czech weapons giant is setting up shop in Ukraine&#x2019;s factories to change that. The Prague-domiciled conglomerate, Colt CZ, has set up assembly of its Bren 2 assault rifles inside Ukraine under the name &#x201C;Sich&#x201D; &#x2014; the center of life for Zaporizhzhian Cossacks, a historical group of Ukrainian semi-nomadic warriors. The goal, as Colt CZ&#x2019;s head of public sector, Ondrej Bohac, put it, is to &#x201C;get rid of Ukrainian dependence on Soviet weapons, like the AK-47, and not only on the weapons themselves but also on the ammunition, which is still produced mainly in Russia and Belarus.&#x201D; Ukraine does not seem close to running through its old stockpiles of ammunition, but as with the conversion from Soviet 122 and 152 mm artillery to NATO-standard 120 and 155 mm, the transition is a long-term Western turn. The Sich offers swappable components for alternating between Soviet and NATO calibers. Tens of thousands of the assault rifles are already in the hands of Ukrainian soldiers, mostly from Czechia, but they have begun assembly inside of Ukraine. Many international arms giants have announced plans to build their wares inside of Ukraine, ranging from Rheinmetall to Northrop Grumman to Bayraktar. Colt CZ is one of the first to set up production, putting the firm in a relative frontier position. Its experience will be a bellwether for NATO-based weapons manufacturers expanding to Ukraine. Colt CZ began its life as Jihoceska Zbrojovka, or the South Czech Armory, shortly after the First World War and the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Renamed to Ceska Zbrojovka, or Czech Armory, it would go on to survive Nazi occupation and Soviet domination and ultimately an invasion by Warsaw Pact soldiers in 1968. In large part thanks to Ceska Zbrojovka, Czechoslovakia would retain an unusually independent military until the fall of the USSR. Recent years have seen the company expand internationally, most conspicuously in buying the Connecticut-originated Colt brand, the unofficial armory of the American Wild West whose name now sits alongside &#x201C;CZ&#x201D; in the company&#x2019;s title. Today, Colt CZ can assemble 400 of their Bren 2 Siches per day in Ukrainian factories, according to Bohac. Ukraine&#x2019;s state-owned defense conglomerate, UkrOboronProm, announced the start of production in December. Colt CZ product manufacturing. (Colt CZ)The assembly lines are owned and staffed by UkrOboronProm, which, for the time being, is getting components shipped from Colt CZ&#x2019;s original factories. Colt CZ is, in turn, training the Ukrainian staff and leasing out their assembly method. It&#x2019;s an arrangement that is becoming standard for international arms makers looking to set up inside of Ukraine. Many have made announcements of doing so over the past three years, but projects by firms like Rheinmetall or Northrop Grumman, primarily to produce 155 mm artillery ammunition, have stalled out. Colt CZ is among the biggest to have started production, at least partially because the guns are themselves small arms rather than, say, ballistic missiles. The speed of set-up is also thanks to the geographical and political proximity of Ukraine and Czechia&#x2019;s own experience under the Soviet heel. &#x201C;It shows our commitment to support the industry and actually do things and not only talk about them,&#x201D; said Bohac. It has been a complicated road to &#x201C;the integration of our defense-industrial complex with the industrial chain of NATO nations,&#x201D; UkrOboronProm&#x2019;s general director, Oleh Hulyak, said in December. Ukrainians fear giving over their home turf to foreign business. Foreign companies are wary of Ukrainian law, particularly historically lax local intellectual property, or IP, protections. In their absence, foreign brands are loath to leave their inventions in Ukraine, where they risk being stolen and counterfeited, in some cases by UkrOboronProm itself. Ukrainian courts are famously unreliable, and their sentences for IP violations often stop at trivial fines. When asked whether Colt CZ would ever end up fighting for its IP rights in a Ukrainian courtroom, Bohac responded, &#x201C;Hopefully not &#x2014; like any other global company, we always prefer that it&apos;s resolved in a third-country courtroom.&#x201D; The Ukrainian production is starting with just assembly of components manufactured in Colt CZ&#x2019;s factories in Czechia, protecting the process while the assembly line for Bren 2 Sich rifles expands. UkrOboronProm gets a stake in the sale, and the Ukrainian government gets to buy from the home team. &#x201C;It has opened the door to the Ukrainian market because every country prefers to procure from domestic producers,&#x201D; said Bohac. Colt CZ product manufacturing. (Colt CZ)It has been a process of diplomacy for Bohac, himself a former Czech diplomat. The Colt CZ deal is not the first time the Ukrainian military has tried to move its main rifles on to NATO calibers. In 2017, a much-touted rollout of a copy of the American M4 called the WAC-47, which UkrOboronProm announced would have replaceable parts to take both NATO and Kalashnikov-standard ammunition, came to nothing. Bohac declined to identify exactly how many Siches had been produced locally, citing UkrOboronProm&#x2019;s rules, but said that something in the &#x201C;upper tens of thousands&#x201D; are already in Ukrainian hands and &#x201C;tens of thousands should be assembled (in Ukraine) this year.&#x201D; Colt CZ also envisions more component manufacturing in Ukraine and expansion into other weapons, including their P10 pistols and CZ Scorpion Evo 3. Among Colt CZ&#x2019;s latest acquisitions is Sellier &amp; Bellot, another Czech company that&#x2019;s made ammunition for almost 200 years. Sellier &amp; Bellot makes its own machining tools, which are essential to more localized component manufacturing within Ukraine. The plan, said Bohac, is to expand from assembly to component production using those machines. &#x201C;We will provide the IP, the machinery, training, and they will take care of all those components and materials, including the powder,&#x201D; he said. The company also has its eyes on greater global output. Post-war, Colt CZ is envisioning selling from Ukraine to other former Soviet states looking to replace their old rifles. But with the war still raging and export controls still fully up, the immediate market will be strictly Ukrainian. &#x201C;I mean, it&apos;s a beautiful story that we are making here. It&apos;s historical. We hope it will be remembered after decades that Czechia, with international donors through our company, was one of the key forces behind the rearmament of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,&#x201D; said Bohac.

Families of Ukrainian POWs rally outside US Embassy, demand 'all-for-all' exchange before peace deal	Relatives of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) and missing persons held a peaceful rally outside of the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv on March 6, urging Washington to help secure the release of all Ukrainian soldiers and civilians held in Russian captivity. The protest comes as U.S. President Donald Trump pushes for a swift peace deal with Russia that foresees concessions from Kyiv, but not the aggressor state that invaded Ukraine in 2014 and escalated the war in 2022, killing tens of thousands of civilians. Protesters demanded an &quot;all-for-all&quot; prisoner exchange before any peace deal with Russia is signed, Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne reported. Russia and Ukraine have conducted multiple swaps throughout the full-scale war, most recently on Feb. 5, when Ukraine secured the return of 150 POWs. Kyiv has pushed for an all-for-all prisoner exchange since 2024, but Moscow has refused the proposal. Ukraine does not disclose the exact number of its soldiers held in Russian captivity. According to Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets, Moscow holds over 16,000 Ukrainian civilians. Additionally, Russia has forcibly deported more than 19,500 Ukrainian children to Russia, Belarus, or occupied territories.

According to Euronews, the demostrators in Washington protested against Trump&apos;s recent statements on Ukraine and his decision to suspend military aid to Kyiv. The protests come amid escalating tensions between Washington and Kyiv following the contentious Feb. 28 Oval Office meeting between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The talks, originally intended to finalize a U.S.-Ukraine mineral deal, ended in a public dispute, leading to the cancellation of the agreement. Since then, &#xA0;Trump has cut U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv, while some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have intensified criticism of Zelensky, with some suggesting he should resign.	https://kyivindependent.com/families-of-ukrainian-pows-rally-outside-us-embassy-demand-all-for-all-exchange-before-peace-deal/	2025-03-06T07:36:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202969930.jpg
Ukraine's central bank raises key policy rate to 15.5%, warns about foreign policy risks	Ukraine&apos;s National Bank (NBU) will raise the key policy rate from 14.5% to 15.5% per annum starting from March 7, chairman Andrii Pyshnyi said on March 6. The move marks the second raise of the key policy rate since the beginning of 2025. In late January, the central bank raised it from 13.5% to 14.5%. The Ukrainian economy was heavily hit by Russia&apos;s full-scale war. At the start of the invasion, inflation skyrocketed to 26.6% in 2022 from 10.0% in 2021. It subsided the following year, but in 2024, inflation again accelerated to 12%, exceeding NBU&apos;s forecast. According to Pyshnyi, the decision aims to maintain the &quot;attractiveness of savings&quot; in the hryvnia currency, the stability of the foreign exchange market, and keeping expectations under control, which will bring inflation to the 5% target. &quot;The NBU will be ready to take additional measures in case of further risks to price dynamics and inflation expectations,&quot; Pyshnyi said. The NBU raised its key policy rate to 10% in January 2022. It had remained unchanged since the beginning of the all-out war, but on June 3, 2022, the rate grew from 10% to 25%. For over a year, it remained at the same level, dropping to 22% in July 2023 and following a gradual decline. In December 2024, the NBU raised the key policy rate from 13% to 13.5% in response to inflationary developments. The central bank said that the risks &quot;of less favorable foreign economic trends&quot; have increased due to &quot;further geopolitical polarization of countries&quot; and &quot;the corresponding fragmentation of global trade.&quot; The comments come amid seismic geopolitical shifts as the U.S. under President Donald Trump has adopted an increasingly hostile stance toward Ukraine, threatened to impose tariffs against other partners, and floated the idea of deepening an economic partnership with Russia. Although the risks to the sufficiency of international financing remain &quot;balanced,&quot; the amount of external support confirmed for 2025 should be &quot;sufficient&quot; to finance the budget deficit without issuing new debt and &quot;to maintain an adequate level of international reserves,&quot; the statement read. &quot;This will allow the NBU to continue to ensure a stable situation in the foreign exchange market and controllability of inflation and exchange rate expectations,&quot; the central bank said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-central-bank-raises-key-policy-rate-warns-about/	2025-03-06T06:00:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2158010341.jpg
European air forces could protect Ukraine from Russian aerial strikes, experts suggest	Military experts proposed to deploy European air forces to protect Kyiv and other non-front-line Ukrainian cities from Russian aerial attacks, the Guardian reported on March 6, citing the so-called Sky Shield plan. The plan could potentially work as part of the &quot;truce in the sky&quot; proposed by President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier this week, preventing missiles, long-range drones, and bombs from targeting civilian infrastructure. The project&apos;s supporters said it could be a European-led air defense zone involving 120 fighter jets that will operate separately from NATO. According to the plan, developed by former British Air Force planners in cooperation with Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, the protection zone would cover Ukraine&apos;s three operational nuclear power plants, as well as the cities of Odesa and Lviv in Ukraine&apos;s south and west. The country&apos;s east, where the fierce battles are ongoing in Donetsk Oblast, were not included in the zone. According to the authors, this step can be more tangible than the deployment of ground troops as peacekeepers. In February, the Washington Post reported that up to 30,000 European troops could be deployed in the country after a potential ceasefire. Among those who supported the Sky Shield plan are Philip Breedlove, former NATO supreme commander in Europe, Polish ex-President Aleksander Kwasniewski, and Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania&apos;s former foreign minister. European defense ministries have considered the plan, but their leaders have been reluctant to authorize patrolling Ukrainian skies while Russia&apos;s full-scale war is ongoing, the Guardian wrote. In light of the U.S. policy shift and suspension of military aid to Ukraine, the initiative can be revisited, the news outlet noted. Yet, Western partners still fear an escalation if an aircraft from either side is attacked or shot down. Russian forces regularly launch drones and missiles against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, inflicting heavy civilian casualties. A Russian missile strike against a hotel in Kryvyi Rih late on March 5, carried out shortly after the U.S. paused vital intelligence sharing, killed four people and injured over 30. According to figures released by Kyiv, U.N. statistics, and open-source data published by BBC Russia, the total death toll of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers, as well as Ukrainian civilians, stood at over 148,000 as of mid-February.	https://kyivindependent.com/sky-shield-plan/	2025-03-06T05:43:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2169510520.jpg
Poland, Lithuania signal openness to French nuclear deterrence for Europe	Polish and Lithuanian leaders spoke in positive terms on March 6 about French President Emmanuel Macron&apos;s suggestion that Paris could extend its nuclear umbrella to protect European allies. Macron proposed to start &quot;strategic discussions&quot; on the subject as he warned Europe against the Russian threat and stressed that European countries should no longer rely on the U.S. for their security. France is the only EU country with nuclear weapons. &quot;This readiness of France, this is something very promising,&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk told reporters in Brussels on the sidelines of an EU summit. &quot;We have to treat this proposal seriously.&quot; Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda called it a &quot;very interesting idea,&quot; adding that a nuclear umbrella would serve as an effective deterrence against potential Russian aggression. Both Poland and Lithuania lie at NATO&apos;s eastern flank and share a border with Moscow&apos;s ally Belarus and the heavily armed exclave of Kaliningrad, putting them on the front line of a potential NATO-Russia clash. The idea of nuclear sharing with France was also previously floated by Friedrich Merz, who is likely to be Germany&apos;s next chancellor after victory in the February elections. The discussion comes amid mounting uncertainty of the U.S.&apos;s commitment to European security under President Donald Trump. The Trump administration has frozen military aid for Ukraine and signaled that its geopolitical focus will no longer be on the European continent. Washington also seeks to renew its relationship with Moscow, supposedly in an effort to drive it away from China. European leaders are gathering in Brussels to discuss the EU&apos;s need to boost defense spending and support for Ukraine. This involves the European Commission&apos;s ReArm Europe plan that could mobilize up to 800 billion euros ($860 billion) to arm Europe and Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-lithuania-open-to-potential-french-nuclear-deterrence-for-europe/	2025-03-06T05:25:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202961314.jpg
Trump admin to revoke legal status of 240,000 Ukrainian refugees, Reuters reports	The Trump administration is preparing to revoke the temporary legal status of 240,000 Ukrainians who fled to the U.S. from Russia&apos;s invasion, potentially paving the way for their deportation, Reuters reported on March 6, citing four undisclosed sources. The plan predates U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s public spat with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28 and is part of broader efforts to revoke the legal status of more than 1.8 million people staying in the U.S. on humanitarian grounds, the news agency noted. The move, which is expected as soon as April, would nevertheless threaten to further widen the rift between Kyiv and Washington after the U.S. paused military assistance and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. U.S. and Ukrainian officials have not confirmed the claims. Around 5.2 million Ukrainian refugees remain abroad, with the vast majority of them receiving protection in EU countries. Migrants stripped of the humanitarian parole, granted as part of the Biden administration&apos;s programs, could be fast-tracked for deportations, Reuters reported, citing an internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) document. Immigration has been one of the key topics of Trump&apos;s electoral campaign as he pledged to bolster border security and tighten immigration rules. His first days in office were followed by announcements of large-scale deportations of undocumented migrants, though data suggests the rate is comparable to Biden&apos;s years. The Trump administration began rolling back the protection of Ukrainian and other refugees mere days after taking office. The Uniting for Ukraine program, which allowed Ukrainians to stay in the U.S. for up to two years, work, and receive health insurance, was suspended by late January.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-admin-to-revoke-legal-status-of-240-000-ukrainian-refugees-reuters-reports/	2025-03-06T04:41:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1246719706.jpg
US set to abandon partners again as history repeats in Ukraine	Paris in January 1973. Doha in February 2000. Saudi Arabia in February 2025 &#x2014; all peacemaking summits with the same aroma and feel. But there are key differences before we assume the stage is simply being set for another American episode of &quot;cut and run.&quot; After years of promising never to abandon its close ally, Washington did just that with South Vietnam in Paris and the government of Afghanistan in Doha. In both wars, the U.S. had spent years of blood and treasure propping up its ally. In both &quot;peace&quot; processes &#x2014; because a just peace was not the outcome &#x2014; the ally was not even present as Washington negotiated the terms and set the pace of its exit, despite its prior investment. The war in Vietnam cost America 58,000 lives and an estimated $1 trillion in today&#x2019;s money. Afghanistan cost $2 trillion over 20 years, or $300 million per day, and resulted in 3,468 coalition military and 3,917 contractor deaths. This pales in comparison to the extent of local casualties: 600,000 excess deaths in Iraq, 170,000 in Afghanistan, and 3.4 million during America&#x2019;s phase of the war in Vietnam &#x2014; if nothing else, an indicator of commitment on both sides. So far, the war in Ukraine has cost, by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s recent admission, 43,000 military deaths and 198,000 wounded. Russian casualties are estimated at over 800,000, with perhaps a quarter of that number killed. International assistance to Ukraine has topped 267 billion euros, or 90 billion euros annually &#x2014; without counting the hundreds of billions in physical destruction and expected reconstruction costs. In Paris and Doha, the American administration agreed to terms and a timetable to leave the country. There were side assurances to their allies &#x2014; a nudge and a wink to stay the course. Biden made a similar pledge to Ukraine. &quot;You remind us that freedom is priceless; it&#x2019;s worth fighting for as long as it takes. And that&#x2019;s how long we&#x2019;re going to be with you, Mr. President: for as long as it takes,&quot; he told Zelensky in Kyiv on the first anniversary of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in February 2023. In a Truth Social post on Feb. 19, President Donald Trump said: &quot;A modestly successful comedian &#x2026; A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left. In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only &apos;TRUMP&apos; and the Trump Administration can do. Biden never tried, Europe has failed to bring Peace, and Zelenskyy probably wants to keep the &apos;gravy train&apos; going. I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died&#x2026;&quot; Some of Sheehan&#x2019;s &quot;bright, shining lies,&quot; employed by four American administrations from Dwight Eisenhower to Richard Nixon &#x2014; including Nixon&#x2019;s &quot;secret&quot; bombing of Cambodia, which was, of course, no secret if you were Cambodian or Vietnamese &#x2014; would be harder to sustain today, given the relative transparency of modern media. But such lies may now be bolstered by &quot;fake news&quot; narratives. As the Afghanistan Papers, published in 2019, showed, the tendency of U.S. presidential administrations to mislead the American people, and of military officers to go along with failing strategies due to a misplaced &quot;can-do&quot; attitude, seems to be an enduring feature. What also has not changed is the marginalization of the real victims of war &#x2014; both foreign and American &#x2014; and the way leaders default to ducking responsibility. Trump may just be crudely (as is his wont) trying to publicly bully Zelensky into compliance. But this is likely to be a difficult journey, and Trump does not have all the keys. Several traps lie ahead. French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky prepare for a plenary meeting at Lancaster House in London, U.K., on March 2, 2025. (Justin Tallis / Pool / AFP / Getty Images)The first is in his mistake of sidelining Europe, particularly Turkey. Ukraine&#x2019;s geographic position and size as the second-largest country on the European mainland (after Russia) put it at the heart of European security. Unlike Vietnam or Afghanistan &#x2014; where support relied on a flaky domino theory &#x2014; Ukraine&apos;s fate has direct implications for the continent. A second mistake is to overstate American power. While the U.S. military remains the steel backbone of NATO, this is not the Western alliance at Munich in 1938, another ominous parallel that has been replayed. Contrary to his arithmetic, European aid to Ukraine now outstrips that of the United States. Moreover, these figures need to be disaggregated to provide perspective beyond social media hyperbole: Around half of donor support goes to military assistance (much of which is spent by the donors themselves), 44% to financial support, and 7% to humanitarian aid. Relative to the likely costs of Ukrainian collapse, the investment is small &#x2014; so far, too small to stop Russia. Germany, the U.K., and the U.S. have mobilized less than 0.2% of their GDP per year to support Ukraine, while countries like France, Italy, and Spain allocated just 0.1%, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy&#x2019;s Ukraine Support Tracker. &quot;Even small domestic policy priorities are many times more expensive than what is being done for Ukraine,&quot; notes Kiel. Germany&#x2019;s tax subsidies for diesel fuel cost taxpayers three times more per year than Germany&#x2019;s military aid for Ukraine. Other calculations have Ukraine itself already covering 55% of the war&apos;s costs, with Europe and other non-U.S. sources contributing 25%, and Washington 20%. If the U.S. pulls back, that 20% will need to be shared among other players&#x2014;and at least doubled. The potential disconnection of Starlink is more problematic, but at least financially, Europe could compensate. The most notable difference between Ukraine and Afghanistan or South Vietnam is the will to fight. America is not fighting in Ukraine as it did in Afghanistan and Vietnam &#x2014; it is enabling defense. There is no doubting the Ukrainian will to fight. This was epitomized early on by Zelensky&#x2019;s now-famous reply &#x2014; starkly contrasting with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani&#x2019;s weakness in Kabul &#x2014; to an offer of evacuation: &quot;I need ammunition, not a ride.&quot; The lesson of Afghanistan&#x2014;for Afghans and the other allies and coalition partners of the United States&#x2014;was the same as for the South Vietnamese in 1975: Don&#x2019;t trust Washington. America is too big and too self-centered, and as a result, it excludes its allies from its innermost strategic discussions. The fact that allies were never privy to the side deals struck by U.S. negotiator Zalmay Khalilzad with the Taliban is a case in point, just as the South Vietnamese were cut out of Henry Kissinger&#x2019;s deal-making with Hanoi. The vagaries of Western support and the population&#x2019;s tendency toward self-regard pose a significant handicap in foreign policy, especially in terms of stamina. The more unreliable Western support becomes, the greater the political pressures within Ukraine. While this may have a galvanizing effect on the military and peace process, it threatens to fracture Ukraine&apos;s domestic political unity &#x2014; the opposite of what Western supporters desire. Western support for Ukraine is not about charity. It&#x2019;s about upholding international law, protecting democracy, and preventing Russian President Vladimir Putin from resurrecting the Soviet system of brutal imperial rule. Trump&#x2019;s exaggerated language about Ukraine will not be without consequences. It will cost the free world&#x2019;s respect. This is precisely the opposite of the goal the president seeks. It will undermine the perception of American reliability and the principles of mutual benefit. As Singapore&#x2019;s defense minister Ng Eng Hen put it at the recent Munich Security Conference, America&#x2019;s &#x201C;image&#x201D; abroad had &#x201C;changed from liberator to great disruptor to a landlord seeking rent.&#x201D; It undermines long-held principles of international relations, such as sovereignty, from which a slew of other conflicts &#x2014; particularly in Africa with its arbitrary and weak borders &#x2014; could well arise. It could also catalyze a new arms race, especially for nuclear weapons, as nonproliferation, another post-1945 tenet, is now under threat. This process can only accelerate if Trump&#x2019;s actions lead to the collapse of the transatlantic relationship, as represented in NATO, which would suit Putin perfectly. It would also contradict efforts to strengthen international systems that hold governments accountable for war crimes by effectively shutting down legal proceedings against Russian forces. Washington&#x2019;s early moves &#x2014; including its refusal to use the term &#x201C;war of aggression&#x201D; in the G7 statement &#x2014; suggest it is intent on closing down the war crimes issue. While Trump likes to believe that he alone can make a deal, Washington may discover that, based on current trends, Putin is as determined to take over Ukraine as the Taliban were in Afghanistan or Hanoi was with South Vietnam. As such, the West might end up, if Ukraine were to implode, with the worst of all worlds: an alienated and emboldened Russia, and a seething, anti-Western Ukraine forced back within a neo-Soviet fold. The war would likely enter a new, unconventional phase. Ukrainians have learned bitter lessons about entrusting their security to Moscow. Whatever Trump may wish to believe in his quest for a deal, the Western way of life &#x2014; democracy, liberal policy, and the freedom of personal choice &#x2014; would be imperiled if Ukraine falls. If that were to happen as a consequence of his actions (or inaction), Trump would have placed himself firmly on the wrong side of history.

US is destroying world order, Ukraine's ex-commander-in-chief says	The U.S. is destroying the world order as Washington is making overtures to the Kremlin, said on March 6 Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K. Speaking at the Chatham House, Zaluzhnyi said that President Donald Trump&apos;s administration has questioned the unity of &quot;the whole Western world.&quot; &quot;Now Washington is trying to delegate the security issues to Europe without participation of the U.S. so we can say that in the near future, NATO likewise can stop existing,&quot; the ambassador said. According to Zaluzhnyi, Europe can be Russia&apos;s next target. He said that fears of Western partners made it possible for Moscow to start forming &quot;an axis.&quot; &#xA0; The two key Russian allies, Iran and North Korea, supply Russia with weapons that are used against Ukraine. Pyongyang has also sent over 10,000 troops to fight alongside Russian forces in the embattled Kursk Oblast. &quot;We see that it&apos;s not just the axis of evil and Russia trying to revise the world order, but the U.S. is finally destroying this order,&quot; Zaluzhnyi said. &quot;And when those countries of the axis conclude a strategic agreement between themselves, we should have thought maybe this is an attempt to revise the existing world order.&quot; The remarks come amid rising tensions between Kyiv and Washington following a clash in the Oval Office exchange on Feb. 28 between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Trump. The dispute led to the collapse of a bilateral deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, after which the U.S. president paused all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. The move to suspend aid to Ukraine came on top of other Kremlin-friendly steps recently taken by the U.S. The Trump administration has also been considering lifting sanctions imposed against Russia for its brutal all-out war against Ukraine that killed hundreds of thousands.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-destroying-worl-order-zaluzhnyi-says/	2025-03-06T03:47:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2201152416.jpg
Zelenskyâ€™s Oval Office berating sends a stark warning to the Middle East	In a dramatic confrontation that has reverberated far beyond Washington, the explosive Oval Office exchange on Feb. 28 between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky represents a broader U.S. foreign policy &#x2014; one that many in the Middle East have long viewed with deep skepticism. The confrontation, which was intended to cement a framework minerals deal linking Ukraine&#x2019;s resource wealth to continued U.S. aid, instead degenerated into a public spectacle marked by Trump&#x2019;s patronizing demands and verbal ultimatums. As the U.S. pressed Ukraine to show gratitude and compromise on its security priorities, critics in the Middle East saw confirmation of America&#x2019;s global arrogance, as Washington sacrificed the interests and dignity of smaller states for its own national benefit. For decades, states like Iran and its regional allies have maintained that American grandstanding comes at the expense of genuine partnership. Afghanistan under Ashraf Ghani, Iraq under Saddam Hussein, Libya under Gaddafi, Egypt under General Morsi, and even Iran under Rouhani have negotiated with the U.S. only for Washington to demonstrate its fickleness. Instead of forging a balanced approach to address Ukraine&#x2019;s security needs amid ongoing Russian aggression, the Trump administration&#x2019;s focus on securing economic concessions &#x2014; specifically, a deal that would have transferred 50% of Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resource revenues to an American-controlled fund &#x2014; exposed an approach that treats allies as bargaining chips. This echoes the capitulations British and French empires once imposed on the Ottoman and Persian empires to extract oil and other raw materials. Of course, this was not the first of Trump&#x2019;s coercive and abrasive policies in his second administration. King Abdullah of Jordan was also treated in a non-diplomatic manner during negotiations over hosting people from Gaza. Middle Eastern leaders, including those who rely on strong international partnerships to navigate complex regional security challenges, can draw a sobering lesson from this: that negotiating with a hegemon often means accepting a subordinate role, where loyalty and gratitude are demanded in exchange for minimal security guarantees. During Trump&#x2019;s first term, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe once attempted to deliver a message from Trump to Iran &#x2014; a gesture that the Iranian Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, unequivocally rejected, declaring that a U.S. leader of Trump&#x2019;s ilk did not deserve any form of communication with Iran. At that time, Khamenei&#x2019;s refusal was widely criticized within certain segments of the Iranian government and society, with detractors arguing that his anti-American ideology was an impediment to resolving longstanding issues with the United States. However, in light of Trump&#x2019;s recent humiliating exchanges with Ukraine and Jordan, those very critics have dramatically reversed their stance. Today, many voices in Iran and its regional circles are lauding Khamenei for his steadfast rejection of American overtures, viewing his decision as a robust defense against what they perceive as America&#x2019;s &#x201C;global arrogance.&#x201D; They contend that making further concessions to the U.S. would only serve to exacerbate Iran&#x2019;s vulnerability, reinforcing the belief that genuine problem-solving in international relations must prioritize sovereign dignity over transactional appeasement. This incident also underscores the inherent risks in alliances where power dynamics are unbalanced. In the heated Oval Office, Vice President JD Vance&#x2019;s curt remark &#x2014; &#x201C;Have you said &apos;thank you&apos; once?&#x201D; &#x2014; was not simply an offhand criticism; it symbolized a broader expectation that smaller partners must publicly affirm their indebtedness to the U.S. regardless of their own strategic imperatives. For Middle Eastern states, especially Israel &#x2014; a nation that has long balanced a unique security partnership with Washington &#x2014; this scenario offers a cautionary tale. When a powerful ally imposes its own agenda and demands visible signs of subservience, the smaller partner&#x2019;s strategic autonomy is inevitably compromised. The berating treatment suffered by Zelensky, broadcast live on global media, serves as a warning that in dealings with a country that prioritizes its own interests above all, even a stalwart leader may find himself forced into a position that undermines both national pride and strategic bargaining power. Moreover, the fallout from the meeting has already begun to reshape international diplomatic calculations. European allies, alarmed by Washington&#x2019;s apparent willingness to engage in a high-stakes power play at the expense of a key ally, have expressed concerns that such behavior could destabilize collective security frameworks. Many rockets fired from Iran are seen over Jerusalem from Hebron, West Bank, on Oct. 1, 2024. (Wisam Hashlamoun/Anadolu via Getty Images)For Israel and other Middle Eastern nations, the situation presents an opportunity to reevaluate the dynamics of their own alliances with global powers. It reinforces the need for diversification in diplomatic engagements and a cautious approach toward any bilateral arrangement that might leave them vulnerable to coercive tactics. Instead of relying solely on U.S. backing, regional states might explore strengthening multilateral institutions or forging independent strategic partnerships that allow for more equitable negotiations &#x2014; an approach that has long been advocated by critics of American foreign policy in the region. Finally, this episode raises broader questions about the nature of modern geopolitics and the balance between national interest and alliance solidarity. The public debacle in the Oval Office is not merely a clash of personalities; it is a reflection of an enduring principle in international relations that many in the Middle East have always warned about: powerful nations often view alliances through the prism of transactional benefit rather than mutual respect. For Israel, which has historically benefited from American support yet sometimes chafed under its conditions, the events of Feb. 28 serve as a critical reminder to safeguard its own strategic autonomy. In an era marked by shifting global power balances, regional states must remain vigilant and assertive in defining the terms of their cooperation. The humiliation of a leader like Zelensky should not be taken as a precedent to follow, but rather as an impetus to demand a more balanced, reciprocal form of engagement &#x2014; one that recognizes the intrinsic worth and sovereignty of all partners, regardless of size. Ultimately, this catastrophe exposes a critical flaw in U.S. diplomatic rhetoric that Middle Eastern states, including Israel, must heed. If Washington continues to employ aggressive, self-serving language that reduces alliances to transactional power plays, it risks alienating vital partners in the region &#x2014; partners like Saudi Arabia, Israel, and even Iran, which are increasingly gravitating toward China for a more balanced approach. Such rhetoric not only humiliates key leaders like Zelensky, but also reinforces a dangerous narrative that only military might can prevent the humiliation and destruction of Middle Eastern nations. This perception, in turn, fuels an already volatile arms race and may even accelerate nuclear proliferation in countries like Iran. As a policy imperative, the U.S. must recalibrate its diplomatic tone and adopt a more inclusive, respectful strategy that prioritizes mutual benefit and long-term stability over short-term economic gain. Failing to do so will not only weaken U.S. credibility but also reshape the geopolitical landscape in a manner that could leave American interests increasingly isolated.

Zelensky arrives in Brussels for EU summit	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Brussels on March 6 to attend an emergency EU summit, which was called to discuss further support for Ukraine and Europe&apos;s efforts to boost its own defense capabilities. The meeting comes amid seismic geopolitical shifts as U.S. President Donald Trump cut off military aid for Ukraine while renewing ties with Moscow, casting doubt on his commitment to Kyiv&apos;s and Europe&apos;s security.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-arrives-in-brussels-for-eu-summit/	2025-03-06T02:58:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156503093.jpg
Arsen Zhumadilov officially appointed as new Defense Procurement Agency head	Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry officially appointed Arsen Zhumadilov as the new head of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) on March 6, said the agency responsible for weapons purchases for the military. At the same time, Zhumadilov resigned as chief of the State Rear Operator (DOT), a sister agency overseeing the procurement of non-lethal supplies for the Armed Forces. Andrii Sozanskyi, DOT&apos;s executive director, replaced him as acting director. The defense procurement sector was reshaped in December 2023, aiming to meet NATO standards. The DPA, first established in August 2022, was to focus solely on lethal aid. Meanwhile, the DOT was formed to purchase non-lethal aid such as food and clothing. &quot;The Defense Ministry should work more efficiently. There are very high expectations from everyone involved in the defense sector. Changes are objectively overdue and perhaps overripe. We all have no time to delay any longer,&quot; Zhumadilov said. The official appointment came more than a month after the scandal in procurement agencies. In late January, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov refused to extend the contract with the former DPA director Maryna Bezrukova for another year over supposedly poor performance, defying the DPA Supervisory Board&apos;s decision. According to Bezrukova, Umerov&apos;s move caused a &quot;legal conflict&quot; inside the organization, reportedly blocking its procurement functions. At the same time, the minister appointed Zhumadilov, who also runs the DOT, as interim director-general of the DPA. One of NATO and European partners&apos; requirements for Ukraine was the establishment of two agencies that would be directly responsible for procurement for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, not through the Defense Ministry or contractors. According to Ukrainian law, supervisory boards can hire and fire the heads of state enterprises unilaterally. This means that legally, after the board&apos;s vote, Bezrukova should have taken over the DPA for another year. However, the Defense Ministry, which oversees the DPA, amended the agency&apos;s charter so the ministry can reverse the supervisory board&apos;s decisions. Ukraine&apos;s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) is investigating possible abuses of power by Umerov.	https://kyivindependent.com/arsen-zhumadilov-appointed-as/	2025-03-06T02:51:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1861129611.jpg
Poroshenko, Tymoshenko confirm 'public' contacts with allies but reaffirm opposition to elections during war	Ex-President Petro Poroshenko&apos;s team works &quot;publicly and transparently&quot; with U.S. partners to ensure bipartisan support for Ukraine, Poroshenko said on March 6, reiterating his opposition to elections during the war. His comments came in reaction to Politico&apos;s article, which claimed that U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s team has been leading secret talks with Poroshenko and another opposition leader, Yuliia Tymoshenko, as Washington ramps up pressure against President Volodymyr Zelensky. Tymoshenko also reacted to the story, saying that her party, Batkivshchyna, is negotiating with &quot;our allies who can help secure a just and peaceful solution as soon as possible. &quot; She reaffirmed that elections are possible only after the war ends. Trump&apos;s push for a quick settlement of the Russia-Ukraine war saw him adopt Moscow-aligned positions while pressuring Kyiv by cutting off crucial military aid and intelligence sharing. In recent weeks, the White House has echoed the Kremlin&apos;s false narrative about Zelensky&apos;s illegitimacy, referring to the fact that Ukraine did not hold elections last year. The Ukrainian Constitution does not permit elections under martial law, and critics pointed out difficulties in organizing elections during an all-out war, such as the possibility of voting for front-line soldiers and refugees. According to Ukraine&apos;s former president, his team&apos;s talks with U.S. partners focused on security and a peace through strength approach, including the provision of weapons, intelligence, sanctions, and transatlantic unity. At the same time, Poroshenko criticized the supposed lack of communication between Zelensky&apos;s team and the U.S. government. &quot;Ukraine &#x2014; and President Zelensky said this clearly &#x2014; is ready for talks to end the war under strong leadership of President Trump,&quot; Tymoshenko said on Facebook. According to Politico, senior members of Poroshenko&apos;s European Solidarity party and Tymoshenko have been in contact with four members of Trump&apos;s team. The two opposition leaders reportedly tried to position themselves as more flexible partners for the U.S. than Zelensky. Trump falsely claimed last month that Zelensky&apos;s approval rating has dropped to 4%. While Zelensky&apos;s popularity was steadily declining throughout 2024, the mounting pressure from Washington seemed to have boosted his support. According to a survey by the British pollster Survation, carried out between Feb. 25 and 27, Zelensky leads in the polls with 44%. He is followed by former Commander-in-Chief and Ambassador to the U.K. Valerii Zaluhnyi &#x2014; who has not publicly confirmed presidential ambitions &#x2014; at 21%. Poroshenko came third with 10%, while Tymoshenko scored only 6%, signalling slim chances of beating Zelensky in the election.	https://kyivindependent.com/poroshenko-tymoshenko-reaffirm-opposition-to-elections-under-martial-law-after-claims-of-us-contacts/	2025-03-06T02:42:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1187267913.jpg
Romania expels 2 Russian diplomats in connection to Georgescu's case, media reports	Romania said on March 5 that it had expelled Russian military attache Victor Makovskiy and his deputy, Evgeny Ignatiev, for breaching diplomatic rules of conduct. &quot;It is an exceptional measure... It is not a measure taken easily, and it is taken when the breaches are grave,&quot; Romanian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Andrei Tarnea told Euronews. The decision was communicated to the Russian side, which promised an &quot;appropriate response.&quot; Undisclosed sources told Euronews that the move was connected to the campaign of Romania&apos;s pro-Russian presidential candidate, Calin Georgescu. The far-right politician, who won the first round of a November vote that was later annuled, was detained last month as he faces criminal investigation on suspicions of misreporting his campaign&apos;s finances and promoting war criminals and fascist organisations. Georgesu surged to first place in the November vote with almost 23% despite being seen as a marginal and largely unknown candidate. He was expected to face pro-EU Elena Lasconi in the second round, but Romania&apos;s Constitutional Court annuled the results after a declassified intelligence report pointed to extensive Russian interference in the elections. Georgescu&apos;s surge in popularity was also connected to a massive campaign on the TikTok social media platform shortly before the vote. He remains the front-runner for the rescheduled vote in May. The politician has praised Romania&apos;s World War II fascist leader Ion Antonescu and Russian President Vladimir Putin and proposed a post-war partition of Ukraine. Annulled elections have come to the attention of the Trump administration in the U.S., which has lambasted Romania for the decision as Washington adopts increasingly hostile rhetoric toward its European partners.	https://kyivindependent.com/romania-expels-2-russian-diplomats-in-connection-to-georgescus-case-media-reports/	2025-03-06T02:08:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Romania-Embassy.jpg
US intelligence sharing pause affects Russian aerial strikes warnings, NYT reports	The U.S. pause on sharing intelligence with Kyiv affects warnings against Russian drones and missiles striking Ukrainian military and civilian targets, the New York Times reported on March 5, citing undisclosed U.S. and Ukrainian officials. The U.S. stopped sharing intelligence with Ukraine on March 5, shortly after it froze all military assistance as part of an effort to pressure Kyiv into quick negotiations with Russia. Russian forces regularly launch drones and missiles against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, inflicting heavy civilian casualties. A Russian missile strike against a hotel in Kryvyi Rih late on March 5, carried out shortly after the intelligence sharing pause, killed four people and injured at least 30. According to figures released by Kyiv, U.N. statistics, and open-source data published by BBC Russia, the total death toll of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers, as well as Ukrainian civilians, stood at over 148,000 as of mid-February. A senior Ukrainian official told the NYT that the pause in intelligence sharing would make it more difficult for Ukrainian forces to strike Russian targets. Kyiv still has access to other satellite imagery, they added. Valerii Kondratiuk, the former Ukraine&apos;s spy chief, said that intelligence sharing is concerned primarily with the exchange of satellite images. While European companies have their own satellites, they are not focused on military movements, he added. Some unnamed U.S. officials voiced hope that any pause in intelligence sharing would be short and have little practical impact. A senior Trump administration official told the NYT the original plan was to suspend military and intelligence sharing for a week or two as part of a campaign to put pressure on President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to the NYT, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has a &quot;sizable presence&quot; in Ukraine, with some of its officers deployed in the country to help Ukraine with targeting. The CIA has also helped set up at least three secret signals intelligence collection bases that Ukraine uses to intercept Russian communications to reduce their reliance on U.S. intelligence, the newspaper reported. The conflict between Kyiv and Washington has been simmering for weeks as U.S. President Donald Trump adopted increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Zelensky while intensifying diplomatic outreach to Moscow. The most explosive episode came on Feb. 28, when Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance publicly berated Zelensky in the Oval Office, derailing plans for the signing of a minerals agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/u-s-intelligence-sharing-pause-affects-warnings-russian-strikes-on-ukraine-nyt-reports/	2025-03-06T01:27:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2092457114.jpg
Russia formally appoints new ambassador to US	Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on March 6 appointing Alexander Darchiev as Russia&apos;s new ambassador to Washington. Darchiev, a veteran diplomat with a half-decade of experience in Washington, previously served as Russia&apos;s ambassador to Canada from 2014 to 2021 and later as the director of the North American Department at the Russian Foreign Ministry. The U.S. approved his appointment last month amid renewed diplomatic engagement between the U.S. and Russia. A Russian delegation met U.S. officials in Istanbul on Feb. 27 for a second round of talks, following an initial meeting in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. While the first meeting reportedly focused on Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine, the second round did not include discussions on the war, a U.S. State Department spokesperson confirmed. According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the Istanbul discussions centered on embassy operations. The previous Russian ambassador to the U.S., Anatoly Antonov, was dismissed from his post on Oct. 10, 2024. Under former U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration, the U.S. had largely severed official diplomatic contacts with Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s return to office has shifted U.S. foreign policy. His administration engages more directly with Moscow while adopting a more critical stance toward Ukraine. Trump has also paused military and intelligence sharing with Kyiv to pressure Ukraine to enter peace talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-formally-appoints-new-ambassador-to-us/	2025-03-06T01:03:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2175606823.jpg
France providing intelligence to Ukraine, minister assures after US freeze	France is providing military intelligence to Ukraine, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said after the U.S. halted intelligence sharing with Kyiv, the BFM TV channel reported on March 6. &quot;We have intelligence resources that we are providing to the Ukrainians,&quot; Lecornu said on air on France Inter. The U.S. stopped sharing intelligence with Ukraine on March 5, shortly after it froze all military assistance as part of an effort to pressure Kyiv into quick negotiations with Russia. The decision potentially threatens Ukraine&apos;s ability to strike Russian forces but also detect Russia&apos;s aerial strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Some media suggested that Washington also banned its partners, like the U.K., from sharing U.S.-obtained intelligence with Ukraine. U.S. officials signaled that the pause may be temporary and will depend on progress toward peace talks. Speaking on France Inter, Lecornu also said that French President Emmanuel Macron instructed him to &quot;accelerate the delivery of French aid packages (for Ukraine) to compensate for U.S. aid that no longer arrives.&quot; European countries are expected to step up support amid uncertainties about the Trump administration&apos;s commitment to Ukraine&apos;s and Europe&apos;s security. European assistance for Kyiv and the need for greater defense spending will be discussed during an EU summit in Brussels later on March 6. The conflict between Kyiv and Washington has been simmering for weeks as U.S. President Donald Trump adopted increasingly hostile rhetoric toward President Volodymyr Zelensky while intensifying diplomatic outreach to Moscow. The most explosive episode came on Feb. 28, when Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance publicly berated Zelensky in the Oval Office, derailing plans for the signing of a minerals agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-providing-intelligence-to-ukraine-minister-assures-after-us-freeze/	2025-03-06T00:43:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/France-minister.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill at least 8, injure 39 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed at least eight people and injured 39 others over the past day, regional authorities said on March 6. Ukrainian forces downed 68 out of the 112 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, as well as two ballistic missiles of either the Iskander-M or the North Korean KN-23 model launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Forty-three drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are usually decoys. Russia launches them alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. Russian forces struck a hotel in Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast with a missile overnight, killing four people and injuring at least 30, including a child. A search and rescue operation is ongoing as of 9:40 am local time. The missile strike also damaged 14 apartment buildings, a post office, almost two dozen cars, a cultural center, and 12 shops, the governor said. A Russian drone strike on the city of Sumy killed one person, according to the Sumy regional military administration. Two people suffered injuries as a result of a drone attack on Odesa Oblast, Governor Oleh Kiper said. Russian forces destroyed two houses and targeted an energy facility, he added. One person was killed in the village of Novoolenivka in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Two more people were injured in the region over the past day. A Russian drone attack near the town of Derhachi in Kharkiv Oblast set fire to a house and a car, killing a man and injuring a woman, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 27 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. One person was killed and four others injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-6/	2025-03-06T00:21:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-06_08-24-20.jpg
Lithuania exits Convention on Cluster Munitions	Lithuania formally withdrew on March 6 from the Convention on Cluster Munitions, an international treaty that bans the production and distribution of this controversial weaponry. The Lithuanian parliament voted to exit the treaty last July, leading to Vilnius submitting documents for withdrawal in the autumn of that year. The six-month deadline for leaving the convention expired on March 6. Cluster munitions, weapons that disperse hundreds of smaller &quot;bomblets&quot; in a wide area upon impact, have seen extensive use during Russia&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine. Russian forces have repeatedly deployed this weapon in civilian areas. The U.S. began providing Ukraine with cluster munitions in the summer of 2023, provided they are used outside of populated zones against Russian forces in the occupied territories of Ukraine. Ukraine, Russia, and the U.S. are not parties to the convention, which includes over 110 countries worldwide. The weaponry is seen as posing a risk to civilians as some of the bomblets often fail to explode, presenting danger to local populations for years after the war. Lithuania, which lies at NATO&apos;s eastern flank and borders Russia&apos;s ally Belarus and the heavily armed exclave of Kaliningrad, argued that it requires all possible means to deter potential aggression, especially since Russia uses the weaponry as well, the LRT broadcaster reported. Lithuanian officials pledged to minimize potential risks by implementing algorithms that would prevent the munitions from failing to detonate. The Baltic country is also examining alternatives to cluster munitions but sees the withdrawal from the treaty as a strategic message to potential opponents. Vilnius is also mulling a withdrawal from the Ottawa Treaty banning anti-personnel mines. &quot;I think that we will have the final decision in the spring,&quot; Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene said regarding the treaty on land mines.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-exits-convention-on-cluster-munitions/	2025-03-05T23:36:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/cluster.jpg
Rubio labels Russia's all-out war against Ukraine 'proxy war' between Washington, Moscow	Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine is a &quot;proxy war&quot; between Moscow and Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview with Fox News on March 5. Rubio&apos;s remarks underscore how the Trump administration steadily adopts Kremlin narratives. Previously, Russian President Vladimir Putin falsely claimed the West is fighting Russia &quot;with the hands of Ukrainians.&quot; After Russia failed to take over Ukraine within days and suffered several defeats in 2022, the Kremlin began to push the false claim that Russia was at war with NATO. Western partners have been providing Kyiv with weapons since the beginning of the all-out war but have never sent troops to Ukraine, fearing escalation. The U.S. has now frozen all military assistance to Ukraine as the rift between Kyiv and Washington widens. According to Rubio, U.S. President Donald Trump sees the all-out war against Ukraine as &quot;a protracted, stalemated conflict.&quot; &quot;And frankly, it&#x2019;s a proxy war between nuclear powers &#x2014; the United States, helping Ukraine, and Russia &#x2013; and it needs to come to an end,&quot; Rubio said. The secretary of state said that continuing to give Ukraine weapons &quot;as much as they need for as long as it takes&quot; &#xA0;is &quot;not a strategy.&quot; Speaking about the clash between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Trump in the Oval Office last week, Rubio said that Washington wants to engage both Russia and Ukraine in resolving the war and &quot;we asked the Ukrainians not to sabotage it.&quot; He blamed Ukraine&apos;s president, who answered to U.S. Vice President JD Vance&apos;s comments, for &quot;undermining&quot; Trump&apos;s plan. &quot;(To find a way to end the conflict) is going to require concessions from both sides, but we have to get them both to the table. &#xA0;The Ukrainians have to be there, obviously. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s their country. &#xA0;The Russians have to be at that table,&quot; Rubio said.	https://kyivindependent.com/rubio-labels-russias-all-out-war-against-ukraine-proxy-war-between-washington-moscow/	2025-03-05T23:23:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193483462.jpg
Trump's team leads private talks with Zelensky's political rivals, Politico reports	Four senior members of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s team held secret discussions with political opponents of President Volodymyr Zelensky, Politico reported on March 6, citing three undisclosed Ukrainian lawmakers and a Republican foreign policy expert. Trump&apos;s allies reportedly held talks with Yuliia Tymoshenko, a former prime minister and head of the opposition Batkivshchyna (Fatherland) party, and high-ranking members of the European Solidarity party of ex-President Petro Poroshenko. The news comes after Trump lambasted Zelensky as a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; and publicly berated him in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, underscoring the growing pressure against the Ukrainian president from Washington. Trump&apos;s push for a quick settlement of the Russia-Ukraine war saw him adopt Moscow-aligned positions while pressuring Kyiv by cutting off crucial military aid and intelligence sharing. In recent weeks, the White House has echoed the Kremlin&apos;s false narrative about Zelensky&apos;s illegitimacy, referring to the fact that Ukraine did not hold elections last year. The Ukrainian Constitution does not permit elections under martial law, and critics pointed out difficulties in organizing elections during an all-out war, such as the possibility of voting for front-line soldiers and refugees. Trump also falsely claimed last month that Zelensky&apos;s approval rating has dropped to 4%. While Zelensky&apos;s popularity was steadily declining throughout 2024, the White House fallout and mounting pressure from Washington seem to have boosted his support. According to a survey by the British pollster Survation, carried out between Feb. 25 and 27, Zelensky leads in the polls with 44%. He is followed by former Commander-in-Chief and Ambassador to the U.K. Valerii Zaluhnyi &#x2014; who has not publicly confirmed presidential ambitions &#x2014; at 21%. Poroshenko came third with 10%, while Tymoshenko scored only 6%, signalling slim chances of beating Zelensky in the election. After the televised quarrel last week between Zelensky, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance, several top U.S. officials publicly suggested that Ukraine&apos;s president should step down if he is not &quot;ready for peace.&quot; While Tymoshenko and Poroshenko publicly spoke out against holding elections under martial law, Politico reported that they are positioning themselves as more flexible partners for the U.S. than Zelensky. When approached by the outlet, their parties did not confirm talks with the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-team-leads-private-talks-with-zelenskys-political-rivals-politico-reports/	2025-03-05T22:43:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2182521921.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 881,800 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 881,800 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on March 6. This number includes 1,140 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,261 tanks, 21,311 armored fighting vehicles, 39,606 vehicles and fuel tanks, 24,108 artillery systems, 1,306 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,096 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 27,929 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-881-800-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-03-05T22:07:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2003913401.jpg
Polish official warns of international crisis if US cuts Ukraine from Starlink	Canceling Starlink access for Ukraine would lead to an international crisis between Poland and the U.S., Polish Deputy Prime Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski said on March 5. Poland helps Ukraine maintain its Starlink access and has provided half of all its terminals, totaling over 20,000 terminals since 2022. Starlink satellite internet access plays a crucial role in Ukraine&apos;s civilian and military communications infrastructure. Canceling Poland&apos;s Starlink contracts that provide Ukraine with internet access would be &quot;a big international relations crisis,&quot; Gawkowski said. &quot;I cannot imagine a situation in which a business relation between Poland and a U.S. company would be suddenly interrupted,&quot; Gawkowski said. Gawkowski&apos;s comments follow media reports that the U.S. has threatened to cut Ukraine&apos;s Starlink access unless Kyiv agrees to a critical minerals deal with Washington. Starlink is owned by SpaceX, a company belonging to billionaire Elon Musk. Musk has denied these reports. If Musk were to cut off Ukraine&apos;s Starlink access, Gawkowski said, he would be effectively terminating a corporate contract with an EU nation. Poland and the EU are currently trying to diversify satellite internet access provided to Ukraine, Gawkowski continued. The EU is considering the Paris-based satellite communications company &quot;Eutelsat&quot; to provide satellite internet access to Ukraine&apos;s army. &quot;Poland is maintaining it, Poland purchased Starlink and transferred it to Ukraine. Poland ensures security by paying the subscription fees. I cannot imagine any American corporation violating such agreements,&quot; Gawkowski said on Feb. 25. Musk, a key ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, has drawn scrutiny at home and abroad over his ties to Russia and repeated inflammatory comments regarding Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-official-warns-of-international-crisis-between-poland-us-if-ukraine-cut-from-starlink/	2025-03-05T22:06:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2170729615.jpg
Canada ready to join Ukraine peacekeeping mission with US backing, defense minister says	Canada is ready to partake in a potential peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, provided the United States offers security guarantees, Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair said on March 5. European countries, led mainly by the U.K. and France, are developing a coalition of the willing to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Various countries including Ireland have voiced their willingness to partake in such a mission. &quot;Canada is ready and able to make a contribution to that force,&quot; Blair said on March 5 during a defense conference in Ottawa. &quot;But we also believe that there&apos;s important discussions that need to take place with respect to security guarantees for Ukraine and for the forces that would serve in Ukraine.&quot; Blair also said that for a coalition of peacekeepers to be effective, the U.S. must support the initiative with security assurances. &quot;We&apos;ve strongly indicated we&apos;re willing to be a part of that, but I still believe it is going to require security guarantees from the United States,&quot; Blair said. Blair&apos;s comments echo those of other Western leaders, including U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has urged Washington to provide a &quot;backstop&quot; for a European-led peacekeeping force. The U.S. has thus far welcomed the idea of European peacekeeping troops monitoring a potential ceasefire in Ukraine but has fallen short of offering concrete security guarantees. Along with Canada, other non-European countries, including Turkey, have signaled willingness to join a future peacekeeping coalition in Ukraine. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on March 3 that Australia is open to contributing to a joint force. &quot;There is a discussion at the moment about potential peacekeeping, and from my government perspective, we are open to consideration of any proposals going forward ... We want to see peace in Ukraine, but we want to make sure that the illegal, immoral actions of Russia are not rewarded,&quot; Albanese said. The Kremlin has consistently maintained that it will not accept Western troops on the ground in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/canada-voices-willingness-to-partake-in-ukraine-peacekeeping-mission/	2025-03-05T20:54:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2002538371.jpg
EU prepares for new wave of Ukrainian refugees amid Trump uncertainty, Politico reports	EU leaders are discussing how to handle a potential renewed wave of refugees from Ukraine in the face of uncertainty in U.S. policy and Russia&apos;s ongoing offensives, Politico reported on March 5. Following a heated argument between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28 the White House suspended U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. Trump has repeatedly failed to condemn Russia, stirring panic in Europe. Czechia, Germany, and Poland host the most Ukrainian refugees. EU officials are now debating if there should be a more equal distribution among EU member states in the event of a new wave of refugees, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said on March 5. &quot;If (Russian President Vladimir) Putin escalates this war even further and the American support should disappear, and if this should lead to a larger refugee movement ... we need a binding distribution of the Ukraine refugees throughout the EU, according to a fair mechanism,&quot; Faeser said. European officials do not necessarily expect another large influx of refugees from Ukraine. Regardless, geopolitical uncertainty has prompted dialogue among European authorities on how to respond to a potential influx, Faeser told reporters. Germany will stand with Kyiv &quot;(a)s long as Putin&apos;s terrible attack against Ukraine continues,&quot; she said. Around 5.2 million Ukrainian refugees remain abroad and about 4.2 million reside in the EU. The share of Ukrainian refugees who want to return home dropped from 74% in December 2022 to 43% by the end of 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-officials-prepare-for-new-wave-of-ukrainian-refugees-amid-trump-uncertainty-politico-reports/	2025-03-05T19:10:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1239784826.jpg
Stop being Putin's ho' â€” US congresswoman lambasts Trump speech	U.S. President Donald Trump needs to stop appeasing Russian President Vladimir Putin, Representative Jasmine Crockett said in response to Trump&apos;s congressional address on March 4. Crockett, a Democrat, was asked by the digital media organization Call to Activism to share &#xA0;what she would like to say to Trump following his speech. &quot;I would tell him to grow a spine and stop being Putin&apos;s ho,&quot; she said. Crockett&apos;s remarks come amid a series of disastrous upheavals in U.S.-Ukraine relations, beginning with Trump kicking President Volodymyr Zelensky out of the White House on Feb. 28 and culminating in Washington&apos;s freeze on military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv. The Kremlin has hailed these developments, saying they align with Moscow&apos;s interests. Trump &quot;is out here really doing the bidding of Russia in a way we&apos;ve never seen an American president do,&quot; Crockett said. She went on to denounce Trump&apos;s treatment of Zelensky, calling their White House meeting a &quot;disgrace.&quot; &quot;We need a president that understands what diplomacy looks like, and it doesn&apos;t look like the disgrace that we saw that took place in the Oval Office.&quot; Ahead of Trump&apos;s address, other leading Democrats in the House and Senate issued a statement warning that the administration&apos;s ties with Russia were a threat to U.S. security interests. &quot;Trump has shown more alignment with Vladimir Putin, who threatens the international rules-based order, than with our long-standing partners and allies,&quot; congressmembers serving on military, intelligence, and foreign policy committees wrote. During his speech, Trump was vague about the decision to halt all military aid to Ukraine. He read out a recent statement from Zelensky expressing Ukraine&apos;s readiness for a peace agreement, framing it as a diplomacy win for his administration. He also claimed Russia had sent &quot;strong signals&quot; that they were ready to make a deal. The freeze on military support to Ukraine remains in place despite Zelensky&apos;s statement. U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said on March 5 that Trump may resume aid deliveries once Ukraine makes further steps towards peace talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/stop-being-putins-h-us-congresswoman-lambasts-trump-speech/	2025-03-05T18:51:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202138194.jpg
Netherlands to provide Ukraine with $3.8 billion in support in 2026	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. The Netherlands will provide Ukraine with 3.5 billion euros ($3.8 billion) in combined government support in 2026, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof announced on March 5. Schoof added that $700 million will be earmarked for Kyiv to invest in drone production. The details were provided on exactly where and what supports the additional funding would be disbursed to. Schoof, who spoke to President Volodymyr Zelensky on the phone on March 5, wrote on X that &quot;the Netherlands will keep backing Ukraine in its struggle against Russian aggression,&quot; including &quot;political, military, financial and moral support.&quot; Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, the Netherlands has provided Kyiv with a combined 7.33 billion euros ($7.87 billion) in support, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. In addition to the aid funding, the Dutch government has provided Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets, having committed 24 aircraft in the summer of 2024. President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed on Feb. 22 that Ukraine anticipates continued deliveries of F-16 fighter jets from the Netherlands in the immediate future.	https://kyivindependent.com/netherlands-to-provide-ukraine-with-3-8-billion-in-2026/	2025-03-05T16:00:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/gettyimages-2182692851-612x612.jpg
US Supreme Court rules judge can force Trump administration to un-freeze remaining foreign aid funding	The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on March 5 the Trump administration must adhere to a lower court ruling that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) restart payments worth nearly $2 billion for the remaining USAID projects. The split 5-4 decision did not explain the reasoning for its decision, nor did it provide a timeline as to when the payments must restart, but did note that &quot;feasibility of any compliance timelines&quot; must be considered. U.S. District Judge Amir Ali, who ordered the initial payments, must now provide clarity on the foreign aid&apos;s release. The ruling does not apply to the Trump administration&apos;s decision to terminate over 90% of the USAID foreign aid contracts that cuts $60 billion in foreign assistance. The cuts will include 5,800 of 6,200 USAID contracts, purportedly saving $54 billion, and 4,100 of 9,100 State Department grants, for a cut of $4.4 billion, Politico reported. Multiple global health groups challenged the Trump administration&apos;s cuts to foreign aid for work already completed until Feb. 13. The White House initially appeared as though they would not comply with the court order but eventually appealed the decision. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration initally halted almost all foreign aid for 90 days for a review amid efforts to shutter the aid agency and merge it under the State Department. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support to Kyiv. The agency has funded school reconstruction, bomb shelters, critical energy repairs, and civil society initiatives. The White House has accused the agency of pushing a &quot;liberal agenda&quot; and widespread waste, despite foreign aid making up just 1% of the federal budget. USAID cuts not only marked a significant realignment of U.S. foreign policy but also threatened various Ukrainian organizations and projects across multiple sectors reliant on U.S. funding. Ukraine is in talks with private and EU partners to replace funding sources for key projects in energy infrastructure, veterans&apos; affairs, and more.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-supreme-court-rules-judge-can-force-trump-administration-to-un-freeze-remaining-foreign-aid/	2025-03-05T14:34:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/gettyimages-2202300988-612x612.jpg
Russian missile attack on hotel in Kryvyi Rih kills 2, injures 14	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russian forces struck a hotel in Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast with a missile on March 5, killing two people and injuring 14, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine reported. The missile struck the five-storey hotel around 10 p.m. local time, killing a 53-year-old man, as well as one other victim. No additional information was provided on the identities of the deceased. Seven of the injured victims are currently listed as being in serious condition, while other remain in moderate condition, Suspilne reported. Emergency crews are currently working on-scene to evacuate more people from the burning hotel. Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service said that there may be additional victims under the rubble. Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelensky, remains a frequent target of Russian missile attacks. With a population of about 660,000, it is the second-largest city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, located roughly 70 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the nearest front line.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-on-hotel-in-kryvyi-rih-kills-2-injures-7/	2025-03-05T13:43:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-05_15-53-17.jpg
Macron open to extending France's nuclear protection to European allies amid threat from Russia	During a televised address to his nation on March 5, French President Emmanuel Macron said he was open to extending France&apos;s nuclear umbrella to protect European allies. &quot;I have decided to start strategic discussions on the defense of the entire continent with our nuclear weapons. The decision will depend on the heads and commanders-in-chief of European countries,&quot; Macron said. The remarks come amid ongoing Russian aggression on the European continent that extends beyond Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russia has been accused of waging a proxy war with Europe, having been alleged of numerous incidents of Russian sabotage on the continent. &quot;The threat from Russia extends to the whole of Europe,&quot; Macron said. &quot;This aggressiveness seems far away, but it is very close. Russia is interfering in our elections, spreading propaganda everywhere.&quot; France and the United Kingdom are the only two European nations that possess a nuclear arsenal. Macron added that a final decision on the matter would ultimately rest with the French president. Macron further called for European allies to increase spending on defense, amid concerns that the United States may not come to Europe&apos;s defense if it is attacked by Russia. &quot;I want to believe that the U.S. will stand by our side, but we have to be ready for that not to be the case,&quot; Macron said, emphasizing that Russia continues to amass a larger military presence. &quot;Russia continues to rearm, it spends 40% of its budget on defense. By 2030, Russia wants to mobilize another three million soldiers and add four thousand tanks to its arsenal.&quot; Western leaders and defense officials previously warned about the threat emanating from Russia amid Europe&apos;s current lack of military preparedness. Western intelligence agencies have also warned that Russia may find the opportunity to launch a large-scale war on Europe within five years. &quot;Russia has become a threat for France and Europe,&quot; Macron said. &quot;(T)o watch and do nothing would be madness.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-open-to-extending-frances-nuclear-umbrella-to-european-allies-amid-threats-from-russia/	2025-03-05T13:06:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/gettyimages-2202893246-612x612.jpg
How US right-wing podcasters shape pro-Russia, anti-Ukraine sentiments	Listening to right-leaning alternative media in the U.S., one might come away with the impression &#x2014; albeit without evidence &#x2014; that Ukraine is irredeemably corrupt, President Volodymyr Zelensky is a dictator, and Russia&#x2019;s invasion was somehow justified. On a December episode of comedian Tim Dillon&#x2019;s podcast, podcaster Joe Rogan asserted that &#x201C;most people don&#x2019;t even know about the coup in 2014 in Ukraine,&#x201D; echoing a Russian talking point that casts the country&#x2019;s revolution against a pro-Russian corrupt regime in 2013-2014 as a U.S.-backed plot. &#x201C;Most people don&#x2019;t know that the president of the Ukraine right now, Zelensky, played the president on a television show &#x2014; a comedy show. And the premise of the comedy show was that a comedian becomes the president,&#x201D; Dillon added. While true in part, Dillon misrepresented Zelensky&#x2019;s role in &#x201C;Servant of the People,&#x201D; where he played a schoolteacher turned president, not a comedian. Dillon&#x2019;s use of &#x201C;the Ukraine,&#x201D; a linguistic relic of Soviet-era dominance, underscored how even casual conversations can echo geopolitical biases. After the onset of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war in 2022, negative and misleading narratives about Ukraine have gained momentum in right-leaning U.S. alternative media. As traditional news consumption reaches historic lows, a new frontier of media consumption has taken the lead. Right-wing alternative media has been particularly successful in the U.S. because &#x201C;it fills a void that mainstream media left open. It offers a clear, emotionally compelling, and often conspiratorial narrative that gives its audience easy explanations for complex problems,&#x201D; David Packman, an American talk show host and progressive political commentator, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Progressive media is up against a serious disadvantage which is that the truth is often way less exciting than a lie.&#x201D; During his 2024 election campaign, U.S. President Donald Trump aggressively courted influential right-leaning podcast hosts, harnessing their reach to millions of listeners for his political benefit. Some of these media figures &#x2014; including Rogan, Tucker Carlson, Patrick Bet-David, and Lex Fridman &#x2014; have also repeatedly amplified Russian narratives about Ukraine. With the U.S. suspending military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine in early March and the Trump administration&#x2019;s intensifying attacks on Zelensky, policy debates in the U.S. over the war and Ukraine&#x2019;s future appear to be shaped less by experts and more by Russian propaganda narratives, amplified by U.S. right-wing podcasters. Rogan&#x2019;s podcast, with over 19 million YouTube subscribers and a consistent hold on the top of the charts, dominates the alternative media sphere in the U.S. What began as a casual hangout for comedians has evolved over the past 16 years into a platform featuring high-profile guests like Silicon Valley tech moguls and presidential candidates. While he positions himself as &#x201C;an American first&#x201D; &#x2014; appearing to imply that patriotism is separate from political party allegiance &#x2014; &#xA0;Rogan has, in recent years, slowly embraced right-wing talking points. Rogan officially endorsed Trump during the 2024 presidential election and declared, &#x201C;Why would anyone be against (his desire to make America first)?&#x201D; in a recent episode with businessman Marc Andreessen. &#x201C;There&apos;s always been a very strong isolationist, &#x2018;America First&#x2019; constituency in the U.S. You will always be able to sell commercial media programming by waving the flag and asking why foreign aid is being sent abroad rather than paying for local or state needs,&#x201D; Professor Michael Socolow, an American media historian, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;(President Franklin D.) Roosevelt had to fight (isolationism) when trying to stop the Nazis before the Japanese bombed America into World War II. It seems like the anti-Ukraine discourse has blended into this traditional American political faction.&quot; Rogan has also voiced strong opposition to U.S. aid to Ukraine. In one episode, while talking to record producer and songwriter Scott Storch, Rogan condemned then-U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s authorization of Ukrainian strikes on Russian soil with American weapons, unleashing expletives aimed at Zelensky. &#x201C;How are you allowed to do that when you are on your way out? Like people don&#x2019;t want you to be there anymore, maybe that would be a good thing we would like to avoid from a dying former president. The whole thing is nuts,&#x201D; Rogan said. &quot;Zelensky says Putin is terrified. F**k you, man. You f**king people are about to start World War III.&#x201D; U.S. podcaster Joe Rogan greets then-U.S. President-elect Donald Trump during the UFC 309 event at Madison Square Garden in New York, New York, U.S. on Nov. 16, 2024. (Jeff Bottari / Zuffa LLC)During the heated Feb. 28 meeting in Washington, Trump made a similar point when he warned Zelensky he was &quot;gambling with World War III,&quot; suggesting that Ukraine&#x2019;s resistance to Russian aggression was a greater threat to global stability than Russia&apos;s invasion itself. Rogan later revealed that he turned down Zelensky&#x2019;s offer to appear on the podcast to share the Ukrainian perspective, offering little more than a casual dismissal during an episode with three other comedians: &#x201C;Zelensky tried to come on. They tried to get Zelensky on. I was like, &#x2018;What are you talking about?&#x2019;&#x201D; In the same episode where Rogan rejected the idea of interviewing Zelensky, fellow comedian Ari Shaffir casually mentioned that Former Fox News host and conspiracy theorist Tucker Carlson had told him that former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had &#x201C;prevented&#x201D; a 2022 peace deal &#x2014; a Kremlin narrative that ignores the fact that Russia-Ukraine negotiations stalled shortly after the discovery of the Bucha massacre. Both Johnson and Zelensky have also denied the claim. &#x201C;Where&#x2019;s the evidence (of Johnson intervening)? What&#x2019;s the context? Who are the sources? Doesn&#x2019;t matter &#x2014; once it&#x2019;s said on a massive platform, it becomes the truth,&#x201D; Packman said. &#x201C;And because these hosts are seen as more &#x2018;authentic&#x2019; than traditional news anchors, their words carry weight, even when they&apos;re just speculating or repeating Kremlin talking points without realizing it.&#x201D; Some of the anti-Ukraine messaging pushed by Rogan and other alternative media personalities can often be traced back to their guests, some of whom not only repeat pro-Russian narratives but have also interacted directly with the Kremlin. Among them is U.S. filmmaker Oliver Stone, who conducted over a dozen interviews with Vladimir Putin during the two years of filming a documentary about the Russian leader. Stone&#x2019;s other documentary, &#x201C;Ukraine on Fire,&#x201D; depicts the 2013-2014 EuroMaidan Revolution (or Revolution of Dignity) as &#x201C;the Maidan Massacre&#x201D; that resulted in the overthrow of then-President Viktor Yanukovych rather than a democratic uprising against Yanukovych&#x2019;s push to develop closer ties with Russia over the EU. In a 2022 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, whose YouTube channel has nearly five million subscribers, Stone dismissed those who said that Putin was a &#x201C;madman&#x201D; for his invasion of Ukraine. &#x201C;What people don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201D; Stone argued, &#x201C;is that Ukraine has been a terrorist state since 2014&#x201D; &#x2013; another Kremlin talking point that has nothing to do with reality. Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has appeared on Rogan and Fridman&#x2019;s podcasts, has used X, formerly known as Twitter, to repeatedly amplify Russian talking points. He has also referred to the EuroMaidan Revolution as a coup and called for Ukraine&#x2019;s Crimean Peninsula &#x2013; occupied by Russia since 2014 &#x2013; to remain with Russia, which garnered him praise from former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Carlson, who has also interviewed Putin as well as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, has been a guest on a number of these shows or featured some of the hosts on his own show. Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin gives an interview to US talk show host Tucker Carlson at the Kremlin, Moscow, Russia on Feb. 6, 2024. (Gavriil Grigorov / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;I do feel for Zelensky, I do&#x2026;I think Zelensky&#x2019;s been completely misused by the State Department&#x2026;by the policy makers in the U.S. who have used Ukraine as a vessel for their geopolitical ambitions,&#x201D; Carlson told Fridman shortly after his interview with Putin, reinforcing the narrative that Ukraine&#x2019;s push for independence is not truly its own. Additionally, Carlson has repeatedly claimed &#x2014; without evidence &#x2014; that Ukraine is selling U.S.-supplied weapons on the black market, including to Mexican drug cartels. Fellow right-wing commentator Richard Hanania privately asked Carlson for proof behind his claim, to which Carlson responded with a slew of personal insults, Hanania revealed in a March 2 post on X. When pressed on Carlson&#x2019;s pro-Russia rhetoric in an interview with Piers Morgan in early February, Zelensky didn&#x2019;t mince words: &#x201C;He needs to stop working for Putin, to stop kissing his ass, honestly.&#x201D; In addition to those who have traveled to Moscow for sit-downs with Putin, some podcasters have also been accused of receiving money directly from the Kremlin. In September 2024, the U.S. Justice Department alleged that several right-wing podcasters, including Tim Pool and Dave Rubin, were linked to Tenet Media, a company serving as a Russian intelligence services fronta front for Russian intelligence ser after Russia Today&#x2019;s reach was restricted. The podcasters were allegedly unaware of the company&#x2019;s ties to Russia and denied that the Kremlin had any influence over their work. However, some of them continue to push anti-Ukraine talking points to this day. &#x201C;I f**king despise these smarmy hypocrites defending Ukraine and Zelensky,&#x201D; Pool wrote on X on March 4. &#x201C;Ukraine has given us NOTHING. There is no reason to be involved in this war.&#x201D; Given these alternative media figures&#x2019; ties to Trump&#x2019;s political orbit, Zelensky has attempted to navigate &#x2014; and capitalize on &#x2014; this alternative media landscape to his country&#x2019;s benefit. While Zelensky didn&#x2019;t appear on Rogan&#x2019;s podcast and talks of an interview with Carlson never materialized, he sat down in January for a nearly three-hour conversation with Fridman. During the discussion, Zelensky fervently detailed Ukraine&#x2019;s struggles in an existential war and why negotiating with Putin isn&#x2019;t as straightforward as some suggest. While Fridman has publicly praised Zelensky as a hero, likening him to Winston Churchill, he steered their conversation in a different direction during the interview by speaking of the need for compromises and even to forgive Putin, prompting Zelensky to reply that the compromise was that Putin will likely never face the prison sentence he deserves &#x2014; but forgiveness, after everything, is out of the question. Following the interview, Fridman said on Rogan&#x2019;s podcast that he intends to travel to Moscow for an interview with Putin. Some other Ukrainian political figures, for personal gain, have also attempted to exploit the opportunities presented by this right-wing alternative media landscape.

(Lex Fridman / YouTube)At the end of December, Oleksiy Arestovych, a controversial former adviser to the President&#x2019;s Office, made an appearance on Iranian-American entrepreneur Patrick Bet-David&#x2019;s podcast. Bet-David hosted Trump and several of his immediate family members on his show during the presidential election. Arestovych cast himself to Bet-David&#x2019;s audience as a &#x201C;phenomenally popular&#x201D; figure forced to leave Ukraine at the warning of an unnamed U.S. official but resolute in his ambition to return when conditions permitted. Arestovych is known for exaggerating and even lying about his role in wartime Ukraine. None of Arestovych&#x2019;s statements were challenged by Bet-David during the three-hour-long interview &#x2014; every claim was presented and, in turn, accepted as fact. &#x201C;There are very few critical or antagonistic interviewers on podcasts,&#x201D; Socolow explained. &#x201C;That&apos;s how Trump used them so effectively during the campaign, for example. He knew he would be treated nicely, and that made it easier to promote his anti-Ukraine (and supposedly &#x2018;pro-America&#x2019;) messages.&#x201D; Amid declining U.S. popular support for Ukraine, Arestovych also sought to undermine confidence in Zelensky&apos;s leadership both domestically and internationally with provocative statements like &#x201C;I trust Putin more than Zelensky.&#x201D; Bet-David, known for frequently discussing alongside his co-hosts how Ukraine is &#x201C;totally corrupt,&#x201D; then pressed Arestovych to answer whether Zelensky had profited financially from the war. &#x201C;This is a very important question for you to answer,&#x201D; Bet-David said. &#x201C;If you answer it, in a way, it&#x2019;s catastrophic for (Zelensky). Do you know the answer, whether money ended up flowing to him through shell accounts or other people?&#x201D; Former President&apos;s Office advisor Oleksiy Arestovych at a forum in Kyiv on Dec. 11, 2020. (Evgen Kotenko/ Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images)&#x201C;I do not have information that he received money from corruption scandals. But I can tell you for sure that the level of corruption is off the charts. It&#x2019;s catastrophic,&#x201D; Arestovych replied vaguely, adding that &#x201C;at a minimum, it benefits the people who are surrounding (Zelensky).&#x201D; Bet-David has increasingly pushed anti-Ukraine rhetoric through conversations with a number of guests that have no apparent expertise on the issue. In a March 4 interview, men&apos;s rights activist and alleged human trafficker Andrew Tate joined Bet-David in accusing Zelensky of the &#x201C;audacity&#x201D; of &quot;disrespecting&quot; Trump during his White House visit. Bet-David and Tate also implied that Zelensky is somehow prolonging the war out of personal interests, despite the Kremlin saying publicly that they have yet to achieve their objectives in Ukraine &#x2014; namely, the destruction of Ukrainian statehood. Polls show that right-wing alternative media&#x2019;s anti-Ukraine rhetoric has resonated among a significant percentage of the American public. As the full-scale war entered its fourth year, that lack of support could prove deadly. Pew Research published a poll in November that showed 43% of Republicans believed that the U.S. was providing too much aid to Ukraine, and only 36% said the country had a responsibility to help defend Ukraine. Likewise, a Gallup poll from December showed that 50% of Americans believe in the need for a swift end to the war even if it means Ukraine doesn&#x2019;t recover all of its territory under Russian occupation. &#x201C;What appears to be happening is that the fringe media is influencing the more-established and respectable conservative media mindset,&#x201D; Socolow said. &#x201C;And this is shaping anti-Ukraine, pro-Putin rhetoric that&apos;s becoming more influential.&quot; Thanks for reading this article. As an American who has lived for a long time in Ukraine, it&#x2019;s important for me to call out those back in my birth country who are spreading harmful disinformation about the country that holds a special place in my heart. During wartime, it is even more important to get facts straight.

Ukraine war latest: US halts intelligence sharing with Ukraine, CIA director confirms	Key developments on March 5: The U.S. has halted intelligence sharing with Kyiv, threatening Ukraine&apos;s ability to strike Russian targets amid the full-scale war, CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed to Fox Business on March 5. &#x201C;Trump had a real question about whether President (Volodymyr) Zelensky was committed to the peace process, and he said let&#x2019;s pause,&#x201D; Ratcliffe said. On March 5, the Financial Times reported, citing undisclosed sources, that the U.S. had halted intelligence sharing with Ukraine. The move follows Washington&apos;s decision to freeze all military aid supplies to Ukraine following a public spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. The decision was likely intended to put pressure on Zelensky in peace talks. Zelensky later issued a statement on March 4 in which he called the Oval Office clash &quot;regrettable&quot; and affirmed commitment to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s leadership. The U.S. president praised Zelensky&#x2019;s statement in his address to Congress but made no direct comment on releasing military aid. &#x201C;I think on the military front and the intelligence front, the pause that allowed that to happen, I think will go away,&#x201D; Ratcliffe added. There had been conflicting claims as to whether the aid freeze also concerned intelligence sharing, a crucial capability that allows Ukraine to strike Russian targets and track military movement. Citing an undisclosed Ukrainian official, Bloomberg originally disputed the Financial Times&apos; article, claiming that intelligence sharing is ongoing. The British tabloid Daily Mail previously reported that the U.S. banned the U.K. from sharing Washington-obtained intelligence with Kyiv. Two officials told the FT that while Washington blocked allies from sharing U.S. intelligence with Ukraine, &quot;recipients with assets inside the country&quot; are likely to continue passing certain information to Ukraine. The restrictions will nevertheless hamper time-sensitive intelligence crucial for conducting precision strikes against moveable Russian targets, according to the outlet. Sky News supported this claim, reporting that the restrictions are &quot;selective&quot; and are aimed at Ukraine&apos;s ability to launch strikes. Since then, the U.S. media has reported that the aid freeze remains in place and that it is unclear whether Zelensky&apos;s statement that the Oval Office clash was &quot;regrettable&quot; was sufficient to lift the freeze. The Oval Office spat on Feb. 28, after which the U.S. leaders berated Zelensky as &quot;ungrateful&quot; and not &quot;ready for peace,&quot; derailed the signing of a much-anticipated natural resources agreement between the two countries. Ukraine&apos;s leader reaffirmed his readiness to sign the deal in his statement on March 4, but CBS News reported that parameters are still unclear as Trump seeks better terms. U.S. President Donald Trump may lift the pause on military support for Ukraine once peace talks are arranged and more confidence-building measures are taken, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said on March 5, according to Reuters. White House officials signaled that Zelensky must issue an apology and demonstrate readiness for peace to get the talks back on track. On March 4, the Ukrainian president made a statement in which he called the quarrel &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his commitment to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Waltz called the statement a &quot;good, positive first step.&quot; Similarly, Trump voiced appreciation for Zelensky&apos;s words and mentioned the statement in his address to Congress. &quot;I think if we can nail down these negotiations and move towards these negotiations, and in fact, put some confidence-building measures on the table, then the president will take a hard look at lifting this pause,&quot; Waltz said on the Fox &amp; Friends program, according to Reuters. According to Trump&apos;s aide, officials are leading talks on a specific date, location, and team for the negotiations. Ukraine has repeatedly stressed that security guarantees that would prevent Russia from resuming its aggression at a later date are a necessary condition for any peace talks. The Trump administration has retorted that the minerals deal is a security commitment of its own and pushed to broker a quick resolution between Kyiv and Moscow. Zelensky reaffirmed his readiness to sign the deal in his statement on March 4, but CBS News reported that parameters are still unclear as Trump seeks better terms. Ukraine and Europe are working on a plan for the first steps toward a just and sustainable peace as Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion enters its fourth year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 5. &quot;We are preparing a plan of first steps to bring about a just and sustainable peace. We are working on it quickly. It will be ready soon,&quot; he wrote on Telegram. Zelensky will participate in a special European Council meeting on March 6, where EU leaders are expected to discuss continued support for Ukraine as well as security guarantees for a lasting peace. The president said in his Telegram post that he had discussed the plan with with Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob, briefing him on the recent leaders&apos; summit in London and joint European efforts. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosted a summit on March 2, gathering key Western leaders, including Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, to coordinate support for Ukraine. Zelensky wrote on Telegram that Europe has a common vision for ending Russia&apos;s war and securing long-term stability. &quot;It should be at the table of future negotiations together with Ukraine and the United States,&quot; he added. The statement comes as U.S. and Russian officials held talks in Istanbul on Feb. 27, following their initial meeting in Riyadh on Feb. 18. The discussions, part of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s push for a swift peace deal, have raised concerns in Kyiv and Europe that Washington is sidelining its allies. Zelensky&apos;s remarks follow a dramatic shift in U.S. foreign policy, with Trump echoing Kremlin narratives and accusing the Ukrainian president of prolonging the war. Washington has frozen all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, a move widely seen as an attempt to pressure Kyiv into talks with Russia. Earlier, the Ukrainian president proposed initial steps toward peace, including releasing prisoners and a ceasefire in the air and sea. Ukrainian and American delegations will meet &quot;soon&quot; for peace talks, President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said on March 5, following discussions with U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. &quot;We discussed further steps towards a just and lasting peace,&quot; he wrote on Telegram. The two sides &quot;also exchanged views on security issues and the coordination of positions within the framework of bilateral relations between Ukraine and the United States,&quot; Yermak said, adding the teams agreed to meet in the near future to &quot;continue this important work.&quot; In his evening address, Zelensky said that the first results of the ongoing negotiations would be announced next week. &quot;Everyone can see how fast diplomatic events are developing. Today, our Ukrainian and U.S. teams have started working on a meeting. There is a positive movement,&quot; Zelensky said. An agreement between Kyiv and Washington on the natural resources remains stalled as Trump seeks a &quot;bigger, better deal,&quot; CBS News reported on March 4. White House officials publicly indicated that Zelensky must issue an apology and demonstrate a commitment to peace talks for discussions to resume. On March 4, Zelensky called the White House clash &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his willingness to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Waltz suggested on March 5 that Trump may lift the pause on military assistance once peace talks are arranged and more confidence-building measures are taken, Reuters reported. The long-debated agreement would establish a fund to which Ukraine would contribute 50% of proceeds from the future monetization of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. Ukraine previously rejected two U.S. proposals due to the absence of security guarantees, but negotiations are continuing amid mounting pressure from Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump said he appreciated President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s statement in support of peace talks but did not directly discuss his decision to halt military aid to Ukraine in his address to a joint session of Congress on March 4. Multiple news outlets reported on March 3 that the Trump administration ordered an immediate freeze on all U.S. military aid to Ukraine. The U.S. president barely referenced the decision in his first major address to lawmakers since returning to the White House, focusing largely on domestic issues. When he mentioned the war and Washington&apos;s role in supporting Ukraine, he avoided any direct mention of the aid freeze. &quot;The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine&apos;s defense,&quot; Trump said. &quot;With no security, with no anything. Do you want to keep it going for another five years?&quot; That question was Trump&apos;s only nod to the suspension of aid, which a White House official said on March 4 is meant to pressure &#xA0;President Volodymyr Zelensky into peace negotiations. Trump said in his address that he &quot;appreciate(s)&quot; Zelensky&apos;s recent statements expressing Ukraine&apos;s readiness for peace, but did not say whether or not the U.S. would resume weapons deliveries. On March 4, Zelensky reiterated Ukraine&apos;s commitment to the peace process in a post on X. &quot;Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians,&quot; &#xA0;he wrote. Zelensky proposed initial steps toward de-escalation with Russia, including prisoner of war (POW) releases, a &quot;truce at sea,&quot; and a &quot;truce in the sky&quot; that would ban missiles, long-range drones, and bombs targeting civilian infrastructure. He also said Ukraine is ready to sign the critical minerals deal &quot;at any time and in any convenient format.&quot; Trump said in his address to Congress that he received that same message in a letter from Zelensky. He read Zelensky&apos;s statement aloud, apparently presenting the message as a sign of successful U.S. pressure on Kyiv. Trump added that his team had held discussions with Russia and received &quot;strong signals&quot; that Moscow is ready to make peace. &quot;Wouldn&apos;t that be beautiful?&quot; he said. While Trump&apos;s remarks on Ukraine and Russia were short on details, his comments indicated that he wants Europe to foot the bill for Ukraine&apos;s defense. &quot;Europe has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending Ukraine,&quot; he said. Trump likened U.S. spending on military aid to Ukraine to &quot;taking candy from a baby&quot; and expressed disbelief at the disparity between European and American aid packages. He repeated his hopes for an end to the war, saying, &quot;It&apos;s time for the madness to stop,&quot; but made no mention of sanctions against Russia or security guarantees for Ukraine. Drones of the Ukrainian Hart Brigade&apos;s Falcon unit destroyed a Russian Murom-M long-range surveillance system near the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces said on March 5. Vovchansk is an embattled town some 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv that has seen heavy battles since Russia launched a new offensive in the area in May 2024. Russian forces &quot;were not saved by the anti-drone net that covered it (Murom-M) from all sides. The first two &apos;birds&apos; of the Falcon pilots punched a hole in it, and the third finally destroyed the system,&quot; the statement read. 0:00/1&#xD7;The Hart Brigade reportedly destroyed the Russian Murom-M long-range surveillance system near the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces said on March 5, 2025. (Khortytsia group of forces/Telegram)Russian troops and a vehicle used to transport infantry and ammunition to their positions came under attack in the same area, the Khortytsia group of forces said. Throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing the way wars are fought. For outnumbered Ukrainian forces, drones have been one of the key weapons to strike Russian warships, naval bases, oil refineries, and airfields inside occupied territories and deep behind Russia&apos;s lines.

France, UK to finalize peace plan with Ukraine 'in days,' set to present to US, Reuters reports	France and the U.K. aim to finalize a peace plan with Ukraine &quot;in days&quot; to present to the United States, Reuters reported on March 6, citing diplomatic sources familiar with the matter. The report follows President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s statement that Ukraine and Europe are working on the first steps toward a just and sustainable peace as Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion enters its fourth year. &quot;We&apos;re looking at putting this plan together in days and not weeks,&quot; a senior European diplomat told Reuters. Another diplomatic source told Reuters that the main goal is to align European and Ukrainian positions before presenting the proposal to the U.S. while reinforcing the message that Russia is the aggressor. European leaders met in London on March 2 to discuss pathways to ending the war and restoring dialogue between Ukraine and the U.S. following the heated Feb. 28 exchange between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. Washington has since frozen all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, widely seen as an attempt to pressure Kyiv into talks with Russia. The move comes amid a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy, with Trump echoing Kremlin narratives and accusing Zelensky of prolonging the war. The Daily Mail claimed that Macron, Starmer, and Zelensky were planning a joint visit to Washington to present a &quot;united front&quot; to Trump. Le Figaro later reported that French officials quickly rebuked the speculation, with the Elysee Palace saying that no such visit is planned &quot;at this stage.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/france-uk-to-finalize-peace-plan-with-ukraine-in-days-set-to-present-to-us-reuters-reports/	2025-03-05T11:58:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202214106.jpg
Trump's alignment with Russia derails Europe's push for a peacekeeping force in Ukraine	European countries have intensified talks on sending peacekeepers to Ukraine to monitor and enforce a possible ceasefire. But the potential deployment of European peacekeepers to Ukraine faces a lot of challenges and uncertainties. There is no unity among European countries on the issue, with some of them openly opposing the idea. The number of peacekeepers is also uncertain, and it is not clear if it will be enough to ensure the effective enforcement of a ceasefire. And the rules of engagement may become a major stumbling block. Another concern is that the Kremlin has refused to accept the potential deployment of Western peacekeepers in Ukraine. Without Russia&apos;s approval, the idea is unlikely to be implemented, and there are no indications so far that U.S. President Donald Trump will pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to approve a European peacekeeping mission. European countries have also said peacekeepers would need to have some form of U.S. support. However, it is unclear if Washington will provide it. Trump has aligned his policy closely with the Kremlin&apos;s agenda and has so far refused to offer any security guarantees to Ukraine. &quot;The deployment of a European military force to Ukraine is, in my view, the least likely form of security assistance to Ukraine because of the high risks involved, and notably the requirement that the United States provides security guarantees to the force &#x2014; essentially Washington being ready to fight Russia,&quot; Neil Melvin, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;President Trump and representatives of his administration have repeatedly stated that the US will not provide such commitments.&quot; Jenny Mathers, a lecturer in international politics at the U.K.&apos;s Aberystwyth University, also argued that &quot;Trump and (U.S. Vice President JD) Vance made it clear just how little they are interested in the security of Ukraine or indeed of Europe.&quot; &quot;European leaders &#x2014; and probably societies too &#x2014; are accepting that Europe will need to take the lead when it comes to security guarantees.&quot; Talks on the potential peacekeeping mission have been spearheaded by the U.K. and France. Ireland, Lithuania, and Canada have also stated that they are considering sending their peacekeepers to Ukraine. &quot;The force would be led by the U.K. and France but would be most likely supported by Sweden, possibly also Poland and the Baltic states or Spain, Italy or the Netherlands, and Denmark,&quot; Pavel Havlicek, a research fellow at the Association for International Affairs, told the Kyiv Independent. But several countries, including some of those named by Havlicek, have been opposed to the idea or non-committal.

(Tom Nicholson / Getty Images)French and Finnish UNIFIL soldiers walk in formation at the Deir Kifa base in South Lebanon on July 25, 2024. (Aline Deschamps/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)Germany has taken an ambivalent stance. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said in January that Berlin might consider deploying its troops in a peacekeeping mission to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Chancellor Olaf Scholz from the Social Democratic Party contradicted Pistorius in February, saying that discussions over Germany potentially deploying its peacekeeping troops to Ukraine were &quot;premature and inappropriate.&quot; The CDU/CSU alliance, which won Germany&apos;s Feb. 23 parliamentary election, appears to be more open to the idea. Its leader, Friedrich Merz, who is expected to become the next chancellor, said in December that Germany may consider joining a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine but only with Russia&apos;s consent. &quot;For my country, Germany, it is a test on our reliability in a possible new European security architecture,&quot; Rebecca Harms, a former member of the European Parliament from Germany, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;And if we put its participation in a historical context, I see that for the Germans, it would be the chance to pay off our horrendous historical guilt in Ukraine,&quot; she added in reference to Nazi Germany&apos;s occupation of Ukraine during World War II and the Holocaust. Meanwhile, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in December that Warsaw was not planning to deploy peacekeepers to Ukraine. &quot;(Some countries) are hesitant &#x2014; like Italy, Spain, and Germany &#x2014; as they see that this could be a potentially dangerous mission, especially if the United States continues to refuse to provide a backstop,&quot; James Shea, a defense and security expert at Chatham House, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Others like the Baltic states and Poland are worried that the troops going to Ukraine would come from the NATO battalions currently defending their national territory and leaving them more vulnerable to Russia.&quot; If a peacekeeping force is created, it might include troops from non-EU countries as well. Turkey has indicated its openness to deploying troops in Ukraine as part of a potential peacekeeping force, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 27, citing sources familiar with the matter. Shea said that &quot;Russia will probably advocate this option (of non-European troops) as it would like the force to be &apos;neutral&apos; and similar to a lightly armed UN peacekeeping force, observing the ceasefire rather than with a mandate to enforce it and help Ukraine to defend itself.&quot; &quot;The Europeans need to work hard with the Americans to ensure that they resist Putin&apos;s demands and go for a robust European-led force,&quot; he added. Havlicek said that &quot;from the Western point of view, Turkish soldiers would be preferred, and Chinese or Central Asian ones would be (preferred) from the Russian one.&quot; At least 200,000 peacekeepers would be required on Ukraine&apos;s eastern front for a peace deal to be enforced, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January. Later, he clarified his comments. &quot;By the way, I didn&apos;t say we need 200,000 (peacekeepers)... A journalist asked me, I said, &apos;Maybe more, maybe less,&apos;&quot; Zelensky said. President Volodymyr Zelensky gives an interview to Turkish media after his visit to Ankara, T&#xFC;rkiye, on Feb. 19, 2024. (Mert Gokhankoc/dia images via Getty Images)The Washington Post reported in February, citing its sources, that participating European nations could send between 25,000 and 30,000 soldiers to Ukraine. &quot;President Zelensky has spoken of the need for a force of hundreds of thousands,&quot; Melvin said. &quot;This is unrealistic. It might just be possible to put together a force of up to 30,000 &#x2013; although whether that could be sustained for long is unclear.&quot; Havlicek said that &quot;around 30,000 to 50,000 troops are often discussed, and they would not be placed at the front line but in several key points where it would be possible to step in if necessary.&quot; It is unclear if such a number will be enough. Harms argued that, given the length of the front line, 100,000 would be needed to effectively monitor the ceasefire. Another problem is that the Kremlin has opposed the potential deployment of Western peacekeepers to Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned in February that Moscow would not accept the deployment of NATO military personnel in Ukraine after any potential peace deal. Melvin said that &quot;this is likely to be a major roadblock to a peace agreement.&quot; But analysts say that the West may try to change the Kremlin&apos;s position. Havlicek argued that &quot;the Kremlin refuses the Western/NATO countries&apos; deployment right now&quot; but &quot;we are only at the beginning of the negotiation process, with many unknowns.&quot; &quot;Economic pressure, including on the energy (sector), could serve as a means to pressure Putin into negotiations,&quot; he added. A European diplomatic source told the Kyiv Independent that, to force Putin to accept a European peacekeeping force, the West should threaten to impose more painful sanctions on Russia&apos;s banking system. The source also said that the West could threaten Russia with sanctions as punishment for violating a ceasefire agreement. The big question is whether Trump will be capable of pressuring Putin or willing to do so. &quot;Trump appears to have no leverage with Putin whatsoever &#x2014; indeed, it looks just the opposite,&quot; Mathers said. &quot;So far, we have seen Trump and his senior officials echoing Kremlin&apos;s talking points and showing how eager they are to re-establish diplomatic and trading relations with Russia without asking Russia to make any concessions at all.&quot; If Russia agrees to a European military presence in Ukraine, the deployment of peacekeepers would still involve considerable risks. &quot;These troops would be under constant risk and potential fire, which is why it is so important to provide U.S. support and guarantees,&quot; Havlicek said. The troops should be there not to fight, but to provide security for the ceasefire and build trust, including ensuring that the conflict does not escalate into a bigger war if Russia resumes military hostilities.&quot; The effectiveness of the potential peacekeeping force also depends on the rules of engagement. &quot;A lot depends on the terms of any deal and the role for peacekeepers that is built in: what their terms of engagement would be,&quot; Mathers said. &quot;We have a situation in the 1990s where UN peacekeepers sent to Bosnia had very limited terms of engagement and ended up being largely ineffectual. We will see if today&apos;s political leaders have learned anything from that experience, or indeed if there is any institutional memory of it.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump chats with Russian President Vladimir Putin during the APEC Economic Leaders&apos; Meeting in Danang, Vietnam, on Nov. 11, 2017. (Mikhail Klimentyev/Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images)Shea argued that &quot;Putin would definitely like the return of the former OSCE observer mission, which proved ineffective at stopping the continuous ceasefire violations in the Donbas.&quot; The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) monitored the front line in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts from 2014 to 2022. Russia violated ceasefire agreements 25 times during the period, according to Zelensky. Shea also said that European peacekeepers would likely &quot;not be on the front line but guarding cities and infrastructure to the rear.&quot; &quot;So, how much fighting ability and deterrent effect they will have on Russia is open to question,&quot; he added. &quot;Especially if Russia doesn&apos;t withdraw its own forces and heavy weapons from forward positions.&quot; European countries have said that they needed a &quot;backstop&quot; from the U.S. for a peacekeeping force in Ukraine. They implied some kind of support or security guarantees but did not elaborate on the issue. Melvin argued that &quot;30,000 (European peacekeepers) would not be able to enforce a ceasefire on their own.&quot; &quot;Without a U.S. security guarantee &#x2014; and here there would be uncertainty about whether President Trump would respond to an attack on the European force even if he had made a previous commitment &#x2014; and given Russia&apos;s comments, there would be considerable risk that these troops would be targeted by Moscow in the future,&quot; he added. Shea said that Europeans could &quot;try to have the U.S. involved in other ways: for instance in supplying air defense assets, logistics and intelligence and allowing the NATO command structure (which depends heavily on U.S. military officers and infrastructure and communications) to provide the planning for the operation.&quot; &quot;Ideally, the U.S. could also provide a reserve or extraction force for the Europeans in a crisis situation, but this will probably be a big ask for Trump and the Pentagon,&quot; he added. &quot;Having the U.S. involved in some way will increase the chances that European countries like Germany, Spain, or Italy, which are currently hesitating to contribute to the force, would do so in the future as U.S. troops on the ground will enhance the overall deterrence capability of the force.&quot; British KFOR soldiers take part in a wreath-laying ceremony for Remembrance Sunday in Pristina, Kosovo, on Nov. 10, 2024. (Armend Nimani/AFP via Getty Images)Mathers said that the Europeans &quot;want the U.S. to commit to retaliating against Russia using American forces (probably air capabilities) if Russia breaks any ceasefire or peace deal.&quot; &quot;They want an Article 5 assurance that an attack by Russia on European troops in Ukraine will be regarded by Washington as an attack on the U.S. and respond accordingly,&quot; she added. &quot;I doubt they will get this, given Trump&apos;s increasingly pro-Russia line, but they might get, for example, an agreement to have U.S. aircraft stationed nearby, patrolling the skies over Ukraine, or something of that nature. Even that, though, would be a stretch for Trump, I suspect.&quot; Kyiv Independent reporter Asami Terajima contributed to this article.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-alignment-with-russia-derails-europes-push-for-a-peacekeeping-force-in-ukraine/	2025-03-05T11:40:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2148296359.jpg
Trump lifting US sanctions on Russia â€” a â€˜huge winâ€™ for Putin, â€˜chaosâ€™ for global economy	U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s administration is reportedly ready to lift sanctions on Russia imposed after the start of the full-scale invasion, in a reversal of U.S. policy toward Moscow during its war against Ukraine. The White House is preparing a plan to potentially give Russia sanctions relief for several entities and Russian citizens as part of negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported on March 3. The move is a stark shift from a sanctions policy by former President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration that included the &#x201C;mother of all sanctions,&#x201D; Europe and the G7 nations want to keep sanctions to throttle Russia&#x2019;s economy and continue to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin. They may have no other option than to follow Washington to maintain unity among Ukraine&#x2019;s allies and avoid being a pariah in the global economy. &#x201C;The big revenue raising opportunities for Russia are still linked to business connected with Europe, and Europe can stand fast on that. But very quickly Europe would find itself marginalized,&#x201D; said Tom Keatinge, director of the Center for Finance and Security at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a think tank. Although the effectiveness of sanctions has been debated, they have clearly gotten under the skin of Putin, who has repeatedly called for their end. Sanctions, particularly on the oil and gas industry, have been a headache for Moscow, forcing it to resort to a shadow fleet to sell discounted fuel while incurring higher export costs. So far, Europe has not said if it will keep sanctions in place or not. Kyiv&#x2019;s sanctions commissioner, Vladyslav Vlasiuk, called on European allies to commit to sanctions &#x201C;for as long as necessary.&#x201D; If the U.S. unilaterally lifts sanctions, it would be a huge win for Putin and a further sign that the Western alliance is crumbling amid already heightened tensions, Keatinge told the Kyiv Independent. The idea of sanctions was for Ukraine&#x2019;s allies to work together to hinder Russia&#x2019;s war economy and punish Moscow for its brutal invasion. Trump&#x2019;s administration previously floated sanctions relief to bring Moscow to the negotiation table, shortly after former president Joe Biden worked with London to lay down the most extensive sanctions to date in January before Trump&#x2019;s inauguration. The growing rift between the U.S. and Europe has increased the risk of Trump acting without Europe. He no longer sees the need to coordinate with European allies and seems uninterested in keeping sanctions in place, said Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council&apos;s Transatlantic Security Initiative. The fallout from the U.S. unilaterally easing sanctions would cause chaos in the global economy, she said. Companies would have to navigate the complexities of conforming to one set of rules for the U.S. and another for the remaining G7 and EU economies, leading to mountains of paperwork and uncertainty among businesses. &#x201C;We have never been in a situation before where one Western ally might act in one way in lifting sanctions and others may act in a different way,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Imagine the chaos that would create for companies if within the G7 and the European Union we had essentially contradictory rules when it comes to Russia.&#x201D; The U.S. and Russia were never important trading partners, with pre-war trade totaling $6.4 billion in Russian imports and $29.7 billion in American exports in 2021. In purely economic terms, lifting American sanctions wouldn&#x2019;t lead to massive amounts of cash flowing to Russia&#x2019;s war machine, but the political messaging would be &#x201C;catastrophic,&#x201D; said Jason McCue, senior partner of McCue Jury &amp; Partners LLP, a law firm.

The EU and G7 have already sanctioned &#x201C;everything that is meaningful,&#x201D; and further packages cannot counterbalance the loss of the U.S., said Braw. European countries will face the moral dilemma of easing sanctions to boost Europe&#x2019;s economy and keep up with American companies or sticking to their guns to punish Putin. Brussels and London would find it hard to lift restrictions as they stipulate that Russia should meet requirements such as compensating Kyiv and respecting Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial integrity. But pressure could mount from businesses and pro-Russian leaders like Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban that have long been against sanctions. &#xA0; &#x201C;There will be European corporations that will be trying to take a back channel to get licenses so that they can compete with Americans,&#x201D; said Keatinge. If the EU lifts sanctions, it would be a much bigger boost for Russia&#x2019;s economy. Moscow and Brussels were key trading partners pre-war, with trade reaching 257.5 billion euros in 2021, including over 60% of Russian fuel imports to the EU &#x2014; Russia&#x2019;s biggest cash cow. The question remains if Putin would allow European enterprises to enter Russia again. If the U.S. unilaterally eases sanctions, Putin will have the leverage to turn around and demand more from Europe in return for a place on its market, said Keatinge. &#x201C;That would be a huge victory for Putin because he would essentially be marginalizing Europe and doing business with the Americans,&#x201D; he said. Trump can lift some sanctions with a wave of his hand while others will have to go through Congress. With the U.S. leader embarking on his own negotiations with Russia, sanction relief will likely be a part of a deal cut with Moscow. Following a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov last month, Trump&#x2019;s administration vocally supported economic opportunities with Russia after the war. In particular, Trump has eyed Russia&#x2019;s lucrative mineral deposits, which previously made up a large chunk of Russian exports to the U.S. &#x201C;If sanctions were lifted, I suspect it would be more about making money for the United States, giving Putin something that he can talk about, and further wedging between the U.S. and the EU,&#x201D; said Keatinge. If Trump does negotiate easing sanctions on Russia, he needs to ensure security guarantees for Ukraine, said Yuliya Ziskina, a senior legal fellow at Razom for Ukraine, a nonprofit. Without them, it would be an &#x201C;ill-fated strategy,&#x201D; she said. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he departs the White House in Washington, DC, U.S. on Feb. 28, 2025. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)&#x201C;Lifting sanctions against Russia would allow it to rebuild its economy, strengthen its war machine, and reattack Ukraine,&#x201D; Ziskina told the Kyiv Independent. Trump is also likely to untie sanctions that would benefit U.S. businesses by arguing that they work against the interests of the U.S. population. In turn, that will bolster Russian businesses and allow them to get hold of dollars via the U.S., overcoming the suspension of U.S. dollar exchange trading on the Moscow Exchange, McCue said. While lifting sanctions would legally give American companies carte blanche to jump back into the Russian market, Moscow is still battling an overheated economy that will turn many off. The ruble&#x2019;s value may have bounced back in recent weeks in line with Trump&#x2019;s talks on a peace agreement, but the key interest rate remains sky-high at 21%, and growth is predicted to slow to 1.7% this year, down from 4.1% in 2024. U.S. Companies would also have to battle the lawlessness of Russia, which is dominated by cutthroat oligarchs close to Putin. Nationalization and corporate raids still loom over Western businesses operating in Russia, and that won&apos;t disappear anytime soon, said Ziskina. Many businesses will remain circumspect of the risks and potential global backlash, although some will cautiously wait to see what happens to the first tranche that barrels in, said Braw. &#x201C;But to be honest, the kinds of companies we&apos;re talking about are not worried about reputational risks,&#x201D; said Keatinge.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-lifting-us-sanctions-on-russia-a-huge-win-for-putin-chaos-for-global-economy/	2025-03-05T11:15:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203349192.jpg
Trumpâ€™s â€˜America Firstâ€™ strategy with Ukraine could backfire on US long term interests, experts warn	U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s escalating pressure on Ukraine over the past week has shocked the global community as he pushes for a quick end to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. The news on March 3 that the U.S. would suspend all military aid to Ukraine sparked fears in Ukraine and joy inside Russia that the U.S. was abandoning its long-standing ally and siding with Moscow. While a halt in aid could be calamitous for Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to defend itself against a full-scale invasion that has now carried on for more than three years, many experts believe the U.S. policies towards Ukraine may also cause long-term harm to the U.S.&#x2019;s own interests. &#x201C;Clearly, there will be different views on this,&quot; said Ian Lesser, a distinguished fellow of the German Marshall Fund and adviser to the president of the U.S.-based think tank. &quot;The Trump administration feels that it&#x2019;s vigorously pursuing an America First policy, and that as a matter of priority, they are looking to greatly reduce &#x2014; if not disengage from &#x2014; European security and to leave that responsibility to European allies,&quot; Lesser said. In a contentious televised meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, Trump said that Europe should be responsible for any security guarantees negotiated as part of a peace plan. Trump is pushing for Ukraine to sign a deal that would allow U.S. investors to profit from Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources, and has said it&#x2019;s &quot;not fair&quot; that the U.S. hasn&#x2019;t received compensation for the funds it has sent to Ukraine. According to Lesser, however, pivoting away from European defense is an &quot;ill-considered choice&quot; that would likely undermine American interests both in the near term and in the longer term. America&#x2019;s long-standing support for Europe has not been an act of charity, he points out, but a policy decision that the country benefits from. &quot;An insecure Europe has implications for the security of North America,&quot; he said. Additionally, signs of disengagement from the U.S. on international security issues will embolden adversaries beyond Europe, he said, citing the South China Sea as a potential example of where tensions could worsen. One of the immediate effects of Trump&#x2019;s latest moves has been a growing sense in Europe that it can no longer count on the U.S as a reliable ally. After the U.S. backed off on its support for Ukraine, the European Union announced a new plan to mobilize hundreds of billions of dollars and boost defense spending. &#x201C;Europe is ready to assume its responsibilities,&quot; said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on March 4. &quot;This is a moment for Europe and we are ready to step up.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and France&apos;s President Emmanuel Macron meet during a summit at Lancaster House in London, England, on March 2, 2025. (Justin Tallis / WPA Pool / Getty Images)A boost in defense spending is a positive signal for the region&#x2019;s security, and a move that Trump has long pushed for. Nevertheless, Trump&#x2019;s approach has meant it comes at the sharp cost of declining confidence in American leadership, said Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of Isolationism: A History of America&apos;s Efforts to Shield Itself From the World. Kupchan said that Trump&#x2019;s stated objective &#x2014; to end the war &#x2014; is the right goal, but that his strategy has been &quot;disastrous.&quot; In his negotiations, the U.S. president has insulted and sidelined allies, while upending longstanding U.S. policy by demanding severe concessions from Ukraine while appearing to placate Russia. &quot;If you&apos;re not just Ukraine, but if you&apos;re France, Germany, the U.K., South Korea, Japan, you have no choice but to ask yourself: Can I count on the United States? Is the United States now passing through a period of such profound political dysfunction that we have to make other plans?&quot; Kupchan said. &#x201C;I think the damage that is done to perceptions of the United States, to America&apos;s reputation for reliability and steadiness, is very harmful,&quot; he added. &apos;It undermines U.S. influence.&quot; A direct consequence of diminished U.S. influence is the weakening of the Western alliance that has kept America&#x2019;s adversaries in check. &quot;I think (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and (Chinese President) Xi (Jinping) are drinking a lot of champagne these days,&quot; Kupchan said. &quot;They don&#x2019;t have to lift a finger. They just sit back and watch Trump weaken the alliance of like-minded countries that has been the anchor of the international system since Pearl Harbor.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin and China&apos;s President Xi Jinping make a toast during a reception following their talks at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia on March 21, 2023. (Pavel Byrkin/AFP via Getty Images)George Barros, who heads the Russia Team and Geospatial Intelligence Team at the Institute for the Study of War, shared a similar view. &quot;Our adversaries are the ones that benefit the most from all these things,&quot; Barros said, referring to Trump&#x2019;s recent moves including the aid suspension. &quot;They&apos;re salivating at the prospect of the American-European transatlantic relationship imploding.&quot; After the announcement of the suspension of aid to Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov spoke positively of the decision, and Russian officials and propagandists rushed to defend Trump after his clash with Zelensky. Despite a March 4 statement from Zelensky in which he proposed steps toward peace and called the Oval Office exchange &quot;regrettable,&quot; the aid freeze remains in place. According to Barros, however, it is still too early to say whether the U.S. is abandoning its ties with Western allies and its role as a leader on the global stage. While he didn&#x2019;t rule it out, he said there is also a possibility that Trump is pursuing a different strategy that he hasn&#x2019;t articulated. Zelensky himself noted the lack of a &quot;clear position&quot; from U.S. officials after the aid suspension during his evening address on March 4, saying &quot;people should not be kept guessing.&quot; Overall, the aid suspension was a &quot;mistake,&quot; Barros said &#x2014; one he hoped would be reversed soon, though he sounded a note of caution. &quot;I think we&#x2019;re still going to see more gut punches in the coming weeks and months, most likely. It&#x2019;s very bad,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-america-first-strategy-with-ukraine-could-backfire-on-u-s-long-term-interests-experts-warn/	2025-03-05T11:10:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202564066.jpg
Ukraine, US delegations to meet 'soon' for negotiations, Zelensky's top aide says	Ukrainian and American delegations will meet &quot;soon&quot; for peace talks, President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said on March 5, following discussions with U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. &quot;We discussed further steps towards a just and lasting peace,&quot; he wrote on Telegram. The two sides &quot;also exchanged views on security issues and the coordination of positions within the framework of bilateral relations between Ukraine and the United States,&quot; Yermak said, adding the teams agreed to meet in the near future to &quot;continue this important work.&quot; In his evening address, Zelensky said that the first results of ongoing negotiations would be announced next week. &quot;Everyone can see how fast diplomatic events are developing. Today, our Ukrainian and U.S. teams have started working on a meeting. There is a positive movement,&quot; Zelensky said. The statements come amid rising tensions between Kyiv and Washington following a clash in the Oval Office exchange on Feb. 28 between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. The dispute led to the collapse of a bilateral deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, after which the U.S. president paused all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. An agreement between Kyiv and Washington on the natural resources remains stalled as Trump seeks a &quot;bigger, better deal,&quot; CBS News reported on March 4. White House officials publicly indicated that Zelensky must issue an apology and demonstrate a commitment to peace talks for discussions to resume. On March 4, Zelensky called the White House clash &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his willingness to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Waltz suggested on March 5 that Trump may lift the pause on military assistance once peace talks are arranged and more confidence-building measures are taken, Reuters reported. The long-debated agreement would establish a fund to which Ukraine would contribute 50% of proceeds from the future monetization of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. Ukraine previously rejected two U.S. proposals due to the absence of security guarantees, but negotiations are continuing amid mounting pressure from Washington.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-delegations-to-meet-soon-for-negotiations-zelenskys-top-aide-says/	2025-03-05T10:37:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1659182865.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly â€” Issue 16	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 16 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Feb. 24&#x2013;March 2, 2025. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Ukraine&#x2019;s Bureau of Economic Security leadership race narrows to 30 candidates The selection process for the next head of the Bureau of Economic Security (BES) has moved to the next stage, with the competition commission reviewing applications from 43 candidates. Following the initial document screening, 30 applicants have been approved to proceed, having met the formal eligibility requirements of the competition. The next phases will include skills assessments, legislative knowledge tests, and integrity checks. Ukraine passes overdue IMF-mandated judicial reform bill Ukraine&#x2019;s Parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, has approved draft law #12368-1, establishing a new judicial framework to replace the controversial Kyiv District Administrative Court (OASK). The bill, which received 234 votes in favor and was welcomed by the G7 Ambassadors, marks the fulfillment of a long-overdue International Monetary Fund structural benchmark, originally due by Dec. 31, 2024. However, the final version deviates from initial IMF recommendations, opting to create two separate courts: The High Qualification Commission of Judges (HQCJ) is required to announce a competition for judicial appointments within one month of the law&#x2019;s enactment, with international experts playing a role in the selection process for the next three years. Ukraine&#x2019;s stock market regulator adopts updated ethics code in line with IMF commitments Ukraine&#x2019;s National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC) has adopted an updated Employee Ethics Code, aligning with recent amendments to the Law on State Regulation of Capital Markets and Organized Commodity Markets. The decision was announced by NSSMC Chairman Ruslan Mahomedov via Telegram on Feb. 28. The revision is part of a structural benchmark under Ukraine&#x2019;s Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies with the IMF, with a deadline set for January 2025. According to Mahomedov, the updated code was developed in consultation with experts from the World Bank and the IMF, ensuring it meets international best practices. Ukrainian government adopts new public investment allocation mechanism On Feb. 28, 2025, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine approved a new framework for allocating public investment, aimed at prioritizing state-funded projects based on their strategic importance. The unified project portfolio will rank investment initiatives according to their relevance to Ukraine&#x2019;s national goals and regional development needs. The government has also established an Interagency Commission to oversee the distribution of state budget funds for investment projects, chaired by the Minister of Finance. The commission will include representatives from key ministries, including the economy, regional development, health, energy, and digital transformation ministries. Ukraine moves forward with $1 billion purchase of Russian-made nuclear reactors Ukraine&#x2019;s Verkhovna Rada has cleared the way for state-owned Energoatom to proceed with its $1 billion acquisition of Russian-made nuclear reactors from Bulgaria, after all blocking resolutions against draft law #11392 were rejected. The deal involves the purchase of two Rosatom reactors originally intended for the Belene Nuclear Power Plant in Bulgaria, to be used for the construction of reactor units No.3 and No. 4 at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant. While the legislation allowing the purchase has been approved, Energoatom still lacks the necessary parliamentary authorization for the actual construction of the new units. Ukrainian law enforcements raid leading pharmaceutical plants amid pricing probe National Police of Ukraine conducted raids on three of the country&#x2019;s largest pharmaceutical manufacturers on Feb. 28, &#x201C;Economichna Pravda&#x201D; reported. According to the National Police statement, raids were a part of ongoing criminal investigations. The searches follow a recent decision by Ukraine&#x2019;s National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) to introduce drug price regulations, cutting the cost of essential medications by 30% from March 1, 2025. The NSDC had also recommended that law enforcement agencies intensify efforts to combat price manipulation and financial abuses in the pharmaceutical sector.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-16/	2025-03-05T09:52:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2197731140.jpg
Ukraine, EU drafting plan for first steps toward lasting peace, Zelensky says	Ukraine and Europe are working on a plan for the first steps toward a just and sustainable peace as Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion enters its fourth year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 5. &quot;We are preparing a plan of first steps to bring about a just and sustainable peace. We are working on it quickly. It will be ready soon,&quot; he wrote on Telegram. Zelensky will participate in a special European Council meeting on March 6, where EU leaders are expected to discuss continued support for Ukraine as well as security guarantees for a lasting peace. The president said in his Telegram post that he had discussed the plan with with Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob, briefing him on the recent leaders&apos; summit in London and joint European efforts. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosted a summit on March 2, gathering key Western leaders, including Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, to coordinate support for Ukraine. Zelensky wrote on Telegram that Europe has a common vision for ending Russia&apos;s war and securing long-term stability. &quot;It should be at the table of future negotiations together with Ukraine and the United States,&quot; he added. The statement comes as U.S. and Russian officials held talks in Istanbul on Feb. 27, following their initial meeting in Riyadh on Feb. 18. The discussions, part of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s push for a swift peace deal, have raised concerns in Kyiv and Europe that Washington is sidelining its allies. Zelensky&apos;s remarks follow a dramatic shift in U.S. foreign policy, with Trump echoing Kremlin narratives and accusing the Ukrainian president of prolonging the war. Washington has frozen all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, a move widely seen as an attempt to pressure Kyiv into talks with Russia. Earlier, the Ukrainian president proposed initial steps toward peace, including releasing prisoners and a ceasefire in the air and sea.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-eu-drafting-plan-for-first-steps-toward-lasting-peace-zelensky-says/	2025-03-05T09:46:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/03/e6616e5fc8719714246c2f23f2404b17_1679921770_extra_large.jpeg
Zelensky to take part in special European Council meeting on March 6	President Volodymyr Zelensky will take part in a special meeting of the European Council on March 6, a senior EU official confirmed to the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We are living in a defining moment for Ukraine and European security,&quot; European Council President Antonio Costa said ahead of the summit. Discussions will focus on strengthening support for Ukraine as Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion enters its fourth year. Participants will also discuss &quot;European contributions to the necessary security guarantees required to ensure a lasting peace in Ukraine,&quot; the European Council said in a statement on its website. EU leaders are also expected to adopt a communique reaffirming that European security cannot be negotiated without European participation, Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne reported. The meeting follows growing concerns in Kyiv and European capitals over U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s diplomatic outreach to Russia, including direct talks between American and Russian officials in Istanbul on Feb. 27 and Riyadh on Feb. 18. Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and other senior Western officials gathered in London on March 2 for a summit hosted by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to coordinate Ukraine policy. Zelensky arrived in London on March 1 following a turbulent visit to Washington, where a planned natural resources agreement with the U.S. collapsed after a tense Oval Office exchange with Trump. The fallout has fueled speculation about the future of U.S.- Ukraine relations. Washington has frozen all military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv, a move widely seen as an attempt to pressure Zelensky into talks with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-take-part-in-special-european-council-meeting-on-march-6/	2025-03-05T09:10:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190701439.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup â€” Dark days for Ukraine	The following is the March 4, 2025 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. This week&#x2019;s newsletter was originally going to be about the Trump&#x2013;JD Vance&#x2013;President Volodymyr Zelensky clash in the Oval Office and the subsequent collapse of the minerals deal &#x2014; itself a shocking turn of events after weeks of tense negotiations. But then, apparently as punishment for Zelensky not being &#x201C;grateful enough,&#x201D; as Vance put it, or as Trump and others have said, for &#x201C;not being ready for peace,&#x201D; reports sufaced the U.S. was halting military aid to Ukraine. Understandably, Ukrainians were outraged at the decision &#x2014; we did a piece collecting reactions. Read it here. The freeze reportedly goes into effect immediately, impacting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition and affecting not only future aid but also weapons already in transit. One of the most worrying aspects of the freeze in the immediate future is how Ukraine will replace the U.S.-provided air defense missiles that help protect Ukrainian cities from Russian aerial attacks. Beyond the shock of the U.S. pulling its support for Ukraine at a time like this, the impact of Ukraine being unable to protect its skies could have repercussions that extend for generations. Less protection means more civilian deaths and more damage to infrastructure. A less safe Ukraine means more people will flee abroad, which puts strain on both Europe&apos;s and Ukraine&#x2019;s economies. That&#x2019;s fewer people in Ukraine to help with recovery efforts post-war. Further damage to infrastructure means higher costs to rebuild. But the loss of the U.S. &#x2014; the world&#x2019;s largest military superpower &#x2014; as an ally runs the risk of a Russian victory in Ukraine and, ultimately, the disappearance of Ukraine itself. And what would that mean for the world? Truth be told, it saddens me to have to repeat points I&#x2019;ve made in this newsletter and elsewhere since the start of the full-scale invasion, but apparently, the world needs reminding. Ukraine&#x2019;s grain exports feed millions of people around the world. If those exports stop, even temporarily, people will be left without food, and prices will rise &#x2014; all over the world. It happened at the start of the war and can happen again. Millions &#x2014; yes, millions &#x2014; of Ukrainian refugees would flee across the border into Europe, causing a crisis. I hardly doubt any European country is ready for it. Russia would be in possession of all of Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources, and all those &#x201C;minerals&#x201D; everyone has been talking about would go to benefit Vladimir Putin and his cronies; it would be in control of the military-industrial complex that has been created in Ukraine over the last three years. Russia would be richer and stronger, and the world would be less safe. One thing that can and should be done to counteract the Trump administration&#x2019;s move away from Ukraine and toward Russia &#x2014; Europe must fully seize the some $200 billion of frozen Russian assets and send them to Ukraine. Markets have responded to the Zelensky-Trump-Vance showdown, with Ukraine&apos;s international bonds falling to their lowest point in over a month on March 3 as optimism wanes around a quick end to the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported. According to Tradeweb data cited by Reuters, the 2036 maturity experienced the steepest decline, dropping 4.5 cents to 60.775 cents on the dollar and reaching a one-month low. Bonds tied to economic performance declined the most, with trading activity remaining high, one trader told Reuters. &quot;The new U.S. administration calls for pessimism,&quot; Paul McNamara at GAM told Reuters. &quot;I see no economic reason to invest.&quot; Read more here. Ukraine&apos;s National Police conducts searches at one of the country&apos;s largest pharmaceutical companies on Feb. 28, 2025. (Ukraine&apos;s National Police / Facebook)Storm brewing?Late last week, on Feb. 28, just before Vance and Trump ambushed Zelenksy in the Oval Office, three of Ukraine&#x2019;s major pharmaceutical companies experienced their own unpleasant surprise. Ekonomichna Pravda reported, citing its source, that Ukraine&apos;s National Police had conducted searches at the offices and employee homes of Ukrainian pharmaceutical giants Arterium, Farmak, and Darnytsia. &quot;Those who are conducting searches are requesting information that could be obtained by simply sending a request. Everything is reminiscent of the &#x201C;Mazepa case,&#x201D; the source told EP. The &#x201C;Mazepa case&#x201D; in question refers to Ukrainian investor and businessman Ihor Mazepa, who in early 2024 was yanked out of his car at the border with Poland and searched by the police, while his accounts were frozen. It was widely considered punishment for speaking out against heavy-handed treatment by law enforcement on businesses. Why the raids? It&#x2019;s not exactly clear yet. Zelensky&#x2019;s administration could be putting pressure on the industry after he ordered the government to do something about &#x201C;unreasonably high drug prices&#x201D; in Ukraine. After Zelensky&#x2019;s statement about pricing, the government capped the markup of drug prices at 35% for over-the-counter drugs, and the Health Ministry announced that the price of the 100 most popular drugs would come down by 30% on March 1. KMPG UkraineM&amp;A: Staying the courseIn other news &#x2014; M&amp;A deals in 2024 showed relative stability despite the war, with the total volume of deals, 49, equal to that of 2023 and a disclosed total deal value of around $1.1 billion, KMPG said in a recent report. &#x201C;Despite a 15.7% decline in total overall deal value, adjusted figures that exclude exceptionally large transactions indicate a 40.5% increase,&#x201D; the Kyiv-based accounting firm wrote. Ukrainian capital staying in the country due to wartime currency restrictions, war risk insurance mechanisms, and government-led infrastructure recovery initiatives have all contributed to continued M&amp;A activity. It has also been helped along by Ukraine&#x2019;s privatization efforts, which delivered record revenues of Hr 12 billion ($300 million) in 2024, KMPG said in its report. Read the full report here. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has lowered its 2025 growth forecast for Ukraine&#x2019;s economy, now expecting 3.5% growth instead of the previously projected 4.7%. The downgrade comes as inflation accelerates due to the ongoing war, which reached 12% in December. After the London-based bank announced it had started offering some services in Ukraine on Feb. 11, Ukraine&#x2019;s central bank came out and said Revolut had not obtained the proper licence to do so. Revolut has denied any wrongdoing, saying that it is merely offering EU accounts to Ukrainian residents on a cross-border basis and that it does not plan to open Ukrainian accounts without further authorization. Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy company, DTEK, is in talks with several suppliers for a two-year liquefied natural gas import contract into the country, CEO Maxim Timchenko said in an interview at IE Week in London, Bloomberg reported. In June 2024, DTEK signed the first major deal with U.S. Venture Global to supply LNG to Ukraine for two years. It was the first time Ukraine purchased U.S. LNG directly. This figure includes direct and indirect damage caused by disrupted logistics, increased fertilizer and fuel costs, expenses for land reclamation and demining, and occupied territories, Agriculture Minister Vitalii Koval said on Feb. 25 during a World Bank report presentation. The agricultural sector plays a vital role in Ukraine&apos;s economy, comprising approximately 20% of the country&apos;s GDP.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-business-roundup-dark-days-for-ukraine/	2025-03-05T09:02:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201830448.jpg
How Trumpâ€™s Ukraine peace plan could backfire	U.S. President Donald Trump entered the White House promising to bring a swift end to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and his first few weeks in office have proven he&#x2019;s determined to follow through. While his endeavour to fulfil a campaign promise in itself is not too surprising, the way he is approaching the issue has stunned not only Ukraine, but also the U.S.&#x2019;s long-term global allies, who are now scrambling to adjust to a world in which Washington cannot be viewed as a reliable security partner. The Kyiv Independent spoke to George Barros, Russia team lead at the Institute for the Study of War, who explains why America&#x2019;s global adversaries will be &#x201C;salivating&#x201D; at what is currently unfolding on the global stage.	https://kyivindependent.com/how-trumps-ukraine-peace-plan-could-backfire/	2025-03-05T07:58:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_0406.jpg
70% of Americans say Ukraine is not to blame for war with Russia, poll shows	An overwhelming majority of Americans do not believe Ukraine is more to blame for the war waged against it by Russia, according to an Ipsos poll published by Reuters on March 5. The poll follows a dramatic shift in U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump, who has echoed Kremlin narratives, initiated direct talks with Moscow while excluding Kyiv, and accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of prolonging the war. According to the survey, 70% of adults surveyed disagreed with the statement &quot;Ukraine is more to blame for starting the war.&quot; Seven percent agreed. Among Democratic respondents, 81% rejected the idea that Ukraine was to blame, while 62% of Republicans shared that stance. The poll was conducted among 1,174 U.S. adults between March 3-4 and comes amid heightened tensions between Washington and Kyiv following the contentious Feb. 28 Oval Office meeting between Trump, Zelensky, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance. The talks, originally intended to finalize a mineral deal between the two countries, ended in a public dispute, leading to the cancellation of the agreement. Since the meeting, some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have escalated their criticism of Zelensky, with some even suggesting he should resign. Washington has also frozen all military aid to Ukraine, a move widely seen as an attempt to pressure Kyiv into peace talks with Moscow. Additionally, the U.S. has halted intelligence sharing with Ukraine, threatening its ability to strike Russian targets, CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed to Fox Business on March 5.	https://kyivindependent.com/70-of-americans-say-ukraine-is-not-to-blame-for-war-with-russia-poll-shows/	2025-03-05T07:56:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2147987555-1.jpg
Drone coalition mobilizes over $2 billion to boost Ukraine's defense, ministry says	The drone coalition has received over 2 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in assistance from partners in the first year of its operation, the Defense Ministry announced on March 5. The allied initiative, co-headed by the U.K. and Latvia, was launched in January 2024 to bolster Ukraine&apos;s arsenal of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which became a crucial capability on the battlefield. Nearly 20 countries joined the coalition as of late 2024. &quot;The main goal of the coalition is to provide the Ukrainian Defense Forces with drones and strengthen the defense industry of Ukraine and partner countries to create a technological advantage over... (Russia) in the long term,&quot; the statement read.Kyiv employs long-range drones to strike deep into Russian territory, targeting military infrastructure such as airfields, oil refineries, and logistical hubs. On Feb. 9, the Defense Ministry launched the &quot;Drone Line&quot; initiative to accelerate drone deployment on the battlefield. Ukraine has also developed long-range missile-drone hybrids, such as the Palianytsia and Peklo models, featuring turbojet engines as alternatives to cruise missiles. President Volodymyr Zelensky has set a target of producing at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/drone-coalition-receives-over-2-billion-from-partners-to-boost-ukraines-defense-ministry-says/	2025-03-05T05:50:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2152788960.jpg
Trump may resume Ukraine aid after further progress toward peace, White House says	U.S. President Donald Trump may lift the pause on military support for Ukraine once peace talks are arranged and more confidence-building measures are taken, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said on March 5, according to Reuters. Trump paused all military assistance and, reportedly, intelligence sharing earlier this week after his public spat with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, derailing plans to sign a bilateral deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources. White House officials signaled that Zelensky must issue an apology and demonstrate readiness for peace to get the talks back on track. On March 4, the Ukrainian president made a statement in which he called the quarrel &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his commitment to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Waltz called the statement a &quot;good, positive first step.&quot; Similarly, Trump voiced appreciation for Zelensky&apos;s words and mentioned the statement in his address to Congress. &quot;I think if we can nail down these negotiations and move towards these negotiations, and in fact, put some confidence-building measures on the table, then the president will take a hard look at lifting this pause,&quot; Waltz said on the Fox &amp; Friends program, according to Reuters. According to Trump&apos;s aide, officials are leading talks on a specific date, location, and team for the negotiations. Ukraine has repeatedly stressed that security guarantees that would prevent Russia from resuming its aggression at a later date are a necessary condition for any peace talks. The Trump administration has retorted that the minerals deal is a security commitment of its own and pushed to broker a quick resolution between Kyiv and Moscow. Zelensky reaffirmed his readiness to sign the deal in his statement on March 4, but CBS News reported that parameters are still unclear as Trump seeks better terms.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-may-resume-ukraine-aid-after-further-steps-toward-peace-confidence-building-white-house-says/	2025-03-05T05:41:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2200263755.jpg
Russia jails British volunteer fighting for Ukraine for 19 years	A Russian court sentenced James Scott Rhys Anderson, a British volunteer who was fighting for Ukraine in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, to 19 years in prison, independent outlet Mediazona reported on March 5. Footage of Anderson, 22, in Russian captivity emerged in November 2024. Russian authorities later confirmed that the British national was in their custody. The court sentenced Anderson on &quot;terrorism&quot; and &quot;mercenarism&quot; charges. Russia often portrays foreign volunteers fighting for Ukraine as &quot;mercenaries&quot; and claims they are not entitled to protection as prisoners of war. The British volunteer is to spend the first five years in prison and the rest of the term in a high-security penal colony. The court considered Anderson&apos;s case in a closed session. A soldier of the Ukrainian Armed Forces who served in the same unit as the U.K. national was allegedly brought in as a witness. Anderson pleaded guilty, according to the court. It is unclear whether the confession was forced, as Ukrainian officials and human rights groups pointed to widespread cases of abuse and torture of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POW) and captive civilians by Russia. Russia accused Anderson of &quot;illegally crossing the border&quot; into Kursk Oblast in mid-November in 2024 and committing &quot;criminal actions against civilians.&quot; The claims could not be verified, and Moscow has sentenced a number of Ukrainian POWs and volunteer fighters on similar charges without providing evidence. Two other Brits, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, were captured by Russian forces in Mariupol in 2022 and sentenced to death before being released in a prisoner exchange.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-jails-british-volunteer-fighting-for-ukraine-for-19-year/	2025-03-05T05:23:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-05-14_51_21.jpeg
Ukraine destroys Russian long-range surveillance system, shows combat footage	Drones of the Ukrainian Hart Brigade&apos;s Falcon unit destroyed a Russian Murom-M long-range surveillance system near the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces said on March 5. Vovchansk is an embattled town some 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv that has seen heavy battles since Russia launched a new offensive in the area in May 2024. Russian forces &quot;were not saved by the anti-drone net that covered it (Murom-M) from all sides. The first two &apos;birds&apos; of the Falcon pilots punched a hole in it, and the third finally destroyed the system,&quot; the statement read. 0:00/1&#xD7;The Hart Brigade reportedly destroyed the Russian Murom-M long-range surveillance system near the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces said on March 5, 2025. (Khortytsia group of forces/Telegram)Russian troops and a vehicle used to transport infantry and ammunition to their positions came under attack in the same area, the Khortytsia group of forces said. Throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing the way wars are fought. For outnumbered Ukrainian forces, drones have been one of the key weapons to strike Russian warships, naval bases, oil refineries, and airfields inside occupied territories and deep behind Russia&apos;s lines.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-forces-destroy-russian-long-range-surveillance-system-show-combat-footage/	2025-03-05T05:12:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-05-at-14_17_52.png
Why doesn't Zelensky wear a suit?	When President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived at the White House on Feb. 28 to discuss ending the war that had inflicted tremendous tragedy on his country since its escalation in 2022, he was asked a question he likely least expected to hear at such a critical moment. &quot;Why don&apos;t you wear a suit?&quot; &quot;You&apos;re at the highest level in this country&apos;s office, and you refuse to wear a suit,&quot; Brian Glenn, the chief White House correspondent for the right-wing Real America&apos;s Voice TV channel, asked Zelensky during his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. &quot;Do you own a suit?&quot; Glenn continued. &quot;A lot of Americans have problems with you not respecting the office.&quot; It was no coincidence that Glenn was the one asking this not only inappropriate but also extremely disrespectful question. Glenn is considered to be one of the favorite reporters of Trump and his supporters. He appeared to be merely mirroring Trump&#x2019;s irritation with Zelensky&#x2019;s outfit, which he had made clear just shortly before, while meeting Zelensky outside the White House upon arrival. &quot;You&apos;re all dressed up today,&#x201D; Trump said to a wartime leader. On that day, Zelensky was wearing a simple all-black outfit, in line with his wartime style that he had adopted on Feb. 24, 2022, when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Oval Office meeting between Zelensky and Trump led to a heated argument after an invited interference of U.S. Vice President JD Vance, resulting in the cancellation of a planned mineral deal and Trump&#x2019;s decision to halt all military aid for Ukraine on March 3. But amid a major U.S. foreign policy shift &#x2013; abandoning allies and aligning with a longtime adversary, Russia &#x2013; Glenn&#x2019;s suit question continued to make headlines and receive reactions on social media in the ensuing days. According to Zoya Zvynyatskivska, a Ukrainian fashion historian, comments about clothing are never the cause but rather the result of someone&apos;s prejudice and dislike, and it is impossible to dress in a way that would change that attitude. &#x201C;In Trump&apos;s mind, there is no war. Everything has already ended,&quot; Zvynyatskivska told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;If Zelensky takes off his military-style outfit and puts on a suit, what does that mean? It means he agrees that the war is over.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky meet in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, DC, U.S. on Feb. 28, 2025. (Andrew Harnik / Getty Images)&quot;Yes, Zelensky dresses demonstratively. But the only message he wants to convey with his clothing is: &apos;In my country, there is a war,&apos;&quot; Zvynyatskivska says. &quot;Everyone wants to forget. Everyone wants to move on. But he keeps reminding them.&quot; In response to Glenn&#x2019;s question, Zelensky said, &quot;I will wear a costume after this war will finish.&quot; &quot;Maybe something like yours, yes. Maybe something better, I don&apos;t know,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe something cheaper.&quot; Following the meeting, Axios reported, citing two anonymous sources, that Trump&apos;s advisers told Zelensky&apos;s team multiple times that it would be more respectful for Ukraine&apos;s leader to &quot;ditch his military-style attire&quot; when visiting the White House. &quot;One small but not insignificant factor&quot; that irritated Trump was the fact that Zelensky ultimately did not wear a suit, Axios reported. The last time Zelensky was seen in a suit was in his video address shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the start of the full-scale invasion in the early hours of Feb. 24, 2022. In his next address later that day, Zelensky appeared in a khaki T-shirt. The next morning, he wore a fleece pullover of the same color for his morning address. Since then, he has mostly been wearing military-style attire, only swapping it for a vyshyvanka &#x2014; a traditional Ukrainian embroidered shirt &#x2014; on holidays or special occasions. &quot;We all know that his life was already in danger on the very first day (of the full-scale invasion). Leaders of other countries even offered him evacuation, but he refused,&quot; Zvyniatskovska says. &quot;He was already wearing a bulletproof vest and comfortable clothing underneath it because, at that moment, his life was in danger.&quot; Even when Ukrainian troops liberated Kyiv Oblast in the spring of 2022 and the danger to his life was seemingly not as immediate, Zelensky chose to stick to simple military-style garments &#x201C;in solidarity with the people who are fighting,&#x201D; says Zvyniatskovska. &quot;He&apos;s not wearing military uniform,&quot; she says. &quot;But wearing khaki clothing that is convenient and hints at what is happening in your country &#x2014; I believe this is a beautiful, powerful non-verbal statement that reminds everyone who meets him (about the war in Ukraine).&quot; Left top: Pope Francis meets with President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Studio of Paul VI Hall in Vatican City on May 13, 2023.

(Aaron Chown / Pool / Getty Images)Zelensky has said numerous times that he would wear a suit only after Ukraine wins the war. In the documentary by Ukrainian journalist and TV host Dmytro Komarov called &quot;A Year,&quot; Zelensky even showed the blazer he plans to wear on Ukraine&apos;s victory day. &quot;It&apos;s a symbol. It means that the war will be over soon, we will win soon, and we all will wear suits again,&quot; Zelensky said. During the latest Oval Office meeting, Zelensky wore an all-black ensemble, including a polo shirt by the Ukrainian brand Damirli, adorned with a trident &#x2014; Ukraine&apos;s coat of arms. On Instagram, the brand wrote that the polo Zelensky wore is &quot;not merely a garment &#x2014; it is the uniform of a modern warrior, a symbol of the unbreakable spirit of a nation standing for its freedom.&quot; &quot;History remembers leaders whose choice of clothing became part of their fight and a reflection of their era,&quot; Damirli wrote. &quot;Yes, it&apos;s not a suit, but it&apos;s a kind of intermediate option. I think he really demonstrated respect,&quot; Zvyniatskovska says. &quot;Very modest, beautiful outfit in black, restrained color, no khaki.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s team, including Presidential Office Head Andriy Yermak who was wearing a suit on Feb. 28, adhered to the White House&apos;s formal dress code. &quot;They dressed according to the standard for an international event,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;Everyone on the team was dressed perfectly appropriately.&quot; But Zelensky&apos;s outfit was &quot;symbolic,&quot; it was a statement, according to Zvyniatskovska. Zelensky is not the first wartime leader to disregard official dress code during high-profile visits or meetings. The Ukrainian president is now often compared with U.K. Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who, during World War II, also chose not to wear a suit during his visit to the White House in January 1942. Then-British Prime Minister Winston Churchill outside the White House, wearing his &quot;siren suit,&quot; on Jan. 17, 1942. (Hulton Archive / Getty Images)A photo of him dressed in a &quot;siren suit,&quot; a practical one-piece garment designed for air raids, went viral following the latest Oval Office clash. &quot;Zvyniatskovska says history offers many examples of people &#x2014; like Mother Teresa &#x2014; who chose to wear signature outfits as statements, even at high-profile events.&quot; &quot;He&apos;s not the first person in the 21st century to break standard etiquette rules to convey their message,&quot; Zvyniatskovska says, adding that Zelensky was wearing the same polo during his meeting with King Charles III in the U.K. on March 2. &quot;And everything went fine,&quot; she says. &quot;So it&apos;s not the clothing that is the problem.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s decision to stick to his wartime style during the Oval Office meeting gained significant support in Ukraine. When The Kyiv Independent asked people on the streets of Kyiv whether Zelensky should have worn a suit, the majority of respondents felt he made the right choice not to. &quot;As far as I remember, America supports freedom so, in my opinion, everyone can wear what they want,&quot; Stanislav Rakitin told the Kyiv Independent. Ukrainian soldier Vadym, who is stationed near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, told the Kyiv Independent that he, too, supports Zelensky&#x2019;s symbolic choice.

(Dursun Aydemir / Anadolu Agency / Getty Images)&quot;His position that he&apos;s at war and not into suits seems reasonable to me,&quot; he says. &#xA0; &quot;The fact that they&apos;ve been nitpicking about his clothing only shows their pitifulness. There&apos;s no need to apologize for anything. They&apos;re just nitpicking. They&apos;re looking for a reason. No one in the world said a word about it. (Former U.S. President Joe) Biden didn&apos;t say anything.&quot; &#xA0; Ukrainian journalist and soldier Petro Shuklinov says that Zelensky&apos;s attire not only sends a message to the world but also to his own soldiers, emphasizing: &#x201C;I am here to bring weapons. I am here to bring security. My country is at war, and I represent my country. I cannot do otherwise.&apos;&quot; &quot;I didn&apos;t vote for him, but for me, the president is an institution. And now, wherever he is, he represents me, my country, and all our people. Criticizing him is criticizing me. And if anyone wants to make a remark to me, I invite them to come to Ukraine,&quot; Shuklinov said. Hi, this is Daria Shulzhenko, the author of this story. After watching the now infamous Oval Office meeting multiple times, I can say this: No matter what President Volodymyr Zelensky wore that day, the outcome would have been the same. It was never about his outfit &#x2014; it was about how he was treated. But I hope this piece serves as a reminder that Ukrainian soldiers are the ones fighting the hardest battle for freedom right now. And as you can see, they have no issue with what he wears. While they are on the battlefield, we are making sure their voices are heard around the world. So please consider supporting our reporting.	https://kyivindependent.com/why-doesnt-zelensky-wear-a-suit/	2025-03-05T04:36:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Artboard-1.jpg
US halts intelligence sharing with Ukraine, FT reports	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. The U.S. has halted intelligence sharing with Kyiv, threatening Ukraine&apos;s ability to strike Russian targets amid the full-scale war, the Financial Times (FT) reported on March 5, citing undisclosed sources. The reported move follows Washington&apos;s decision to freeze all military aid supplies to Ukraine following a public spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. There have been conflicting claims as to whether this also concerns intelligence sharing, a crucial capability that allows Ukraine to strike Russian targets. The British tabloid Daily Mail previously reported that the U.S. banned the U.K. from sharing Washington-obtained intelligence with Kyiv. Ukrainian and U.S. officials have not confirmed the claims, which could not be independently verified.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-halts-intelligence-sharing-with-ukraine-ft-reports/	2025-03-05T04:26:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1494251877.jpg
Russia's oil, gas budget revenue in February drops by 18% year-on-year	Russia&apos;s budget revenue from oil and gas trade in February decreased by 18% year-on-year and by 2.3% compared to January, Reuters reported on March 5, citing Russian Finance Ministry data. Oil and gas revenues last month amounted to 771.3 billion rubles ($8.6 billion), a significant drop from 945.6 billion rubles ($10.5 billion) in February 2024 and a moderate decrease in comparison to 789.1 billion rubles ($8.8 billion) in January 2025. The news underscores Russia&apos;s economic woes amid its full-scale war against Ukraine and the heavy Western sanctions imposed since 2022. Oil and gas exports, which have traditionally represented a significant portion of Russia&apos;s federal budget revenue and play a key role in sustaining its war economy, have been particularly targeted by Western economic restrictions. The previous U.S. Biden administration rolled out several waves of sanctions against Russia&apos;s oil and gas industry and its &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of tankers, most recently in January. The EU, which has traditionally been the primary buyer of Russian fossil fuels, sought to pivot away from Russian supplies while Ukraine has launched a campaign of long-range drone strikes against Russia&apos;s energy facilities. In spite of this, fossil fuel exports continue to be crucial in feeding Russia&apos;s war chest, representing about 30% of the country&apos;s federal revenue last year. Moscow has managed to redirect much of its sales to other major markets, such as China and India. A February study also showed that while EU countries spent about $20.3 billion in military support for Ukraine in 2024, they bought Russian fossil fuels worth about $23.5 billion in the same period. The future of sanctions against Russia also remains uncertain as the new Trump administration, which has adopted a more amicable stance toward Moscow, floated the idea of sanctions relief as part of peace efforts. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-oil-gas-revenue-in-february-drops-by-18-year-on-year/	2025-03-05T03:50:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
Minsk could be best place for trilateral talks between Russia, US, Ukraine, Kremlin says	Minsk could be the best place to host potential trilateral talks between the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Russian news agency Interfax on March 5. Peskov&apos;s statement follows a proposal by Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko to host U.S. President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for peace talks. &quot;This issue has not been brought up or discussed in any way. But, of course, Minsk is the best place for us. It is our main ally, so it is the best place for negotiations,&quot; Peskov said. According to Peskov, the Kremlin is &quot;positive&quot; about Zelensky&apos;s stated readiness to &quot;come to the negotiating table.&quot; In a statement on March 4, the Ukrainian president said that he and his team &quot;stand ready to work under President Trump&#x2019;s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts.&quot; He went on to propose the release of prisoners and a partial truce in the air and sea as first steps toward a peace deal. Zelensky&apos;s overture came days after his public clash with Trump in the Oval Office and after the U.S. paused all military aid to pressure Ukraine to talks. &quot;The question is with whom to sit (at the negotiating table). So far, there is still a legal prohibition for the Ukrainian president to negotiate with the Russian side. Therefore, in general, the approach is positive, but the nuances have not yet changed,&quot; Peskov added. Trump&apos;s recent stance on Ukraine, including his public rebuke of Zelensky and reported halt on U.S. military aid to Kyiv, has drawn praise from Russian officials while raising concerns among European allies. Since taking office, Trump has distanced the U.S. from its traditional role as Ukraine&apos;s primary supporter, instead questioning Kyiv&apos;s commitment to peace and implying that Ukraine shares blame for the ongoing war. Trump, echoing Kremlin rhetoric on the war in Ukraine, said at the end of February the country should &quot;forget&quot; about joining NATO, which the country sees as a security guarantee against a future Russian invasion. Russia has repeatedly presented NATO expansion as a &quot;justification&quot; for the war. The U.S. also voted alongside Russia on Feb. 24 against a U.N. resolution that condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/minsk-could-be-best-place-for-trilateral-talks-between-russia-us-ukraine-kremlin-says/	2025-03-05T03:35:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245735181.jpeg
US military aid freeze remains in place so far despite Zelensky's statement, WSJ reports	The pause on U.S. military assistance for Ukraine will remain in place until U.S. President Donald Trump decides that President Volodymyr Zelensky supports peace talks with Russia, the Wall Street Journal reported on March 5, citing undisclosed U.S. official sources. The sources reportedly said it remains unclear whether Zelensky&apos;s recent statement, in which he affirmed commitment to peace and called his public spat with Trump &quot;regrettable,&quot; would be enough to restart the U.S. aid. Relations between Kyiv and Washington have been tense in recent weeks, especially after Zelensky, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance entered into a heated argument in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. The spat, after which the U.S. leaders berated Zelensky as &quot;ungrateful&quot; and not &quot;ready for peace,&quot; derailed the signing of a natural resources agreement and preceded the Trump administration&apos;s decision to freeze all military assistance flowing to Ukraine. Officials from Trump&apos;s team, including his special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, privately stressed to Zelensky the need to mend the rift quickly before Trump&apos;s address to Congress on March 4, CNN reported, citing sources. The U.K. government has also reportedly played a major role in convincing Zelensky. According to the Telegraph, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the Ukrainian president on March 4 to urge him to back Trump&apos;s mineral agreement and relay what the U.S. president wished to hear. After Zelensky published his statement on social media, Trump voiced appreciation for his words but made no direct comment on the aid freeze. The New York Times also reported that the aid freeze remains in place at the moment. While U.S. officials stressed that the signing of the mineral deal is not fully off the table, it remains unclear when and if it will be signed. CBS News reported that Trump is currently seeking a &quot;bigger, better deal&quot; with Ukraine instead.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-military-aid-freeze-remains-in-place-so-far-despite-zelenskys-statement-wsj-reports/	2025-03-05T02:38:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203348355--1-.jpg
Utterly staggered' â€” Trump's Ukraine military aid freeze threatens the world order, expert says	A decision by the White House to suspend all military aid to Ukraine has stunned Kyiv and its European allies, throwing the very future of the established world order into doubt. &quot;I&apos;m utterly staggered. It&apos;s just extraordinary,&quot; Timothy Ash, associate fellow at the Chatham House&#x2019;s Russia and Eurasia Programme, told the Kyiv Independent on March 4. &quot;It&apos;s almost like the collapse of the Soviet Union if you think of the scale of what we&apos;re seeing now, it&apos;s utterly remarkable.&quot; Ash said the implications of the military aid freeze, as well as U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s hostile rhetoric towards President Volodymyr Zelensky in recent weeks, will have profound implications not only for Ukraine, but the entire world. The Kyiv Independent: What&apos;s your initial reaction to the U.S. freezing military aid to Ukraine? Timothy Ash: Well, it&apos;s very disappointing and sad. I guess one conclusion from the White House meeting on Friday was that clearly the Trump administration is in the (Russian President Vladimir) Putin camp. I mean, NATO is kind of dead. Any idea that the U.S. will provide some kind of security guarantee to NATO and any peacekeeping operation in Ukraine is&#x2026; it&apos;s pretty clear that&apos;s not going to happen. The only positive for Ukraine, I guess, is that it&apos;s clear now where it stands. It&apos;s clear where it stands in respect to the U.S. and it has to make its decisions accordingly. The Kyiv Independent: Can you place all of this historically in terms of how significant these events are that we&apos;re seeing? Timothy Ash: Well, to be honest, it&apos;s utterly shocking. The mainstay of European security since World War II has been NATO. And I think people like (U.S. Vice President) JD Vance forget that the U.S. triggered Article 5 after the 9/11 terror attack &#x2014; NATO allies rallied around the U.S. It&apos;s also interesting that over the last few hours or 24 hours at least, Vance has been criticising some European countries in terms of their military capability. That&apos;s not gone down very well in the U.K. in particular, given that the U.K. and European countries also stood behind the U.S. in Afghanistan and Iraq. I mean, we lost (635) soldiers in both conflicts. So it is simply extraordinary&#x2026; that we need to think of a new security architecture in Europe. We&apos;re seeing huge shifts, tectonic shifts in alliances that I don&apos;t think anyone could quite have imagined. This idea that the Americans and the Russians are going to ally up against the Chinese, Europe left stranded &#x2014; what&apos;s Europe going to do? I mean it&apos;s just utterly extraordinary. The penny seems to have dropped in Europe, finally. They realize that they need to increase their own defense spending and ramp up military production. Obviously, we&apos;ve had announcements this morning from (European Commission President Ursula) Von der Leyen and various European politicians in that regard. But in the end, there is a short-term gap. Years of underinvestment, years of neglect in terms of defense spending have left us dependent on the Americans. Going forward, that can&apos;t endure. We have to change. How we get through the transition period is kind of difficult. The immediate problem is obviously Ukraine &#x2014; how we help Ukraine get through this existential threat to its survival. And longer term, Europe has to see Ukraine as being pretty central to its own defense with the Americans gone. Ukraine is a very capable military force. Almost the only thing standing behind Europe and Russia at the moment is Ukraine. So how do we work better with the Ukrainians to help build our own defense? That&apos;s a huge question mark. How do I put it into perspective? I&apos;m utterly staggered. It&apos;s just extraordinary. It&apos;s almost like the collapse of the Soviet Union if you think of the scale of what we&apos;re seeing now, it&apos;s utterly remarkable. The Kyiv Independent: The collapse of the Soviet Union was a generally positive event for the West &#x2013; is it fair to say that the ramifications of this change are going to be largely negative? Timothy Ash: The collapse of the Soviet Union set in motion many of the problems that we&apos;re dealing with today. Essentially, we spent the peace dividend. We assumed we&apos;d won the Cold War. And now, those chickens are coming home to roost. But we need to move on. It&apos;s the reality. We are where we are. And it&apos;s crystal clear now that the U.S. is not a reliable partner. Europe has some leverage &#x2014; it&apos;s a big economy, $27 trillion. It has buying power. I&apos;m not worried about the finances of stepping up defense production. I&apos;m just worried about the physical challenge of actually producing and buying weapons. In the short term, you&apos;d imagine the Americans would still be willing to sell them to Europe. It would be a huge market. And then eventually, Europe will step up and will be a significant arms producer. And again, I would imagine that would give it leverage also with the Americans. If in the end, this is a hegemonic battle for supremacy between the U.S. and China, I do find it a bit ironic, or a bit strange that the Americans have decided to tag along to the Russian economy, which is a $2 trillion economy. Ultimately, I don&apos;t see Russia giving the U.S. the scale in terms of that hegemonic battle with China. Europe is the economy that can give the Americans scale. So we have leverage. We have leverage in the short term in terms of purchases of weapons, big arms procurement deals that can produce, give jobs to Trump in the U.S. economy. And then longer term, I think it&apos;s very hard for the Americans to ignore the sheer scale of the European economy and its ability to help in terms of that hegemonic battle with the Chinese. And ultimately, if the Americans decide to do something else, then Europe should look for alternatives, right? It should look to improve its relations with China, it should look for better relations with Turkey and the Gulf states &#x2014; it should diversify its own national security. The Kyiv Independent: At least in the short term, is Russia the main winner out of all that&apos;s happening at the moment? Timothy Ash: In respect to Ukraine, you&apos;ve got to think so, yes. It&apos;s extraordinary that Trump went into negotiations with Russia over Ukraine. With a strong negotiating hand &#x2014; he could have ramped up sanctions, ramped up military supplies to Ukraine, there&apos;s lots of stuff to negotiate on territory, NATO membership, and he&apos;s given everything away before there&apos;s even been any negotiations. It&apos;s quite extraordinary. The Russians must think this is manna from heaven &#x2014; they just can&apos;t believe their luck. And we&apos;ve seen that Russia is now going back to its maximalist demands, this idea of the &quot;denazification&quot; of Kyiv, which means regime change, in effect. Ukraine is not a Nazi state, it&apos;s a democracy. But the Russians like to push that kind of angle. And also the demilitarization of Ukraine, which essentially means putting limitations on Ukraine&apos;s conventional military capability and its ability to defend itself, because they want to invade again. Unfortunately, because of Trump&apos;s shenanigans, the start of the negotiations has shifted significantly east &#x2014; we could have started around NATO membership. Ukraine may not likely have been given NATO membership, but it would have given some leverage for the negotiating team from the West. And a lot of this is in the context of negotiations around this mineral deal. And there&apos;s a chance that the freezing of aid is just a temporary thing and it&apos;s all designed to strong arm Zelensky into signing this mineral deal.

(Contributor/Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Even if it is a negotiating tactic, it&apos;s causing a lot of damage. Timothy Ash: We&apos;ve already seen the damage to NATO itself. Faith and trust in NATO, trust in the U.S. as an ally has been very badly damaged. The scenes in the White House may have gone down well with some MAGA supporters in the U.S., but I think, from a world perspective, any foreign observer looking at that would say that this is just another U.S. ally that&apos;s been left down. Let down by the Americans like Afghanistan, like Iraq, like Vietnam&#x2026; there&apos;s a very long list of partners that the Americans have not stood by. I think that&apos;s very damaging to the U.S. over the long term. With the minerals deal, it seems to be the case that Trump wants a quick deal, he wants a quick win. He views the mineral deal as that. He views a ceasefire deal as a quick win. And Trump&apos;s not very good on the detail, right? I think the problem most Europeans have with the White House thinking around a ceasefire is, we&apos;ve been there before. We&apos;ve been there before with Minsk I, Minsk II &#x2013; numerous ceasefires have been broken (by the Russians). It&apos;s all pretty worrying for Ukraine. Ukraine has a good long-term outlook. Its economic position could be good with EU accession, recovery, and reconstruction bills, but it needs security. No investor will invest around this minerals deal if they don&apos;t feel Ukraine is secure. And how would you ensure security? That&apos;s the key question. The deal itself is not sufficient enough. The Kyiv Independent: Is there a chance that this could all backfire for the Trump administration? Timothy Ash: It weakens trust and confidence in the Americans. I would think Europe will be looking for alternatives. And if the Americans come asking for European help against China or another 9/11, I think Europe will say, &quot;no thank you. You made your choices on Ukraine.&quot; And mismanaging this peace process could be politically very damaging for (Trump). This could be, in terms of scale, multiple times more damaging than the disastrous U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Any deal that doesn&apos;t leave Ukraine secure could see the military collapse of Ukraine &#x2013; the social, economic, and political collapse of Ukraine &#x2013; and a complete victory of Russia over Ukraine. And I think that would be a devastating blow to European security and political, social instability also, because I think tens of millions of Ukrainians would move west. And that would be Trump&apos;s responsibility. He would have caused that. Does he care? Does he really understand any of this? I have my doubts.	https://kyivindependent.com/utterly-staggered-trumps-ukraine-military-aid-freeze-threatens-the-world-order-expert-says/	2025-03-05T02:27:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2198948272.jpg
Most French support assistance to Ukraine, sending peacekeepers, poll shows	Roughly two-thirds of the French favor maintaining or increasing aid to Ukraine and sending peacekeepers after the end of hostilities, BFM TV reported on March 4, citing a survey by the Elabe Institute. Many European leaders have reiterated their ongoing support for Ukraine amid U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s push for a swift deal to end the war. Still, some allies in Europe fear that they will have to shoulder the economic and security burdens of Ukraine&apos;s post-war recovery as the U.S. and Russia exclude them from talks on ending the war. Some 64% of respondents want France to continue providing assistance to Ukraine. Meanwhile, 20% of respondents believe that the amount of aid must be increased, and 44% think that it should be at the same level as it is now, according to the survey. Another 18% of respondents believe support must be reduced, and 17% say it should be terminated. Voters of the pro-Macron centrist coalition Ensemble, as well as the left-wing New Popular Front, are in favor of continued aid, while voters of the right-wing National Rally (FN) mostly want it reduced or terminated, BFM TV reported. France has allocated around 4.9 billion euros ($5.3 billion) in military assistance to Ukraine as of December 2024, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy said. This included Caesar howitzers, AMX-10RC armored vehicles, and Mirage 2000 jets. While ranking high in overall support, France has allocated a smaller portion of its GDP to support Ukraine than some smaller European nations, like the Netherlands, Denmark, or the Baltic countries. Though the share of those who want to continue supporting Ukraine has been growing since June 2024, three out of four respondents say they are not ready to pay more taxes for this purpose. Only 24% say they are ready to contribute. Around 68% of respondents opposed deploying French soldiers to Ukraine while the hostilities are ongoing. At the same time, 67% support sending peacekeeping troops after the signing of a peace agreement with Moscow to guarantee security and peace in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer have been spearheading the idea of deploying peacekeeping troops to Ukraine to monitor a ceasefire. Regarding NATO, 40% of respondents favored Ukraine&apos;s accession after the war, and 30% now. Some 35% of respondents favored Ukraine joining the European Union after the war, and 31% favored it now. While President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Ukraine&apos;s preferred postwar security guarantee is NATO membership, the U.S. leadership has severely undercut that aim in the past few days. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said during the Ramstein summit on Feb. 12 that Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership was not a &quot;realistic outcome&quot; of peace negotiations. He also said that a return to the country&apos;s pre-2014 borders was &quot;an unrealistic objective.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/most-french-support-continued-assistance-to-ukraine-sending-peacekeepers-media-reports/	2025-03-05T01:57:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2008845928.jpg
Merz seeks to quickly push through $3.2 billion in German aid for Ukraine	Friedrich Merz, Germany&apos;s likely next chancellor, said he wants a defense aid package for Ukraine worth roughly 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion) approved by the current, outgoing parliament, Le Monde and AFP reported on March 4. Speaking at a press conference, Merz said he plans to raise the issue with outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has opposed the package unless funded by additional government borrowing. Germany&apos;s incoming chancellor has presented extensive plans to reform debt break rules to boost defense spending as Europe is expected to take more responsibility for its security and Ukraine during the U.S. presidency of Donald Trump. Merz&apos;s conservative CDU/CSU alliance won the parliamentary elections on Feb. 23 with almost 29% of the vote. The Christian Democrats are in talks with Scholz&apos;s Social Democratic Party (SPD) on forming a new government, though the outgoing chancellor said he would not be personally part of the coalition negotiations. Germany has allocated 4 billion euros ($4.1 billion) in military support for Ukraine this year, and the additional package would raise this to 7 billion ($7.2 billion). The defense articles contained in the new assistance include three IRIS-T air defense systems, three Skyranger air defense systems, 10 howitzers, surface-to-air missiles, 20 protective vehicles, artillery shells, and drones, the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported. According to Merz, the additional aid &quot;can be approved now as off-budget expenditure.&quot; The CDU chairman has also unveiled plans for a massive defense spending boost, establishing a 500-billion-euro ($535 billion) special development and defense fund and exempting defense spending above 1% of GDP from debt break rules. As changes to debt break rules need support from two-thirds of the parliament to pass, Merz hopes to negotiate the bills&apos; passage with pro-Ukraine moderate parties in the current Bundestag as quickly as possible. In the next parliament, which must convene no later than March 25, Merz could expect stronger opposition. Roughly one-third of the seats will be held by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the Left Party (Die Linke), both of which oppose military aid for Ukraine. Germany has been Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. Berlin&apos;s role is especially important now that the Trump administration has frozen defense assistance for Ukraine, seeking to push Kyiv to the negotiating table.	https://kyivindependent.com/merz-seeks-to-quickly-push-through-3-2-billion-in-german-aid-for-ukraine/	2025-03-05T01:35:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/e99dfedf4f71ca1b5c178d4d5f33105c_1733742724_extra_large.jpeg
Ukraine natural resources deal not ready as Trump seeks better terms, CBS News reports	An agreement between Kyiv and Washington on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources is not finalized as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks a &quot;bigger, better deal,&quot; CBS News reported on March 4, citing undisclosed sources. The painstakingly negotiated deal was scheduled to be signed on Feb. 28, but that plan was derailed after a public clash between Trump and Zelensky, leaving the agreement&apos;s fate uncertain. After the U.S. froze military assistance for Kyiv, Zelensky issued a statement in which he called the spat &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his readiness to sign the minerals deal and work toward peace. Reuters reported that the deal was expected to be signed on March 4, but this claim was disputed by U.S. officials, and no agreement was concluded that day. CBS News did not clarify what terms Trump wants to see renegotiated. The long-debated agreement would establish a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the future monetization of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. The U.S. has reportedly put forth three proposals of the mineral deal, but the Ukrainian side has turned down the first two because they did not include security agreements, even as Washington ramped up the pressure. The third version was also free of concrete security commitments but included a line reading that the fund &quot;will be reinvested at least annually in Ukraine to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine.&quot; The Trump administration has been reluctant to commit to Ukraine&apos;s security, arguing that the economic agreement is a security guarantee of itself and that Europe should take responsibility for Kyiv&apos;s defense.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-minerals-deal-not-ready-as-trump-seeks-better-terms-cbs-new-reports/	2025-03-05T00:44:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202607825.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, injure 7 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed at least two civilians and injured at least seven others over the past day, regional authorities reported on March 5. Russian forces launched 181 drones from the Russian cities of Oryol, Kursk, Bryansk, Millerovo, Primorsk-Akhtarsk, and from Cape Chauda in the Russian-occupied Crimea against Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Russia also reportedly launched three Iskander M/KN-23 ballistic missiles from Voronezh Oblast and an S-300 anti-aircraft guided missile from Kursk Oblast. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 115 drones over Kharkiv, Sumy, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Odesa, and Cherkasy oblasts, the Air Force said. Another 55 drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are often decoys that Russia launches alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 29 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, one person was killed and six others were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Russian forces attacked Odesa Oblast and its regional center of Odesa with drones and ballistic missiles, according to Governor Oleh Kiper. During the attack, Russia targeted critical infrastructure in Odesa, causing power, water, and heat supply outages in the city. A Russian strike against the village of Lymanka on Odesa&apos;s outskirts killed a 77-year-old man, according to the statement. Russian aerial strikes also targeted an energy facility of Ukraine&apos;s largest private energy company, DTEK, in Odesa Oblast overnight, the company announced. This was the fourth Russian attack in two weeks on the oblast&apos;s power grid. In Donetsk Oblast, a Russian strike injured a civilian in the town of Pokrovsk, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Kharkiv Oblast, Russian forces attacked the village of Kozacha Lopan with a glide bomb, injuring a 41-year-old man, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-2-injure-7-over-past-day/	2025-03-05T00:31:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-05-09_31_48.jpeg
Zelensky, Macron, Starmer may visit Washington next week, media reports	President Volodymyr Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer might visit Washington as early as next week to present a &quot;united front&quot; on peace in Ukraine, the British tabloid Daily Mail reported on March 5, citing undisclosed diplomatic sources. The meeting would follow Zelensky&apos;s televised clash with U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, which derailed the planned signing of a mineral deal and preceded Washington&apos;s decision to halt military aid for Ukraine. Macron and Starmer, who visited Washington just days before Zelensky to sway Trump toward playing a role in Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability, have since then sought to mend the rift between Kyiv and the White House. &#xA0; On March 4, the same day he held a phone call with Starmer, Zelensky issued a statement in which he called the Oval Office clash &quot;regrettable&quot; while voicing readiness to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Zelensky also proposed initial steps toward peace, including the release of prisoners and a ceasefire in the air and sea, a proposal that was previously mentioned by Macron. During his address to Congress, Trump said he &quot;appreciates&quot; Zelensky&apos;s statement but made no direct comment on the aid freeze or the proposed truce. The leaders of Ukraine, France, and the U.K. are hoping to discuss the plan with Trump during their potential visit to Washington, the Daily Mail wrote. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Officials have not publicly commented on a possible trip of the three leaders to the U.S. The news comes as the Trump administration upends years of Washington&apos;s policy on Ukraine and Russia while casting doubt on its commitment to European security. Starmer and Macron have shaped up to be leading voices in the efforts to boost Europe&apos;s own defense capabilities and assistance for Ukraine, spearheading a plan to deploy thousands of peacekeepers in the country to monitor a potential ceasefire.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-macron-starmer-may-visit-washington-next-week-media-reports/	2025-03-04T23:59:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202256775.jpg
Russia launches counter-terrorist operation in Dagestan, kills 4, authorities claim	Russian authorities killed four militants overnight on March 5 in a counter-terrorist operation in Dagestan aimed against the Islamic State terrorist organization, Russia&apos;s National Anti-Terrorism Committee claimed. The militants &quot;were planning to commit a terrorist act at a facility of the regional administration of the Russian Interior Ministry in the (Dagestani) city of Kaspiysk,&quot; the committee said in a statement. &quot;There were no casualties among the civilian population or losses among law enforcement personnel.&quot; The statement came after reports of an attack by a group of unknown assailants against a police station in Makhachkala, the region&apos;s capital. A counter-terrorist operation was announced at 0:25 a.m. local time. Russia&apos;s predominantly Muslim Republic of Dagestan, lying in the North Caucasus, has seen a number of terrorist attacks by Islamic radicals and clashes with security forces over the past years. During one such attack in June 2024, 17 police officers and five civilians were killed, along with five perpetrators who opened fire against snagoygues and churches in the cities of Derbent and Makhachkala. Following the operation on March 5, Russian authorities claimed they had discovered grenade launchers, improvised explosive devices, grenades, machine guns, a pistol, and ammunition at the site of the skirmish and in a nearby cache. &quot;According to available data, the gang&apos;s activities were coordinated by members of the Islamic State,&quot; the committee said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Russia suffered one of its deadliest terrorist attacks in March 2024 when several assailants linked to the Islamic State opened fire in the Crocus City Hall near Moscow, killing 145 people.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-kills-4-in-counter-terrorist-operation-in-dagestan-authorities-claim/	2025-03-04T23:11:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-167533303.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 880,660 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 880,660 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on March 5. This number includes 1,250 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,256 tanks, 21,304 armored fighting vehicles, 39,512 vehicles and fuel tanks, 24,087 artillery systems, 1,306 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,094 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 27,849 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-880-660-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-03-04T22:42:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2166298605.jpg
Vance denies lack of Trump admin's pressure on Russia	U.S. Vice President JD Vance disputed on March 4 that the Trump administration was not pressuring Moscow to bring it to peace talks, arguing that the existing sanctions are straining Russia&apos;s economy. &quot;Well, I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s right, actually,&quot; Vance replied to a journalist who suggested that Washington is exerting pressure on Kyiv but not on Moscow. &quot;We still have a number of sanctions that are placed on Russians. We do believe the Russians, economically, are struggling because of this conflict.&quot; The comments came the same day that the U.S. froze crucial military assistance for Ukraine in an attempt to pressure Kyiv to the negotiating table. The decision came after a public dispute between President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and Vance in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, &#xA0;after which U.S. leaders berated the Ukrainian president for not being &quot;ready for peace&quot; and supposed lack of gratitude. The aid freeze raised concerns among Kyiv&apos;s other partners and was welcomed by the Kremlin, whose all-out war against Ukraine entered its fourth year. The U.S. has intensified diplomatic outreach to Moscow, holding two rounds of bilateral talks last month. The Trump administration has so far kept the sanctions against Russia imposed by the Biden administration in place, but the U.S. media reported that the White House is considering easing some of them as part of a peace process. &quot;We believe it is in Russia&apos;s best interest, and the United States&apos; and Ukraine&apos;s best interest, to bring this conflict to a close. We believe applying pressure to everybody to stop the killing. That&#x2019;s what the president&#x2019;s policy is,&quot; Vance said. Trump has not proposed any new sanctions against Russia and has praised his contacts with the Kremlin while adopting an increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Ukraine. Vance&apos;s comments came ahead of Trump&apos;s address to a joint session of Congress, during which the U.S. president reiterated the need to end the war as quickly as possible but made no direct mention of the aid freeze. Trump also said he appreciated Zelensky&apos;s statement in support of peace and claimed that both Russia and Ukraine are ready for talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/vance-disputes-lack-of-trump-admins-pressure-on-russia/	2025-03-04T22:36:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203259450.jpg
Lukashenko invites Trump, Zelensky, Putin to hold talks in Minsk	Minsk is prepared to host the leaders of the United States, Ukraine, and Russia for talks on ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko said in an interview on March 4. Lukashenko&apos;s remarks follow shortly after the U.S. imposed an immediate freeze on military aid to Ukraine, in a move the White House claimed was meant to pressure President Volodymyr Zelensky into entering peace negotiations. In an interview with American internet personality Mario Nawfal that aired on Belarusian state media, Lukashenko said he was willing to help U.S. President Donald Trump achieve his goal of brokering peace between Kyiv and Moscow. &quot;If you want, come here,&quot; he said, speaking to Nawfal in Minsk. &quot;It&apos;s only 200 kilometers from the Belarusian border to Kyiv. Half an hour by plane. You are welcome to come. We will sit down here. We&apos;ll come to an agreement quietly, without noise, without shouting. So tell Trump: I&apos;m waiting for him here, along with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and Zelensky. We&apos;ll sit down and calmly negotiate. If you want to make a deal.&quot; Despite the invitation, Lukashenko stressed that he did not want to act as a mediator between other nations. &quot;Most of all, I hate mediation. It means being between someone and pretending that you can do something,&quot; he said. Belarus previously hosted talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 2014 and 2015, leading to the Minsk Agreements. The agreements were meant to stop the Donbas war, triggered by Russia&apos;s invasion of eastern Ukraine in 2014. Russia violated both agreements. Two days before launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Putin declared that the Minsk Agreements &quot;no longer existed.&quot; Zelensky brought up Russia&apos;s violation of prior agreements during his Oval Office meeting with Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance, in an attempt to explain the importance of concrete security guarantees for Ukraine. Trump and Vance responded by berating Zelensky, accusing him of being ungrateful for U.S. assistance. Days later, the U.S. halted military aid to Ukraine. In a joint address to both chambers of the U.S. Congress on March 4, Trump made little mention of the decision, but said he planned to work with &quot;both sides&quot; to stop the war in Ukraine. &#xA0; Belarus remains a staunch ally of the Kremlin. While it has not committed its own troops to the battlefield in Ukraine, it allowed the Russian military to use its territory and infrastructure extensively during the launch of the full-scale invasion. Zelensky claimed on Feb. 14 that Russia is once again building up troops in Belarus, possibly in preparation for large-scale operations against NATO countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-invites-trump-zelensky-putin-to-hold-talks-in-minsk/	2025-03-04T21:14:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1257742097.jpg
Do you want to keep it going for another 5 years?' â€” Trump on aid to Ukraine	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. President Donald Trump did not directly discuss his decision to halt military aid to Ukraine in his address to a joint session of Congress on March 4. Multiple news outlets on March 3 reported that the Trump administration ordered an immediate freeze on all U.S. military aid to Ukraine. &quot;The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine&apos;s defense,&quot; Trump said. &quot;With no security, with no anything. Do you want to keep it going for another five years?&quot; That question was Trump&apos;s only nod to the suspension of aid, which a White House official said on March 4 is meant to pressure &#xA0;President Volodymyr Zelensky into peace negotiations. Trump said in his address that he &quot;appreciate(s)&quot; Zelensky&apos;s recent statements expressing Ukraine&apos;s readiness for peace, but did not say whether or not the U.S. would resume weapons deliveries. Zelensky on March 4 reiterated Ukraine&apos;s commitment to the peace process in a post on X. &quot;Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians,&quot; &#xA0;he wrote. Zelensky proposed initial steps toward de-escalation with Russia, including prisoner of war (POW) releases, a &quot;truce at sea,&quot; and a &quot;truce in the sky&quot; that would ban missiles, long-range drones, and bombs targeting civilian infrastructure. He also said Ukraine is ready to sign the critical minerals deal &quot;at any time and in any convenient format.&quot; Trump said in his address to Congress that he received that same message in a letter from Zelensky. He added that his team was seeing &quot;strong signals&quot; from Russia indicating that Moscow is ready to make peace. While Trump&apos;s remarks on Ukraine and Russia were short on details, his comments indicated that he wants Europe to foot the bill for Ukraine&apos;s defense. &quot;Europe has spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending Ukraine,&quot; he said. The decision to halt aid came on the heels of a contentious meeting in the Oval Office between Zelensky, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance. The U.S. leaders berated Zelensky for continuing to stress Ukraine&apos;s need for security guarantees, accusing him of being insufficiently grateful for American assistance. Zelensky was ordered to leave the White House, and departed without signing the much-anticipated minerals deal between the U.S. and Ukraine. Trump later claimed that Zelensky &quot;is not ready for peace.&quot; The suspension affects over $1 billion in arms and ammunition deliveries. It halts not only future aid but also weapons already in transit, including shipments on aircraft and ships, as well as equipment awaiting transfer in Poland. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed that the freeze had gone into effect, based on reports from the Ukrainian-Polish border. The White House has not specified what steps Ukraine must take to restore the flow of weapons. Trump&apos;s foreign policy moves in recent weeks signal a seismic shift in U.S. attitudes toward Ukraine, Russia, and Europe. Trump has conceded to Russian demands before negotiations even begin, initiated direct talks with Moscow while excluding Kyiv, and echoed Kremlin talking points &#x2014;&#xA0;including blaming Ukraine for starting the war and calling Zelensky a &quot;dictator.&quot; The Kremlin has applauded Trump&apos;s policy shift, saying it &quot;largely aligns&quot; with Russia&apos;s interests. Trump&apos;s address to Congress comes six weeks after the start of his second term in the White House. In a post to Truth Social late on March 3, Trump said he would use his address to &quot;tell it like it is.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-address-to-congress-aid-ukraine/	2025-03-04T19:55:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203340903.jpg
Top Democrats accuse Trump, Musk of endangering US security by siding with Russia	U.S. President Donald Trump is &quot;threatening the national security of our country,&quot; top Democratic lawmakers said in a statement issued March 4. The statement came hours before Trump is set to deliver a major address to a joint session of Congress, his first since returning to the White House on Jan. 20. &quot;Since taking office a little more than a month ago, the president has alienated nearly every international partner and ally we have, leaving us isolated in an increasingly dangerous world as Russia, North Korea, Iran, and China work together,&quot; the statement reads. &quot;We need partners and allies to effectively address the multitude of national security threats we face &#x2014; or could face. Yet, Trump has shown more alignment with Vladimir Putin, who threatens the international rules-based order, than with our long-standing partners and allies.&quot; The statement was signed by leading congressional Democrats on military, intelligence, and foreign policy committees. Its publication follows Trump&apos;s order to immediately halt all military aid to Ukraine. The statement harshly criticized the aid freeze, which it said &quot;appallingly demonstrated&quot; Trump&apos;s alliance with Moscow over Kyiv. Democrats also condemned billionaire Elon Musk for directing mass terminations of federal workers as the head of the Trump-created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The firings &quot;weakened our ability to respond to international crises,&quot; lawmakers said. The officials called on others to take action to defend U.S. security interests against threats from the administration. &quot;We are speaking out and urging others to join us before it&apos;s too late,&quot; the statement said. &quot;Because make no mistake &#x2014; this is a concerted effort by Trump and Musk to dismantle our system of government and exploit our weakness to consolidate power that benefits the very countries threatening our national security.&quot; The Trump administration&apos;s decision to suspend aid to Ukraine came on top of several recent Kremlin-friendly moves. Trump has undermined President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy, falsely blamed Ukraine for starting the war, refused to label Putin a dictator, and sent delegates to talks with Russian officials without Ukraine&apos;s participation. The White House has also been considering lifting sanctions imposed against Russia for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/top-democrats-accuse-trump-musk-of-endangering-us-security-by-siding-with-russia/	2025-03-04T17:54:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2155468554.jpg
Russiaâ€™s airlines face growing crisis as sanctions strangle aircraft maintenance	Russia&#x2019;s civilian aviation sector is facing a severe crisis as Western sanctions block access to essential spare parts and maintenance services. With more aircraft suffering mechanical failures, Russian airlines are resorting to smuggling components from the U.S. and Europe to keep their fleets in the air, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Experts warn that without a steady supply of certified parts, Russia&#x2019;s commercial planes will soon become unsafe to fly. Since December 2024, the number of aviation incidents in Russia has surged. Between Dec. 1 and Jan. 20, Russian aircraft experienced 11 engine failures&#x2014;more than double the number from the previous two months. A growing number of flights have been forced to make emergency landings, with engine and landing gear malfunctions becoming routine. Many of these incidents involve Boeing and Airbus jets, which make up two-thirds of Russia&#x2019;s commercial fleet. Sanctions have made proper maintenance nearly impossible, leaving airlines with few options. Russian carriers can either ground aircraft that require critical safety inspections, take the risk of flying without proper maintenance, or smuggle parts from the West through third countries. U.S. authorities have been cracking down on these illegal supply chains, arresting individuals involved in smuggling schemes. The latest case, announced by the U.S. Department of Justice on Feb. 13, involved three employees of Flighttime Enterprises, an Ohio-based subsidiary of a Russian aircraft parts supplier. They were accused of illegally exporting $2 million worth of aviation components to Russia. Russia has tried to develop its own domestic aircraft, but even its flagship Sukhoi Superjet relies heavily on Western components. The government has ambitious plans to produce over 1,000 aircraft by 2030, including the MC-21 model, but experts say mass production is years behind schedule. Russian manufacturers lack the technology to replace key Western-made components, particularly in engines and avionics. Facing a worsening crisis, Moscow is looking to China for help. Beijing is developing its own aircraft engines and may eventually supply Russia with alternatives. However, experts believe a reliable replacement for Western aviation technology won&#x2019;t be available until at least 2029. Until then, Russian airlines will have to continue operating aging aircraft with limited maintenance&#x2014;raising serious safety concerns for passengers flying within the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-airlines-face-growing-crisis-as-sanctions-strangle-aircraft-maintenance/	2025-03-04T16:24:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Il-Russia.jpeg
Fox News correspondent claims no Trump mineral deal planned for today	U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly told Fox News on March 4 that there are no plans to sign a mineral resources deal with Ukraine following Donald Trump&#x2019;s speech to Congress. His statement comes after earlier reports suggesting Trump intended to announce the agreement during his upcoming address. President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s Feb. 28 visit to the White House was originally intended to finalize the long-debated agreement on jointly developing Ukraine&#x2019;s mineral resources. The meeting instead turned into a public clash, with Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance berating Zelensky. The Ukrainian president later left the White House without signing the deal. Following the talks, Trump accused Zelensky of &quot;disrespecting&quot; the U.S. in the Oval Office and said the Ukrainian president &quot;is not ready for peace.&quot; U.S. President told reporters on March 3 that a proposed economic deal between the U.S. and Ukraine remained on the table, but stressed that Zelensky needed to be more &quot;appreciative&quot; of U.S. support. When asked if the deal was off, Trump replied, &quot;I don&#x2019;t think so,&quot; adding that it would be beneficial for the U.S. and criticizing former President Joe Biden for sending $300 billion to Ukraine without receiving much in return. Trump also said that to restart negotiations, Zelensky must show more gratitude for U.S. assistance. On the same day, U.S. Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick said the U.S. and Ukraine are still making progress on a key mineral agreement that could strengthen long-term economic ties and pave the way for further security assistance. &quot;This mineral deal will be signed in short order, which will lead to a strong long-term economic partnership between the United States and Ukraine, and which will ultimately and naturally lead to security assistance,&quot; Fitzpatrick wrote. He also indicated that European nations would be expected to contribute, adding that they would face mandates to step up their support.	https://kyivindependent.com/fox-news-correspondent-claims-no-trump-mineral-deal-planned-for-today/	2025-03-04T14:59:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2202062036.jpg
Eutelsat in talks to expand satellite services for Ukraine amid Starlink uncertainty, FT reports	Eutelsat, the French satellite operator that owns Starlink rival OneWeb, is negotiating with European governments to expand satellite connectivity in Ukraine. The company announced on March 4 that it is working with European institutions and business partners and has equipment ready for rapid deployment to support critical missions and infrastructure in Ukraine, according to Financial Times. These discussions come as investors speculate that Eutelsat could step in if Ukraine loses access to Elon Musk&#x2019;s Starlink system. Concerns over Starlink&#x2019;s availability escalated after the U.S. paused military aid to Ukraine on March 3. Ukraine has relied heavily on Starlink for battlefield communications, making it a crucial component of its military operations. Last week, Reuters reported that U.S. officials had raised the possibility of restricting Ukraine&#x2019;s access to the system. Musk, who owns Starlink and has influence over U.S. President Donald Trump, denied the claim, calling the report false. Shares in Eutelsat surged as much as 123% to 4.50 euro before settling at a 70% gain, driven by investor confidence that European leaders will increase military support for Ukraine. The European Commission on March 4 proposed a 150 billion euro loan package to help EU member states finance defense procurement, which could facilitate immediate military aid to Kyiv. A spokesperson for the Commission confirmed that alternatives to Starlink were under consideration. Eutelsat&#x2019;s proposal involves combining OneWeb&#x2019;s low Earth orbit satellites, positioned around 1,200 kilometers above the surface, with its geostationary satellites at 35,000 kilometers. This dual-constellation approach could provide essential connectivity for Ukraine&#x2019;s military, including drone operations that have dealt significant blows to Russian forces. OneWeb already provides services to Ukraine through a German distributor, but expanding its role would require European governments to approve procurement and integration plans. Eutelsat acknowledged that the extent of its contribution depends on Ukraine&#x2019;s military requirements, security protocols, and existing communication systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/eutelsat-in-talks-to-expand-satellite-services-for-ukraine-amid-starlink-uncertainty-ft-reports/	2025-03-04T13:56:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/------Starlings.JPG
Ukraineâ€™s DroneUA begins supplying robots to NASA	DroneUA, a Ukrainian distributor of unmanned systems, has started supplying robots to NASA, the company announced on March 4. The first test batch has already been sent to Virginia for trials, where experts will determine the most effective applications. NASA initiated the partnership, and DroneUA hopes it will lead to long-term cooperation. &quot;Testing our solutions in the United States paves the way for lasting collaboration with NASA. This proves that Ukrainian innovations are shaping the future,&quot; said Valerii Iakovenko, DroneUA&#x2019;s co-founder and managing partner. The company sees this partnership as an opportunity to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s economy and expand its presence in global markets. Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov welcomed the development, emphasizing the importance of Ukrainian manufacturers supplying equipment abroad. &quot;Ukrainian technologies are effective everywhere&#x2014;on land, in water, and even in space. I am proud of our most talented developers. You are creating an innovative future,&quot; he wrote. Fedorov noted that Russia&apos;s war has rapidly advanced Ukraine&#x2019;s defense tech sector, accelerating technological innovation at an unprecedented pace. In February, DroneUA officially registered its trademark in the United States. The company supplies drones, robots, and sensors for agriculture, energy, geodesy, and the oil and gas industry. It also develops technological solutions for data processing and unmanned system servicing.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-droneua-begins-supplying-robots-to-nasa/	2025-03-04T12:47:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1592375370.jpg
Ukraine war latest: US suspends Ukraine military aid to pressure Zelensky into talks, Trump adviser says	Key developments on March 4: The U.S. has suspended military aid to Ukraine as part of a pressure campaign to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky toward negotiations with Russia, U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s senior adviser Jason Miller told CNN on March 4. &quot;President Trump is the only person, the only person talking about stopping the killing, and sometimes leaders can use the carrot, sometimes they can use the stick,&quot; Miller said. Several media outlets reported that Trump ordered an immediate halt to all military aid to Ukraine on March 4, affecting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries. Miller claimed that Trump was using strong tactics to reinforce his demand for peace talks and that he expects Zelensky to &quot;get back to the table.&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed that American military aid had indeed been suspended, citing Polish border reports. &quot;This is an emergency,&quot; Tusk said. Polish Foreign Ministry spokesperson Pawel Wronski added that the U.S. had not consulted with any of its NATO allies before suspending the aid. The move follows a heated Oval Office meeting on Feb. 28 between Trump, Zelensky, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance, which ended with the cancelation of a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement. Since the meeting, some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have escalated their criticism of Zelensky, with some even suggesting he should resign. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, the U.S. has provided $119.8 billion in aid to Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, including $67.1 billion in military aid, $49 billion in financial aid, and $3.6 billion in humanitarian support. The U.S. and Ukraine are preparing to sign a mineral deal on March 4, according to Reuters, citing sources familiar with the matter. The sources indicated that U.S. President Donald Trump plans to announce the agreement during his upcoming address to Congress. However, they cautioned that the situation remains fluid and could still change. President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s Feb. 28 visit to the White House was originally intended to finalize the long-debated agreement on jointly developing Ukraine&#x2019;s mineral resources. The meeting instead turned into a public clash, with Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance berating Zelensky. The Ukrainian president later left the White House without signing the deal. Following the talks, Trump accused Zelensky of &quot;disrespecting&quot; the U.S. in the Oval Office and said the Ukrainian president &quot;is not ready for peace.&quot; Zelensky later called the fallout &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed Ukraine&#x2019;s readiness to sign the mineral and security agreement &quot;at any time and in any convenient format.&quot; The report comes after Trump reportedly ordered an immediate halt to more than $1 billion in U.S. military aid to Ukraine on March 4. Since the dispute, some Republican lawmakers have ramped up criticism of Zelensky, with some suggesting he may need to step aside. Zelensky&#x2019;s White House visit was preceded by weeks of tense negotiations as Ukraine rejected the initial two draft proposals, arguing they imposed one-sided obligations on Kyiv without any security commitments from Washington. The final agreement is expected to establish a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of the proceeds from the future monetization of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. Zelensky&#x2019;s refusal to sign the initial draft, presented by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Kyiv on Feb. 12, prompted the U.S. President to lash out publicly. Trump denounced Zelensky as a &quot;dictator,&quot; falsely accusing him of refusing to hold elections and echoing Kremlin disinformation about his legitimacy. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 4 that his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House &quot;did not go the way it was supposed to be,&quot; calling the fallout &quot;regrettable.&quot; The statement follows days of mounting pressure from Washington, with senior U.S. officials signaling that Zelensky should apologize for the heated Feb. 28 Oval Office exchange with Trump and Vice President JD Vance. The meeting ended without a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement being signed. Zelensky reaffirmed that Ukraine is ready to sign the agreement on minerals and security &quot;at any time and in any convenient format.&quot; &quot;We see this agreement as a step toward greater security and solid security guarantees, and I truly hope it will work effectively,&quot; he posted on X. Zelensky also responded to Trump&apos;s latest criticism of his comments on March 2, in which he described peace negotiations as being in the earliest stages and a final deal as &quot;very, very far away.&quot; Trump seized on the remarks as alleged proof that Zelensky does not want peace, posting on Truth Social that &quot;America will not put up with it for much longer.&quot; &quot;Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians,&quot; Zelensky said. He suggested that the initial steps toward de-escalation could include prisoner of war (POWs) releases, a &quot;truce in the sky&quot; banning missiles, long-range drones, and bombs targeting civilian infrastructure, as well as a &quot;truce at sea.&quot; &quot;Then we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the U.S. to agree a strong final deal,&quot; Zelensky added. The remarks come as several media outlets reported that Trump ordered an immediate freeze on all military aid to Ukraine on March 4, halting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries. Trump&apos;s senior adviser, Jason Miller, told CNN that the aid suspension is part of a pressure campaign to push Zelensky into negotiations with Russia. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told Fox News on March 3 that Washington expects Zelensky to show &quot;regret&quot; for the Oval Office dispute and commit to signing the mineral deal. Ukrainian drones attacked an oil refinery in the city of Syzran in Russia&apos;s Samara Oblast overnight on March 4, Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation, said. The first explosions occurred around 3 a.m. local time, according to local residents. A fire broke out at the facility as a result. Samara Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev later said that drones attacked &quot;one of the Syzran industrial enterprises&quot; without providing more details. Russian forces downed drones, and there were no casualties, Fedorishchev claimed. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. Drones attacked Russian Syzran oil refinery in Samara Region, locals report an explosion. A year ago, drones hit the same site, sparking a fire. No official details on the latest incident yet. pic.twitter.com/I0hJs85WW4 The Syzran Oil Refinery, lying around 700 kilometers (430 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border, was opened in 1942 and belongs to the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft. The refinery has a capacity of 8.9 million tons of oil per year. It produces fuel, aviation kerosene, and bitumen, as well as processes crude oil from Western Siberia and Samara Oblast, according to Kovalenko. Drones earlier attacked the Syzran Oil Refinery on Feb. 19. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force struck a military facility near Troitskoye in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast on March 4, destroying dugouts and firing positions and killing up to 30 Russian military personnel, according to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. The facility was reportedly used for planning attacks, including launching first-person-view (FPV) drones at Ukrainian positions. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s Defense Forces remain ready to continue operations targeting Russian military facilities until the Russia ceases its armed aggression against the Ukrainian people,&quot; the statement read. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially capturing about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukrainian forces have lost roughly half that area since, they recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in a new offensive. Over six months of fighting in the region, Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported in February. Ukraine is likely using its foothold in Kursk Oblast as leverage in potential peace talks. President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier that the offensive disrupted Russia&apos;s ability to conduct large-scale operations in northeastern and southern Ukraine. Russian forces in Kursk Oblast have been reinforced by North Korean troops, deployed last fall to counter Ukraine&apos;s cross-border operations. U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s heated Oval Office meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky signals a major shift in U.S. foreign policy, one that a Kremlin spokesman says &quot;largely aligns&quot; with Russia&#x2019;s interests. Trump&#x2019;s recent stance on Ukraine, including his public rebuke of Zelensky and reported halt on U.S. military aid to Kyiv, has drawn praise from Russian officials while raising concerns among European allies. Since taking office, Trump has distanced the U.S. from its traditional role as Ukraine&#x2019;s primary supporter, instead questioning Kyiv&#x2019;s commitment to peace and implying that Ukraine shares blame for the ongoing war. His administration&#x2019;s position has prompted Russian officials to express optimism about a potential thaw in U.S.-Russia relations. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state television on March 3 that &quot;the new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations,&quot; calling the shift a positive development for Moscow. During the Oval Office meeting on Feb. 28, Trump and Vice President JD Vance accused Zelensky of failing to show gratitude for U.S. support and warned that his refusal to negotiate with Putin could escalate into a broader conflict. In response, European leaders reaffirmed their commitment to Ukraine, denouncing Russia&#x2019;s invasion and calling for continued Western military aid. The divergence in approach has raised questions about the future of U.S. support for Kyiv. Russian officials have openly praised Trump&#x2019;s stance, with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov calling him &quot;the first, and so far, the only Western leader&quot; to acknowledge what Moscow considers the true cause of the war. Other Kremlin figures, including the deputy chair of Russia&#x2019;s Security Council, applauded Trump for taking a harsher tone toward Zelensky, even labeling Ukraine&#x2019;s leader a &quot;dictator.&quot; Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that once the war ends, Washington and Moscow could pursue &quot;potentially historic economic partnerships,&quot; including cooperation on Arctic development and rare earth mining.

Trump's pivot toward Moscow met with joy in Russia	It&apos;s a good decision, says Kremlin&apos;s spokesman, following the U.S. pausing of all aid to Ukraine. &quot;The details remain to be seen, but if this is true, it is a decision that could indeed push the &apos;Kyiv regime&apos; towards a peace process,&quot; said Dmitry Peskov. Russia has been open about what it would require to begin peace talks: Ukraine&apos;s Crimea and four Ukrainian oblasts &#x2014; Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson &#x2014; none of which Moscow controls in full. U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered a suspension of all military aid to Ukraine overnight on March 4. The directive reportedly went into effect immediately, impacting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries. &quot;Major!&quot; wrote Kirill Dmitriev, the CEO of Russia&apos;s state-run Direct Investment Fund, who became a vital link between the Kremlin and the White House. Dmitriev was one of the three top Russian officials taking part in the Feb. 18 U.S.-Russia negotiations in Riyadh. The move to suspend aid to Ukraine came on top of other Kremlin-friendly steps recently taken by the U.S. The Trump administration has also been considering lifting sanctions imposed against Russia for its brutal all-out war against Ukraine that killed hundreds of thousands. Meanwhile, Trump has also been aggressively attacking Ukraine and its leadership, which Russian officials and propagandists cheered. They backed Trump after he and Vice President J.D. Vance berated Zelensky in the Oval Office. Peskov said the U.S. policy now &quot;largely aligns&quot; with Russia&apos;s interests. Since President Trump began speaking favorably of Russia, often parroting Kremlin talking points, Russian officials and propaganda have drastically changed their rhetoric. If earlier a common theme on Russian television was an open threat to use nuclear weapons against the U.S., now state-run media outlets are talking more and more positively about the U.S. while continuing to issue xenophobic statements against Ukraine. &quot;Firewall between the U.S. and Russia is abolished. New America starts to reestablish relations with Russia. The new concert of two great powers with very similar anti-globalist illiberal ideologies is quite possible, but not certain,&quot; ultranationalist Alexander Dugin, a fervent supporter of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, wrote prior to Zelensky&apos;s meeting with Trump on Feb. 28. Russian political philosopher Alexander Dugin attends a memorial for his daughter Daria Dugina in Moscow, Russia, on Aug. 23, 2022. (Contributor/Getty Images)Russian officials and propaganda praised the U.S. vote against a Ukrainian resolution at the U.N. General Assembly, calling Russia an aggressor state. They also spoke in favor of Trump&apos;s controversial appointments and continued to spread false claims about Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy, which were picked up by Washington. In most of his recent posts, Russian propaganda mouthpiece Vladimir Solovyov has called Zelensky a &quot;former Ukrainian president, recognized as an illegitimate head of state.&quot; &quot;We were waiting for Trump not because he is pro-Russian but because he is pro-American,&quot; Solovyov said. Peskov welcomed the U.S. policy shift, saying on Feb. 26 that it was &quot;impossible to (even) imagine&quot; and that restoring relations would take a &quot;long way to go.&quot; The shift in Russian reaction became evident following Trump and Zelensky&apos;s altercation at the White House. Following the scuffle, Russian officials and propagandists jumped to Trump&apos;s defense. Their defense was paired with attacks against Zelensky and Europe. Solovyov said that Zelensky was &quot;chastised for rudeness&quot; and &quot;disgraced himself.&quot; Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev praised Trump for telling &quot;the truth,&quot; calling the argument &quot;a livid reprimand&quot; delivered to an &quot;ungrateful&quot; Zelensky. Dmitry Medvedev attends a plenary session at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum in St. Petersburg, Russia, on June 27, 2024. (Artem Priakhin/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)He reiterated Trump&apos;s claim that Ukraine &quot;is gambling with World War III&quot; and said that military aid to Kyiv should be stopped. It stopped three days later. Medvedev, currently a deputy chairman of Russia&apos;s Security Council, has made numerous inflammatory statements on social media platforms and has openly challenged Ukraine&apos;s right to exist as an independent nation. Overall, Trump is enjoying a wave of support in Russia, which sees the U.S. president as a tool that would help force Ukraine into a peace deal beneficial to the Kremlin. &quot;Whoever in the U.S. attacks Putin and Russia today attacks Donald Trump,&quot; wrote Dugin.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-pivot-toward-moscow-met-with-joy-in-russia/	2025-03-04T12:22:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1245382772.jpg
Trump cuts to US weapons aid likely to hit Ukrainian civilians before front line	President Donald Trump&#x2019;s freeze on weapons is alarming Ukrainians, who look to U.S. air defense to stave off the worst of Russia&apos;s missile attacks. A White House representative on March 3 announced a &#x201C;pause&#x201D; on U.S. weapons aid to Ukraine following an ugly encounter between Trump, his Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last week. The directive is reportedly immediate and affects $1 billion in weapons aid, including what&#x2019;s already in transit, mostly through Poland. The details of what weapons exactly are affected by the decision are not entirely clear. Most U.S. shipments of lethal weapons and artillery to Ukraine have already been delivered. A number of U.S. vehicles remain under repair in Europe, but shipments have already slowed down radically in recent months, and Ukraine has moved on from U.S. dependence. For much of the weaponry that Ukraine needs to continue fighting, Europe could stand in for U.S. weapons, especially given the new political will to rearm the EU. But for air defense that protects Ukrainian cities from deadly Russian aerial attacks, nobody can replace the U.S. &#x201C;I think it will be sorely unpleasant, but that&#x2019;s not to say that this is stuff without which we&#x2019;ll lose the war tomorrow,&#x201D; says Serhiy, a drone pilot stationed in Kharkiv whose last name is not being disclosed for security reasons. &#x201C;But the situation in the rear will be noticeably worse since the big air defense covers the cities.&#x201D; Air defense helps protect Ukraine&#x2019;s local weapons production. It also keeps Russia from hitting power plants and civilian homes at will. &#x201C;It&#x2019;ll be harsh times, but we&#x2019;ll handle it,&#x201D; says another soldier by the callsign of &#x2018;Artem,&#x2019; whose real name is not being disclosed. &#x201C;It means more pressure on the cities and civilians.&#x201D; Civilians leave the site after a Russian ballistic missile hit the city center in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Dec. 20, 2024. (Vlada Liberova/Libkos/Getty Images)Per the State Department, the Biden administration oversaw the delivery of three Patriot and 12 NASAM air defense systems after the start of the full-scale war, along with a slew of other cheaper surface-to-air missiles and anti-drone weaponry. The Patriot system, in particular, is the only viable defense against Russian hypersonic Kinzhal missiles. The U.S. alone makes it, and can stop any deliveries from other countries who already have them. &#x201C;Securing a supply of Patriot missiles is our vulnerable spot,&#x201D; Dmytro Zhmailo, a Ukrainian military analyst, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Our mobile groups are demonstrating high efficiency with our, roughly speaking, small arms&#x201D; in shooting down drones, Zhmailo said. &#x201C;But Russian ballistic missiles, especially those that reach our cities within minutes, are still being intercepted by Patriot systems.&#x201D; Given stockpiling and replacement sourcing, Ukrainian officials are much more confident in their abilities on the front line than in aerial defense. Zelensky took to Twitter on March 4 calling on Trump to make a deal in which &#x201C;the first stages could be the release of prisoners and truce in the sky &#x2014; ban on missiles, long-ranged drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure &#x2014; and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same.&#x201D; Some observers are not so optimistic about Ukraine&apos;s capabilities on the front but still consider the military has months of stock. &#x201C;I would say that the impact of the U.S. suspension of military aid will be noticeable at the front in a month or two at the latest,&#x201D; estimated Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute. &#x201C;A suspension of intelligence cooperation and/or a decision to turn off Starlink services would have much more immediate and serious military effects.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s a threat that has been reported on previously but later denied by Elon Musk, the owner of company SpaceX that makes Starlink satellites.

(Omar Marques/Getty Images)U.S. intelligence on Russian movements, including the flow of information on missile launches and targeting of military sites, would also be tough to replicate. A source told CNN that the U.S. will continue to share intelligence with Ukraine despite Trump&apos;s decision, but whether that could change in the future is unclear. Trump&apos;s relationship with intelligence agencies is known to be frosty. The pause has, however, yet to graduate to a full stop. House Speaker Republican Mike Johnson called it &#x201C;temporary&#x201D; while speaking in D.C. on March 4. The pause appears to be mostly political pressure from Trump, who is eager to force Zelensky to make concessions in pursuit of a peace deal. But the Ukrainian president has continued to push for a deal that contains firm security guarantees for Ukraine in the event Russia launches a future attack. Trump is consequently playing off a potential rather than actual impact of a sudden cut in weapons shipment, says Ron Farkas, who runs logistics for weapons systems, including the F-16 through Poland. &#x201C;I would argue there hasn&#x2019;t been equipment coming in for some time. They&#x2019;re talking about cutting things that aren&#x2019;t happening. Everyone&#x2019;s out of stuff,&#x201D; &#xA0;Farkas told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not saying that there&#x2019;s not deliveries coming into Ukraine, I&#x2019;m just saying it&#x2019;s a slow trickle.&#x201D; &#x201C;If things were ending, I&#x2019;d start getting CVs in my inbox. I have not received a single stop work-order,&#x201D; says Farkas, comparing the cuts to USAID last month. The U.S. defense contractors looking to sell their weapons also have more weight over the current administration and Republicans in Congress. &#x201C;I find it very difficult to believe that they&#x2019;ll come in and cut Lockheed Martin contracts or cut Boeing contracts. Or (Musk&#x2019;s) Starlink contracts,&#x201D; Farkas said. Representatives for the U.S. State Department in Ukraine and for Ukrainian air defense declined to comment. The U.S. and Ukrainian Defense Departments did not return requests for comment.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-cuts-to-us-weapons-aid-likely-to-hit-ukrainian-civilians-before-front-line/	2025-03-04T11:31:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202602648.jpg
US, Ukraine plan to sign mineral deal on March 4, Reuters reports	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. &#xA0; The U.S. and Ukraine are preparing to sign a mineral deal on March 4, according to Reuters, citing sources familiar with the matter. The sources indicated that U.S. President Donald Trump plans to announce the agreement during his upcoming address to Congress. However, they cautioned that the situation remains fluid and could still change.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-ukraine-plan-to-sign-mineral-deal-on-march-4-reuters-reports/	2025-03-04T11:29:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201813711.jpg
People should not be guessing' â€” Zelensky calls for clear dialogue with US on military aid amid freeze	President Volodymyr Zelensky instructed Ukraine&#x2019;s defense minister, intelligence chiefs, and diplomats on March 4 to reach out to the U.S. to clarify the future of American military assistance. &quot;People should not be guessing. Ukraine and America deserve a respectful dialogue and a clear position of each other,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. His call comes after reports that U.S. President Donald Trump ordered an immediate halt to more than $1 billion in U.S. military aid to Ukraine on March 4. Zelensky mentioned that military aid was briefly paused in late January before being restored, referencing a Reuters report from February that tied the pause to policy debates within the White House. &quot;This is not 2022; now our resilience is higher, and we have means of defense, but normal partnership relations with America are important for us to really end the war,&quot; he said. Zelensky also warned that Moscow had not changed its stance, asserting that Russia would demand a reduction of Ukraine&#x2019;s army, a renunciation of territories, and a significant weakening of Ukraine&#x2019;s political structure. House Speaker Mike Johnson said on March 4 that the suspension of aid is a &quot;temporary pause&quot; and linked it to the fallout from Zelensky&apos;s Oval Office exchange with Trump. The meeting on Feb. 28 ended without signing a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement. U.S. officials have increased pressure on Zelensky, with some calling for an apology for the White House dispute. Zelensky earlier called the fallout &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed Ukraine&apos;s readiness to sign the mineral and security agreement &quot;at any time and in any convenient format.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/people-should-not-be-guessing-zelensky-orders-officials-to-clarify-future-of-us-military-aid-to-ukraine/	2025-03-04T11:25:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/98f74e298d34967cffe22f79a708f597_1741111431.jpeg
Russian fighter jet provokes French Reaper drone over Mediterranean, French Defense Minister says	A Russian Su-35 fighter jet engaged in a dangerous provocation against a French Reaper drone over the Mediterranean Sea on March 2, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu reported on March 4. &quot;The Russian Su-35 fighter jet behaved dangerously toward the French Reaper drone... Three consecutive approaches could have led to the loss of control of the drone,&quot; Lecornu posted on X. The incident occurred on March 2 while the French drone was conducting an observation mission in the eastern Mediterranean.

This is not the first such incident involving Russian military aircraft. A Russian fighter jet forced down an American MQ-9 Reaper drone over the Black Sea on March 14, 2023. In December, two Dutch F-35 fighter jets intercepted Russian aircraft over the Baltic Sea, according to the Netherlands Defense Ministry. Russian military aircraft frequently operate without transponders or flight plans over the Baltic and Black Seas, maneuvers often seen as testing NATO&apos;s response capabilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-fighter-jet-confronts-french-reaper-drone-in-mediterranean-france-reports/	2025-03-04T10:48:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1229478705.jpg
Ukraine strikes Russian military facility in Kursk Oblast, kills up to 30 troops, General Staff reports	Ukraine&apos;s Air Force struck a military facility near Troitskoye in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast on March 4, destroying dugouts and firing positions, and killing up to 30 Russian military personnel, according to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. The facility was reportedly used for planning attacks, including launching first-person-view (FPV) drones at Ukrainian positions. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s Defense Forces remain ready to continue operations targeting Russian military facilities until the Russia ceases its armed aggression against the Ukrainian people,&quot; the statement read. Map showing Ukrainian-controlled territory in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast as of March 4, 2025, with captured areas marked in blue. (DeepState/OpenStreetMap)Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially capturing about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukrainian forces have lost roughly half that area since, they recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in a new offensive. Over six months of fighting in the region, Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported in February. Ukraine is likely using its foothold in Kursk Oblast as leverage in potential peace talks. President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier that the offensive disrupted Russia&apos;s ability to conduct large-scale operations in northeastern and southern Ukraine. Russian forces in Kursk Oblast have been reinforced by North Korean troops, deployed last fall to counter Ukraine&apos;s cross-border operations.	https://kyivindependent.com/up-to-30-russian-troops-killed-in-ukrainian-strike-on-kursk-oblast-facility-general-staff-claims/	2025-03-04T10:05:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2166040844-1.jpg
Ukraine to boost gas imports due to Russian attacks on energy infrastructure, Bloomberg reports	Ukraine plans to import about 3.5 billion cubic meters of gas for the upcoming heating season due to ongoing Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure, Bloomberg reported on March 4. Recent Russian missile and drone strikes have significantly reduced Ukraine&apos;s gas production capacity, forcing the country to rely more heavily on imports to meet domestic demand. Damage to infrastructure has caused production drops of up to 40% at times. &#x201C;We are waiting for a final approval of the balance, which will define the projected volume of consumption, extraction, and imports of gas,&#x201D; Roman Chumak, acting CEO of Ukraine&apos;s state-owned oil and gas company Naftogaz, told Bloomberg. The country&#x2019;s gas buying plans come amid a volatile market marked by high competition and elevated prices due to Europe&#x2019;s need to replenish low gas inventories. In February, Ukraine imported 560 million cubic meters of gas from Europe, compared to just 700 million cubic meters for the entire previous heating season, Bloomberg reported, citing estimates from Kyiv-based Dragon Capital. Due to Russian strikes and extreme cold in February, Ukraine&#x2019;s gas production sharply declined, leading Naftogaz to urgently purchase significant amounts of natural gas from the European Union to meet critical heating demands. Tensions between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump could potentially weaken Ukraine&apos;s ability to defend against Russian attacks, raising concerns about energy security, according to Bloomberg. Naftogaz and Ukrainian energy company DTEK confirmed to Reuters that Russian forces attacked and damaged their facilities twice in February. At the start of 2025, Ukraine halted its agreement with Russia to transport Russian gas to European customers through its pipelines, as the deal expired at the end of 2024 and was not renewed.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-boost-gas-imports-due-to-russian-attacks-on-energy-infrastructure-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-04T09:39:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-821523200.jpg
US military aid freeze to Ukraine temporary, linked to Zelensky-Trump clash	The pause in U.S. military aid to Ukraine is temporary and tied to the fallout from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s heated Oval Office exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson said on March 4. &quot;It&apos;s a temporary pause,&quot; Johnson said during a press briefing when asked about the reported freeze on over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries. The move follows a heated Feb. 28 Oval Office meeting between Trump, Zelensky, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance, during which the two American leaders berated Zelensky. The meeting ended without a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement being signed. Since then, senior U.S. officials have repeatedly suggested that Zelensky should express regret for the confrontation. Johnson said Zelensky should &quot;make right what happened last week, the shocking developments in the Oval Office.&quot; &quot;If he does that (signs the minerals deal), I think this is the win-win-win scenario for everybody involved,&quot; he added. Zelensky, in a statement earlier on March 4, called the outcome of the Oval Office meeting &quot;regrettable&quot; and emphasized Ukraine&apos;s readiness to sign the minerals deal &quot;at any time and in any convenient format.&quot; Trump&apos;s senior adviser, Jason Miller, told CNN that the aid freeze is part of a broader pressure campaign to push Zelensky toward peace talks with Russia. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz previously said Washington expects Zelensky to show &quot;regret&quot; for the Oval Office clash and commit to finalizing the deal.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-military-aid-freeze-to-ukraine-is-temporary-linked-to-trump-zelensky-exchange-speaker-johnson-says/	2025-03-04T09:21:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2150335295.jpg
Why Trumpâ€™s Ukraine aid freeze upends world order	The U.S. has suspended military aid to Ukraine as part of a pressure campaign to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky toward negotiations with Russia, U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s senior adviser Jason Miller said on March 4. It&#x2019;s just the latest in a series of developments since Trump took office that mark a dramtic shift in the U.S.&#x2019;s relationship with not only Ukraine, but Europe, and the rest of the world. The Kyiv Independent spoke with Timothy Ash, associate fellow at the Chatham House&#x2019;s Russia and Eurasia Programme, who told us that what is unfolding right now amount to &#x201C;teutonic shifts in alliances that I don&#x2019;t think anyone could quite have imagined.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/why-trumps-ukraine-aid-freeze-upends-world-order/	2025-03-04T09:14:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Ash-4.jpg
Zelensky says White House clash 'regrettable,' proposes steps for peace	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 4 that his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House &quot;did not go the way it was supposed to be,&quot; calling the fallout &quot;regrettable.&quot; The statement follows days of mounting pressure from Washington, with senior U.S. officials signaling that Zelensky should apologize for the heated Feb. 28 Oval Office exchange with Trump and Vice President JD Vance. The meeting ended without a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement being signed. Zelensky reaffirmed that Ukraine is ready to sign the agreement on minerals and security &quot;at any time and in any convenient format.&quot; &quot;We see this agreement as a step toward greater security and solid security guarantees, and I truly hope it will work effectively,&quot; he posted on X. Zelensky also responded to Trump&apos;s latest criticism of his comments on March 2, in which he described peace negotiations as being in the earliest stages and a final deal as &quot;very, very far away.&quot; Trump seized on the remarks as alleged proof that Zelensky does not want peace, posting on Truth Social that &quot;America will not put up with it for much longer.&quot; &quot;Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians,&quot; Zelensky said. He suggested that the initial steps toward de-escalation could include prisoner of war (POWs) releases, a &quot;truce in the sky&quot; banning missiles, long-range drones, and bombs targeting civilian infrastructure, as well as a &quot;truce at sea.&quot; &quot;Then we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the U.S. to agree a strong final deal,&quot; Zelensky added. The remarks come as several media outlets reported that Trump ordered an immediate freeze on all military aid to Ukraine on March 4, halting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries. Trump&apos;s senior adviser, Jason Miller, told CNN that the aid suspension is part of a pressure campaign to push Zelensky into negotiations with Russia. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told Fox News on March 3 that Washington expects Zelensky to show &quot;regret&quot; for the Oval Office dispute and commit to signing the mineral deal.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-says-white-house-regrettable-vows/	2025-03-04T08:44:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201830448.jpg
Russian forces in Kharkiv sector suffer more fatalities than wounded, Ukraine says	Russian forces in the Kharkiv sector of the front line have suffered more irrecoverable losses than wounded over the past month, Volodymyr Degtyaryov, spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s &quot;Khartia&quot; brigade, said on March 4. &quot;If you look at the enemy&apos;s losses in February, you can see an interesting trend &#x2014; more dead than wounded. Perhaps this is due to the fact that they have less movement and more (personnel) concentrations,&quot; Degtyaryov told Ukrainian media Suspilne. He noted that Russian forces rarely use vehicles, as Ukrainian troops have established a &quot;dead zone&quot; extending 10 kilometers into Russian-occupied areas, allowing Ukrainian forces to maintain control over the sector from the air. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. &quot;Of course, they have offensive potential, but we are doing everything we can to prevent them from doing so,&quot; Degtyaryov added. The situation in Kharkiv Oblast as of March 4, 2025. The area marked in red is the territory occupied by Russia. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Kharkiv Oblast, which shares a direct border with Russia, remains a major flashpoint in the ongoing war. Moscow launched an offensive in the region on May 10, 2024, advancing up to 10 kilometers (6 miles) before Ukrainian defenders halted the push at the first line of defense. During the first month of the offensive, Russian forces suffered around 4,000 casualties, including both killed and wounded, according to Ukraine&apos;s military. Despite their losses, Russian troops still control several villages on two axes in Kharkiv Oblast &#x2014; one near Lyptsi and the other near the embattled town of Vovchansk.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-in-kharkiv-sector-suffer-more-irrecoverable-losses-than-wounded-brigade-spokesperson-says/	2025-03-04T08:04:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1494251171-1.jpeg
Russian oil deliveries to Czech Republic via Druzhba pipeline suspended, Czech official says	Russian oil deliveries to the Czech Republic via the Druzhba pipeline have been halted, Czech news channel CT24 reported on March 4, citing Industry and Trade Minister Lukas Vlcek. &quot;We control the situation and are prepared for such circumstances. Refineries in the Czech Republic are well prepared, and the state material reserve system is reliable, so I can assure everyone that there are enough oil reserves for both households and businesses,&quot; Vlcek said. No mention was made of the cause for the halt in deliveries. The Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline transports Russian oil to Europe through two main branches: the southern route supplies Central Europe, and the northern route serves Northern Europe. This is not the first disruption to Druzhba&apos;s oil flow. In early December 2024, supplies were temporarily halted but resumed after two days. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala announced in January that Prague intends to completely stop Russian oil imports via Druzhba. The country plans to rely instead on the Transalpine Pipeline, which has been modernized to boost supply volumes. The European Union imposed an embargo on Russian oil and oil products in June 2023, though the southern branch of Druzhba was temporarily exempted. That exemption expires in June 2025, after which recipient countries must find alternative supply routes.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-oil-deliveries-to-czech-republic-via-druzhba-pipeline-halted-czech-minister-says/	2025-03-04T07:36:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-94281707.jpg
US continues intelligence sharing with Ukraine despite military aid freeze, CNN reports	The U.S. continues to share intelligence with Ukraine despite President Donald Trump&#x2019;s suspension of military aid, CNN reported on March 4, citing a source familiar with the matter. Since the start of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion, the U.S. has provided Kyiv with real-time intelligence, including satellite imagery and sensitive information on Russian troop movements. As of the morning of March 4, this support remained unchanged, according to CNN&apos;s source. The report comes as multiple media outlets reported that Trump ordered an immediate halt to all U.S. military aid to Ukraine on March 4, affecting more than $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries. Trump&apos;s senior adviser, Jason Miller, told CNN that the aid freeze is part of a pressure campaign to push President Volodymyr Zelensky toward negotiations with Russia. &quot;Sometimes leaders can use the carrot, sometimes they can use the stick,&quot; Miller said. The decision follows a heated Feb. 28 Oval Office meeting between Trump, Zelensky, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance, during which the two American leaders berated Zelensky. The meeting ended without a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement being signed. Since the confrontation, some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have escalated their criticism of Zelensky, with some even suggesting he should resign. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told Fox News on March 3 that the U.S. administration expects Zelensky to show regret and commit to signing the mineral deal. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, the U.S. has provided Ukraine with $119.8 billion since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, including $67.1 billion in military assistance, $49 billion in financial aid, and $3.6 billion in humanitarian support.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-continues-sharing-intelligence-with-ukraine-despite-trumps-aid-freeze-media-reports/	2025-03-04T07:18:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/--------------2024-03-19-202210.png
US suspends Ukraine military aid to pressure Zelensky into talks, Trump adviser says	The U.S. has suspended military aid to Ukraine as part of a pressure campaign to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky toward negotiations with Russia, U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s senior adviser Jason Miller told CNN on March 4. &quot;President Trump is the only person, the only person talking about stopping the killing, and sometimes leaders can use the carrot, sometimes they can use the stick,&quot; Miller said. Several media outlets reported that Trump ordered an immediate halt to all military aid to Ukraine on March 4, affecting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries. Miller claimed that Trump was using strong tactics to reinforce his demand for peace talks and that he expects Zelensky to &quot;get back to the table.&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed that American military aid had indeed been suspended, citing Polish border reports. &quot;This is an emergency,&quot; Tusk said. Polish Foreign Ministry spokesperson Pawel Wronski added that the U.S. had not consulted with any of its NATO allies before suspending the aid. The move follows a heated Oval Office meeting on Feb. 28 between Trump, Zelensky, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance, which ended with the cancelation of a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement. Since the meeting, some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have escalated their criticism of Zelensky, with some even suggesting he should resign. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, the U.S. has provided $119.8 billion in aid to Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, including $67.1 billion in military aid, $49 billion in financial aid, and $3.6 billion in humanitarian support.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-suspends-ukraine-military-aid-to-pressure-zelensky-into-talks-trump-adviser-says/	2025-03-04T06:35:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201194454.jpg
Russia agrees to help US in negotiations with Iran over nuclear program, Bloomberg reports	Moscow has pledged to help Washington in dealing with Iran over the Islamic Republic&apos;s nuclear program and its support for regional anti-American proxies, Bloomberg reported on March 4, citing its undisclosed sources. Since returning to the White House, Trump has been trying to restore relations with Russia, which were severed under the previous administration when the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Trump voiced his interest in negotiations with Iran to Putin during a phone call in February. A few days later, the U.S. and Russian delegations discussed this issue during talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Bloomberg reported. Moscow has long been partners with Tehran, but their cooperation only intensified after the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022. Iran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed drones used in attacks against Ukrainian cities, as well as short-range ballistic missiles. With Iran&apos;s assistance, Russia has begun producing its own variants of Shahed drones called Geran-2. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier that Russia believes the U.S. and Iran should &quot;resolve all problems through negotiations,&quot; and Moscow is &quot;ready to do everything in its power to achieve this goal.&quot; When asked whether Russia offered to mediate between Tehran and Washington, Esmail Baghai, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said that it was &quot;natural&quot; for countries to offer their assistance. &quot;Given the importance of these issues, it is quite possible that many parties will show goodwill and willingness to help in solving various problems,&quot; Baghai said during a televised press conference in Tehran on March 3. &quot;From this point of view, it is only natural that countries will offer assistance if it is needed,&quot; he added. Since taking office, Trump has distanced the U.S. from its traditional role as Ukraine&apos;s primary supporter, instead questioning Kyiv&apos;s commitment to peace and implying that Ukraine shares the blame for the ongoing war. Russian officials have openly praised Trump&apos;s stance, with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov calling him &quot;the first, and so far, the only Western leader&quot; to acknowledge what Moscow considers the true cause of the war. Other Kremlin figures, including the deputy chair of Russia&apos;s Security Council, applauded Trump for taking a harsher tone toward President Volodymyr Zelensky, even labeling Ukraine&apos;s leader a &quot;dictator.&quot; Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that once the war ends, Washington and Moscow could pursue &quot;potentially historic economic partnerships,&quot; including cooperation on Arctic development and rare earth mining.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-agrees-to-help-us-in-negotiations-with-iran-over-nuclear-program-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-04T05:43:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-872780694.jpg
US military aid to Ukraine suspended according to Polish border reports, Tusk says	The Trump administration halted military aid to Ukraine, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on March 4, citing Polish border reports, Rzeczpospolita reported. Several media outlets reported earlier that U.S. President Donald Trump had ordered the suspension of military aid, including the aid that was already on its way to Ukraine. &quot;Today we have no reason to believe that these are just words. Reports coming from the border, from our center in Jasionka, confirm the statements of the American side,&quot; Tusk said. Tusk called the situation &quot;an emergency&quot; and insisted on full mobilization and concentration of joint efforts to resolve it.&quot;The situation is serious and requires special concentration from the government. We will make decisions that will require the full solidarity of the state and your (Ukrainian) ministries,&quot; Tusk said.&quot;The days and weeks are coming when it is absolutely necessary to stop empty discussions, prestige disputes, coalition disagreements, because we will have to make decisions in a mode that is, in a sense, extraordinary,&quot; he added.According to Pawel Wronski, Polish foreign ministry spokesperson, the U.S. has not consulted with any of its NATO allies about suspending military aid to Ukraine. The suspension of U.S. military aid followed a spat between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Trump in the Oval Office last week. The argument between two leaders also resulted in the failure to sign a minerals deal.Since the meeting, some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have escalated their criticism of Zelensky, with some even suggesting he should resign.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-military-aid-to-ukraine-suspended-according-to-polish-border-reports-tusk-says/	2025-03-04T04:09:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183928589.jpg
I'm full of anger' â€” Ukraine awakes to a nightmare as US freezes military aid	Even in a country grimly accustomed to negative news, the headlines that Ukraine woke up to on March 4 still came as a shock &#x2014; the U.S. is freezing military aid. &quot;It hurts to watch it unfolding,&quot; Volodymyr Dubovyk, the head of Odesa National University&apos;s Center for International Studies, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We can scrap everything that we previously knew about U.S. foreign policy.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump on March 3 reportedly ordered a suspension of all military aid to Ukraine, with a senior Defense Department official telling Bloomberg it is on hold until Trump determines that Ukrainian leaders are making a genuine effort toward peace. Neither Washington nor Kyiv have officially confirmed the freeze. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that the reports the Polish government gets from the Ukrainian-Polish border confirm the freeze. The move is the latest from the White House as it escalates pressure on President Volodymyr Zelensky, just days after a heated exchange in the Oval Office cast doubt on U.S. support for Kyiv, and ended in the cancelling of a planned mineral deal between the two countries. The Trump administration&apos;s strongarm tactics against Zelesnky are being felt especially painfully in Ukraine as the Kremlin appears to be getting a free ride from a White House which &#x2014; by the Kremlin&apos;s own admission &#x2014; is now largely aligned with Russia&apos;s interests. &quot;It looks as if Trump is trying to cut a deal with Russia at the cost of the weaker party, which is Ukraine,&quot; Oleksandr Merezhko, a lawmaker and chair of the parliament&apos;s foreign affairs policy, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;I don&#x2019;t see that Trump is using leverage against the aggressor, he is using leverage against the victim of the aggression. To stop military aid to Ukraine right now means to help Russia kill Ukrainians with impunity.&quot; Trump has long-promised he could swiftly end the war in Ukraine as soon as he took office, though his original pledge of &quot;24 hours&quot; was amended to &quot;100 days&quot; shortly before his inauguration. During his first week in office, Trump appeared to come out on the side of Ukraine, putting the onus on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and threatening &quot;high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions&quot; if he didn&apos;t &quot;make a deal.&quot; But in the weeks since, and after a phone call between Trump and Putin, the rhetoric coming from the White House towards Ukraine has been increasingly hostile and has, at times, resembled that coming from the Kremlin. Trump has described Zelensky as a &quot;dictator&quot; and questioned his legitimacy, with some Republican lawmakers this week calling for him to resign. Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, lawmaker for the Holos (Voice) party, told the Kyiv Independent that even though the tone has changed, he believes Trump&apos;s more recent actions still align with his original stated goal of ending the war swiftly &#x2014; but regardless of the cost for Ukraine. &quot;I think that it&#x2019;s a continuation of Trump&#x2019;s policy to end the war as soon as possible by effectively giving up on Ukraine&#x2019;s interests,&quot; he said. &quot;Because based on the logic of his and his administration&#x2019;s statements, their goal is peace at any cost. But for Ukraine, such an option is not acceptable.&quot; The directive to freeze U.S. military aid reportedly goes into effect immediately, impacting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition. The pause affects not only future aid but also weapons already in transit, including shipments on aircraft and ships, as well as equipment awaiting transfer in Poland. &quot;I&apos;m full of anger,&quot; &#x2018;Bart,&#x2019; a Special Operations Forces sniper fighting in the hot spot near Pokrovsk, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;America has sided with Russia, North Korea, and Iran, they have chosen the side of darkness. If the U.S. has chosen to play the role of world policeman, it is its duty to protect world democracy.&quot; Yet despite the anger and the future of weapons supplies in doubt, Ukrainian soldiers who spoke to the Kyiv Independent remain confident in their ability to fight back against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;There is no panic in the army,&quot; &quot;Fuko&quot; who serves with Ukraine&apos;s 66th Prince Mstyslav Khorobyi Brigade said, adding: &quot;We are ready to keep going as long as it takes. &quot;Moreover, the weapons supply crisis can be avoided if our European allies respond quickly and help us with the supply of the most important weapons.&quot; Bart acknowledged the aid freeze &quot;will have some impact, but not a critical one.&quot; &quot;Europe is helping us, we will break through &#x2014; Russia is running out of steam, and we need to push on,&quot; he added. As Ukraine increasingly looks to Europe for support, there were signs on March 4 that Brussels was preparing to step up. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the ReArm Europe plan aimed at strengthening the defense capabilities of the EU&#x2019;s countries, which could unlock close to 800 billion euros ($842 billion). &quot;Europe is ready to assume its responsibilities,&quot; von der Leyen said, adding: &quot;This is a moment for Europe and we are ready to step up.&quot; Whether or not Europe can step up in time to fill the potential hole left by the U.S.&apos; withdrawal remains to be seen, and Ukraine will be assessing which areas of its defense could be impacted the most. &quot;Our main challenge is air defense which depends on U.S. support,&quot; Lieutenant Colonel Bohdan Krotevych told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We must urgently find an alternative because civilians will die if we run out of missiles.&quot; Krotevych added that the Trump administration needs to understand this too, otherwise they are &quot;setting themselves up for prison sentences.&quot; &quot;When? Whether it happens after his current term or through impeachment is for the American people to decide,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/im-full-of-anger-ukraine-awakes-to-a-nightmare-as-us-freezes-military-aid/	2025-03-04T04:00:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198359955.jpg
US military aid continue to flow as of evening of March 3, Prime Minister Shmyhal says	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. U.S. military aid continued to flow to Ukraine as of late last night, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on March 4 during his press conference in Kyiv. The statement comes after several media outlets reported that U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered a suspension of all military aid to Ukraine on March 4. The directive reportedly went into effect immediately, impacting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-military-aid-continue-to-flow-as-of-evening-of-march-3-ukraines-prime-minister-shmyhal-says/	2025-03-04T03:41:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168960387.jpg
Oil prices continue to decline amid growing tensions between US, Ukraine, Reuters reports	Oil prices have continued to drop after U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly suspended military aid to Ukraine, Reuters reported on March 4. The news from the U.S. comes after a spat between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last week. Neither Washington nor Kyiv have officially confirmed the freeze. Brent crude oil futures fell 54 cents, or 0.75%, to $71.08 per barrel. In the meantime, futures for U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil decreased by 36 cents, or 0.53%, to $68.01 per barrel, according to the news agency. The market perceived the distancing of the U.S. and Ukraine as a signal of a possible easing of the war, subsequently leading to the loosening of sanctions against Russia and the return of additional volumes of Russian oil for purchase, Reuters reported. Yet Goldman Sachs analysts noted that Russian oil exports are now more limited by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) quotas than by sanctions, so even if sanctions are eased, a significant increase in supplies is not guaranteed. OPEC&apos;s decision to extend the planned increase in production by 138,000 barrels per day, the first increase since 2022, also puts pressure on prices. A day earlier, oil prices fell by about 2%, hitting a 12-week low, amid news about Ukraine and concerns that new U.S. tariffs will hurt global economic growth, according to Reuters. Trump&apos;s 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico will come into effect on March 4, with energy products from Canada subject to a 10% duty, while tariffs on Chinese goods will rise from 10% to 20%.	https://kyivindependent.com/oil-prices-continue-to-decline-amid-growing-tensions-between-us-ukraine-reuters-reports/	2025-03-04T03:23:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/taneco.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, injure 11 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed two civilians and injured 11 others over the past day, regional authorities reported on March 4. Russian forces launched 99 drones from the Russian cities of Orel, Kursk, Bryansk, Millerovo, and Primosk-Akhtarsk at Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 65 drones over Kharkiv, Sumy, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Odesa, Kirovohrad, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, the Air Force said. Another 32 drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are often decoys that Russia launches alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. In Donetsk Oblast, a Russian attack killed a person in the town of Pokrovsk, while another Russian strike injured a person in the village of Nova Poltavka, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian forces attacked the village of Omelnyk with a glide bomb, killing a 49-year-old man. His wife suffered injuries in the strike, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 30 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, five people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Odesa Oblast, four people were injured in the attack against the regional center of Odesa, according to Governor Oleh Kiper. Three people suffered shrapnel wounds and broken limbs, while another person suffered a concussion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-2-injure-11-over-past-day/	2025-03-04T03:05:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2147527243.jpg

Ukrainian drones reportedly strike oil refinery in Russia's Samara Oblast	Ukrainian drones attacked an oil refinery in the city of Syzran in Russia&apos;s Samara Oblast overnight on March 4, Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation, said. The first explosions occurred around 3 a.m. local time, according to local residents. A fire broke out at the facility as a result. Samara Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev later said that drones attacked &quot;one of the Syzran industrial enterprises&quot; without providing more details. Russian forces downed drones, and there were no casualties, Fedorishchev claimed. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. Drones attacked Russian Syzran oil refinery in Samara Region, locals report an explosion. A year ago, drones hit the same site, sparking a fire. No official details on the latest incident yet. pic.twitter.com/I0hJs85WW4 The Syzran Oil Refinery, lying around 700 kilometers (430 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border, was opened in 1942 and belongs to the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft. The refinery has a capacity of 8.9 million tons of oil per year. It produces fuel, aviation kerosene, and bitumen, as well as processes crude oil from Western Siberia and Samara Oblast, according to Kovalenko. Drones earlier attacked the Syzran Oil Refinery on Feb. 19. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine.

Pentagon denies halting cyber operations against Russia, Bloomberg reports	The Pentagon has denied that U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a halt to cyber operations against Russia, Bloomberg reported on March 4, citing an unnamed senior defense official. The Record previously reported that U.S. Cyber Command was ordered to suspend offensive cyber and information operations against Moscow. The news coincided with President Donald Trump&apos;s efforts to negotiate an end to Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine under terms that critics argue favor Moscow. Cybersecurity experts had warned that such a move would benefit one of America&apos;s most persistent cyber adversaries, potentially weakening U.S. leverage in both cyber and conventional military operations. Russian hacker groups have engaged in various forms of cyber warfare throughout the full-scale war, including cyberattacks against Ukraine, hacks of civilian infrastructure in Europe, and interference in foreign elections. But according to a source quoted by Bloomberg, Hegseth did not cancel or suspend cyber operations against Russia. Nor has he issued any orders to reverse this priority, the source said. The U.S. Cyber Command oversees 135 teams of &quot;cyber mission forces.&quot; The units involved in offensive operations are cyber combat mission teams, according to Bloomberg.	https://kyivindependent.com/pentagon-denies-halting-cyber-operations-against-russia-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-03T23:41:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193880159.jpg

Ukraine brings back 7 children from occupied territories, Russia	Seven Ukrainian children have been returned home under the President of Ukraine&#x2019;s initiative, Bring Kids Back UA, according to Daria Zarivna, Director of the initiative and advisor to the Head of the Office of the President. The children had been residing in the Russian-occupied territories and Russia itself. Since February 2022, at least 20,000 Ukrainian children have been abducted from Russian-occupied areas and transferred to other Russian-controlled territories or to Russia, according to the Ukrainian national database, &quot;Children of War.&quot; Among the returned children is a boy who, along with his parents, lived under occupation for an extended period, Zarivna wrote on March 3. &quot;He endured forced passportization, psychological pressure at school, and a constant fear for his future,&quot; she added. &quot;In an effort to provide him with the opportunity for an education in a free country, his parents decided to bring him to Ukrainian-controlled territory.&quot; Ukraine considers the abduction of these children a war crime and argues that these actions meet the U.N.&#x2019;s legal definition of genocide. Russia, however, claims that the children are being relocated for their protection from conflict zones. Ukrainian authorities, including Children&#x2019;s Ombudswoman Daria Herasymchuk, estimate that up to 300,000 children have been unlawfully deported, while the figure put forth by Lubinets, the Ukrainian Human Rights Commissioner, stands at 150,000. The Ukrainian government has managed to return 1,233 children so far, according to the Ministry of Reintegration. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Children&apos;s Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, citing their involvement in the unlawful transfer of Ukrainian children. Russia dismissed the ICC&#x2019;s decision as &quot;outrageous and unacceptable.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-brings-back-7-children-from-russia-occupied-territories/	2025-03-03T21:48:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/dscf6830-1668456828oat5c.jpg
Kremlin welcomes Trumpâ€™s policy shift as US moves 'align' with Russia's interests	U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s heated Oval Office meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky signals a major shift in U.S. foreign policy, one that a Kremlin spokesman says &quot;largely aligns&quot; with Russia&#x2019;s interests. Trump&#x2019;s recent stance on Ukraine, including his public rebuke of Zelensky and reported halt on U.S. military aid to Kyiv, has drawn praise from Russian officials while raising concerns among European allies. Since taking office, Trump has distanced the U.S. from its traditional role as Ukraine&#x2019;s primary supporter, instead questioning Kyiv&#x2019;s commitment to peace and implying that Ukraine shares blame for the ongoing war. His administration&#x2019;s position has prompted Russian officials to express optimism about a potential thaw in U.S.-Russia relations. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state television on March 3 that &quot;the new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations,&quot; calling the shift a positive development for Moscow. During the Oval Office meeting on Feb. 28, Trump and Vice President JD Vance accused Zelensky of failing to show gratitude for U.S. support and warned that his refusal to negotiate with Putin could escalate into a broader conflict. In response, European leaders reaffirmed their commitment to Ukraine, denouncing Russia&#x2019;s invasion and calling for continued Western military aid. The divergence in approach has raised questions about the future of U.S. support for Kyiv. Russian officials have openly praised Trump&#x2019;s stance, with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov calling him &quot;the first, and so far, the only Western leader&quot; to acknowledge what Moscow considers the true cause of the war. Other Kremlin figures, including the deputy chair of Russia&#x2019;s Security Council, applauded Trump for taking a harsher tone toward Zelensky, even labeling Ukraine&#x2019;s leader a &quot;dictator.&quot; Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that once the war ends, Washington and Moscow could pursue &quot;potentially historic economic partnerships,&quot; including cooperation on Arctic development and rare earth mining.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-welcomes-trumps-policy-shift-as-us-moves-align-with-russias-interests/	2025-03-03T20:53:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1255667814.jpg
Vance says US door open if Zelensky willing to 'seriously talk peace'	As U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly halted all military aid to Ukraine, Vice President JD Vance once again criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky in a March 3 interview with Fox News, claiming Zelensky has shown a &quot;clear unwillingness to engage in the peace process&quot; &#x2014; a policy Trump insists reflects the will of the American people. During the Oval Office meeting on Feb. 28, Zelensky, Trump and Vance held a 45-minute-long press briefing in the Oval Office which ended in a heated argument about American aid to Ukraine, and canceling of the planned signing of the U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement. Trump and Vance accused Zelensky of failing to express gratitude for U.S. support and warned that his refusal to make concessions to Putin was a dangerous gamble that could escalate into World War III. Following the meeting, Trump said that Zelensky &quot;is not ready for peace.&quot; &quot;He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace,&quot; Trump posted on Truth Social on Feb. 28. Vance told Fox News&apos; Sean Hannity that &quot;what President Trump has said clearly and consistently is of course (that) the door is open so long as Zelensky is willing to seriously talk peace.&quot; &#xA0; &quot;You can&apos;t come into the Oval Office or anywhere else and refuse to even discuss the details of a peace deal,&quot; he said. &quot;This is not going to make anybody happy. The Russians are going to have to give up stuff, the Ukrainians are going to have to give up stuff. You can&apos;t come to the Oval Office and say &apos;give us security guarantees, we won&apos;t even engage with you about what we are willing to give up.&apos; That&apos;s been the Ukrainian posture.&quot; &quot;Hope is not a strategy. Throwing money and ammunition at a terrible conflict &#x2014; that is not a strategy,&quot; Vance said on the Biden adminstration policy on Ukraine. The U.S. has provided assistance worth $119.8 billion since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, including $67.1 billion in military aid, $49 billion in financial aid, and $3.6 billion in humanitarian aid, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Following the tense meeting with Trump, Zelensky told Fox News on Feb. 28 that Ukraine is &quot;ready for peace but we need to be in a good position.&quot; &quot;We want peace... that&apos;s why I visited President Trump,&quot; Zelensky told Fox News, adding that he hopes that Trump would show stronger support for Ukraine rather than positioning himself as a mediator in the war. He emphasized that Russia was the aggressor, having launched the invasion. &quot;I want really him to be more at our side,&quot; Zelensky said. Vance reiterated to Hannity that President Trump will be &quot;the first person to pick up the phone&quot; once Zelensky is ready to talk about peace. &quot;The president is actually taking a much more realistic perspective in saying this can&apos;t go on forever, we can&apos;t fund this thing forever, the Ukrainians can&apos;t fight forever &#x2014; so let&apos;s bring this thing to a peaceful settlement.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/vance-says-us-door-open-if-zelensky-willing-to-seriously-talk-peace/	2025-03-03T18:49:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199662300.jpg

Europeâ€™s major powers consider seizing frozen Russian assets in ceasefire talks, FT reports	France, Germany, and the UK are exploring ways to seize over 200 billion euro ($210 billion) in frozen Russian assets as part of efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in Ukraine, officials familiar with the discussions told Financial Times (FT). While Berlin and Paris had previously resisted full asset confiscation, they are now engaging in talks with European and G7 partners about potential mechanisms to use the funds. A proposal discussed by French officials suggests seizing the assets if Moscow violates a future ceasefire agreement, ensuring security guarantees for Kyiv. Diplomatic activity has intensified in recent weeks, with France and the U.K. leading efforts to draft a European peace plan. These discussions gained momentum after U.S. President Donald Trump launched direct negotiations with Russia aimed at ending the war. Since 2022, G7 nations have frozen roughly 300 billion euro ($310 billion) in Russian central bank assets, with the majority&#x2014;around 190 billion euro ($200 billion) &#x2014;held in Belgium&#x2019;s Euroclear. Currently, only the interest generated by these funds is being used to back a $50 billion loan package for Ukraine, while the principal remains untouched. Ukraine, Poland, and the Baltic states have long pushed for the full confiscation of these assets, but major European capitals had resisted over concerns about international legal precedents and financial stability. The European Central Bank had warned that such a move could undermine confidence in the euro as a reserve currency, given that most of the frozen assets are euro-denominated. However, shifting political dynamics appear to be changing the debate. French President Emmanuel Macron recently told Trump that immediate seizure would not align with international law but suggested the assets could be part of post-war negotiations. Meanwhile, Germany&#x2019;s likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has signaled openness to asset seizure and is coordinating with outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz ahead of an EU summit. In the U.K., Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed that London is examining ways to deploy the funds, noting that while profits from Russian sovereign assets are already being used to support Ukraine, the fate of the principal remains complex.	https://kyivindependent.com/europes-major-powers-consider-seizing-frozen-russian-assets-in-ceasefire-talks-ft-reports/	2025-03-03T14:59:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1240065587.jpg
Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick claims US-Ukraine mineral deal to be signed	The United States and Ukraine are making progress on a key mineral agreement that could strengthen long-term economic ties and pave the way for further security assistance, according to U.S. Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick. Fitzpatrick, who represents Pennsylvania and serves as the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Energy, the Environment, and Cyber, announced the development on social media following a conversation with Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to President Volodymyr Zelensky. He described the discussion as &quot;lengthy and productive&quot; and expressed confidence that the deal would be finalized soon. I just had a lengthy and productive one-on-one conversation with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x2019;s Chief-of-Staff, Andrii Yermak. We are 100% getting this train back on the tracks. This mineral deal will be signed in short order, which will lead to a strong long-term economic&#x2026; &quot;This mineral deal will be signed in short order, which will lead to a strong long-term economic partnership between the United States and Ukraine, and which will ultimately and naturally lead to security assistance,&quot; Fitzpatrick wrote. He also indicated that European nations would be expected to contribute, adding that they would face mandates to step up their support. The specifics of the agreement remain unclear, but Ukraine&#x2019;s vast reserves of lithium and other rare earth minerals have drawn increasing interest from Western nations. These resources are critical for modern technologies, including batteries, electronics, and defense applications. Fitzpatrick&apos;s comment follows Zelensky&apos;s early departure from Washington on Feb. 28 without signing a U.S.-Ukraine mineral deal after a tense confrontation with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance at the White House. In the days since, some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have escalated criticism of Zelensky, with some suggesting he should resign.	https://kyivindependent.com/rep-brian-fitzpatrick-claims-us-ukraine-mineral-deal-to-be-signed/	2025-03-03T13:48:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201332404.jpg
Trump administration weighs sanctions relief for Russia, Reuters reports	The United States is preparing a proposal to potentially ease sanctions on Russia as President Donald Trump works to restore diplomatic ties and negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, a U.S. official and another source familiar with the discussions told Reuters. The White House has directed the State and Treasury departments to compile a list of sanctions that could be lifted. U.S. officials plan to use this list in upcoming talks with Russian representatives as part of a broader strategy to improve economic and political relations with Moscow. Sanctions officials are now drafting a proposal that would remove restrictions on specific Russian individuals and entities, including oligarchs, the sources said. While internal government offices routinely prepare such options, the White House&#x2019;s direct request signals a serious consideration of sanctions relief as part of a potential agreement with the Kremlin. The administration has not specified what it expects in return. Trump has moved quickly to shift U.S. policy on Russia. He called Russian President Vladimir Putin on Feb. 12, then sent U.S. representatives to meet with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia and Turkey. In January, Trump had warned that he would increase sanctions if Moscow refused to negotiate an end to the war. However, members of his administration have since acknowledged the possibility of lifting economic restrictions. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in a Feb. 20 interview with Bloomberg Television, suggested that Russia could see sanctions relief depending on its approach to negotiations. Trump himself told reporters on Feb. 26 that easing sanctions remained an option. The White House requested a potential sanctions relief plan before Trump extended a state of emergency last week over the war in Ukraine, the sources said. The state of emergency, first imposed in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea, allows the U.S. government to sanction individuals and organizations involved in the war. Despite Russia&#x2019;s ability to sustain a wartime economy through increased military spending and industrial production, experts say it remains vulnerable and in need of Western relief. The Kremlin has expressed interest in economic cooperation, particularly in rare earth metals. Putin recently suggested potential collaboration with the U.S. in that sector. Trump has also sought a minerals deal with Ukraine, which has significant lithium and rare earth metal reserves, as a way to offset the billions of dollars in American aid. However, his meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28 ended without an agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-administration-weighs-sanctions-relief-for-russia-reuters-reports/	2025-03-03T12:57:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1252236776.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Trump to discuss potential suspension of military aid for Ukraine	Key developments on March 3: U.S. President Donald Trump will discuss on March 3 the possible suspension or complete cancellation of military aid to Ukraine, including weapons pledged by the Biden administration, The New York Times (NYT) reported, citing an undisclosed source. The news comes after Trump&apos;s public spat with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28 that upended plans to sign a natural resources treaty between the two countries. An unnamed administration official told the NYT that Trump will meet on March 3 with his top national security aides, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, to review and potentially act on a range of policy options for Ukraine. Among the issues to be considered will be the suspension or cancellation of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, including the latest shipments of ammunition and equipment authorized during the Biden administration, the official said. Zelensky has repeatedly urged the U.S. to continue shipping arms to Ukraine to strengthen Kyiv&apos;s position in future peace negotiations with Russia. The Trump administration has not authorized new weapons shipments for Ukraine but has not halted those that were announced under the previous Biden administration. Reuters reported in early February that opposing factions within the administration had been debating whether the U.S. should continue providing weapons. The U.S. has provided Ukraine with $65.9 billion in military aid since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on March 2 that a number of European nations, including the U.K. and France, are developing a &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; that will include &quot;planes in the air and boots on the ground&quot; in an effort to negotiate a successful ceasefire in Ukraine. Starmer added that for any coalition to succeed, Europe must &quot;have strong U.S. backing.&quot; &quot;(European allies) will go forth to develop a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; to defend a deal in Ukraine and to guarantee the peace,&quot; Starmer said during a press conference following a European leaders&apos; summit in London. &quot;Not every nation will feel able to contribute, but that can&apos;t mean we sit back. Instead, those willing will intensify planning now with real urgency.&quot; &quot;The U.K. is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air. Together with others, Europe must do the heavy lifting,&quot; Starmer said. &quot;This is not a moment for more talk... If you want to preserve the peace, you have to defend the peace.&quot; Ukraine remains committed to working with the U.S. and European partners to secure peace and expects continued American support, Zelensky said on March 3. &quot;It is very important that we try to make our diplomacy really substantive to end this war the soonest possible,&quot; Zelensky posted on X. The statement comes after U.S. President Donald Trump lashed out at Zelensky for telling British media that a peace deal with Russia remains &quot;very, very far away.&quot; Trump called it &quot;the worst statement that could have been made&quot; and accused Zelensky of not wanting peace &quot;as long as he has America&apos;s backing.&quot; Zelensky countered that Ukraine needs real peace and that no one wants it more than Ukrainians, as the war continues to devastate cities and claim lives. &quot;Peace is needed as soon as possible,&quot; he said. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration wants to hear from Zelensky that he regrets the Oval Office clash, U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told Fox News on March 3. &quot;What we need to hear from President Zelensky is that he regrets what happened, that he&apos;s ready to sign this minerals deal, and that he&apos;s ready to engage in peace talks,&quot; Waltz said. Zelensky&apos;s visit to the White House on Feb. 28 was intended to finalize a long-debated agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine on jointly developing Ukraine&apos;s mineral resources. The press conference instead turned into a public clash, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance berating Zelensky. The Ukrainian president later left the White House without signing the deal. Following the talks, Trump accused Zelensky of &quot;disrespecting&quot; the U.S. in the Oval Office and said the Ukrainian president &quot;is not ready for peace.&quot; Waltz also claimed the confrontation proved that the Ukrainian president was not serious about peace negotiations. &quot;But here&apos;s the problem: time is not on his (Zelensky&apos;s) side. Time is not on the side of indefinitely continuing this conflict. The American people&apos;s patience is not unlimited. Their wallets are not unlimited. Our stockpiles and munitions are not unlimited,&quot; he said. Waltz suggested that Zelensky was jeopardizing Ukraine&apos;s long-term economic ties with the U.S. He said, &quot;He could leave the White House with the U.S. and Ukraine bound together economically for a generation.&quot; Following the exchange, some Republican lawmakers have ramped up criticism of Zelensky, with some even suggesting he may need to step aside. House Speaker Mike Johnson told NBC News on March 2 that Zelensky &quot;needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude, or someone else needs to lead the country.&quot; Waltz himself took aim at Zelensky in an interview with far-right Breitbart News on March 1, comparing him to &quot;an ex-girlfriend that wants to argue everything that you said.&quot; As U.S. officials continue to lambast the Ukrainian president over the incident, European allies gathered in London on March 2 to reaffirm their support for Zelensky and the embattled country. Russian forces struck a Ukrainian military training ground in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast on March 1 during a formation exercise, Mykhailo Drapatyi, commander of the Ground Forces of Ukraine, said on March 3. A day earlier, reports of a Russian attack with an Iskander-M ballistic missile on a training ground in the village of Cherkaske near the regional center of Dnipro began circulated on social media. The strike was allegedly carried out after an Orlan drone spotted a formation of soldiers about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the front line. Drapatyi did not disclose the number of Ukrainian soldiers killed and injured. He added that the truth about the attack could be hidden &quot;in the fog of bureaucracy&quot; but promised to prevent this. &quot;A tragedy at a training ground is a terrible consequence of an enemy strike. The war requires quick decisions, responsibility, and new safety standards; otherwise, we will lose more than we have,&quot; Drapatyi said. Drapatyi added he had launched an investigation into the circumstances of the strike and appointed an independent review with the participation of military counterintelligence. &quot;Everyone who made decisions that day, and everyone who did not make them on time, will be held accountable. No one will hide behind explanations or formal reports,&quot; he said. Later, on March 3, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said the head of the unit training center that was hit and the commander of the military unit had been suspended from duty. &quot;In the middle of the day, on March 1, the enemy attacked one of the military units on the territory of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine training ground in the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast,&quot; he said. &quot;As a result of the hit of the Iskander-M ballistic missile equipped with cluster munitions, there are dead and wounded,&quot; he added. Also on March 3, Ukraine&apos;s State Bureau of Investigation announced it was opening criminal proceedings into the &quot;death and injury of Ukrainian servicemen as a result of a Russian missile strike on a training ground in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.&quot; This is not the first time Russia has attacked Ukrainian troops while they are lining up in the rear. On November 3, 2023, in a village near the front line in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian forces attacked a group of soldiers. As a result of the Russian missile strike, 19 soldiers of the 128th Brigade and two civilians were killed. According to an investigation by Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry, the soldiers were gathered in the courtyard of a house during an awards ceremony while all camouflage rules were ignored. The Russian army is trying to break through the Russia-Ukraine border in Sumy Oblast and cut Ukrainian forces off from its logistics routes, State Border Guard spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said on March 3 on national television. Demchenko&apos;s statement comes after Russian forces attempted to cross the Russia-Ukraine border in Sumy Oblast near the village of Novenke but were repelled the previous week. Northeastern Sumy Oblast borders Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukrainian forces launched an incursion last summer to draw away Moscow&apos;s troops from Donbas and disrupt Russian plans for an offensive from the north. Demchenko said Russia is attempting to enter Ukrainian territory with assault groups in the direction of the village of Novenke, which lies just across the border, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the regional center, Sumy. The Ukrainian army is making every effort to prevent Russian units from gaining a foothold on Ukrainian territory, Demchenko said, adding that Russian troops mainly use &quot;large numbers of equipment and personnel&quot; in Kursk Oblast to achieve a breakthrough. &quot;These are not mass assaults. When the enemy tries to drive the Ukrainian Defense Forces out of Kursk Oblast, firstly, it puts pressure on our units within Kursk Oblast,&quot; Demchenko said. &quot;And then, it (Russia) is trying to expand the area of active combat activities, trying to enter the territory of Ukraine. However, all elements of the Defense Forces are operating in that area to prevent this. All available weapons are being used,&quot; he added. Russia plans to launch at least 500 drones per aerial attack against Ukraine, Vadym Skibitsky, the deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), said in an interview with RBC Ukraine published on March 3. Both Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology throughout the war, significantly altering modern warfare tactics. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russia has launched thousands of cheap but effective drones at Ukraine. Russia currently uses 150 to 200 drones per attack against Ukraine, which occur on a daily basis, but Russian forces plan to increase their capabilities to 500, Skibitsky told RBC Ukraine. Russia also plans to increase the number of sites from which drones will be launched. Russian forces have significantly increased domestic production of various types of drones, according to Skibitskyi. Russia uses combat and reconnaissance drones, as well as so-called &quot;decoys,&quot; which are drones without a payload, he added. &quot;All of this simply overloads our air defense system. It is very difficult to distinguish between a drone flying with a warhead and one without,&quot; Skibitsky said.

Sanctions, shrinking exports spark crisis in Russia's coal industry, media reports	Western sanctions and shrinking export opportunities in Asia have triggered a severe crisis in Russia&apos;s coal industry, particularly in Kemerovo Oblast, the country&apos;s key coal-producing region, the Moscow Times reported on March 3. &#xA0; Kemerovo Oblast, or Kuzbass, which accounts for 60% of Russia&apos;s hard coal production and 80% of its coking coal, has been hit the hardest. Financial troubles have forced eight coal companies in the region to halt operations, leaving hundreds of miners without pay for months, according to Kemerovo Governor Ilya Seredyuk. &quot;Falling prices on world markets, problems with logistics, a shortage of personnel, and a high key rate &#x2014; along with Western sanctions &#x2014; have created a serious challenge for the coal industry,&quot; Seredyuk said. Russia has attempted to shift coal exports to Asia after losing access to Western markets, but demand has declined. In 2023, Indian coal imports from Russia fell by 37%, while Chinese imports dropped by 13%. As a result, total coal exports from Kuzbass fell by 10.4%, and regional production declined by 7.3% to 198.4 million tons (396 million pounds). Despite Moscow&apos;s deepening economic ties with Beijing, Western sanctions have become an increasing hurdle to Russian-Chinese trade, further compounding financial losses and bankruptcies in Russia&apos;s coal sector.	https://kyivindependent.com/sanctions-shrinking-exports-spark-coal-crisis-in-russias-kemerovo-region-media-reports/	2025-03-03T11:47:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1234072071.jpg
Why is Ukraine not accepted into NATO?	NATO membership for Ukraine is becoming increasingly elusive. The previous U.S. administration has been silently opposing extending a NATO invitation to Ukraine. The current U.S. administration has made its opposition public. &quot;You can forget about (NATO membership). That&apos;s probably the reason the whole thing (war) started,&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 26 when asked about the potential settlement between Ukraine and Russia. Such a policy by Ukraine&apos;s main backer has raised eyebrows in the past. It doesn&apos;t anymore. For decades, Russian officials and propaganda have been using NATO enlargement as a justification for the Kremlin&apos;s hostile action toward the country&apos;s neighbors, including its wars against Ukraine and Georgia. Despite the U.S. and other NATO member states giving a variety of reasons why they have been against welcoming Ukraine to the military alliance, experts the Kyiv Independent spoke to said the only real reason for keeping Kyiv out is Moscow&apos;s stance on the issue. &quot;The Biden administration was always fearful of escalation in the conflict with Russia. The Trump administration has its own reasons, probably linked to any deal it&apos;s trying to strike with Moscow on a ceasefire,&quot; Mark Webber, non-resident associate fellow at the NATO Defense College, told the Kyiv Independent. NATO follows &quot;an open door&quot; policy, meaning that a new country can be invited to join the alliance with the consent of all 32 members. The requirements for future candidates include support for democracy, development of a market economy, civilian control of the armed forces, respect for the sovereignty of other countries, and work on interoperability with NATO forces. The first step to joining the alliance is receiving a Membership Action Plan (MAP) with recommendations for the candidate country. In 2008, Ukraine applied to receive the MAP and was able to secure the backing from U.S. President George W. Bush. Yet, under increased pressure from Russian President Vladimir Putin, the alliance members, primarily Germany and France, rejected Ukraine&apos;s aspirations to join NATO. Kyiv returned to the path of Euro-Atlantic integration years later, after Russia launched its war against Ukraine, occupying Crimea and parts of the country&apos;s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

(Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Before the start of the war, most Ukrainians didn&apos;t support joining a military union and preferred their country to remain a neutral state. Following the start of the war, NATO membership was supported by the majority of the population, peaking at over 80% following the start of the all-out war in 2022. In late 2022, Ukraine applied for an accelerated accession to the alliance, and in 2023, NATO leaders ruled that Kyiv could become a member without the need for a Membership Action Plan. Yet, Kyiv wasn&apos;t invited to join, unlike Finland and Sweden that are also in close proximity to Russia. &quot;Ukraine is seemingly unusual in that it is a large, important pro-NATO country, which wants to join the alliance but has not generated consensus amongst it to be admitted,&quot; Webber said. NATO members could also be restrained by the level of potential obligations to a country that joined the alliance while it is at war and by the provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty on collective defense, enshrined in Article 5, according to the expert. The article suggests that an attack on one member is an attack on all member states, however, it doesn&apos;t clearly define the actions that member states are obligated to take. Among the reasons Ukraine was denied membership in the past were the lack of transparency in defense procurement and the allegedly high level of corruption in the country, as the Biden administration hinted previously. Yet Webber said NATO has already been joined by countries with &quot;a poor record when it comes to corruption.&quot; &quot;Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania joined NATO and the European Union, even though I think it would be fair to say that their political, economic system and even the management of defense procurement had a whiff of corruption about it,&quot; Webber said. &quot;I think it&apos;s probably an excuse that is used (against Ukraine),&quot; he added. &quot;Ultimately, the geostrategic problem and the fear of antagonizing Russia is the most significant obstacle.&quot; This opinion is shared by Stefan Wolff, professor of international security at the University of Birmingham. &quot;Russia, arguably, feels more threatened by Ukrainian NATO membership because (Vladimir) Putin clearly cannot accept that Ukraine &apos;turns against&apos; Russia and because Ukraine, unlike Finland or Sweden, is integral to Putin&apos;s vision of a Russian sphere of influence,&quot; Wolff said. Russia attempted to justify its invasion of Ukraine by an alleged threat from NATO, among other reasons. Now, the Kremlin is putting a ban on Ukraine to ever joining NATO among its main demands for concluding a potential peace agreement to end the war it had started. Several NATO members, including the U.K., France, Italy, Poland, and the Baltic states, have supported Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO, calling it an essential security guarantee. Yet, two key members, U.S. and Germany, as well as Hungary and Slovakia, have declared that they do not support this step. &quot;Germany has traditionally been cautious when it comes to upsetting opinions in Russia,&quot; Webber said. It&apos;s difficult to predict whether this position will change under Friedrich Merz, who is set to become Germany&apos;s next chancellor in the upcoming months. Merz has been seen as a pro-Ukrainian politician, recently calling for transferring German-made long-range Taurus missiles to Ukraine, which Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been hesitant to do. Regarding Slovakia and Hungary, experts agree that with prime ministers Robert Fico and Viktor Orban in office, it would be hard to push those countries to support an invitation to Ukraine. Bratislava and Budapest continue to argue that Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO will lead to an escalation with Russia. The main obstacle would, of course, be Washington, with the current administration signaling that Ukraine is not welcome to join an alliance or to receive any sort of security guarantee. At the same time, Wolff noted that joining NATO may not meet Kyiv&apos;s expectations on security guarantees. &quot;The key question, to which nobody really has an answer at the moment, is whether, under Trump, the deterrent effect of Article 5 still has any credible meaning. If it doesn&apos;t, then joining the alliance would not give Ukraine the security it deserves,&quot; Wolff said.	https://kyivindependent.com/why-is-ukraine-not-accepted-into-nato/	2025-03-03T11:25:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1534871526.jpg

The worst statement' â€” Trump criticizes Zelensky for saying peace deal with Russia is far away	U.S. President Donald Trump criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky on March 3 for saying that a peace deal with Russia remains &quot;very, very far away.&quot; Zelensky made the remark in a March 2 interview with British media, saying that negotiations were in the earliest stages and that a settlement with Moscow remains a distant prospect. &quot;This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky, and America will not put up with it for much longer,&quot; Trump posted on Truth Social. Trump seized on the statement, using it as alleged evidence that Zelensky does not want peace. &quot;This guy doesn&apos;t want there to be peace as long as he has America&apos;s backing,&quot; Trump wrote, claiming that European leaders had told Zelensky they &quot;cannot do the job without the U.S.&quot; The comments follow Zelensky&apos;s early departure from Washington on Feb. 28 without signing a U.S.-Ukraine mineral deal after a tense confrontation with Trump and Vice President JD Vance at the White House.

5 ways you can support Ukraine â€” even if your government doesn't want to	Editor&#x2019;s note: We originally shared a version of this guide for our members on Feb. 24, 2024. If you would like to join a community of people united by wanting to help Ukraine, consider becoming a member today. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s public spat with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28 threw the future of Washington&apos;s support for Ukraine in the air, but led to a renewed outpouring of support for Ukraine across the world. As Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine enters its fourth year, and Trump mulls cutting military aid entirely, here are some ways to help Ukraine and stand with Ukrainians. Contact your elected representatives, regardless of where you live. In the U.S., the American Coalition for Ukraine has a tool to find your members of Congress and recommended messaging for what to ask your government representatives. Finding a local group organizing political support for Ukraine in your country or city is a great starting point for getting more involved. You can also find and support candidates who support Ukraine in upcoming elections. It&#x2019;s also possible to boycott international companies that still operate within Russia. The Kyiv School of Economics has made a list of corporations that continue to do business in Russia. The mobile version of the website even has a barcode scanner, so you can easily find the details about a product&#x2019;s parent company. Also, consider supporting Ukrainian brands or local businesses. You can check out our Ukrainian gift guide for inspiration.

Ukraine bonds drop sharply following Trump-Zelensky argument, Reuters reports	Ukraine&apos;s international bonds fell to their lowest point in over a month on March 3 after a heated exchange between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump last week, Reuters reported. According to Tradeweb data cited by Reuters, the 2036 maturity experienced the steepest decline, dropping 4.5 cents to 60.775 cents on the dollar and reaching a one-month low. Bonds tied to economic performance declined the most, with trading activity remaining high, one trader told Reuters. Following Trump&#x2019;s election in November last year, Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereign bonds rose in price as investors expected a quicker end to the war, the Financial Times reported on Nov. 14. But Ukraine&apos;s debt has fluctuated dramatically in recent weeks due to geopolitical tensions and uncertainty about Trump&apos;s willingness to support the war-torn country. Tensions escalated in mid-February when Trump called Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; while improving relations with Russia, causing bond prices to drop sharply, Reuters reported. Ukraine&apos;s GDP warrant, which increases payouts during strong economic growth, also came under pressure, dropping around 2 cents to trade at just over 80 cents on March 3. &quot;The new U.S. administration calls for pessimism,&quot; Paul McNamara at GAM told Reuters. &quot;I see no economic reason to invest.&quot; According to Reuters, most bonds had recovered many losses last week as investors anticipated a minerals agreement during Zelensky&apos;s Washington visit, potentially securing Trump&apos;s backing for Ukraine&apos;s war effort. This optimism collapsed after Friday&apos;s confrontation ended in shouting in the Oval Office, prompting Zelensky to cut his visit short. Ukraine completed a debt restructuring with bondholders last September and now owes around $15.2 billion across eight new series of bonds, as well as $2.6 billion on a GDP warrant. The exchange reduced Ukraine&apos;s external debt by about $9 billion. The earliest maturity date for the new bonds is 2029.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-bonds-drop-sharply-following-trump-zelensky-argument-reuters-reports/	2025-03-03T10:01:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2202528427-1.jpg
US wants Zelensky to 'regret' Oval Office clash, sign minerals deal, Waltz says	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration wants to hear from President Volodymyr Zelensky that he regrets the Oval Office clash, U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told Fox News on March 3. &quot;What we need to hear from President Zelensky is that he regrets what happened, that he&apos;s ready to sign this minerals deal, and that he&apos;s ready to engage in peace talks,&quot; Waltz said. Zelensky&apos;s visit to the White House on Feb. 28 was intended to finalize a long-debated agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine on jointly developing Ukraine&apos;s mineral resources. The press conference instead turned into a public clash, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance berating Zelensky. The Ukrainian president later left the White House without signing the deal. Following the talks, Trump accused Zelensky of &quot;disrespecting&quot; the U.S. in the Oval Office and said the Ukrainian president &quot;is not ready for peace.&quot; Waltz also claimed the confrontation proved that the Ukrainian president was not serious about peace negotiations. &quot;But here&apos;s the problem: time is not on his (Zelensky&apos;s) side. Time is not on the side of indefinitely continuing this conflict. The American people&apos;s patience is not unlimited. Their wallets are not unlimited. Our stockpiles and munitions are not unlimited,&quot; he said. Waltz suggested that Zelensky was jeopardizing Ukraine&apos;s long-term economic ties with the U.S. He said, &quot;He could leave the White House with the U.S. and Ukraine bound together economically for a generation.&quot; Following the exchange, some Republican lawmakers have ramped up criticism of Zelensky, with some even suggesting he may need to step aside. House Speaker Mike Johnson told NBC News on March 2 that Zelensky &quot;needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude, or someone else needs to lead the country.&quot; Waltz himself took aim at Zelensky in an interview with far-right Breitbart News on March 1, comparing him to &quot;an ex-girlfriend that wants to argue everything that you said.&quot; As U.S. officials continue to lambast the Ukrainian president over the incident, European allies gathered in London on March 2 to reaffirm their support for Zelensky and the embattled country.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-needs-to-regret-oval-office-clash-sign-minerals-deal-waltz-says/	2025-03-03T09:15:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193394562.jpg
US deliberately orchestrated Zelensky-Trump Oval Office clash, Friedrich Merz says	The American side deliberately orchestrated the confrontation during President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s visit to the White House, Friedrich Merz, the head of Germany&apos;s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the likely chancellor, said on March 3. &quot;It was not a spontaneous reaction to interventions by Zelensky, but obviously a manufactured escalation in this meeting in the Oval Office,&quot; Merz said at a press conference in Hamburg. The visit was expected to mark the signing of a long-debated agreement between Ukraine and the U.S. on jointly developing Ukraine&apos;s mineral resources. The press conference between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump turned into a heated exchange, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance berating the Ukrainian leader. Zelensky left the White House without an agreement in hand. Merz said he was &quot;quite surprised, including by the mutual tone of the dialogue,&quot; adding that the incident fit a pattern in recent U.S. behavior. &quot;There is a certain sequence in a number of events in recent weeks and months, including the appearance of the American delegation in Munich at the security conference, and we are now seeing it from Washington,&quot; he said. At the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14, Vance stunned European leaders with a speech attacking European values and calling for cooperation with far-right parties. According to Merz, these events serve as a wake-up call for Europe&apos;s security policy. &quot;I am in favor of preparing for the fact that in the coming years and decades we will have to do much, much more for our own security,&quot; he said. Merz, whose CDU party won Germany&apos;s recent elections, is expected to become chancellor once coalition talks conclude. He has been a vocal critic of the outgoing government&apos;s Ukraine policy and has condemned Trump&apos;s shifting stance on the war. On Feb. 21, Merz called Trump&apos;s statements about Ukraine &quot;shocking&quot; and aligning with Russian narratives.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-deliberately-escalated-tensions-during-zelenskys-white-house-visit-merz-says/	2025-03-03T07:52:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1929925182.jpg
EU weighs satellite alternatives for Ukraine amid Starlink concerns, Politico reports	The European Commission is assessing ways to help Ukraine secure satellite communications in case access to the Starlink network is restricted, Politico reported on March 3. Starlink has played a vital role in Ukraine&apos;s battlefield communications, with around 42,000 terminals providing service to the military, medical facilities, businesses, and aid organizations. The review comes amid reports that the U.S. threatened to cut Ukraine&apos;s access to Starlink if Kyiv did not reach a deal with Washington over critical mineral resources. On Feb. 22, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk denied that the U.S. had made such a threat. Ukraine had shown interest in alternative satellite options, including Govsatcom, a shared network of EU national government satellites, and IRIS, a new constellation expected to be operational in the 2030s, according to European Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier. Member of the European Parliament Christophe Grudler urged the EU to &quot;assess all possible alternative satellite solutions that the EU could offer Ukraine&quot; as a Starlink replacement. Le chantage am&#xE9;ricain pour la fourniture du service internet par satellite Starlink est inacceptable.Je demande &#xE0; @EU_Commission d&apos;&#xE9;tudier toutes les solutions alternatives par satellite que l&#x2019;UE pourrait proposer &#xE0; l&#x2019;Ukraine.Y compris GovSatCom ou des capacit&#xE9;s commerciales. pic.twitter.com/H2zblWNpKA He suggested that Govsatcom deployment could be expedited this year by skipping the certification process and providing a temporary solution while IRIS is being developed. SpaceX began supplying Starlink terminals to Ukraine shortly after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, giving Kyiv a critical advantage in battlefield connectivity. Musk, whom U.S. President Donald Trump has tasked with eliminating &quot;fraud&quot; and &quot;waste&quot; in the U.S. budget, has become increasingly vocal in criticizing Ukraine and amplifying Russian disinformation. He has also called for shutting down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which provided vital humanitarian aid to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-weighs-satellite-alternatives-for-ukraine-amid-starlink-concerns-politico-reports/	2025-03-03T07:16:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1813800965.jpeg
Russiaâ€™s FSB 'neutralizes' alleged terrorist planning attack in Moscow	Russia&#x2019;s Federal Security Service (FSB) shot to death a suspected terrorist who was allegedly preparing an attack on the Moscow subway station and a Jewish institution, Russian media reported on Mar. 3. While being detained in Moscow region, the suspect resisted arrest and was &quot;neutralized&quot; during a shootout, the Public Relations Center of the FSB said, in comments reported by Interfax-Russia Firearms and chemical substances for assembling explosive devices were reportedly found and seized during a subsequent investigation at the suspect&apos;s apartment. &quot;The terrorist intended to carry out the detonation of self-made explosive materials,&quot; the FSB said. The suspect was a Russian citizen originating from Central Asia and is alleged to have been a member of an international terrorist organization banned in Russia. After the attack, he planned to join a terrorist organization in Afghanistan, the FSB claimed. According to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, four terrorism suspects were killed by the FSB this year so far. One of them was accused by Russia of undergoing training in Kyiv before preparation of an attack against a Russian official. The State Duma passed a bill on Dec. 12 expanding the criteria for the &apos;Terrorists and Extremists&apos; registry, including political, religious, ideological, racial or national hatred. According to the U.S.-based think tank Institute for the Study of War (ISW), the proposed bill would provide &quot;significant leeway to designate people who have allegedly committed a wide array of crimes as terrorists and extremists.&quot; The law is to take effect on June 1, 2025, Deutsche Welle reported. Russia has been regularly &#xA0;accused of arbitrarily jailing political opponents and dissidents accused of politically-motivated hatred. According to the ISW, in seeking to control dissent, the Kremlin is &quot;looking to change the mechanisms for adding people to the terrorist and extremist list in order to incentivize Russians to engage in self-censorship by tightening the Kremlin&apos;s control over criticism in Russian society, especially about Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-fsb-neutralizes-alleged-terrorist-planning-attack-in-moscow/	2025-03-03T06:45:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1249615636.jpg
Russia trying to break through border in Sumy Oblast, cut off Ukraine's Kursk logistics routes, Border Guard says	The Russian army is trying to break through the Russia-Ukraine border in Sumy Oblast and cut Ukrainian forces off from its logistics routes, State Border Guard spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said on March 3 on national television. Demchenko&apos;s statement comes after Russian forces attempted to cross the Russia-Ukraine border in Sumy Oblast near the village of Novenke but were repelled the previous week. Northeastern Sumy Oblast borders Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukrainian forces launched an incursion last summer to draw away Moscow&apos;s troops from Donbas and disrupt Russian plans for an offensive from the north. Demchenko said Russia is attempting to enter Ukrainian territory with assault groups in the direction of the village of Novenke that lies just across the border, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the regional center, Sumy. The Ukrainian army is making every effort to prevent Russian units from gaining a foothold on Ukrainian territory, Demchenko said, adding that Russian troops mainly use &quot;large numbers of equipment and personnel&quot; in Kursk Oblast to achieve a breakthrough. &quot;These are not mass assaults. When the enemy tries to drive the Ukrainian Defense Forces out of Kursk Oblast, firstly, it puts pressure on our units within Kursk Oblast,&quot; Demchenko said. &quot;And then, it (Russia) is trying to expand the area of active combat activities, trying to enter the territory of Ukraine. However, all elements of the Defense Forces are operating in that area to prevent this. All available weapons are being used,&quot; he added. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, the Russian military claimed. Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000 in Kursk Oblast, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 6. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said last November that the incursion thwarted Russia&apos;s plans to invade Sumy Oblast in an attempt to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-trying-to-break-through-border-in-sumy-oblast-cut-off-logistics-routes-of-ukrainian-forces-border-guard-says/	2025-03-03T06:20:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2174582368.jpg
Russia plans to launch 500 kamikaze drones per day at Ukraine, HUR says	Russia plans to launch at least 500 drones per aerial attack against Ukraine, Vadym Skibitskyi, the deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), said in an interview with RBC Ukraine published on March 3. Both Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology throughout the war, significantly altering modern warfare tactics. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russia has launched thousands of cheap but effective drones at Ukraine. Russia currently uses 150 to 200 drones per attack against Ukraine which occur on a daily basis, but Russian forces plan to increase their capabilities to 500, Skibitskyi told RBC Ukraine. Russia also plans to increase the number of sites from which drones will be launched. Russian forces have significantly increased domestic production of various types of drones, according to Skibitskyi. Russia uses combat and reconnaissance drones, as well as so-called &quot;decoys,&quot; which are drones without a payload, he added. &quot;All of this simply overloads our air defense system. It is very difficult to distinguish between a drone flying with a warhead and one without,&quot; Skibitskyi said. &quot;Earlier, in 2023 and early 2024, we knew only a Shahed (drone), then there were Geran-1, Geran-2, and that was it. Today, the range of these unmanned aerial vehicles is so large that it is not even always possible to count them on one hand,&quot; Skibitsky added. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Feb. 6. Russia is forming unmanned systems forces and plans to recruit up to 210,000 personnel for the new branch by 2030. Ukraine, as well as Russia, has continuously expanded its drone capabilities, using aerial, naval, and ground-based systems for reconnaissance, precision strikes, and other operations. The country&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces announced on Jan. 31 that Ukrainian troops are now employing a long-range drone capable of traveling up to 2,000 kilometers (1,242 miles) while carrying a 250-kilogram air bomb.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-plans-to-launch-at-least-500-drones-in-ukraine-in-one-aerial-attack-ukraines-intelligence-says/	2025-03-03T05:44:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1244030448-1665987223fwizj.jpg
Trumpâ€™s Oval Office clash with Zelensky killed diplomacy	The showdown between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Feb. 28 shocked the entire world. But instead of analyzing its political impact, let&#x2019;s focus on the details of manners, gestures, which may seem less important than the issues at stake, but reveal more about the underlying basic stance. The first thing that stands out is the behavior of two arrogant and self-assured U.S. politicians treating the leader of Ukraine &#x2014; who was under immense pressure, on the verge of a breakdown &#x2014; in an extremely disrespectful and brutal manner. The only country whose representatives I know to use such brutal language is Russia. Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova wrote: &quot;How Trump and Vance held back from hitting that scumbag is a miracle of restraint.&quot; As expected, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev joined in, calling Zelensky a &quot;cocaine clown.&quot; But such statements are made by second-tier figures, never top leaders. At the level of public diplomacy, Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance violated the rules even respected by figures like Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Mao Zedong. The only other regime that sometimes resorts to similar brutality is North Korea &#x2014; no surprise that Trump has openly praised North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un as a good leader and even called him a friend. Before Zelensky even entered the room, White House staff criticized him for allegedly showing disrespect by not being properly dressed. The entire treatment of Zelensky was disrespectful. What makes it even worse is that Trump, a man who set new standards in public vulgarity, now shamelessly condemns others for disrespect. The ultimate obscenity is reproaching someone for disrespect in a manner that, in itself, is a blatant act of disrespect. Even a simple AI like ChatGPT has better manners than Trump and Vance in a conversation. Additionally, U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz described Zelensky&apos;s reaction to being dismissed with a tasteless metaphor: &quot;It&apos;s like, you know, an ex-girlfriend who wants to argue about everything you said nine years ago, instead of moving the relationship forward.&quot; So, was the open conflict in the Oval Office a spontaneous outburst? At the very least, this obscene exchange had been brewing, waiting to explode. We should bear in mind that, at the level of substantive content, nothing new happened. To put it in Hegelian terms, this was a passage from &#x201C;An sich&#x201D; (in-itself) to &#x201C;F&#xFC;r sich&#x201D; (for-itself) &#x2014; from mere background presence to the explicit positing of content. This shift changes everything: once something is directly stated, it cannot be undone. Everyone in a group might know something that is only in itself and could interpret it away as a misunderstanding, but once it&#x2019;s out in the open, it&#x2019;s a different matter. In the case of the Oval Office meeting, although tensions had always been palpable, things became tense when Vance pressed Zelensky for not appreciating the United States&#x2019; help in Ukraine&#x2019;s war with Russia. What followed was an open shouting match &#x2014; something unheard of in diplomacy, where such direct and brutal exchanges are typically saved for behind closed doors. As some commentators noted, diplomacy died in the Oval Office. What we witnessed was something more akin to a low-level negotiation between mafia bosses. Vance&#x2019;s argument, that after years of trying to break Russia with arms, the time has come for diplomacy, is so full of holes that its inconsistency is glaring. War (Russian aggression) erupted after years of ineffective diplomatic attempts &#x2014; when Russia occupied Crimea in 2014, diplomacy achieved nothing. The heroic Ukrainian resistance, supported by the West, didn&#x2019;t fail; it created conditions for possible negotiations. Without this resistance, Ukraine would no longer exist as a state. And, as we&#x2019;ve already seen, who are Trump and Vance to talk about diplomacy after they&#x2019;ve broken all its rules? It&#x2019;s na&#xEF;ve to claim that exposing tensions will clarify the situation. First, as we&#x2019;ve seen, making things public can preclude possible solutions by adding acts of aggression and humiliation. Second, and more important, what occurred in the Oval Office was not a process of bringing out true tensions: the situation remained obscured, with Trump clearly angry at Ukraine and Europe, and Zelensky placed in an impossible position &#x2014; he had to defend Ukraine&#x2019;s vital interests, which were ignored by the U.S., while also showing respect and gratitude, knowing Ukraine&#x2019;s survival depends on U.S. support. U.S. President Donald Trump (R) and President Volodymyr Zelensky (L) meet in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S. Feb. 28, 2025. (Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)Should we blame Zelensky? Shouldn&#x2019;t he have been more aware of the need for U.S. help and acted more considerately? A contrast is clear with French President Emmanuel Macron and, especially, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who, as Owen Jones pointed out, during his last visit to Washington, virtually disappeared up Trump&#x2019;s backside. I believe Zelensky should not only not be reproached &#x2014; on the contrary, we should fully appreciate his tragic predicament. He defended himself clearly and counterattacked, but he had to combine this with a humiliating respect for Trump, who supports the Russian agenda. Trump&#x2019;s claim that Zelensky doesn&#x2019;t want a ceasefire but a continuous war was simply a lie: of course, Zelensky wanted peace, but &#x2014; quite understandably &#x2014; a peace that would not just be a ceasefire opening the door for Russian reorganization and renewed attack. To paraphrase Carl von Clausewitz&#x2019;s well-known definition of war as a continuation of politics by other means, such a ceasefire would be a continuation of war with peaceful means. Trump&#x2019;s repeated metaphor of cards is also misleading &#x2014; Zelensky was right to reply, &quot;I don&#x2019;t play cards.&quot; Jews didn&#x2019;t hold any good cards in Nazi Germany, especially after 1938, but should we have told them, &quot;Sorry, you don&#x2019;t have good cards &#x2014; you want our full support, but this could lead to a new world war&quot;? How can one argue against that logic? After Trump and Vance humiliated Zelensky for not showing enough gratitude, he posted a brief message on X: &#x201C;Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.&#x201D; Was this almost compulsive repetition of &#x201C;thanks&#x201D; meant to show gratitude for the lack of which Trump and Vance criticized him, or is there an element of irony in this message, whether intentional or not? When Trump evokes humanitarian reasons, there is always a hidden horror behind it. Remember that he also claimed Gaza should be emptied for humanitarian reasons, but neither in Gaza nor Ukraine did he ask the obvious question: who is responsible for the destruction? Both in Gaza and in Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, &quot;America First&quot; clearly means business. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio extolled the &#x201C;extraordinary opportunities, economic and geopolitical, that the U.S. and Russia could both seize once the war in Ukraine was over.&#x201D; This emphasis on business is not just an ideology, but one thoroughly intertwined with specific ideological-political choices. Business presupposes a set of unwritten rules that should be respected &#x2014; basic trust is fundamental. These rules are violated by Trump, who turns business into a brutal game of blackmail. As for political choices: why treat China as the main enemy and dismiss any &#x201C;extraordinary opportunities&#x201D; for collaboration with China? Why, especially, does Trump repeatedly characterize Europe as the main foe of the U.S., including the absurd claim that the EU was created to &quot;screw&quot; the U.S.? The story is well-known, so there&#x2019;s no need to repeat it here. And there&#x2019;s no need to point out what Europe should do: if Trump claims the EU was made to screw the U.S., then Europe should respond fully &#x2014; politically, economically, and militarily &#x2014; all options should be on the table, including a new alliance with China and de-dollarization. In short, Europe should unite as much as possible and declare a state of emergency. What Trump is doing in his obscene actions is applying to politics the stances he declared publicly years ago. The horror of such actions extends well beyond economic extortion and the violation of diplomatic norms. When someone acts legally, their external acts do not violate any legal prohibitions or regulations. However, politeness &#x2014; manners, gallantry, etc. &#x2014; is more than just obeying external legality. It&#x2019;s the ambiguously imprecise domain of what one is not strictly obligated to do (but is expected to do). This is part of our unspoken customs and expectations, something rooted in our inherited substance of social mores. Incidentally, this is the self-destructive deadlock of Political Correctness: it tries to formulate and legalize manners. Trump and Vance, great opponents of Political Correctness, acted precisely this way when they forced Zelensky into an impossible position by demanding that he explicitly say &#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D; Trumpian discourse (in its strict Lacanian sense of a social link sustained by speech) poses a threat to the very substance of our social life. It contributes directly to the social disintegration that many analysts have noted. The lack of manners excludes others from communication: I pretend to listen to my partner, but I don&#x2019;t really hear them. This stance is becoming a mass phenomenon. Here&#x2019;s what Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said after the Oval Office meeting: &#x201C;What I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful, and I don&#x2019;t know if we could ever do business with Zelensky again. I think most Americans saw a guy that they would not want to go into business with, the way he handled the meeting.&#x201D; Again, the term &#x201C;business&#x201D; is revealing here. Graham then urged Zelensky to prioritize a minerals deal over security guarantees or a ceasefire with Russia &#x2014; an obscenity if there ever was one. The minerals deal was a clear case of extortion by the U.S.: you get our help if you pay for it &#x2014; estimated by Trump at $350 billion, which is more than the actual sum &#x2014; by allowing the U.S. to exploit your natural resources for decades to come. In other words, the minerals deal was a price for security guarantees. A minerals deal without security guarantees is meaningless for Ukraine. The whole affair becomes even more obscene when we combine it with Trump and Vance&#x2019;s demands for gratitude: Ukraine must say &#x201C;Thank you!&#x201D; for help and then pay for it. A classic example of political &#x201C;realism&#x201D; &#x2014; Trump and his gang like to present themselves as &#x201C;realists,&#x201D; repeating the mantra that they just want to prevent the concrete suffering, destruction, and death of ordinary people. However, as John Ganz insightfully pointed out, such &#x201C;realist&#x201D; views (practiced by Henry Kissinger, for example) ignore the concrete suffering of hundreds of thousands of individuals. Zelensky told Vance about the Russian threat: &quot;You have a nice ocean and don&#x2019;t feel it now, but you will in the future.&quot; Trump immediately jumped in: &quot;Don&#x2019;t tell us what we&#x2019;re going to feel!&quot; Trump&#x2019;s arrogance seduced him into misreading Zelensky: his &#x201C;you will feel it&#x201D; had nothing to do with subjective feeling; it referred to political and military pressure. Trump, however, took it as Zelensky ordering him how to feel &#x2014; if anyone should have been ordered to feel gratitude, it was Zelensky. In a normal exchange between allies, Zelensky should have responded that it is Ukraine that deserves respect and gratitude for defending not only its own sovereignty but also the freedom of all of Europe and, ultimately, the U.S. Editor&#x2019;s Note: The opinions expressed in the op-ed section are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/slavoj-zizek-trumps-oval-office-clash-with-zelensky-killed-diplomacy/	2025-03-03T05:31:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202563777.jpg
Trump says US should spend' less time worrying about Putin'	U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 2 that the U.S. should &quot;spend less time worrying about Putin,&quot; and instead focus on immigrants who engage in a range of alleged criminal behavior. &quot;We should spend less time worrying about Putin, and more time worrying about migrant rape gangs, drug lords, murderers, and people from mental institutions entering our country &#x2014; &#xA0;so that we don&#x2019;t end up like Europe!&quot; he said in a post on Truth Social. The post comes just days after the U.S. under Trump&apos;s administration welcomed Andrew and Tristan Tate &#x2014; &#xA0;social media influencers accused of rape, human trafficking, and money laundering &#x2014; into the country from Romania where they were under criminal investigation. Trump&apos;s comments are the latest instalment of a widening gulf between the U.S., and Ukraine and its European allies. His public spat with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28 upended plans to sign a natural resources treaty between the two countries. The leaders of France and the U.K. visited the U.S. last week to convince Trump to play a role in Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability, but their diplomatic efforts were overshadowed by the unprecedented and televised quarrel in the White House. The humiliating treatment Zelensky received from Trump and Vice President JD Vance prompted Europe&apos;s leaders to speak out in support of the Ukrainian president. At the same time, some European officials have appealed to Zelensky to mend ties with Trump to ensure continued U.S. engagement.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-says-us-should-spend-less-time-worrying-about-putin/	2025-03-03T05:26:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2154393954.jpg
6 silver linings of the Trump-Zelensky showdown	The ambush by hired hand U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the White House Oval Office at high noon on Feb. 28 made for great theater, more 24-hour TV than diplomacy. At first, it seemed like an absolute disaster for President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukraine, potentially risking the withdrawal of U.S. military support and even harder days ahead in Ukrainians&#x2019; existential fight for survival against Russia. But after the dust settled on the Oval Office saloon floor, a few silver linings for Ukraine became clear. First, while the minerals deal hardly seemed worth the paper it was written on for Ukraine &#x2014; offering zero real commitments, whether security or financial, from the U.S. &#x2014; it did give Zelensky one thing: time in the White House. A chance to make Ukraine&#x2019;s case and, in the worst case, to truly assess where the Trump administration stands: with Russia or with Ukraine. If it was the former, at least Ukraine would know and could plan accordingly rather than be left in limbo. As it turned out, the worst-case scenario played out. The aggression from both Vance and U.S. President Donald Trump toward Zelensky made it clear: they stand with Russia. Trump even repeated his infamous Helsinki summit claim &#x2014; that he trusts Russian President Vladimir Putin more than Ukraine&#x2019;s leadership. Ukraine now knows the U.S. does not stand behind it, and it will be better prepared as a result. It will have to adapt its strategies and seek other options. Second, the U.S. position has now been exposed to the world. It stands behind Russia and can no longer be viewed as a neutral arbiter in peace talks. In fact, Washington has lost its right to lead those negotiations. Before the Oval Office showdown, Ukraine and Europe had largely been sidelined from the peace process, which was driven by the U.S. and Russia. Ukraine and Europe feared an imposed settlement &#x2014; one unlikely to be sustainable. But the White House debacle forced Europe to step up and take the initiative. The result? Any future peace deal is now more likely to be in Ukraine&#x2019;s favor and more durable. Trump was casual about Ukraine&#x2019;s legitimate security concerns, but Europe can now put them front and center. The initiative has shifted away from Russia and the U.S. &#x2014; both of which had been working against the interests of Ukraine and Europe. In fact, the four-point peace plan proposed by the U.K., along with Britain, Italy, and France leading the way, seemed pragmatic: arm Ukraine, give it the tools to defend itself, push for a one-month truce (focused on air and sea, where verification is easier), and only then move toward a full ceasefire. Europe has made clear that Ukraine needs security guarantees &#x2014; and the arms to enforce them.

(Justin Tallis/Pool/AFP via Getty Images)Third, the White House fiasco should be Europe&#x2019;s final wake-up call: NATO as we knew it is dead, the U.S. security guarantee for Europe is over, and if Europeans care about their own defense, they need to act. And, judging by the weekend&#x2019;s response, they have. There are now zero excuses for Europe not to massively ramp up defense spending and rebuild its hard power. None. Yes, European defense spending will increase, but the continent still faces capacity constraints in military industries. In the short term, reliance on the U.S. is inevitable. But Europe has leverage &#x2014; if it chooses to use it. Europe will spend more on defense, but it will need to buy weapons from the U.S. in the short term. If it were smart, it would get ahead of the curve by committing to a long-term procurement deal &#x2014; say, $1 trillion over 10 years. Call it the Trump Defense of Democracy Program, whatever strokes Trump&#x2019;s ego. The reality is, Trump would struggle to say no to the jobs, jobs, jobs such a deal would create in the U.S. This would buy Europe time to scale up its own defense industry while securing weapons in the interim. Longer term, there&#x2019;s a lot of talk about a &#x201C;Reverse Nixon&#x201D; &#x2014; a U.S. realignment with Russia against China. That would be an absurd long-term choice. Pushing away a $27 trillion European economy in favor of a $2 trillion Russian one? Europe will get its defense industries in order, and when it does, it will provide the U.S. with an unrivaled industrial base against China. Imagine Europe spending 4% of $27 trillion on defense in a decade &#x2014; that&#x2019;s $1.1 trillion, half of Russia&#x2019;s GDP. Even going full war economy, Russia cannot match that. But Europe can. It was also encouraging to see Turkey at the Lancaster House summit over the weekend. With an 800,000-strong land army, Turkey is the only European NATO power capable of putting tens &#x2014; if not hundreds &#x2014; of thousands of troops on the ground in Ukraine. It also has the manufacturing scale to help bridge Europe&#x2019;s defense production gaps. But Turkey wants something in return &#x2014; technology transfers, financial access, and a deeper trade relationship with both the EU and U.K. These are low-hanging fruit. Turkey is no ally of Russia; it fears a Russian victory in Ukraine and the resulting domination of the Black Sea. Europe needs to engage with Turkey, not ignore it. Fourth, the U.K. is back in Europe. Whether intentionally or not, Britain has found itself thrust into the peace process. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer &#x2014; &#x201C;Charmer Starmer&#x201D; &#x2014; played a blinder over the weekend, proving adept at talking to the U.S., Europe, and Ukraine alike. The U.K.&#x2019;s first-class diplomatic skills, sorely missing since Brexit, are back in play. If Britain wants a safe and secure Europe, it has to put skin in the game &#x2014; whether that means boots on the ground or brogues in the conference room. Fifth, the Oval Office debacle exposed the real bullies and aggressors &#x2014; and who the victims are. Zelensky stood up for the little guy. Imagine losing hundreds of thousands of people to Russian war crimes &#x2014; murdered, raped, kidnapped &#x2014; only to be told to say &#x201C;thank you&#x201D; to the U.S. for its aid. As CNN later revealed, Zelensky has already publicly thanked the U.S. 94 times. What more does Washington want? Groveling? Kissing Trump&#x2019;s ring? The Global South will take note &#x2014; and likely side with Ukraine. Sixth, if I were sitting in Beijing, I&#x2019;d be worried. The events in Washington made one thing clear: the U.S. is aligning with Russia against China. That&#x2019;s a strategic disaster for Beijing. China needs to make more friends in Europe &#x2014; now. And Europe should reciprocate. It&#x2019;s time to show the U.S. that it is not Europe&#x2019;s only option.

Attacks on Ukraineâ€™s draft officers on the rise, fueled by social tension and Russian interference	Within a single week in February, several attacks against enlistment offices and personnel in Ukraine took place, resulting in injuries among both military and civilians. The most striking was the murder of an enlistment officer at a gas station in Poltava Oblast. A man killed the officer during an attempt to kidnap his acquaintance who had recently been mobilized into the army. The soldier died immediately from the gunshot wounds. Two accomplices were detained later the same day. &quot;Killing military personnel in the rear is a red line that cannot be crossed,&quot; Mykhailo Drapatyi, commander of Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces, wrote on Facebook, reacting to the recent attacks. &quot;We have already seen cases of humiliation and aggression against our defenders, but I have not seen a strong public reaction. Now, we have direct armed attacks. This is how the enemy works,&quot; Drapatyi added. As Ukraine steps up its mobilization efforts, attacks on personnel are becoming more frequent, driven by escalating social tensions as the war drags on. In search of the perpetrators, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) insists that Russian special services are behind the latest incidents. In the meantime, criticism of the government&apos;s mobilization policy, as well as its inability to protect service members is also mounting. &#x201C;Everything that was done regarding mobilization was done in the worst possible way,&#x201D; Andrii Osadchuk, a lawmaker of the Holos faction and deputy chairman of parliament&apos;s Law Enforcement Committee, told the Kyiv Independent. The consequences of poorly organized mobilization efforts have been emotional and psychological, creating a fragility of social relations in Ukraine that Russia is exploiting, Osadchuk said. Throughout the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has had to confront Russian aggression not only on the battlefield. In February alone, the SBU detained dozens of individuals who it said were recruited by Russian special services and involved in sabotage activities in Ukraine. Among the detained were both adults and underage citizens who acted on Russia&apos;s orders. They reported the coordinates of Ukraine&apos;s critical infrastructure, set fire to military vehicles, and organized disinformation campaigns. Two cases were also related to attacks against enlistment office staff. The SBU and Ukraine&apos;s National Police on Feb. 5 detained Russian agents who had detonated explosives near an enlistment office in Pavlohrad, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. On the same day, the SBU determined the circumstances of the recruitment of another agent who blew himself up in an enlistment office in the western Ukrainian city of Rivne. The explosives were detonated remotely, killing the agent and injuring six other people. According to Serhii Andrushchenko, SBU&apos;s deputy head, the remote detonation of self-made devices is a new tactic of the Russian special services, allowing them to get rid of the perpetrator of the crime and not pay them the promised money for carrying out an attack. &quot;Russian special services simply use these people for their purposes as expendable material. An FSB (Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service) officer does not care what happens to them after the task is completed,&quot; Andrushchenko said.

(Serhii Mykhalchuk/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Russian special services are trying to destabilize the situation with terrorist attacks against the military to discredit enlistment offices, disrupt mobilization, and sow distrust in Ukrainian forces, Andrushchenko added. Osadchuk echoed Andrushchenko&apos;s stance, saying that destabilization inside Ukraine is &quot;an absolute priority&quot; for Russia. The expert stressed that Russian special services have been operating similarly for decades in Ukraine but have been particularly active over the past two and a half years of the full-scale invasion. Russia&#x2019;s efforts to destabilize the situation in Ukraine are made easier due to the fact that people are &#x201C;exhausted, traumatized, and tense,&#x201D; Osadchuk said. The societal conditions are ripe for these types of crimes, he said. Ukraine is continuing efforts to boost the pace of mobilization and increase the number of its troops as Russia advances on the front line. The Ukrainian government adopted updated legislation on mobilization in 2024, and the Defense Ministry has opened several recruitment centers throughout the country for the Ukrainian military. Despite attempts to make military service more attractive for volunteers, including the right to choose a post in the army and financial bonuses, enlistment offices still fulfill the main function of mobilization in Ukraine. The reputation of draft offices is often overshadowed by accusations &#x2014; at times justified &#x2014; of forced conscription without compliance with fundamental civil rights, as well as ill-treatment of conscripts in recruitment centers. Cases of wrongdoing are exploited by Russian propaganda to fuel negative attitudes toward enlistment officers and Ukraine&#x2019;s mobilization efforts. &quot;(Russian) psychological operations do not appear out of the blue. It is true that there is class differentiation in mobilization. But it is also true that no state in the world has ever fought a war and won it exclusively with volunteers,&quot; Dmytro Kukharchuk, head of recruitment of the Third Assault Brigade, wrote on Facebook. Young residents line up after enlisting in civil mobilization in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 28, 2022. (Laurent Van der Stockt for Le Monde/Getty Images)&quot;We can argue about the methods of mobilization, justice, and the human element in the enlistment offices. And there will be truth in each of these disputes. But war does not wait for us to agree,&quot; Kukharchuk added. Although Russia officially declared mobilization only once at the beginning of the all-out war, the Russian government has made considerable efforts to replenish its troops. Russia&#x2019;s recruitment tactics involve offering attractive financial incentives, pardoning crimes, or simply taking people off the streets. Trying to avoid increasing tensions in society, Russia has recruited civilians from less populated regions and marginalized ethnic minority communities. It has also supplemented its troops by forcibly drafting tens of thousands of Ukrainians in occupied territories &#x2014; a war crime, according to international law. Osadchuk insists that the way enlistment offices in Ukraine carry out their work must be reorganized completely to prevent the situation from deteriorating. According to the lawmaker, &quot;Russia or any of its other forms of existence&quot; will not disappear even after the hot phase of the war is over, and Ukraine &quot;needs to learn&#x201D; how to deal with Russia&#x2019;s operations. It is also important to highlight the work of law enforcement agencies that detain those who collaborate with Russia, according to Osadchuk. &quot;We see that the most vulnerable group is young people aged 14 to 18 who are hired through Telegram channels,&quot; Osadchuk said. &quot;They need to be taught simple things. It is a crime. If you fall for the campaign and the promised thousand dollars, you will not get it. Instead, you will get three to ten years (in prison). You will ruin your life forever,&quot; he added. Osadchuk also emphasized the need to change the government&apos;s information policy. &quot;It is harmful to promote narratives that encourage relaxation and apathy rather than mobilization and unity,&quot; the lawmaker said. According to Osadchuk, President Volodymyr Zelensky made a mistake by promoting the narrative that the war could end soon, demotivating both civilians and the military. &quot;No real fact suggests that the hot war phase should stop somewhere. Our imagination wants it, but we are not there,&quot; Osadchuk said. &quot;Everyone should realize that the war is not &apos;somewhere over there.&apos; It can be lost. We could be forced to retreat from Kyiv. This is not a fantasy or intimidation at all. It can really happen,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-on-ukraines-draft-personnel-rise-fueled-by-social-tension-and-russian-interference/	2025-03-03T04:56:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1468750344.jpg
Trump sided with Putin. Europe, whatâ€™s your move?	U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance&#x2019;s verbal assault on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office will mark Feb. 28, 2025, as an infamous moment in American and world history. The United States is rapidly destroying its good name and alienating everyone except the world&#x2019;s most brutal dictators. The damage to America&#x2019;s credibility and reputation will take decades to repair &#x2014; and may be irreparable. More broadly, with the end of the postwar U.S.-centered international order, we are witnessing the collapse of any global authority. As rogue states seek to capitalize on the chaos, Europe must step up and assume the role once played by the U.S. That starts by fully supporting Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. Yes, Europe is not as powerful as the U.S. militarily; but that does not mean it is weak. In fact, it holds all the cards that it needs. Its combined military forces are among the world&#x2019;s strongest, most experienced, and most innovative. The Oval Office quarrel &#x2014; which Trump and Vance seemed all too eager to &#x2014; should be the final impetus for Europe to get its act together, after decades of complacency. It has everything it needs to stand on its own, to support Ukraine, and to deter Russia. Moreover, Trump&#x2019;s shameful behavior is pushing America&#x2019;s dearest ally closer to Europe, helping to bridge the post-Brexit divide. It is galvanizing the forces of democracy and compelling political elites to wake up. Europe may soon have a moderate two-party ruling coalition in Germany, and a committed democratic one in Austria. After a terrible year, French President Emmanuel Macron&#x2019;s star is rising again. Europe has a half-billion people and a GDP comparable to the U.S. We may not be as innovative, but the gap is not as large as pundits would have you believe. If we forge a coalition with Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, we can close it soon &#x2014; especially now that Trump, Vance, and Elon Musk are destroying the pillars of U.S. power with their own cultural revolution. In addition to raising costs for American consumers with tariffs, the Trump administration is waging a war on immigrants &#x2013; long a unique source of American strength. Europe should capitalize by welcoming the best and brightest &#x2014; including those being hounded out of America&#x2019;s world-class federal agencies. As for defense capabilities, Germany&#x2019;s industrial base is sufficient to arm the continent, while France and Britain&#x2019;s nuclear umbrella can replace America&#x2019;s. The five largest European countries and the United Kingdom all currently have responsible, predictable governments that make a mockery of those now in power in Washington. Poland has an especially important role to play in what happens next. Economic trends are on our side. Our army is growing. We made the right arms purchases while there was still time. Not even Trump can find a bad word to say about us. All of Europe can see this. The French (slightly jealous) speak of &#x201C;le moment polonais.&#x201D; Poland&#x2019;s current leaders are among the most experienced, respected, and resolute statesmen to be found anywhere. Polish servicemen attend a press conference of Poland&apos;s Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak at Jarylowka military camp near Poland&apos;s border with Belarus on Aug. 12, 2023. (Attila Husejnow/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)At the recent Munich Security Conference, I spoke with many U.S. politicians &#x2014; including those, like Senator Lindsey Graham, who are bending the knee to Trump &#x2014; and I did not see much self-confidence. Rather than saying what they really think, they debased themselves and toed the Dear Leader&#x2019;s line. It was embarrassing to watch. When the Trump administration&#x2019;s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, was asked backstage whether &#x201C;we still have an alliance,&#x201D; he admitted that he himself doesn&#x2019;t know. Power in Washington is now completely concentrated in Trump. There are no longer any &#x201C;adults in the room,&#x201D; only sycophantic parrots competing to amplify their foolish master the loudest. Historian Timothy Snyder struck the right note in arguing that 2025 is not about what America thinks; it is about what Europe can do. The Trump policy (a generous term) can only be profitable in the short term; for now, no one will dare to go head-to-head with the U.S. In the long run, however, the dismantling of the U.S. state, the pointless tariffs, and the alienation of friends and allies will cause lasting damage. This is the moment to stand behind Ukraine. The treatment that Zelensky received was an absolute disgrace, loudly cheered by Russia. And no, he would not have gotten a better result if he had let himself be pushed around. This U.S. government has shown where its loyalties lie. The same thing happened with the critical-minerals agreement that Trump&#x2019;s advisers have been forcing on Ukraine. The first version amounted to mafia-style extortion, and Zelensky rightly rejected it. When a follow-up deal came, it was much better. I will not be surprised if Trump and Vance&#x2019;s disgusting behavior provokes a backlash from the American public. But Europeans cannot afford to wait. With Trump back in the White House, Americans will have their own very big problems to worry about. Europeans must take our future into our own hands.

Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 6, injure 26 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed six civilians and injured 26 others over the past day, regional authorities reported on March 3. Russian forces launched 83 drones from the Russian cities of Orel, Kursk, Millerovo, and Primosk-Akhtarsk at Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 46 drones over Kharkiv, Sumy, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, &#xA0;Kyiv, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, the Air Force said. Another 31 drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are often decoys that Russia launches alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 25 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, four people were killed, and 10 other people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian forces killed two civilians and injured another in the city of Pokrovsk. One person was also injured in the town of Kostiantynivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Kharkiv Oblast, Russian drones hit a five-story building, injuring eight people, including a 6-year-old child, in the regional center of Kharkiv. As a result of a Russian attack with four glide bombs at the village of Dovzhyk, a woman and a man suffered injuries, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian forces targeted the town of Nikopol with artillery, injuring an 84-year-old man and two women, aged 44 and 82. The man was rescued from the rubble and hospitalized in a severe condition. Russia also attacked the city of Kryvyi Rih with drones. A 52-year-old woman was injured, the local military administration reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-6-injure-26-over-past-day/	2025-03-03T04:30:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-03-13_40_53.jpeg
Kyiv, not Kiev â€” How Ukrainians reclaimed their capital	For decades, if not more, English speakers the world over referred to Ukraine&#x2019;s capital as Kiev, pronouncing it kee-yev. Few people knew they were using the Russian name for the city. The city is pronounced keeiv in Ukrainian and is transliterated correctly into English as Kyiv. In fact, until recently, the names of almost all Ukrainian places and people were transliterated according to their Russian versions. After gaining independence in 1991, Ukrainians lobbied the international community to adopt native transliterations when speaking and writing about Ukrainian cities. Their efforts were largely ignored for several decades as Ukraine struggled to shake its reputation as a former part of Russia. The needle began to move slightly in 2014 when Russia invaded Ukraine&#x2019;s east and annexed Crimea. With the outset of the full-scale invasion in 2022, the world seemed to get the message. Most major news outlets, academic publications, and government bodies now refer to Ukrainian place names by their Ukrainian transliterations. There are still some hold-outs, however, most notably among media outlets that often parrot Kremlin narratives. &#xA0; The Russian spelling and pronunciation of Kyiv throughout the ages was no accident. While the name gets its origin from an empire that predates Russia, a series of policies by the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union that sought to Russify Ukraine and the Ukrainian language distorted its roots. Kyiv, located on the Dnipro River, was officially founded in 482 A.D., although archeological evidence suggests there has been a settlement on the site for about 2,000 years. Various theories about its founding exist &#x2014; with the founders being said to be Goths, Huns, and Turks, among others &#x2014; but the most popular legend credits four royal siblings of an Eastern Slavic tribe with establishing the city in the 5th century. Kyiv is thus said to be named after the eldest sibling, Kyi, similar to how the mythical Romulus inspired the name Rome. In the 9th century, Kyiv became the capital and cultural center of Kyivan Rus, a medieval state spanning eastern and northern Europe, from which modern Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus all trace their origins. During the &#x201C;Golden Age&#x201D; of Kyivan Rus, Kyiv emerged as a political, cultural, and religious center, with landmarks like Saint Sophia&#x2019;s Cathedral and the Pechersk Lavra monastery complex reflecting its importance and prosperity. View from The Bell Tower of Saint-Sophia &#x421;athedral in Kyiv, Ukraine on May 23, 2024. (Oleh Tymoshenko / The Kyiv Independent)Moscow, founded at the tail end of Kyivan rule in 1147 A.D., is more than 600 years younger than Kyiv. Over the eight centuries that followed the breakup of Kyivan Rus, Kyiv was controlled by the Mongols, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Kingdom of Poland, the Russian Empire, and lastly the Soviet Union before becoming the capital of independent Ukraine. Both the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union drew their national identity from the legacy of Kyivan Rus. Authors of Russian history and the Russian state, including President Vladimir Putin, have envisioned their control over the city as a prerequisite for reuniting a long-lost empire. This imperial preoccupation also underpins current Russian narratives; in Putin&#x2019;s view, Kyiv is the mother city of a great Slavic kingdom that is destined to be reunified. Under the Russian Empire and Soviet Union, Russian cities, including Saint Petersburg and Moscow, dictated official language policies. In Soviet times, Moscow required all 15 member republics of the Soviet Union to adopt Russian as their official language. The result was that over the last century, Westerners came to know Ukrainian cities by their official Russian-language transliterations: Kiev as opposed to Kyiv, Kharkov as opposed to Kharkiv, Lvov as opposed to Lviv, and Odessa as opposed to Odesa. This lack of international awareness and recognition of the languages and cultures of individual Soviet member states meant &#x201C;Russian&#x201D; became a commonplace blanket term for all things Soviet. This legacy carried on past the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. Many foreign governments and media outlets continued to refer to Ukrainian cities by their Russian transliterations, bolstered by and contributing to the widespread stereotypes that &#x201C;everyone in Ukraine speaks Russian&#x201D; and the factually incorrect &#x201C;Ukraine is a former part of Russia.&#x201D; &#xA0; After the 2014 EuroMaidan revolution and Russia&#x2019;s annexation of Ukraine&#x2019;s Crimea and invasion of Donbas, more institutions in the West began acknowledging Ukraine&#x2019;s political and linguistic sovereignty.

(Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images)By 2019, many diplomatic missions and English-language news outlets had switched to using Ukrainian spellings of Ukrainian proper names out of respect for the country. Social media has also played a pivotal role in encouraging foreigners to switch to using Ukrainian names. Ukraine&#x2019;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs launched the #ReformUA campaign in the late 2010s, with hashtags such as #KyivNotKiev, #LvivNotLvov, and #KharkivNotKharkov. The effort also discouraged referring to Ukraine as &#x201C;the Ukraine&#x201D; &#x2014; which insinuates that it is a region in a larger nation, rather than an individual state in its own right. Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022 brought global attention to Ukraine and its capital city, prompting widespread adoption of &#x201C;Ukrainian&#x201D; spellings &#x2014; or rather, since Ukrainian uses a Cyrillic alphabet, Latin alphabet transliterations that better reflect the Ukrainian pronunciation of names.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-not-kiev-how-ukrainians-reclaimed-their-capital-and-their-future/	2025-03-03T03:24:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Illustration.JPG
Trump-Putin summit now being 'fast-tracked,' CNN reports	Preparations for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin are now being &quot;fast-tracked,&quot; CNN reported on March 2, citing undisclosed sources. The news comes after President Volodymyr Zelensky left Washington early without signing a mineral deal with the U.S. following a tense argument with Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance in front of journalists. Trump&apos;s spat with Zelensky on Feb. 28 was an additional incentive for the next round of talks on restoring relations between the U.S. and Russia to take place in the coming weeks, the sources told CNN. The next meeting between the Russian and American presidents may take place in one of the Persian Gulf countries, according to CNN. The first round of talks on Feb. 18 in Saudi Arabia marked the first direct negotiations between the U.S. and Russia since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion began, with Russia&apos;s delegation, led by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, sitting down with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials. Ukraine was not invited to participate. Following the initial meeting, Rubio outlined three main objectives both sides had agreed to pursue. These include restoring embassy staff in Washington and Moscow, creating a high-level team to facilitate Ukraine peace talks, and exploring ways to strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-trump-summit-now-being-fast-tracked-cnn-reports/	2025-03-03T02:58:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-810261630.jpg
A tragedy' â€” Russia strikes Ukrainian military training ground during exercises, Drapatyi, says	Russian forces struck a Ukrainian military training ground in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast on March 1 during a formation exercise, Mykhailo Drapatyi, Commander of the Ground Forces of Ukraine, said on March 3. A day earlier, reports of a Russian attack with an Iskander-M ballistic missile on a training ground in the village of Cherkaske near the regional center of Dnipro began circulated on social media. The strike was allegedly carried out after an Orlan drone spotted a formation of soldiers about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the front line. Drapatyi did not disclose the number of Ukrainian soldiers killed and injured. He added that the truth about the attack could be hidden &quot;in the fog of bureaucracy&quot; but promised to prevent this. &quot;A tragedy at a training ground is a terrible consequence of an enemy strike. The war requires quick decisions, responsibility, and new safety standards; otherwise, we will lose more than we have,&quot; Drapatyi said. Drapatyi added he had launched an investigation into the circumstances of the strike and appointed an independent review with the participation of military counterintelligence. &quot;Everyone who made decisions that day, and everyone who did not make them on time, will be held accountable. No one will hide behind explanations or formal reports,&quot; he said. On March 1, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that it had launched an Iskander M missile at the Novomoskovsk military training ground in Dnipro Oblast. Soldiers of the 157th Separate Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were allegedly undergoing military training there. This is not the first time Russia has attacked Ukrainian troops while they are lining up in the rear. On November 3, 2023, in a village near the front line in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian forces attacked a group of soldiers. As a result of the Russian missile strike, 19 soldiers of the 128th Brigade and two civilians were killed. According to an investigation by Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry, the soldiers were gathered in the courtyard of a house during an awards ceremony while all camouflage rules were ignored.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-strikes-training-ground-during-formation-resulting-in-mass-casualties-ukraines-military-says/	2025-03-03T02:49:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1243729890.jpg
Trump to discuss potential suspension, cancellation of military aid for Ukraine on March 3	U.S. President Donald Trump will discuss on March 3 the possible suspension or complete cancellation of military aid to Ukraine, including weapons pledged by the Biden administration, The New York Times (NYT) reported, citing an undisclosed source. The news comes after Trump&apos;s public spat with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28 that upended plans to sign a natural resources treaty between the two countries. An unnamed administration official told NYT that Trump will meet on March 3 with his top national security aides, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, to review and potentially act on a range of policy options for Ukraine. Among the issues to be considered will be the suspension or cancellation of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, including the latest shipments of ammunition and equipment authorized during the Biden administration, the official said. Zelensky has repeatedly urged the U.S. to continue shipping arms to Ukraine to strengthen Kyiv&apos;s position in future peace negotiations with Russia. The Trump administration has not authorized new weapons shipments for Ukraine, but has not halted those that were announced under the previous Biden administration. Reuters reported in early February that opposing factions within the administration had been debating whether the U.S. should continue providing weapons. The U.S. has provided Ukraine with $65.9 billion in military aid since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his term freezing foreign aid funding for 90 days.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-to-discuss-potential-suspension-cancellation-of-military-aid-for-ukraine-on-march-3/	2025-03-03T01:09:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2201915640.jpg
France, UK working on developing one month truce plan for Ukraine, Macron tells Le Figaro	French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer are working on a plan to reach a one-month truce in Ukraine, Macron told Le Figaro on March 2. Macron&apos;s statement comes after European leaders met in London to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, and restoring dialogue between the Ukrainian and U.S. governments following the heated argument between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House last week. Ground and maritime operations, as well as energy infrastructure, would be part of a potential truce plan, Macron told Le Figaro. A peacekeeping forces will be deployed on the ground only at the second stage of the plan&apos;s implementation, according to Macron. &quot;There will be no European troops on Ukrainian soil in the coming weeks,&quot; he added. But an unnamed British official denied that such a truce had been agreed upon in London, adding there was not yet agreement on the timing of any potential ceasefire. Macron added that the European Union must also allocate an additional 200 billion euros ($208 billion) to strengthen its defense capabilities in light of a possible U.S. rollback and further Russian threats. EU countries have to set a target for defense investment of 3%-3.5% of GDP, the French president said. He added defense funds are expected to come through &quot;innovative financing,&quot; including joint loans and other EU mechanisms. These issues will be on the agenda of the emergency European summit on March 6. According to Macron, the EU is also seeking to provide Ukraine with an emergency military aid package worth 20 billion euros ($21 billion) at the meeting in Brussels. While most European leaders publicly voiced support for Zelensky after his spat with Trump, Starmer called both the Ukrainian and U.S. leaders in an attempt to bridge the rift. The prime minister reportedly aims to tell Zelensky that fixing relations with Trump would be necessary to ensure lasting peace. The British prime minister and Macron, who visited Washington earlier the previous week, are seeking to mend the ties between Kyiv and the U.S. and present a united front on Ukraine and Russia. European leaders had previously been sidelined from talks between the U.S. and Russia &#x2014; concerned that neither the EU nor Kyiv will have a role in negotiating a ceasefire in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-uk-working-on-developing-truce-plan-for-ukraine-le-figaro-reports/	2025-03-02T23:51:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184127273.jpg
Ufimsky oil refinery 1,400km inside Russia catches fire, local authorities report	A large fire broke out overnight at the Ufimsky oil refinery in the Russian city of Ufa some 1,400 kilometers inside Russia, local authorities reported on March 3. Regional emergency services said the fire had been extinguished, adding: &quot;No excess of harmful substances has been recorded near the plant.&quot; No cause was given but Ukrainian forces have repeatedly launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry beginning in the spring of 2024. Russian Telegram channels reported an explosion at the refinery before the fire broke out. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the reports. Ukrainian attack drones successfully conducted one of the deepest strikes of the war tonight, hitting Russia&#x2019;s Ufa Oil Refinery, over 1300 km behind the frontline.

Anora,' film with former Russian propaganda actor wins 5 Academy Awards	&quot;Anora&quot; won five Academy Awards (Oscars), including Best Picture at the 97th Academy Awards on March 2. Among the cast of &quot;Anora&quot; is Russian actor Yura Borisov, who has starred in Russian propaganda films and illegally visited Russian-occupied Crimea.

Americans split on Ukraine, CBS News poll finds	U.S. respondents are split between supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression, an opinion poll published by CBS News on March 2 found.

No consensus among EU states on giving frozen Russian assets to Ukraine, Tusk says	The EU does not have a united stance on giving Ukraine frozen Russian assets, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on March 2 at a London summit focused on Ukraine. Western nations froze $300 billion in Russian assets at the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Ukraine has only received loans covered by interest earned from the frozen assets. &quot;Everyone understands it would be best to transfer these funds for the purpose of defense and reconstruction of Ukraine,&quot; Tusk said. The freeze on Russian assets in the EU is due to expire in June. Tusk called for the EU to extend the sanctions against Russian assets amid fears of opposition from Hungary which has repeatedly clashed with the EU over implementing sanctions against Russia. &quot;We need to focus on extending the sanctions, because they are working,&quot; Tusk said. The EU must maintain sanctions against Russia. Sanctions are contributing to Russian economic and financial weakness, Tusk added. &quot;There are fears of negative consequences for the euro and the banking system,&quot; the leader said. Poland is calling for other EU member states to support transferring Russian assets to Ukraine but does not have a decisive voice as it is not part of the eurozone, Tusk added. Currently, interest earned on frozen Russian assets is being used to help Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression, the leader said. Leadership in Hungary and Slovakia have spread pro-Russian narratives on many occasions and have repeatedly opposed support for Ukraine from the EU. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban urged EU leaders to abandon a joint statement in support of Ukraine ahead of a summit on March 6.	https://kyivindependent.com/no-consensus-among-eu-states-on-giving-frozen-russian-assets-to-ukraine-tusk-says/	2025-03-02T19:56:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/Tusk.jpg
US FBI Director accuses Zelensky of lack of transparency, pushes for Ukraine aid audit	Kash Patel, the newly Trump-nominated director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), called on US Congress to investigate how aid money sent to Ukraine has been used, The Epoch Times reported on March 2. &quot;I&apos;ve asked this Congress to investigate where this money has gone. The American people are owed that answer because it&#x2019;s our money. It&#x2019;s our taxpayer dollars,&quot; Patel said. Opinion polls show that Americans significantly overestimate the proportion of the U.S. federal budget that is spent on foreign aid, believing it to be around 25 percent when in fact it was only around 1 percent in 2023, amounting to just 0.25% of GDP. He also criticized the scale of U.S. aid to Ukraine. &quot;The issue is not about the U.S. sending a billion dollars, but rather that the amount sent to one country is one hundred times that billion.&quot; Patel then questioned Zelensky&#x2019;s credibility, and referenced a missile incident in Poland. &#x201C;Zelensky went on the world stage and said &#x2018;Russia fired a rocket into Poland,&apos; which would be an act of war. It turned out that Russia fired no such rocket,&#x201D; Patel claimed. Poland has scrambled jets amid Russian attacks on Ukraine several times over the past year, as missiles sent to western Ukraine have violated Polish airspace. He concluded with further skeptical statements and additional calls to investigate Ukrainian funds. &quot;We just can&#x2019;t have full faith and trust in giving a leader $100 billion and then having him say, &apos;I&#x2019;m not telling you where the money went.&apos;&#x201D; Patel concluded. Numerous U.S. government organizations have been keeping up with oversight and transparency measures of aid to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion. Aside from military aid, U.S. funds have been vital in supporting numerous Ukrainian programs and initiatives. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, the U.S. Agency for International Development&apos;s (USAID) has provided Ukraine with $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support, helping to rebuild schools after Russian attacks, pay for bomb shelters, advanced medical equipment for hospitals and much more. USAID&apos;s efforts have also included supporting judicial reforms and anti-corruption initiatives, and promoting transparency and accountability in governance. On Feb. 26 however, the Trump administration announced that it would be terminating over 90% of USAID foreign aid contracts, cutting $60 billion in foreign assistance. Patel previously served as a federal prosecutor, and he held various intelligence positions in Trump&#x2019;s first administration. He has been considered a Trump loyalist, and his views align with the current administration&#x2019;s escalating criticisms of President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s government, including Trump&#x2019;s recent false claims that the U.S. has sent $350 billion in assistance to Ukraine. Patel also received $25,000 in 2024 from a film company run by pro-Kremlin filmmaker Igor Lopatonok, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Feb. 7. The payment came after Patel participated in a documentary about Trump that aired on TCN, the online network of right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-fbi-director-accuses-zelensky-of-lack-of-transparency-pushes-for-ukraine-aid-audit/	2025-03-02T17:56:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196773597.jpg
Canada imposes new sanctions against Russia	Canada introduced new sanctions on March 2 against 10 Russian individuals and 21 entities, including paramilitary groups. The sanctions were announced by the Office of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, following his participation the same day in the European leaders&#x2019; summit in London. Canada&#x2019;s new sanctions target leaders of post-Wagner paramilitary organizations, a senior Russian military official, and several groups operating in Ukraine and Africa, as well as entities involved in resource extraction within these networks. &quot;To date, Canada has imposed sanctions on over 3,000 individuals and entities complicit in Russia&#x2019;s aggression &#x2013; and we remain committed to working with our partners to increase economic pressure on Russia,&quot; the statement said. &#x201C;Canada&#x2019;s commitment to Ukraine is unwavering.&#x201D; The summit included leaders and senior representatives of 15 countries, invited by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss a path toward a just and lasting peace in Ukraine in the face of Russia&#x2019;s war. Zelensky arrived in London following his trip to the U.S. Ukraine&apos;s leader left Washington without signing the much-anticipated natural resources deal after a public spat with U.S. President Donald Trump, prompting shock and concerns about the future of U.S.-Ukraine ties.	https://kyivindependent.com/canada-imposes-new-sanctions-against-russia-2/	2025-03-02T16:18:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1749110905.jpg

Zelensky will have no choice but to concede' â€” Trump reposts commentary claiming mineral deal ensures Ukraine's security	U.S. President Donald Trump reposted a claim on his social media network Truth Social on March 2 that President Volodymyr Zelensky &quot;will have no choice but to concede&quot; to Washington&apos;s terms to the mineral deal because Kyiv cannot survive the war without U.S. backing. The reposted commentary, initially published by Michael McCune, comes after his public spat with Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28 that upended plans to sign a natural resources treaty between the two countries. &quot;Trump played both sides liked a master chess player. In the end, Zelensky will have no choice but to concede because, without U.S. support, Ukraine cannot win a prolonged war against Russia,&quot; Trump reposted on his Truth Social network. &quot;Trump is actually protecting Ukraine without dragging the U.S. into war,&quot; the commentary read, presenting the deal as &quot;genius.&quot; The televised quarrel between Trump, his Vice President JD Vance, and Zelensky erupted after the Ukrainian president stressed the need for security guarantees and said that the Kremlin has repeatedly violated ceasefires, leading to the U.S. officials berating him as ungrateful and in a weak position. Following the heated exchange, Trump said that Zelensky is &quot;not a man who wants to make peace.&quot; Trump told reporters on Feb. 28 that Ukrainian president was &quot;looking for something that I&apos;m not looking for&quot; and again asserted that Zelenskyy wanted to &quot;fight, fight, fight.&quot; Zelensky pushed back on Trump&apos;s comments during an interview with Fox News asserting that Ukraine is &quot;ready for peace but we need to be in a good position.&quot; &quot;We want peace... that&apos;s why I visited President Trump,&quot; Zelensky said. In his post, Trump claimed that U.S. business interests in Ukraine would be enough of a security guarantee as Russia would not be able to threaten them &quot;without triggering massive international consequences.&quot; &quot;(B)ecause attacking Ukraine would mean endangering American lives - something that would force the U.S. to respond.&quot; A number of U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers are continuing their defense of Trump while hurling criticisms of Zelensky following the exchange, with some suggesting that Zelensky may have to resign. During an interview with NBC News on March 2, House Speaker Mike Johnson took aim at Zelensky suggesting he &quot;needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country.&quot; White House national security advisor Mike Waltz also criticized Zelensky on March 2, stating that &quot;We need a leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians and end this war.&quot; Waltz, in a comment to far-right media outlet Breitbart News on March 1, compared Zelensky to &quot;an ex-girlfriend that wants to argue everything that you said.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-zelensky-mineral-deal/	2025-03-02T12:35:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201830848.jpg
â€˜We need to get the U.S. back on track:â€™ Ukrainian businesses, economists react to mineral deal failure	An agreement on Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources collapsed after a heated argument in the Oval Office on Feb. 28 between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, casting doubt on the deal&#x2019;s future. Following weeks of tough negotiations, Kyiv and Washington eventually came to an agreement on Ukraine&#x2019;s critical minerals, oil, gas, and infrastructure. After the Trump Administration dropped some of Kyiv&#x2019;s major objections to earlier versions of the deal, the Zelensky administration said it was ready to move forward with the agreement, despite the absence of security guarantees. That all fell apart after Zelensky traveled to Washington to sign the agreement in what was supposed to be a first step in jointly developing Ukraine&#x2019;s resources. Instead, a press conference descended into Vance and Trump berating Zelensky, ending with the Ukrainian president being escorted out of the White House without an agreement in hand. While Trump and his VP&#x2019;s tirade against the Ukrainian president sets a firm wedge between the allies, Ukrainian businessmen and economists do not believe all is lost. Ukraine is still ready to offer up its resources for American investment, meaning another round of negotiations is possible once emotions cool off, they say. &#x201C;While political messaging might shift, the core economic and business relationships between the two countries remain resilient,&#x201D; Hennadiy Chyzhykov, president of the Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce, told the Kyiv Independent. The resources deal has been a rough road littered with controversies. Trump&#x2019;s initial demands would have given Washington as much control over Ukraine&#x2019;s main sources of revenue as the Ukrainian government. Critics accused the U.S. of offering a colonial-style deal. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz slammed Trump for being &#x201C;selfish.&#x201D; Throughout the weeks of talks, Zelensky reiterated he wouldn&#x2019;t give up Ukraine&#x2019;s resources without security guarantees, while Trump labelled Zelensky &#x201C;a dictator,&#x201D; seemingly in response to his unwillingness to sign the agreement. The last agreement, dated Feb. 25, still didn&#x2019;t offer any guarantees for protection against Russian aggression, but it did promise a more equal economic partnership to develop Ukraine&#x2019;s resources. Many in Ukraine were cautiously optimistic that it could work out, funneling much-needed capital into Ukraine. Following the drama in Washington, the Kyiv Independent spoke to Ukraine&#x2019;s business community to get their take on the fate of the deal and U.S.-Ukraine relations. What we are seeing now is a phase of recalibration in U.S.- Ukraine relations. While political debates and shifts in messaging can create uncertainty, strategic agreements &#x2014; especially those related to critical resources &#x2014; are rarely abandoned overnight. The U.S. and Ukraine both recognize the mutual benefits of energy and resource cooperation, and I expect that discussions will continue with an adjusted framework, potentially involving more European and private sector stakeholders. Ukraine&#x2019;s resource potential remains immense, and the global demand for critical minerals is only growing. While a slowdown in negotiations with the U.S. could momentarily delay some opportunities, it also opens the door for broader diversification. Ukraine is actively engaging with European and Asian partners, and this moment may encourage a more balanced approach &#x2014; ensuring that we leverage multiple partnerships rather than relying too heavily on any single agreement. The U.S.-Ukraine relationship has proven to be resilient despite changes in political leadership and diplomatic challenges. It is important to separate political rhetoric from long-term strategic interests &#x2014; support for Ukraine, whether military, economic, or political, remains a bipartisan priority for many in Washington.It&#x2019;s also worth noting that international relations are dynamic. Moments of tension often lead to more structured and sustainable agreements in the long run. This is not a breakdown but rather a recalibration of expectations and priorities. The most important thing is that discussions are ongoing, stakeholders are engaged, and there is a shared interest in de-escalation and finding mutually beneficial solutions. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine&apos;s president, left, and US President Donald Trump look at photos during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC. Feb. 28, 2025. (Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Arseniy Yatsenyuk &#x2014; economist, former Prime Minister of Ukraine, and founder of the Open Ukraine FoundationWe urgently need to develop a roadmap on how to fix the situation we all find ourselves in. Neither Ukraine nor the Trump administration has benefited from this, only the war criminal (Russian President Vladimir) Putin. It is better to sign this (resources) agreement as soon as possible to show that Ukraine is ready for any kind of investment. If the U.S. president needs this deal to &quot;sell&quot; it to his MAGA base, we are okay with this. But we need real investments and economic cooperation. However, this deal has nothing to do with a real peace process. It is necessary to define the terms of this peace agreement that will meet the demands of Ukraine and international law. Everyone has to be on the same page &#x2014; the European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Ukraine, with the Russians on the other side of the aisle.We need to undertake enormous efforts to get the U.S. back on track.The president of Ukraine, together with our friends and partners from the EU and the U.K., should send a letter to the U.S. administration clearly defining the red lines that Ukraine will never accept.I would strongly recommend that our European friends make the terms of the peace deal framework public. We must clearly see what red lines are being set by the European Union and Ukraine. Ukraine will never accept any kind of legalization of any territorial concessions. Ukraine will never accept any disarmament. We need to work out in detail the issue of NATO and our membership perspective. We can discuss the timeframe of this, but this is the ultimate goal of Ukraine. These red lines should be clearly set in a joint statement by the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine and sent to the White House. There were, unfortunately, no security guarantees in the resources agreement, but it was a step in the right direction. So I was really upset and disappointed. I don&#x2019;t feel it&#x2019;s the end. I believe that a reasonable second round should be prepared. From the business point of view, I believe that U.S. Investment will help to develop the country like it did previously with South Korea, Japan, and Singapore.We should sign the resources agreement. It will be the first step. But nowadays it&apos;s much more difficult because it&apos;s more emotional. For Zelensky, the security question is much more important, but this pragmatic approach from the Trump administration is now prevailing. Ukraine could have a lot of interest both from European and U.S. investment after the war and could be one of the hottest places on the planet if it is clear that the war is stoppedI still think it&apos;s in America&#x2019;s interest to be on the Ukrainian side, and I think we should find a way to save Trump and Zelensky&#x2019;s faces and relaunch this relationship. It&#x2019;s very important for Ukraine. US President Donald Trump greets Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky as he arrives at the White House in Washington, DC. Feb. 28, 2025.

Of course, we are all capable of putting emotions aside, but a conversation that starts with a sarcastic question like &quot;Don&#x2019;t you own a suit?&quot; is hard to call constructive or respectful. Ukraine considers the United States a crucial ally, and we are deeply grateful to the American people and authorities at all levels for the immense support they have provided us over the years. Truth and justice must prevail; if the outcome is different, we will have to acknowledge that we are living in a world entirely different from the one we believed we inhabited. I am confident that we, along with European leaders and the United States, have the wisdom and strength to stand on the side of justice. I won&#x2019;t claim to have deep expertise to fully assess the resources agreement, but as far as I can judge, its main value lies in the declaration of the United States&apos; intent to continue supporting Ukraine, also within the framework of business interests. This is an important agreement, but it is a framework one and depends entirely on the relationships and goodwill of the parties.It could become a more powerful tool for Ukraine&#x2019;s protection only if hundreds, if not thousands, of further negotiations are successful and satisfactory for both sides, hypothetically leading someday to something more concrete in establishing a strong, long-term, and fair peace. The discussion (on Feb. 28) immediately went in a direction that does not suggest any positive steps moving forward. Nevertheless, Ukraine is still ready to sign the agreement &#x2014; peace is what we need the most.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-need-to-get-the-u-s-back-on-track-ukrainian-businesses-economists-react-to-mineral-deal-failure/	2025-03-02T12:26:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201823899.jpg
Trump-Zelensky clash and US talks with Russia | Ukraine This Week	In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Anna Belokur breaks down the shocking argument that took place in the Oval Office on Friday, in which U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for a perceived lack of gratitude for American assistance to Ukraine. The event has raised alarm bells regarding the future of peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, and indicates a worryingly pro-Russian tilt by the current American administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-zelensky-clash-and-us-talks-with-russia-ukraine-this-week/	2025-03-02T12:03:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_0749.JPG
Zelensky meets with King Charles following European leaders' summit	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with King Charles III on March 2 following the conclusion of the European leaders&apos; summit hosted by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The meeting, which sources tell BBC News lasted just under an hour, comes as a show of support for the leader of the embattled country amid the fallout of Zelensky&apos;s heated meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. European leaders converged in London on March 2 to reaffirm their support for Kyiv and discuss how to strengthen support for Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace. Earlier in the day, Starmer said that a number of European nations, including the U.K. and France, are developing a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; that will include &quot;planes in the air and boots on the ground&quot; in an effort to negotiate a successful ceasefire in Ukraine. Starmer added that for any coalition to succeed, Europe must &quot;have strong U.S. backing.&quot; While most European leaders publicly voiced support for Zelensky after his spat with Trump, Starmer called both the Ukrainian and U.S. leaders in an attempt to bridge the rift. The prime minister reportedly aims to tell Zelensky that fixing relations with Trump would be necessary to ensure lasting peace. Amid Starmer&apos;s visit to the U.S. to meet Trump on Feb. 27, King Charles invited Trump to an &quot;unprecedented&quot; second state visit to meet the Royals. Trump previously visited the United Kingdom in his first term in office on the invitation of Queen Elizabeth II. Zelensky previously met with Britain&apos;s King Charles on July 18.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-with-king-charles-following-european-leaders-summit/	2025-03-02T11:36:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/gettyimages-2202274012-612x612.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Europe developing 'coalition of the willing' to back ceasefire in Ukraine, Starmer says	Key developments on March 1 - 2: U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on March 2 that a number of European nations, including the U.K. and France, are developing a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; that will include &quot;planes in the air and boots on the ground&quot; in an effort to negotiate a successful ceasefire in Ukraine. Starmer added that for any coalition to succeed, Europe must &quot;have strong U.S. backing.&quot; &quot;(European allies) will go forth to develop a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; to defend a deal in Ukraine and to guarantee the peace,&quot; Starmer said during a press conference following a European leaders summit in London. &quot;Not every nation will feel able to contribute but that can&apos;t mean we sit back. Instead those willing will intensify planning now with real urgency.&quot; &quot;The U.K is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air. Together with others, Europe must do the heavy lifting,&quot; Starmer said. &quot;This is not a moment for more talk... If you want to preserve the peace, you have to defend the peace.&quot; Starmer is hosting President Volodymyr Zelensky and other leaders in London to discuss how to strengthen support for Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace. The summit is even more crucial now after a fallout between the Ukrainian leader and U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House. The U.K. and France have spearheaded the idea of deploying European peacekeepers in Ukraine to monitor a potential ceasefire. French President Emmanuel Macron and Starmer appealed to Trump to remain involved in maintaining a post-war order, but they failed to receive any concrete commitments as the new U.S. administration expects Europe to take responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security. Starmer said that he spoke to Trump on March 1 to deliver plans of the proposed coalition, and added that the proposed coalition will succeed on the basis that Europe work &quot;with the U.S. and that it will have U.S. backing.&quot; Starmer did not specify which other countries would participate in the coalition, but added that &quot;a number of countries have indicated they want to be part of the plan we&apos;re developing.&quot; &quot;The purpose of today&apos;s meeting was to unite our partners around this effort. To strengthen Ukraine, and unsure a just and enduring peace for the good of all of us,&quot; Starmer added. &quot;We have to learn from the mistakes of the past. We cannot accept a deal like Minsk which Russia can break with ease.&quot; While most European leaders publicly voiced support for Zelensky after his spat with Trump, Starmer called both the Ukrainian and U.S. leaders in an attempt to bridge the rift. The prime minister reportedly aims to tell Zelensky that fixing relations with Trump would be necessary to ensure lasting peace. The British prime minister and Macron, who visited Washington earlier this week, are seeking to mend the ties between Kyiv and the U.S. and present a united front on Ukraine and Russia. European leaders had previously been sidelined from talks between the U.S. and Russia &#x2014; concerned that neither the EU nor Kyiv will have a role in negotiating a ceasefire in Ukraine. The United Kingdom signed an agreement with Kyiv on March 1 to provide Ukraine with a loan worth 2.26 billion pounds ($2.84 billion) backed by frozen Russian assets. The loan, which is part of the Group of Seven&apos;s (G7) Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) credit initiative, was signed amid Zelensky&apos;s visit to London to meet with Starmer. &quot;The United Kingdom continues to stand in defense of Ukraine. Today&apos;s agreement, which contributes to strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities, confirms this,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko said in a statement. The loan will go towards &quot;purchasing defense equipment according to Ukraine&apos;s needs,&quot; the Finance Ministry said. In October 2024, G7 countries came to an agreement that pledged to provide Ukraine with almost $50 billion loan. The United States will contribute the bulk of the loan with $20 billion in assistance. The U.S. is closely followed by European Union countries, including France, Germany, and Italy, with a combined $19.4 billion. The remaining approximately $10 billion will be divvied up with Canada providing $3.7 billion, Japan providing $3.07 billion, and the U.K. providing $2.8 billion in loan funding. Under the G7 ERA initiative, Ukraine had previously received $1 billion from the U.S. and $3.1 billion from the EU. While Western countries have frozen $300 billion in Russian assets, they can only access the annual income generated by these funds, approximately $3.2 billion. These profits will back the $50-billion loan to Kyiv, while the vast majority of the assets are frozen in European countries. In January, Zelensky and Starmer signed a 100-year partnership agreement during their meeting in Kyiv on Jan. 16. The wide-ranging deal encompasses cooperation in military, energy, scientific, cultural, economic, and other sectors. Earlier in the day, Starmer, in line with European allies, reaffirmed his country&apos;s support for Ukraine and Zelensky. &quot;We stand with Ukraine for as long as it may take,&quot; Starmer told reporters at a press briefing alongside Zelensky, adding that Ukraine has &quot;full backing across the United Kingdom.&quot; Starmer and Macron are working behind the scenes to pacify relations between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Volodymyr Zelensky following their public spat on Feb. 28. Macron has spoken with both Zelensky and Trump privately, telling La Tribune Dimanche in an interview published on March 1 that he took the initiative to mediate because &quot;what is at stake is too important.&quot; &quot;The manifest destiny of the Americans is to be on the side of the Ukrainians, I have no doubt about it. What the United States has done over the past three years is entirely consistent with its diplomatic and military tradition,&quot; Macron said. &quot;I want to make the Americans understand that disengagement from Ukraine is not in their interest.&quot; Macron also cautioned against signing a peace deal without any security guarantees for Ukraine, adding that &quot;geostrategic deterrence capacity with regard to Russia, China and others, would vanish the same day .&quot; If Russia&apos;s full-scale war of aggression is not stopped in Ukraine, it will &quot;surely go to Moldova&quot; and &quot;perhaps beyond to Romania,&quot; the French president added. Both the U.K. and France have supported the idea of deploying peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of the country&apos;s security guarantees. Starmer announced on March 2 that the U.K. had reached an agreement with Kyiv to provide Ukraine with 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion) for the purchase of 5,000 air defense missiles. Starmer said that the deal would be conducted through export financing, with the missiles being produced in Belfast, Northern Ireland. &quot;This will be vital for protecting critical infrastructure now and strengthening Ukraine in securing the peace when it comes,&quot; Starmer said. The deal, which Starmer announced during a press conference following the conclusion of a European leaders&apos; summit in London, follows a separate commitment announced on March 1 that would provide a $2.8 billion loan backed by frozen Russian assets. Ukraine has long been calling for allies to provide additional funding for Ukraine&apos;s air defense needs as Russia continues to pummel Ukrainian cities with missile and drone attacks. A number of U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers are continuing their criticism of Zelensky, with some suggesting that Zelensky may have to resign, following the president&apos;s heated exchange at the White House with Trump on Feb. 28. During an interview with NBC News on March 2, House Speaker Mike Johnson took aim at Zelensky suggesting he &quot;needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country.&quot; &quot;What President Zelensky did in the White House was effectively a signal to us that he&#x2019;s not ready for (peace talks), and I think that&#x2019;s a great disappointment,&quot; Johnson said. Johnson&apos;s remarks fall in line with Senator Lindsey Graham &#x2014; formerly a staunch supporter of Ukraine &#x2014; who said on Feb. 28 that Zelensky &quot;is either going to have to fundamentally change or go.&quot; Zelensky rebuked calls for his resignation from Republican lawmakers following the exchange, saying on Fox News that &quot;only Ukrainians vote for their president.&quot; U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has defended Trump since the incident, also criticized Zelensky in separate interview with ABC News on March 2, stating that the United States will &quot;be ready to reengage when they&#x2019;re ready to make peace.&quot; Rubio added that he has not spoken to Zelensky or members of the Ukrainian delegation since they were ordered to leave the White House. Rubio&apos;s comments echo those of Trump who told reporters following the spat that the Ukrainian president was &quot;looking for something that I&apos;m not looking for&quot; and again asserted that Zelenskyy wanted to &quot;fight, fight, fight.&quot; Zelensky pushed back on Trump&apos;s comments during his interview asserting that Ukraine is &quot;ready for peace but we need to be in a good position.&quot; &quot;We want peace... that&apos;s why I visited President Trump,&quot; Zelensky added. White House national security advisor Mike Waltz also criticized Zelensky on March 2, stating that &quot;We need a leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians and end this war.&quot; When asked if Trump wanted Zelensky to resign, Waltz declined to directly answer the question, responding that &quot;If it becomes apparent that President Zelenskyy&#x2019;s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in his country, then I think we have a real issue on our hands.&quot; Waltz, in a comment to far-right media outlet Breitbart News on March 1, compared Zelensky to &quot;an ex-girlfriend that wants to argue everything that you said.&quot; The Kremlin has praised what it perceives as the U.S.&apos;s foreign policy shift, claiming on March 2 that it &quot;aligns&quot; with its &quot;vision&quot; after Trump&apos;s public dispute with Zelensky. &quot;The new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations. This largely coincides with our vision,&quot; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in comments published by state-controlled media. &quot;There is a long way to go, because there is huge damage to the whole complex of bilateral relations. But if the political will of the two leaders, President (Vladimir) Putin and President Trump, is maintained, this path can be quite quick and successful.&quot; Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also praised Trump, calling him a &quot;pragmatist&quot; and adding that &quot;that&apos;s what makes him interesting,&quot; state-controlled media reported on March 2. Lavrov claimed that the Trump administration&apos;s so-called common sense approach dictates &quot;stepping aside&quot; from aiding Ukraine. Trump, echoing Kremlin rhetoric on the war in Ukraine, said at the end of February the country should &quot;forget&quot; about joining NATO, which the country sees as a security guarantee against a future Russian invasion. Russia has repeatedly presented NATO expansion as a &quot;justification&quot; for the war. Overlooking the challenges of holding elections in a war zone, Trump on Feb. 19 called Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot;&#x2014;a remark he later claimed he did not remember making. The U.S. also voted alongside Russia on Feb. 24 against a U.N. resolution that condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-europe-developing-coalition-of-the-willing-to-back-ceasefire-in-ukraine-starmer-says/	2025-03-02T11:16:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/gettyimages-2202283308-612x612.jpg
U.K. to provide Ukraine with $2 billion for air defense	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Czechs crowdfund money to purchase Black Hawk helicopter for Ukraine	A Czech volunteer initiative announced on March 1 that it had raised enough money to purchase a Black Hawk military helicopter for Ukraine&apos;s war effort. The volunteer initiative, called &quot;A Gift for Putin,&quot; began crowdfunding money for the helicopter in November 2023, rallying more than 20,500 donors to contribute a total of 72.3 million Czech Koruna ($2.9 million). The funds will go toward purchasing a Black Hawk helicopter from the United States, where it is more affordable than in the Czech Republic. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) will operate the Black Hawk for evacuating Ukrainian soldiers and special operations, according to the website. &quot;Ukraine cannot win the war with drones or ammunition alone. It also needs tanks, aircraft, howitzers&#x2014;and helicopters for special operations,&quot; the volunteer initiative&apos;s website reads.	https://kyivindependent.com/czechs-crowdfund-money-to-purchase-black-hawk-helicopter-for-ukraine/	2025-03-02T07:55:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2183850598--1-.jpg
Putin congratulates winner of 'election' in occupied Abkhazia	Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Badra Gunba on winning the presidential &quot;election&quot; in the Russian-occupied Georgian region of Abkhazia in a statement released by the Kremlin&apos;s press service on March 2. &quot;I expect that the friendly, allied Russian-Abkhazian relations will continue to strengthen for the benefit of our brotherly nations,&quot; Putin&apos;s message goes on to read. Abkhazia, an occupied region internationally recognized as part of &#xA0;Georgia, has been under de facto Russian control since the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia. Aslan Bzhania, the former leader of Abkhazia, submitted his resignation on Nov. 19 in a bid to quell mounting unrest over a proposed investment deal with Russia. The agreement, which would allow Russian citizens to purchase property in Abkhazia, fueled fears of deeper Russian entrenchment in the territory and was subsequently scrapped. Gunba, the winner of the presidential &quot;election,&quot; is considered to be a pro-Kremlin politician. Freedom House, a U.S.-based NGO advocating for democracy and political freedom, said that Abkhazia&apos;s legal framework &quot;does not support fully democratic elections,&quot; but noted that &quot;incumbent officials remain vulnerable to defeat at the polls.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-congratulates-winner-of-election-in-occupied-abkhazia/	2025-03-02T07:37:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2157386935.jpg
Reported Russian 'shadow fleet' oil tanker, detained over damaged undersea cables, allowed to leave Finland	The Eagle S oil tanker, which is thought to be part of Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; was allowed to leave Finland&apos;s waters after it was detained on suspicion of sabotaging undersea Baltic cables, the Agence France-Presse news agency reported on March 2. Finnish authorities announced that there were &quot;no longer grounds&quot; to continue detaining the Russian-linked vessel Eagle S, though their criminal investigation remains ongoing. Three of the eight suspected individuals from the ship&apos;s crew have been barred from leaving Finland as authorities continue to probe the incident. In January, the Swedish Navy found an anchor at the site of the sabotaged cables in the Baltic Sea. Finnish authorities suspect the Eagle S intentionally dragged its anchor along dozens of kilometers of the Baltic seabed, according to AFP. The vessel is believed to be part of Russia&#x2019;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; a network of ships that Moscow allegedly uses to circumvent Western sanctions and continue exporting oil and gas. These vessels operate under opaque ownership structures, making them difficult to track and raising significant security and environmental concerns. In mid-January, senior officials from three nations said that recent damage to undersea cables was likely the result of accidents rather than deliberate sabotage by Russia. However, some analysts and officials believe the damage is potentially linked to Russia&#x2019;s broader hybrid warfare strategy&#x2014;a blend of cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, and covert operations to stir discord in the West.	https://kyivindependent.com/reported-russian-shadow-fleet-tanker-allowed-to-leave-finland-after-damaging-baltic-cables/	2025-03-02T07:12:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2192468806.jpg
Zelensky meets Italy's Meloni at London summit	President Volodymyr Zelensky and Italy&apos;s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni held a &quot;productive meeting&quot; on the sidelines of an international summit in London on March 2, the Presidential Office said. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hosting leaders and top officials from more than a dozen countries, as well as leaders of the EU and NATO, to devise a strategy for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine. &quot;I had a productive meeting with the President of the Council of Ministers of Italy (Giorgia Meloni) to develop a joint action plan for ending the war with a just and lasting peace,&quot; Zelensky said on X. &quot;No one other than (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is interested in the continuation and quick return of the war. Therefore, it is important to maintain unity around Ukraine and strengthen our country&apos;s position in cooperation with our allies &#x2013; the countries of Europe and the United States.&quot; I had a productive meeting with the President of the Council of Ministers of Italy @GiorgiaMeloni to develop a joint action plan for ending the war with a just and lasting peace.No one other than Putin is interested in the continuation and quick return of the war. Therefore, it&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/3xCF7qTiCv Zelensky&apos;s visit to the U.K. follows his calamitous trip to the U.S. While expecting to sign a framework agreement on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources with U.S. President Donald Trump, the visit derailed after he got into a heated argument with Trump and Vice President JD Vance, leaving the deal&apos;s fate uncertain. European leaders have rushed to declare support for Zelensky but also urged him to mend ties with Trump to keep the U.S. engaged in the peace process. Meloni suggested that Italy and the U.K. could act as a bridge between Kyiv and Washington. Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have also reportedly sought to work behind the scenes to ease tensions between the two leaders. &quot;I think it is very important that we avoid the risk that the West divides. And I think on this, the U.K. and Italy can play an important role in bridge building,&quot; Meloni said upon arriving in London for the allied summit, as quoted by the Telegraph.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-italys-meloni-at-ukraine-summit-in-london/	2025-03-02T06:42:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/865809bf3611024ddd634a9f78e002d6_1740925269_extra_large.jpeg
Italy, UK can help mediate Zelensky-Trump dispute, Meloni says	Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on March 2 that Italy and the U.K. could mediate between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump following their dispute on Feb. 28, adding that any continued division &quot;will make us all weaker,&quot; the Telegraph reported. With Washington&#x2019;s role seen as crucial to any lasting peace in Ukraine, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have also reportedly sought to work behind the scenes to ease tensions between the two leaders. &quot;I think it is very important that we avoid the risk that the West divides. And I think on this, the U.K. and Italy can play an important role in bridge building,&quot; Meloni said upon arriving in London for the allied summit, as quoted by the Telegraph. Italy&apos;s prime minister met Starmer at 10 Downing Street for a bilateral talk ahead of the summit to discuss Ukraine, migration, and other topics. Prior to arriving in London, Zelenky was in Washington to sign a natural resources deal with the United States. His visit took a dramatic turn when a heated exchange with Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance led to his expulsion from the White House. The clash erupted after Zelensky publicly stressed the need for security guarantees, citing Russia&#x2019;s repeated violations of ceasefires before its full-scale invasion in 2022. Following the contentious meeting, Trump claimed that Zelensky was &quot;not ready&quot; for peace. Starmer has invited leaders and senior representatives from 15 countries to discuss strategies for securing a just and lasting peace in Ukraine. Meloni believes her close relationship with Trump can help reconcile his relationship with Zelensky, according to the Telegraph.	https://kyivindependent.com/meloni-says-she-can-help-mediate-zelensky-trump-dispute/	2025-03-02T06:24:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202193028.jpg
European leaders gather in London for Ukraine summit after White House fallout	French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, and other top Western officials arrived for a London summit to discuss support for Kyiv, the Guardian reported on March 2. They are among the leaders and senior representatives of 15 countries invited to the U.K. by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss ways to ensure just and lasting peace in Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in London already on March 1 for talks with Starmer after his trip to the U.S. Ukraine&apos;s leader left Washington without signing the much-anticipated natural resources deal following a public spat with U.S. President Donald Trump, which caused a shock across Europe. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have also arrived in the U.K.&apos;s capital, the Guardian wrote. The list of invitees further includes European Council President Antonio Costa and leaders or representatives of Germany, Canada, Czechia, Spain, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Romania, and Turkey. &quot;On my way to London to highlight Europe&#x2019;s ongoing support to Ukraine that can lead to just and lasting peace in Ukraine,&quot; von der Leyen said on X ahead of her trip. &quot;The path to peace is strength. Weakness breeds more war. We will support Ukraine while undertaking a surge in European defense.&quot; The Baltic countries, which have been among Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters throughout the full-scale invasion, were not among the invitees, reportedly leading to Starmer issuing an apology. The summit is seen as a last-ditch effort to revive Western unity after seismic foreign policy shifts in Washington under the Trump administration. Both Starmer and Macron visited the U.S. earlier this week to convince Trump to continue playing a role in Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability, but their diplomatic efforts were overshadowed by the unprecedented public spat in the White House on Feb. 28. The humiliating treatment Zelensky received from the U.S. president and Vice President JD Vance prompted Europe&apos;s leaders to speak out in support of the Ukrainian president. At the same time, a number of top Western officials, including Starmer and Rutte, have openly or privately appealed to Zelensky to mend ties with Trump to ensure continued U.S. engagement. Speaking ahead of the summit, the British prime minister revealed that the U.K., France, and Ukraine will spearhead efforts to create a joint ceasefire plan to present to Trump. The London meeting is also a chance for Ukraine&apos;s EU allies to coordinate strategy ahead of the European summit on March 6, which is under threat of being derailed by Moscow-friendly Hungary and Slovakia.	https://kyivindependent.com/european-leaders-gather-in-london-for-ukraine-summit-after-white-house-fallout/	2025-03-02T05:40:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202195178.jpg
Ukraine calls out IAEA staff for passing via occupied territories but pins blame on Russia	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry protested on March 2 against International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) staff passing through occupied territories to carry out a rotation at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant but blamed the situation on Russian blackmail. Moscow&apos;s &quot;systematic attempts to impose illegal and contradictory operational mechanisms on international organizations&quot; led to &quot;violations of Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity&quot; by several IAEA staff members, the ministry said. The statement came hours after Russian occupation authorities claimed that a rotation of IAEA personnel had taken place through Russian-controlled territory. Ukraine&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry accused Russia of obstructing the rotation of IAEA staff at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and keeping inspectors under &quot;unprecedented psychological pressure in a high-risk zone.&quot; Inspectors from the IAEA, stationed at the Russian-occupied facility to monitor risks and ensure the safety of operations, are meant to rotate every 80 days. &#xA0;The ministry said Russian forces had blocked staff rotations through Ukrainian-controlled territory. &quot;We consider the actions of the IAEA not as a rotation of experts at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant but as a humanitarian evacuation under conditions that threaten the lives and health of the agency&apos;s staff,&quot; the Foreign Ministry said in an apparent dismissal of the IAEA&apos;s capabilities of handling the situation on the ground. The IAEA has not yet commented. The largest nuclear plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, has been under Russian occupation since 2022. While the facility remains under Russian control, it is not currently generating electricity.	https://kyivindependent.com/foreign-ministry-condemns-iaea/	2025-03-02T05:05:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1243158341.jpg
1 killed, 10 injured after Russian drone drops explosive on bus in Kherson	A Russian drone dropped an explosive on a shuttle bus in the southern city of Kherson on March 2, killing one person and injuring at least 10, the city&apos;s military administration said. A 53-year-old woman was killed in the attack, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. The attack took place in the afternoon in the city&apos;s western Dniprovskyi district. At least nine of the victims have been hospitalized, the regional prosecutor&apos;s office said. Four of them are in serious condition, according to Roman Mrochko, the head of the Kherson city military administration. Kherson and other Ukraine-controlled settlements west of the Dnipro River endure daily Russian attacks as Moscow&apos;s forces maintain control of the river&#x2019;s east bank. Evidence points to Russia systematically targeting civilians in Kherson with drones in a campaign dubbed by journalists as a &quot;human safari.&quot; A Russian drone strike in the city on Jan. 6 targeted another bus, killing one person and injuring eight.	https://kyivindependent.com/1-killed-10-injured-after-russian-drone-drops-bomb-on-bus-in-kherson/	2025-03-02T04:48:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1822097784.jpg
Russia, China seek to recruit fired US federal employees, CNN reports	Russia and China are attempting to recruit U.S. federal employees working in national security who were impacted by the Trump administration&apos;s layoffs, CNN reported on March 1, citing four undisclosed sources and an intelligence report. In efforts spearheaded by Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the U.S. government launched a mass firing of government employees and gutted federal agencies like USAID. These steps, presented as cutting waste and realigning government policies with President Donald Trump&apos;s &quot;America First&quot; agenda, could be followed by further layoffs in the civil service in the near future. Washington&apos;s foreign adversaries are seeking to leverage the situation and recruit employees who were recently fired &#x2014; or are in danger of being laid off &#x2014; and have security clearance or access to sensitive information on critical infrastructure, CNN wrote. Foreign intelligence operatives were instructed to look for potential sources on LinkedIn, TikTok, RedNote, and Reddit, the outlet reported, citing a document by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. The CIA has already fired about 20 officers working in diversity and recruitment, which is seen as only a first step before what the New York Times described as &quot;one of the largest mass firings in the agency&#x2019;s history.&quot; The Pentagon, in turn, announced plans to lay off 5,400 probationary employees, representing roughly 5-8% of its civilian workforce. The last few weeks saw the Trump administration take steps described by critics as friendly toward Moscow, publicly denouncing the Ukrainian leadership and launching direct talks with Russia in a supposed effort to broker a peace deal. According to media reporting, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has also ordered U.S. Cyber Command to suspend offensive cyber and information operations against Russia amid the diplomatic outreach.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-china-trying-to-recruit-fired-us-federal-employees-cnn-reports/	2025-03-02T03:58:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2201176686.jpg
Kremlin says perceived US foreign policy shift aligns with its 'vision'	The Kremlin has praised what it perceives as the U.S.&apos;s foreign policy shift, claiming on March 2 that it &quot;aligns&quot; with its &quot;vision&quot; after U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s public dispute with President Volodymyr Zelensky. &quot;The new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations. This largely coincides with our vision,&quot; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in comments published by state-controlled media. &quot;There is a long way to go, because there is huge damage to the whole complex of bilateral relations. But if the political will of the two leaders, President (Vladimir) Putin and President Trump, is maintained, this path can be quite quick and successful.&quot; Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also praised Trump, calling him a &quot;pragmatist&quot; and adding that &quot;that&apos;s what makes him interesting,&quot; state-controlled media reported on March 2. Lavrov claimed that the Trump administration&apos;s so-called common sense approach dictates &quot;stepping aside&quot; from aiding Ukraine. Trump, echoing Kremlin rhetoric on the war in Ukraine, said at the end of February the country should &quot;forget&quot; about joining NATO, which the country sees as a security guarantee against a future Russian invasion. Russia has repeatedly presented NATO expansion as a &quot;justification&quot; for the war. Overlooking the challenges of holding elections in a war zone, Trump on Feb. 19 called Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot;&#x2014;a remark he later claimed he did not remember making. The U.S. also voted alongside Russia on Feb. 24 against a U.N. resolution that condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-comments-on-trump-policy-shift/	2025-03-02T03:33:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1252236776.jpg
Norwegian fuel supplier halts sales to US Navy over Trump-Zelensky dispute, citing 'moral compass'	Norwegian fuel supplier Haltbakk Bunkers will not deliver a &quot;single liter&quot; of fuel to the U.S. Navy until U.S. President Donald Trump &quot;is gone,&quot; the company&apos;s owner told media outlet Kystens Noeringsliv on March 1 after Trump&apos;s highly public dispute with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Zelensky was poised to sign a major natural resources deal with the U.S. on Feb. 28 when a last-minute provocation by U.S. Vice President JD Vance ignited a public clash. Afterward, Zelensky was expelled from the White House, with Trump accusing him of not being &quot;ready&quot; for peace. The official Facebook page of Haltbakk Bunkers, which appears to have since gone private, called the dispute &quot;the biggest sh*tshow ever presented &apos;live on TV&apos; by the current American president and his vice president.&quot; &quot;Huge credit to the president of Ukraine (for) restraining himself and for keeping calm even though the U.S.A. put on a backstabbing TV show. It made us sick,&quot; the post reads, adding that the company decided to no longer act as a fuel provider for U.S. military forces and naval vessels docking in Norway. Haltbakk Bunkers&apos;s owner, Gunnar Gran, told Kystens Noeringsliv that his company provided U.S. warships with 3,000,000 liters of fuel in 2024. Haltbakk Bunkers has &quot;many Ukrainian employees&quot; and wants to show that it maintains support for Ukraine, Gran said. He believes that the boycott &quot;will not upset anyone.&quot; In light of Haltbakk Bunkers&apos;s announced boycott, Norway&apos;s Defense Ministry put out a statement on March 2 reaffirming its ties with the U.S. &quot;The U.S. and Norway maintain a close and strong defense cooperation. American forces will continue to receive the supply and support they require from Norway,&quot; the statement reads. Norway has been supplying Ukraine with military aid in the country&apos;s fight against Russian aggression. Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland announced on Feb. 24 that they would allocate additional humanitarian, military, and energy aid to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/norwegian-fuel-supplier-halts-sales-to-us-over-trump-zelensky-dispute/	2025-03-02T02:42:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2191301206.jpg
UK, France, Ukraine to develop ceasefire plan to present to US	The U.K., France, Ukraine, and possibly other countries will develop a ceasefire plan that will be presented to the U.S., U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in an interview with the BBC on March 2. Starmer is hosting President Volodymyr Zelensky and other leaders in London to discuss how to strengthen support for Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace. The summit is even more crucial now after a fallout between the Ukrainian leader and U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House. The British prime minister and French President Emmanuel Macron, who visited Washington earlier this week, are seeking to mend the ties between Kyiv and the U.S. and present a united front on Ukraine and Russia. Speaking to the BBC ahead of the summit, Starmer said the joint ceasefire initiative would be &quot;an important step forward&quot; after the heated exchange in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. &quot;President Zelensky is rightly concerned that if there&apos;s to be a deal, it has to hold. That&apos;s why we&apos;ve talked extensively about what are the guarantees - in what way do we all defend the deal if that deal is made,&quot; Starmer said. The U.K. and France have spearheaded the idea of deploying European peacekeepers in Ukraine to monitor a potential ceasefire. Macron and Starmer appealed to Trump to remain involved in maintaining a post-war order, but they failed to receive any concrete commitments as the new U.S. administration expects Europe to take responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security. The humiliating treatment Zelensky received from Trump and Vice President JD Vance underscored the growing rift between Europe and the U.S. While most European leaders publicly voiced support for Zelensky after the spat, Starmer called both the Ukrainian and U.S. leaders in an attempt to bridge the rift. The prime minister reportedly told Zelensky that fixing relations with Trump would be necessary to ensure lasting peace.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-france-ukraine-to-discuss-ceasefire-plan-to-present-to-us/	2025-03-02T02:28:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202694014.jpg
Macron, Starmer working to pacify Zelensky-Trump relations 'because what is at stake is too important'	U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron are working behind the scenes to pacify relations between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Volodymyr Zelensky following their public spat on Feb. 28. Macron has spoken with both Zelensky and Trump privately, telling La Tribune Dimanche in an interview published on March 1 that he took the initiative to mediate because &quot;what is at stake is too important.&quot; &quot;The manifest destiny of the Americans is to be on the side of the Ukrainians, I have no doubt about it. What the United States has done over the past three years is entirely consistent with its diplomatic and military tradition,&quot; Macron said. &quot;I want to make the Americans understand that disengagement from Ukraine is not in their interest.&quot; Macron also cautioned against signing a peace deal without any security guarantees for Ukraine, adding that &quot;geostrategic deterrence capacity with regard to Russia, China and others, would vanish the same day .&quot; If Russia&apos;s full-scale war of aggression is not stopped in Ukraine, it will &quot;surely go to Moldova&quot; and &quot;perhaps beyond to Romania,&quot; the French president added. Starmer welcomed Zelensky in London on March 1 following Zelensky&#x2019;s contentious visit to Washington. The leaders are set to discuss joint defense and security plans later on March 2 during a summit with other allies. Ahead of the summit, Starmer has cautioned Zelensky to make amends with Trump because &quot;the U.S. has to be involved&quot; in any lasting peace plans for Ukraine, an anonymous source close to the prime minister told the Financial Times on March 1. Both the U.K. and France have supported the idea of deploying peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of the country&apos;s security guarantees. The U.K. is ready &quot;to put boots on the ground, planes in the air to back Ukraine peace deal,&quot; Starmer said at the end of February. Macron, who has spearheaded the idea of deploying European troops on the ground in some capacity since last year, discussed &quot;practical steps&quot; of a possible peacekeeper deployment with Zelensky in January.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-starmer-working-to-pacify-zelensky-trump-relations-because-what-is-at-stake-is-too-important/	2025-03-02T01:55:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2168217153.jpg
Russia pushing disinformation to damage Ukraine's ties with Armenia, Azerbaijan, intel claims	Russia is spreading disinformation that accuses Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) of trying to instigate an armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, HUR said on March 2. The intelligence agency referred to a fake document presented as a report from HUR to Ukraine&apos;s Deputy Defense Minister Ivan Havryliuk, which has been disseminated in Armenian Telegram channels. Armenia and Azerbaijan are bitter rivals who have clashed in several armed conflicts over border and ethnic issues since gaining independence in the 1990s. Moscow has maintained mostly warm ties with Azerbaijan but was also seen as a key military ally of Armenia. Russia&apos;s relationship with Yerevan sharply deteriorated after Russian peacekeepers did not prevent Baku&apos;s lightning offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh in September 2023. The fake report accuses Ukraine&apos;s intelligence of trying to spark a new war to divert Russia&apos;s attention and disperse its forces, alleviating pressure on Ukraine. HUR noted that the document contains several spelling errors and does not meet the requirements of official communication. According to Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence, the fake report aims to &quot;discredit Ukraine and undermine Ukrainian-Armenian and Ukrainian-Azerbaijani relations, which ultimately benefits Russia.&quot; Kyiv has maintained stable relations with both South Caucasus countries. Azerbaijan has provided humanitarian aid during the full-scale war, while Armenia&apos;s pivot away from Moscow signaled the potential strengthening of Ukrainian- Armenian ties.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-spreading-disinformation-to-damage-ukraines-ties-with-armenia-azerbaijan-intelligence-claims/	2025-03-02T01:43:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1233523455.jpg
Putin ally pushing for US, Russia restart of Nord Stream 2, FT reports	Matthias Warnig, a former spy and longtime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is reportedly lobbying the U.S. to support a potential restart of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, the Financial Times reported on March 2, citing undisclosed sources. Warnig, who led Nord Stream 2&#x2019;s parent company on behalf of Kremlin-controlled gas giant Gazprom until 2023, is reportedly trying to establish contact with U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s team through American businessmen. His efforts come amid discussions on ending Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine and reestablishing economic ties between Washington and Moscow. The Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines in the Baltic Sea were built to supply natural gas from Russia to Europe. The Nord Stream pipelines, fully owned by Russia, were co-financed by five European energy companies. In September 2022, three of the four Nord Stream pipelines were severely damaged in an apparent sabotage attack. Warnig and Nord Stream 2 AG were placed under U.S. sanctions in 2022 by the administration of then-President Joe Biden. Any deal to revive the project would require Washington to lift these sanctions and for Germany to approve the resumption of Russian gas flows to Europe, according to the FT. A U.S. official, speaking anonymously, expressed skepticism over the viability of such an agreement, warning that Berlin&#x2019;s involvement in Nord Stream 2&#x2019;s renewal could &quot;cause huge rifts&quot; with the EU, which maintains sanctions against Russia. Several European officials aware of the backchannel talks &quot;are concerned and have discussed the matter,&quot; the FT added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ft-nord-stream-restart-talks/	2025-03-02T00:53:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/2021-12-thumbnail-image-882jpeg960x0-q90-crop-upscale.jpg
Elon Musk publicly supports call for US to exit NATO, UN	Tech billionaire Elon Musk agreed on March 2 with a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, for the U.S. to exit NATO and the U.N. &quot;I agree,&quot; he wrote in response to a post from a right-wing political commentator saying &quot;it&apos;s time&quot; for the U.S. to leave NATO and the U.N. The news comes after several Republican lawmakers submitted a bill on the U.S. exit from the U.N., claiming that the organization does not align with the Trump administration&apos;s &quot;America First&quot; agenda. I agree https://t.co/ZhjBXCTQfp The U.S. was among several countries, including Russia, Belarus, Israel, and Hungary, that voted against a U.N. resolution at the end of February condemning Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Both NATO and the U.N. were founded by the U.S. and other victors of World War II to promote diplomacy and cooperation between nations as well as to prevent another global war. Musk, an unelected official, currently heads the so-called &#xA0;U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, which has cut significant amounts of government spending, including life-saving foreign aid. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized fellow NATO countries for their perceived lack of contributions to the military alliance and has called for a spending target of 5% of GDP for all members. Kyiv sees NATO membership as a crucial safeguard against future Russian aggression, but Trump said in February that Ukraine &quot;can forget&quot; about joining the alliance, suggesting its bid was a trigger for the war&#x2014;an argument echoed by Russian state propaganda.	https://kyivindependent.com/elon-musk-publicly-supports-call-for-us-to-exit-nato-un/	2025-03-02T00:40:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194418262-1.jpg
Hungary, Slovakia threaten EU unity on Russia, Ukraine ahead of key summit	Leaders of Slovakia and Hungary on March 1 threatened to block EU statements during a key summit next week unless the bloc calls for an immediate ceasefire and launches talks with Russia. European Council President Antonio Costa called a meeting of EU leaders on March 6 to discuss defense spending, further support for Kyiv, and to showcase unity after U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance&apos;s humiliating treatment of President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office earlier this week. Zelensky has also been invited to the EU summit, which will take place after a meeting with international partners in London on March 2 that will exclude Slovak and Hungarian representatives. In a letter to Costa obtained by Reuters, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban reportedly urged the EU to abandon plans for a joint declaration in support of Ukraine and resume direct communication with Moscow like Washington did. &quot;I am convinced that the European Union - following the example of the United States - should enter into direct discussions with Russia on a ceasefire and sustainable peace in Ukraine,&quot; Orban said. The Hungarian prime minister is broadly seen as the most Russian-friendly leader in the EU and a close ideological ally of Trump. Orban was one of the few EU leaders to voice support for the U.S. president rather than Zelensky after their heated exchange in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. &quot;Therefore, I propose not to attempt adopting written conclusions on Ukraine,&quot; Orban wrote, hinting at the fact that the decision must be adopted unanimously. Hungary&apos;s leader has repeatedly obstructed or blocked military support for Ukraine and sanctions against Moscow, leveraging the country&apos;s veto rights. Similarly, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico voiced doubts about Ukraine&apos;s ability to negotiate from a position of strength and said that the EU&apos;s summit statement should include a call for an immediate ceasefire. Issuing the statement after the disastrous White House meeting, Fico also said that Slovakia would not provide financial or military support to Ukraine. Fico halted military aid for Ukraine from Slovak army stocks after taking office in the fall of 2023 but permitted continued arms sales. Slovakia has also provided energy support amid Russian attacks against Ukraine&apos;s power grid. The Slovak populist leader further demanded that the resumption of Russian gas transit to Slovakia &#x2014; a key issue in a conflict between him and Kyiv &#x2014; be included in the summit&apos;s statement. &quot;If the summit does not respect that there are other options besides simply continuing the war, the European Council may not be able to agree on conclusions regarding Ukraine on Thursday,&quot; Fico said. The Slovak leader has previously promoted pro-Russian narratives on Ukraine and the war and met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last December to discuss gas transit issues ahead of Ukraine&apos;s planned transit halt. At the same time, Fico said that Slovakia &quot;respects the need to increase Europe&apos;s defense capabilities&quot; and the decisions of other EU members to continue providing military and financial support for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-slovakia-threaten-eu-unity-on-russia-ukraine-ahead-of-key-summit/	2025-03-02T00:28:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2195100174.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 20 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least two civilians and injured at least 20, including a child, over the past day, regional authorities reported on March 2. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 63 of the 79 drones Russia launched overnight, the Air Force said. Drones were intercepted over Kharkiv, Poltava, Sumy, Kyiv, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia, Khmelnytskyi, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, and Mykolaiv oblasts. In Donetsk Oblast, two people were killed and seven injured in Russian attacks, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. Ten people, including a child, were also injured in strikes against Kherson Oblast, said the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. A 51-year-old man was injured and subsequently hospitalized after a drone strike in the village of Petropavlivka, according to Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov. Multiple settlements in the region were targeted not only with drones but also with guided aerial bombs. One woman in Khmelnytskyi Oblast was taken to the hospital after suffering an injury in a drone attack and was later discharged, Governor Serhii Tiurin reported. Ten homes were also damaged in the attack. A 31-year-old woman was injured in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, according to Governor Ivan Fedorov. Local authorities recorded damage to at least 18 homes, apartments, and cars. Russian forces carried out over 450 strikes on the partially occupied region over the past day, including not only drone but also artillery strikes. Nineteen Shahed drones were shot down over Sumy Oblast, the local military administration reported. No casualties were given. Since the start of 2025, Russian forces have launched 575 drones at the region, frequently targeting civilian infrastructure, including homes, schools, hospitals, and other vital services.	https://kyivindependent.com/air-force-63-russian-drones-taken-out-by-air-defense-in-overnight-attack/	2025-03-02T00:01:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-02-09_47_18.jpeg
Lithuania invests $21 million in Ukraine's arms industry, agrees to joint production	Lithuania has already invested 20 million euros ($21 million) in purchasing weapons for Kyiv from Ukrainian producers and will produce arms in cooperation with Ukraine, the Lithuanian Defense Ministry said on March 1. Ukraine said it aims to raise over $1 billion in defense support this year under the so-called Danish model, which entails foreign partners purchasing weapons and equipment for Kyiv directly from Ukrainian manufacturers. &quot;The Ukrainian defense industry has incredible potential to become a world-class player due to its high-level expertise, based on direct battlefield experience, the motivation and competence of engineers, and the future-oriented mindset of key industry decision-makers,&quot; Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene said in a statement. Sakaliene&apos;s comments come after she signed a preliminary agreement with Ukraine&apos;s Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin and presidential advisor Alexander Kamyshin on a joint production of strategic weapons directly in Lithuania. &quot;An amount of 20 million euros has already been allocated for this, which will continue to grow. However, we are striving for even closer cooperation - to develop joint Lithuanian and Ukrainian weapons production both in Lithuania and Ukraine,&quot; Sakaliene noted. The statement did not reveal the type of weaponry to be produced under the agreement for security reasons. Lithuania has been among Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022. The Baltic country has provided 910 million euros ($940 million) in military support and pledged to contribute 0.25% of its GDP in defense assistance on an annual basis.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-invests-21-million-in-ukraines-arms-industry-agrees-to-joint-production/	2025-03-01T23:29:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1251797848.jpg

Russian proxy claims IAEA team arrives at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant via occupied territory	A new team from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine on March 1, marking the first time the agency&apos;s monitors reached the site through the occupied territory. The Moscow-appointed head of the plant said the rotation of inspectors was facilitated by Russian forces and followed extensive talks between the heads of Russia&#x2019;s state nuclear company, Rosatom, and the IAEA. The Kyiv Independent can&apos;t immediately verify these claims. The latest rotation faced delays due to ongoing military activity around the site, with Kyiv and Moscow each accusing the other of violating safety agreements meant to ensure the IAEA&#x2019;s secure passage. The IAEA did not provide immediate comment and Ukrainian officials did not issue a statement on the matter. Russian forces seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest in Europe, during the early weeks of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. While the facility remains under Russian control, it is not currently generating electricity. Since September 2022, the IAEA has maintained a presence at Zaporizhzhia and Ukraine&#x2019;s other nuclear facilities, aiming to monitor risks and ensure nuclear safety. The agency has consistently warned that ongoing hostilities in the area pose serious dangers. Despite its efforts, security concerns around the plant remain unresolved as fighting continues in the region. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi has urged both Ukrainian and Russian forces to exercise restraint and avoid actions that could jeopardize the plant&#x2019;s safety.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-proxy-claims-iaea-team-arrives-at-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-via-occupied-territory/	2025-03-01T21:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/reactor-4.jpeg
US halts cyber operations against Russia, media reports	Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered U.S. Cyber Command to suspend offensive cyber and information operations against Russia, according to a report by the Record. The decision aligns with President Donald Trump&#x2019;s efforts to negotiate an end to Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine under terms that critics argue favor Moscow. Two U.S. officials familiar with the directive told the Washington Post that the pause will remain in effect while diplomatic discussions continue. Cybersecurity experts warn that the move benefits one of America&apos;s most persistent cyber adversaries, potentially weakening U.S. leverage in both cyber and conventional military operations. Trump&#x2019;s broader approach to Russia has raised concerns among U.S. allies. While negotiations with Moscow unfold, European leaders are ramping up their own defense measures to support Ukraine. Meanwhile, intelligence officials emphasize the risks of halting cyber operations against Russia, which remains one of the most active cyber threats to U.S. security. The pause includes operations that typically expose or disrupt Russian malware before it can be deployed against American systems. A former senior defense official told the Record that suspending these efforts, even temporarily, could allow Russian hackers to regroup and strengthen their offensive capabilities. The order from Hegseth contradicts the administration&#x2019;s stated intent to adopt a more aggressive cyber posture against U.S. adversaries. National security adviser Michael Waltz previously suggested a shift toward stronger cyber deterrence, particularly against China and Iran, but omitted Russia from his comments. At a recent United Nations cyber meeting, a State Department official highlighted cyber threats from China but made no mention of Russian-backed ransomware groups, which have targeted critical U.S. infrastructure, including fuel pipelines and hospitals. The absence of Russia from these discussions has raised eyebrows among diplomats and security analysts.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-halts-cyber-operations-against-russia-media-reports/	2025-03-01T20:45:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1790155286.jpg
â€˜Wrong approach, wrong time, wrong presidentâ€™ â€” Waltz reacts to Trump-Zelensky standoff	National Security Advisor Mike Waltz criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, suggesting he is not genuinely seeking an end to the war with Russia. &quot;It&#x2019;s not clear that Zelensky truly wants to stop the fighting,&quot; Waltz said following a tense meeting between the Ukrainian leader and U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Feb. 28. &quot;He came in, even though he was warned not to, determined to litigate all of that &#x2026; This was the wrong approach, wrong time in history, and definitely the wrong president to try to do this.&quot; Their 45-minute Oval Office press briefing escalated into a heated exchange over U.S. aid to Ukraine, ultimately leading to the cancellation of a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement. Trump later took to Truth Social, accusing Zelensky of disrespecting the U.S. and declaring, &quot;He can come back when he is ready for peace.&quot; Zelensky has taken a firm stance on peace and refused to accept what experts have called &quot;capitulatory deal&quot; that could give Russia an advantage. The Ukrainian president asserted during his interview with Fox News that Ukraine is &quot;ready for peace but we need to be in a good position.&quot; &quot;We want peace... that&apos;s why I visited President Trump,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that he hopes that Trump would show stronger support for Ukraine rather than positioning himself as a mediator in the war. He emphasized that Russia was the aggressor, having launched the invasion. &quot;I want really him to be more at our side,&quot; Zelensky said. The meeting, initially intended to formalize a deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, instead highlighted deep divisions over Ukraine policy within Trump&#x2019;s administration. Ukraine-skeptic Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard echoed Trump&#x2019;s stance, with Gabbard claiming that Zelensky has been pushing the U.S. toward &quot;a nuclear war with Russia/WW3 for years now.&quot; Gabbard has previously blamed NATO for Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, and faced scrutiny for her controversial foreign policy views. Ukrainian-born Representative Victoria Spartz also condemned Zelensky&#x2019;s approach, accusing him of prioritizing political theatrics over Ukraine&#x2019;s real needs. &quot;It&#x2019;s such a disservice to the Ukrainian people to play hero and politics&#x2026; after how much was done by us for Ukraine and for Europe,&quot; she said.	https://kyivindependent.com/wrong-approach-wrong-time-wrong-president-waltz-reacts-to-trump-zelensky-standoff/	2025-03-01T18:23:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193394562.jpg
Canada's Trudeau heads to European defense summit in London	Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau departed for London on March 1 to take part in a European defense summit focused on shaping the conditions for a lasting peace in Ukraine. The gathering, initially planned as a high-level European meeting, has gained new urgency with President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s attendance, following his tense exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Feb. 28. Zelensky had traveled to Washington expecting to finalize a critical minerals deal with the U.S., but the agreement fell apart after he pushed for security guarantees alongside economic cooperation. Trump responded with visible frustration, escalating tensions between the two leaders and casting doubt on future American support for Kyiv. The fallout from the meeting has reinforced European concerns about Trump&#x2019;s stance on Ukraine and prompted fresh discussions on strengthening Europe&#x2019;s independent defense efforts. Earlier this month, Trump&#x2019;s overtures toward Russia alarmed European leaders, accelerating their efforts to enhance Ukraine&#x2019;s military support. European governments increasingly view Ukraine&#x2019;s security as integral to their own, and Sunday&#x2019;s summit in London is expected to focus on how to fill the gaps left by uncertain U.S. backing. France, Germany, and the U.K. have been leading discussions on increased defense funding and alternative security arrangements for Kyiv. Canada was not initially listed among the invited participants when U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer outlined plans for the meeting during his recent visit to Washington. Trudeau&#x2019;s decision to attend signals Canada&#x2019;s ongoing commitment to Ukraine and its role in broader transatlantic security discussions. While Ottawa has provided substantial military and financial aid to Kyiv, it remains to be seen what new commitments, if any, Canada will bring to the table.	https://kyivindependent.com/trudeau-heads-to-european-defense-summit-in-london/	2025-03-01T17:18:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2157822397.jpg
Starmer aims to bridge Trump-Zelensky rift as US expects apology, Bloomberg reports	U.K.&apos;s Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to deliver a stark message to European leaders, urging them to confront the &quot;brutal reality&quot; of growing security threats and commit to higher defense spending. At a high-stakes security summit in London on March 2, he will push allies to take concrete steps to support Ukraine, emphasizing that diplomatic statements alone will not persuade Washington to maintain its security guarantees. The meeting which will be attended by leaders from France, Italy, Canada, Germany, and Turkey, has gained urgency following U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s clash with President Volodymyr Zelensky, which raised concerns about future American support for Kyiv. Amid the diplomatic fallout, the Trump administration has privately signaled that it expects a public apology from Zelensky to mend relations, European officials told Bloomberg. In a bid to stabilize the transatlantic alliance, Starmer has taken on a central diplomatic role, leveraging his recent White House meeting to keep communication open between Trump and European leaders. Following Zelensky&#x2019;s tense encounter with Trump, British officials have worked behind the scenes to prevent the situation from spiraling further. Starmer personally reached out to both Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron to encourage renewed dialogue, positioning the U.K. as a key intermediary between Washington and European capitals. In the meantime, some NATO leaders, including Secretary General Mark Rutte, have encouraged Zelensky to rebuild ties with Trump, recognizing the U.S. remains Ukraine&#x2019;s most important military backer. Starmer and Macron are also pushing for a European-led security initiative, including a potential peacekeeping force, to safeguard any future ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. While Trump has so far refused to back such efforts, Starmer will argue that a stronger European defense posture could help secure American support. He believes that demonstrating Europe&#x2019;s ability to shoulder more responsibility may prevent Trump from fully disengaging from Ukraine. The challenge, however, is convincing other European nations to step up their own defense contributions and commit to long-term military assistance. With the London summit now a critical test for European unity, Starmer is working to prevent Trump from sidelining European leaders in any potential negotiations with Russia. His strategy hinges on ensuring that Ukraine remains central to peace talks while securing commitments from European allies to sustain military and financial aid.	https://kyivindependent.com/starmer-aims-to-bridge-trump-zelensky-rift-as-us-expects-apology-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-01T14:47:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200011633.jpg
Italy to provide Ukraine with $13 million to restore energy infrastructure	Rome signed an agreement with Kyiv on Feb. 28 to provide Ukraine with 13 million euros ($13.5 million) directed towards the country&apos;s Energy Support Fund, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Ministry announced. The funding will be used to support &quot;the restoration of Ukraine&#x2019;s energy sector,&quot; a news release from the Energy Ministry read. Russia continues to target Ukrainian energy infrastructure, testing Ukraine&apos;s resolve as the country is enduring another winter. &quot;This assistance will allow us to procure essential equipment and strengthen the resilience of Ukraine&#x2019;s energy system at a time when the enemy is relentlessly attacking energy facilities,&quot; Ukraine&#x2019;s Deputy Energy Minister Roman Andarak said in a statement. Earlier this month, Italy signed an agreement with the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) to launch a 2 million euro ($2.07 million) project to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s energy system, the Italian Embassy in Ukraine told the Kyiv Independent. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who took office in late 2022, has consistently supported Kyiv and pledged unwavering assistance until the war ends. Material losses from Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure have amounted to &quot;billions of dollars,&quot; according to Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko. Halushchenko said on Feb. 24 that Russia has launched more than 30 mass strikes on Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure over the three years of its full-scale invasion. Over the past three years, Russian troops have occupied territories hosting energy facilities producing 18 gigawatts (GW) of generation. The occupied facilities include hydroelectric power plants, thermal power plants, and Europe&apos;s largest nuclear power plant, stationed in Zaporizhzhia Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/italy-to-provide-13-million-toward-restoring-ukraines-energy-infrastructure/	2025-03-01T13:31:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/10_1_2.jpeg
UK to provide $2.8 billion loan to Ukraine backed by frozen Russian assets	The United Kingdom signed an agreement with Kyiv on March 1 to provide Ukraine with a loan worth 2.26 billion pounds ($2.84 billion) backed by frozen Russian assets. The loan, which is part of the Group of Seven&apos;s (G7) Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) credit initiative, was signed amid President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s visit to London to meet with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer. &quot;The United Kingdom continues to stand in defense of Ukraine. Today&apos;s agreement, which contributes to strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities, confirms this,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko said in a statement. The loan will go towards &quot;purchasing defense equipment according to Ukraine&apos;s needs,&quot; the Finance Ministry said. In October 2024, G7 countries came to an agreement that pledged to provide Ukraine with almost $50 billion loan. The United States will contribute the bulk of the loan with $20 billion in assistance. The U.S. is closely followed by European Union countries, including France, Germany, and Italy, with a combined $19.4 billion. The remaining approximately $10 billion will be divvied up with Canada providing $3.7 billion, Japan providing $3.07 billion, and the U.K. providing $2.8 billion in loan funding. Under the G7 ERA initiative, Ukraine had previously received $1 billion from the U.S. and $3.1 billion from the EU. While Western countries have frozen $300 billion in Russian assets, they can only access the annual income generated by these funds, approximately $3.2 billion. These profits will back the $50-billion loan to Kyiv, while the vast majority of the assets are frozen in European countries. In January, Zelensky and Starmer signed a 100-year partnership agreement during their meeting in Kyiv on Jan. 16. The wide-ranging deal encompasses cooperation in military, energy, scientific, cultural, economic, and other sectors. The loan&apos;s announcement and Zelensky&apos;s visit to London comes amid the fallout of a heated exchange in the White House on Feb. 28 between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. Earlier in the day, Starmer, in line with European allies, reaffirmed his country&apos;s support for Ukraine and Zelensky. &quot;We stand with Ukraine for as long as it may take,&quot; Starmer told reporters at a press briefing alongside Zelensky, adding that Ukraine has &quot;full backing across the United Kingdom.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-provides-2-8-billion-loan-to-ukraine-backed-by-frozen-russian-assets/	2025-03-01T12:34:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/gettyimages-2202072150-612x612.jpg
Russian missile attack on Odesa damages civilian foreign vessel, casualties reported	A Russian ballistic missile struck the Odesa port on the evening of March 1, damaging port infrastructure as well as a foreign civilian ship flying the flag of Panama, Odesa Oblast Governor Oleh Kiper reported. Two port employees were injured as a results of the attack. No information was available as to the extent of their injuries. The Swiss-owned container ship MSC LEVANTE F sailed into the port earlier in the day, local Odesa publication Dumska reported. No information was immediately available as to what the vessel was carrying, or the extent of the damage. Foreign vessels have previously been damaged in Russian attacks on the port. In October 2024, multiple ships had been damaged in separate attacks on the Odesa port. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 23 at the International Conference on Food Security in Kyiv that Russia has damaged 321 port infrastructure facilities, as well as 20 foreign merchant vessels since July 2023. Traveling along the Black Sea route, ships are regularly at risk of being attacked by Russia. Since the beginning of the all-out war, mines have also been drifting along the trade route, which also poses a risk to maritime transport. As a major grain producer, Ukraine exports about 6 million tons of grain per month through ports along the Black Sea. Following an initial blockade at the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Russia unilaterally terminated the Black Sea grain deal last year forcing Kyiv to set up a new export route in the Black Sea. Initially envisioned as a humanitarian corridor to allow the departure of ships stranded there since the start of the full-scale war, it has since grown into a full-blown trade route.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-on-odesa-damages-civilian-foreign-vessel-casualties-reported/	2025-03-01T11:59:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158388860.jpg
Ukrainians, foreigners raised Hr 27 million 'for nukes' hours after Zelensky-Trump White House clash	Ukrainians and foreign donors have sent over 27 million hryvnia ($649,000) in donations to the fundraiser &quot;for nukes&quot; that was opened immediately after the publicized White House clash between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The &quot;for nukes&quot; reference serves as a joke that refers to President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s previous assertions that if Western allies are not ready to accept the country into NATO, then the U.S. should provide Ukraine with an alternative security guarantee, such as nuclear weapons. With many Ukrainians staying up late due to the news about Trump and Zelensky&apos;s heated meeting in Washington, the fundraiser was opened at 1 a.m. Kyiv time by Oleg Gorokhovskyi, Ukrainian businessman and co-owner of country&apos;s largest online bank Monobank. Zelensky left Washington early on Feb. 28 without signing a mineral deal with the United States after Trump reportedly ordered his officials to tell the Ukrainian delegation to leave the White House, despite protest from the Ukrainians. &quot;There are many requests to start fundraising for the nukes. Here is the jar,&quot; Gorokhovskyi wrote in his social media, without elaborating on the subsequent use of the &quot;nukes.&quot; He added a link to the &apos;jar,&apos; Monobank&apos;s famous feature that many volunteers use to raise money for the war effort and humanitarian aid, such as reconstruction of the Ukraine&apos;s largest children hospital Okhmatdyt after Russian missile attack in 2024. According to Gorokhovskyi, Hr 2 million (nearly $50.000) were raised in the first 30 minutes of the fundraiser. Sixteen hours after it began, the sum reached Hr 22 million. It was not immediately clear as to what chartiable cause the money will be donated to. &quot;About 70,000 participants from 61 countries,&quot; Gorokhovskyi wrote on Mar. 1. &quot;After Ukraine, the U.S. donates the most, followed by Poland. Thank you, friends! Americans and Poles are our closest friends and allies beyond any doubt,&quot; he added. The fundraiser&apos;s success shows a wave of support for Zelensky from Ukrainians and foreigners following his explosive meeting with Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance. Following the exchange, a number of European leaders on Feb. 28 reaffirmed their support for Ukraine and Zelensky. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas emphasized the EU&apos;s commitment to stepping up assistance to Ukraine, enabling the country to continue resisting the aggressor. &quot;Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It&apos;s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge,&quot; Kallas posted on X. Ukraine&apos;s abandoned its arsenal of nuclear weapons with the signing of the Budapest Memorandum 30 years ago in exchange for security guarantees from both Russia an the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-raised-hr-22-mln-for-nukes-in-hours-after-the-white-house-clash/	2025-03-01T11:18:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1659540772.jpg

NATO Secretary General calls for Zelensky to 'restore relationship' with Trump following Oval Office clash	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte called on March 1 for President Volodymyr Zelensky to mend relations with U.S. President Donald Trump following a tense exchange in White House a day prior. Zelensky left Washington early without signing a mineral deal with the United States following a tense argument in front of journalists between the two leaders. Trump later reportedly ordered his officials to tell the Ukrainian delegation to leave the White House, despite protest from the Ukrainians. Speaking to the BBC, Rutte said that it was &quot;important that President Zelensky finds a way to restore his relationship with the American president and with the senior American leadership team.&quot; Rutte, who said he has spoken to Zelensky twice since the incident, called the public argument &quot;unfortunate.&quot; The secretary general added that &quot;we really have to give Trump credit,&quot; for providing weapons to Ukraine during Trump&apos;s first term in office, adding that that U.S. commands &quot;respect&quot; for their support. Rutte&apos;s comments come as a number of European leaders on Feb. 28 reaffirmed their support for Ukraine and Zelensky. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas emphasized the EU&apos;s commitment to stepping up assistance to Ukraine, enabling the country to continue resisting the aggressor. &quot;Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader.

When asked if Zelensky though the relationship could be salvaged following the tense exchange, Zelensky replied: &quot;Yes, of course, because it&apos;s more than to the president. It&apos;s a historical relations between our people.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-secretary-general-calls-for-zelensky-to-restore-relationship-with-trump-following-oval-office-clash/	2025-03-01T09:25:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187484276.jpg
Letter to the editor: The Oval Office fiasco was a calculated setup to humiliate Ukraine and undermine democracy	The recent Oval Office meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wasn&#x2019;t just a diplomatic disaster &#x2014; it was a setup. From the moment Zelensky walked into that room, the stage had already been set. This wasn&#x2019;t about serious discussions on aid or strategy. It was about weakening Ukraine, pressuring its leader, and crafting a narrative that justifies pulling back U.S. support. Trump&#x2019;s accusation that Zelensky was &#x201C;gambling with World War III&#x201D; and Vice President J.D. Vance&#x2019;s rebuke for supposed &#x201C;ingratitude&#x201D; weren&#x2019;t off-the-cuff remarks. They were planned. Carefully constructed talking points designed to turn Zelensky from an ally into a liability in the eyes of the American public. And the goal? To shift blame away from Russia, excuse future inaction, and force Ukraine into a losing position &#x2014; all while making it look like Zelensky&#x2019;s fault. Let&#x2019;s be clear: Zelensky didn&#x2019;t walk into a discussion. He walked into a trap. Rather than focusing on ways to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s defenses, Trump and Vance ambushed him &#x2014; portraying Ukraine as a dependent nation that demands too much and gives too little. It was an act of public humiliation, not diplomacy. By demanding that Zelensky negotiate with Vladimir Putin &#x2014; a man who has lied, invaded, and slaughtered without hesitation &#x2014; Trump isn&#x2019;t pushing for peace. He&#x2019;s pushing for Ukrainian surrender. No serious strategist believes that handing over territory will stop Russia&#x2019;s war. History has shown us that appeasement doesn&#x2019;t work. If Ukraine concedes today, Putin will push further tomorrow. The Baltics, Poland, other NATO allies &#x2014; they&#x2019;re all watching. Beyond the Oval Office theatrics, there was something even more disturbing: the so-called minerals deal. According to leaked reports, Trump&#x2019;s team floated the idea that the U.S. should gain control over Ukraine&#x2019;s critical natural resources in exchange for continued military aid. Think about that for a moment. The deal wasn&#x2019;t just about weakening Ukraine politically &#x2014; it was about exploiting it economically. When the U.S. helped Britain during World War II, did we demand control over its coal and steel industries? When NATO defended West Germany during the Cold War, did we insist on taking its most valuable resources? No. Because allies don&#x2019;t extort each other. The only person who really benefits from this? Vladimir Putin. Trump&#x2019;s performance in the Oval Office played right into Kremlin propaganda &#x2014; painting Ukraine as desperate, Zelensky as ungrateful, and U.S. support as a burden for America. This kind of messaging isn&#x2019;t just harmful &#x2014; it&#x2019;s dangerous. It sends a clear signal to Putin: America&#x2019;s commitment to Ukraine is weakening. If Putin believes that, he&#x2019;ll double down. More aggression, more escalation, more war. And it won&#x2019;t stop with Ukraine. If America turns its back now, Taiwan, South Korea, and NATO allies will wonder &#x2014; are they next? This wasn&#x2019;t just an attack on Zelensky. It was an attack on American credibility. Some argue that the U.S. has already done enough for Ukraine. That billions in military aid and weapons should be enough. That the American people are tired of endless commitments abroad. That&#x2019;s a fair concern. But let&#x2019;s be honest: This isn&#x2019;t just about Ukraine. It&#x2019;s about whether the free world still stands against tyranny, or if we&#x2019;re willing to let dictators redraw borders at will. President Zelensky did not cave. He did not concede. He did not betray his country. The question now is: Will America do the same?

Russian forces suffer record vehicle losses in February	During the month of February, Ukrainian forces destroyed the largest number of Russian vehicles since the start of the full-scale invasion, according to Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry. In the shortest month of the year, Ukrainians destroyed 3,472 vehicles and fuel tanks, as well as 596 armoured combat vehicles and 331 tanks, the statement said. In February, the number of combat clashes dropped compared to January: 3,274 against 5,087. Instead, the number of enemy air strikes on the Ukrainian troops&apos; positions and frontline settlements increased from about 2,400 guided aerial bombs in January to 3,522 in February. The Ministry also sited the General Staff&apos;s information on Russia&apos;s manpower losses, which shows that the Russian army irretrievably lost 36,570 people in February. Russia has marginally gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast in recent months but at the cost of heavy casualties as well as equipment losses. As military equipment dwindles, Russian commanders have been forced to provide less protective equipment to soldiers, highlighted by their use of civilian cars in attacks. The General Staff reported on March 1 that Russia has lost 875,610 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022 &#x2014; an estimate in line with Western intelligence assessments.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-lost-most-vehicles-since-beginning-of-all-out-war-in-past-month/	2025-03-01T08:22:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1749127943.jpg
Trump can go to hell' â€” We asked 7 Ukrainian soldiers about Zelensky's Oval Office argument	An astounding political encounter played out in front of the world on Feb. 28, as a highly-anticipated meeting between Presidents Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump descended into a verbal brawl, the cancelling of a mineral deal and &#x2014; reportedly &#x2014; Zelensky&apos;s unceremonious eviction from the White House. Zelensky left Washington without holding a joint news conference scheduled for later in the day, after Trump, U.S. Vice President JD Vance, and a reporter berated him over not being &quot;thankful&quot; for American aid and his decision not to wear a suit for the meeting. &quot;He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace,&quot; Trump posted on Truth Social. The confrontation prompted an outpouring of support for Zelensky, particularly from European leaders, with EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas saying that Trump&apos;s behavior showed &quot;the free world needs a new leader.&quot; As the drama played out on the world stage, on the front lines in Ukraine, the country&apos;s soldiers continued to fend off Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. When the Kyiv Independent reached out to soldiers, several said they couldn&#x2019;t respond properly due to Russian shelling and strikes that occurred in the hours following the tumultuous meeting. One sent a photo of a Russian kamikaze drone strike on their position near the front lines. I don&apos;t know much about politics. However, I have enough knowledge to understand what Trump and his team are trying to say with this behavior. Now in the United States, President Zelensky is portrayed as a warmonger. It&apos;s as if Ukraine started this war, as if we are fighting because there is nothing else for us to do, as if we don&apos;t want peace... But in fact, everyone knows that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin started the war, it is Russian troops who attack Ukrainian cities every day, and not the other way around. Ukrainians want peace, because it is in our country that war is going on, our people are dying. We are grateful to the people of the United States and other countries for their support, and we are ready to share our resources for the sake of peace, but we must have some serious guarantees that Putin will not attack again. Once upon a time, we took our allies at their word and gave up nuclear weapons &#x2014; and what did it lead to? In my opinion, President Zelensky behaved with dignity, despite all the circumstances of this meeting. I support him, although I understand that the United State&apos;s refusal to help will lead to a serious deterioration in the situation on the front. But I sincerely hope this will not happen and that the United States will remain an ally of Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meet in the Oval Office at the White House on Friday, Feb 28 (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images)Bart, special forces sniper Pokrovsk direction I am in f**king shock. Me and all my guys support Zelensky, I would do the same if I were him, I am very disappointed in Trump and the United States. I can&apos;t even find the words to express my disappointment, let him openly express his support for Putin and impose some sanctions on us or whatever he wants. F**k him, and JD Vance and (Elon) Musk. And in my opinion, (Russian forces in Pokrovsk area) are running out of steam, because they keep getting their asses kicked here. A strong geopolitical decision (from Zelensky). Despite the war and other troubles that are brewing in our country, we have saved face in front of a foreign superpower and the whole world. Ukrainians must behave with dignity and not forget that in reality, only the strong are respected. Everything is very, very crazy and just keeps getting crazier. It was very strange &#x2014; I don&apos;t remember ever seeing something like this before when diplomats or presidents have met. I&apos;ve never seen it in Russia, never in Ukraine, and never in the history of the United States. It looked not like presidents talking, but just guys on the street. Zelensky showed too much emotion. If you&apos;re speaking in this situation with people who have helped you with weapons and money, then you must be cooler with them &#x2014; but what he said was true. Maybe President Trump doesn&apos;t understand, but we are very thankful to the American people, and to Great Britain, France, Poland, everyone who has helped us. But if the whole world stopped supporting us tomorrow, we won&apos;t stop our struggle &#x2014; we&apos;ll still try to save our families, our children, our wives, our houses, our country, our independence, and our nation. Help us save our independence, democracy, and stop Russian aggression. Putin is the new Adolf Hitler of the 21st century. Trump is right that a Third World War is very close now. And if we don&apos;t stop Putin in Ukraine, a Third World War will be a certainty. Trump is a pragmatist. He has no empathy, doesn&#x2019;t understand what&#x2019;s happening, and doesn&#x2019;t even want to. To him, both sides &#x2014; us and Russia &#x2014; are morally equal in their actions. He reduces everything to money, but I can&#x2019;t help but recall the saying that true strength lies not in money, but in truth. And the truth is on our side. Trump, as a businessman, is simply suggesting trading our regions for peace. That&#x2019;s quite a concept. Imagine if France had told the thirteen colonies to give up part of their territories to the British for the sake of peace because they had weak bargaining power. It looks like an old dictator helping his old friend get what he wants. I think in a few days, emotions will settle, and they&#x2019;ll try to spin this differently. But just imagine Franklin Roosevelt negotiating with Hitler. I believe Trump is America&#x2019;s shame &#x2014; a country that always declares its commitment to freedom. A country that itself became a nation through a struggle against imperialism. Honestly, Trump can go to hell. Better to stand alone than with allies like these, who help you and then exploit it. You fight for survival, and they barter aid for resources. My opinion is that those &#x201C;negotiations&#x201D; are just information noise and hype for the media, not really worth paying attention to. And the important thing is that all people of the democratic world will pay dearly for their infantility, not wanting to get out of the warm bath of a comfortable life and take responsibility for their countries. Ukrainians are already paying dearly. The same will happen to Europe and the United States. By electing irresponsible populists who promise to solve all our problems in a day, we are simply postponing and deepening them. But these are politicians, they are eager for power and got what they want. Voters are responsible for everything, after all, both presidents were elected in legal elections. We still have many such adventures ahead of us. But we must fight, regardless of the ignoramuses in power. I don&#x2019;t understand how Zelensky held back from slapping him.

Israel wants US to keep Syria 'weak' by allowing Russian bases, sources tell Reuters	Israel works to counter Turkey&apos;s growing influence in Syria by lobbying the United States to keep it weak and decentralised, including by letting Russia keep its military bases in the country, Reuters reported on Feb. 28. Israeli officials have told Washington that Syria&apos;s new Islamist rulers who ousted pro-Russian Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad will pose a threat to Israel&apos;s borders if backed by Turkey, Reuters wrote, citing four sources familiar with the communications. To contain Turkey, Israeli officials tried to persuade U.S. officials that Russia should keep its Mediterranean naval base in Syria&apos;s Tartus province and its Khmeimim air base in Latakia province, which surprised some U.S. officials, according to the report. Syria&apos;s new leadership is in talks with Russia over the fate of the military bases. Some experts say that the new U.S. President Donald Trump could be more open to Russia staying in Syria than his predecessor, Joe Biden. According to the report, Biden&apos;s administration considered offering to ease the sanctions on Syria in exchange for closing Russia&apos;s two military bases Aron Lund, a fellow at U.S.-based think-tank Century International, told Reuters that Israel had a good chance of influencing U.S. thinking, describing the new administration as wildly pro-Israeli. &quot;Syria is barely even on Trump&apos;s radar now. It&apos;s low priority, and there&apos;s a policy void to fill,&quot; he said. Since dictator al-Assad was ousted to Russia in December, Russia began withdrawing assets from Syria, raising doubts about the future of its military presence in the country. Many assets still remain in Syria. However, Russian delegation had since traveled to Syria to reportedly meet the new leadership, and Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin pledged support and cooperation to Syria&#x2019;s new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa. Recent reports suggested that Russia might be close to a deal with Syria to maintain a limited military presence, in exchange for assisting Damascus in its fight with the Islamic State, which remains active in eastern Syria, according to Bloomberg. Ukraine has also reached out to Syria&apos;s new government regarding Russia&apos;s military presence. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha visited Damascus on Dec. 30 and later indicated that Kyiv and Damascus share similar views on the matter.	https://kyivindependent.com/israel-wants-us-to-keep-syria-weak-by-allowing-russian-bases-sources-tell-reuters/	2025-03-01T07:14:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1178072715.jpg
Bernie Sanders on Trumpâ€™s alignment with Russia	U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders sat down with the Kyiv Independent on Feb. 27 to share his concerns about Trump&#x2019;s growing alignment with Russia and other authoritarian regimes, what a possible U.S.-Russia alliance would mean for the American people, the role of billionaires like Elon Musk in shaping both domestic and international political discourse, and why defending Ukraine is crucial for the future of global democracy.	https://kyivindependent.com/bernie-sanders-on-trumps-alignment-with-russia/	2025-03-01T06:35:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_9175.jpg
World stars show support for Ukraine after the White House clash	Several American and European actors and writers published words of support for Ukraine on their social media after the U.S. President Donald Trump clashed in a heated argument with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House. Pedro Pascal, American actor starring in &quot;Narcos,&quot; &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; and &quot;The Last of Us&quot; posted several Instagram stories in support of Ukraine and Zelensky. &quot;Courage has a name,&quot; he wrote in a post featuring the map of Ukraine, also sharing supportive posts from actresses Elizabeth Banks and Piper Perabo, as well as Zelensky&apos;s portraits. &quot;Stay on the right side of history,&quot; he added. Actress Elizabeth Banks posted a Ukrainian flag alongside a statement: &quot;I support Ukraine.&quot; American actor Misha Collins, an ambassador of United24 initiative founded by Zelensky, wrote on X that he&apos;s thankful to the Ukrainian president and all of Ukraine for &quot;standing up to the bullies.&quot; &quot;What I saw was two pompous, traitorous cowards trying to force a courageous leader to kiss their rings. So embarrassed for my country,&quot; Collins wrote. Catherine Deneuve, a veteran French actress, opened the 50th C&#xE9;sar Film Awards ceremony on the stage in Paris with a Ukrainian flag pin on her chest, dedicating the ceremony to Ukraine. She has expressed her support on multiple occasions since 2023. American historian and writer Timothy Snyder also wrote on X to back up Zelensky after the White House clash, critisizing Trump and Vance&apos;s actions. &quot;Trump and Vance act as if the problem is that Ukraine is resisting an ongoing Russian invasion. The problem is the ongoing Russian invasion. If they want to use American power to stop the war, apply it to the aggressor. Abusing the victim is not going to end a war of aggression,&quot; he wrote. Actress Alyssa Milano, who became a United24 ambassador in 2024, wrote a post on Instagram to tell Ukrainians that she &quot;sees them and fees their pain.&quot; &quot;I beg all compassionate public figures, billionaires, elected officials, all the leaders and people of the world who believe in democracy&#x2014; help us overcome this madness. The fight against this regime and against fascism depends on you all.&quot; Milano wrote. Actor Ben Stiller and writer Joan Rowling also publicly supported Ukraine in their social media. After the clash, many European leaders expressed their support of Ukraine and Zelensky, while several pro-Russian European politicians openly supported Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/world-stars-show-support-for-ukraine-after-the-white-house-clash/	2025-03-01T06:29:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/13220d209a32c2e16c526150d0b5ef4f_1655744746.jpeg
Pro-Russian European politicians openly support Trump after clash with Zelensky	Several European politicians that are considered pro-Russian expressed their approval for the U.S. President Donald Trump after he clashed in a heated argument with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban thanked Trump in his post on X. &quot;Today President Trump stood bravely for peace. Even if it was difficult for many to digest,&quot; Orban said. Orban, widely seen as the EU&apos;s most pro-Russian leader, has consistently opposed military aid for Ukraine and maintained close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze wished Trump &quot;endurance and courage in this difficult struggle&quot; on Facebook on March 1. &quot;President Trump and his peace efforts were condemned one after another by the people responsible for unleashing a bloody war and the cold-blooded killing of Ukraine and thousands of Ukrainians,&quot; his statement said. Kobakhidze sparked a political crisis by announcing the suspension of Georgia&apos;s EU accession process until at least 2028 after the elections last October. Protests erupted in Tbilisi against the ruling Georgian Dream party, accused of democratic backsliding and dragging Georgia into the Kremlin&apos;s orbit. Tino Chrupalla, one of the leaders of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, said on X that peace in Ukraine should be achieved even without Zelensky&apos;s participation. &quot;President Trump is cancelling talks with President Zelensky because he is not ready for peace. Peace must still be achieved, even without the beggarly President Zelensky,&quot; Chrupalla wrote. &quot;Since the EU and Germany cannot act as mediators, the US and Russia must come to an agreement,&quot; he added Earlier, AfD showed support for Russian politics and has been mired in scandal after reports of its affiliations with neo-Nazi groups. The statements come as many democratic European leaders expressed their support for Zelensky, who has reportedly landed in London for a summit of European leaders on March 2.	https://kyivindependent.com/pro-russian-european-politicians-support-trump-after-clash-with-zelensky/	2025-03-01T04:13:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1333428293.jpg

He&apos;s set to take part in a summit with European leaders hosted by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss joint defense and security plans on Sunday. A statement from Starmer on Friday night confirmed that he had spoken with the U.S. and Ukrainian presidents after their clash in the White House, BBC reported. According to the report, Starmer retains &quot;unwavering support for Ukraine.&quot; President Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s press briefing in the Oval Office on Feb. 28 ended in a heated argument about American aid to Ukraine, followed by the canceling of the planned signing of the U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement. A number of European leaders on Feb. 28 reaffirmed their support for Ukraine and President &#xA0;Zelensky, including Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, French President Emmanuel Macron, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other leaders.	https://kyivindependent.com/president-zelenskys-plane-left-the-us-to-london/	2025-03-01T01:54:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193577260.jpg

He should apologize' â€” Rubio slams Zelensky after tense White House meeting	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky after his Oval Office meeting with President Donald Trump turned into what Rubio described as a &quot;fiasco.&quot; In an interview with CNN, Rubio said Zelensky should apologize for how the meeting unfolded, questioning whether the Ukrainian leader was truly committed to peace. &quot;There was no need for him to go in there and become antagonistic,&quot; Rubio said, arguing that Zelensky&#x2019;s approach made negotiations more difficult. The meeting, originally intended to discuss U.S. support for Ukraine and potential pathways to peace, quickly fell apart. Trump and Vice President JD Vance accused Zelensky of overestimating his leverage and failing to show enough appreciation for past U.S. aid. Rubio suggested that Zelensky&#x2019;s combative stance raised doubts about his willingness to negotiate: &quot;Maybe Zelensky doesn&#x2019;t want a peace deal. He says he does, but maybe he doesn&#x2019;t.&quot; The fallout from the meeting cast serious uncertainty over the future of U.S. assistance to Ukraine. Zelensky asserted during his interview with Fox News that Ukraine is &quot;ready for peace but we need to be in a good position.&quot; &quot;We want peace... that&apos;s why I visited President Trump,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that he hopes that Trump would show stronger support for Ukraine rather than positioning himself as a mediator in the war. He emphasized that Russia was the aggressor, having launched the invasion. &quot;I want really him to be more at our side,&quot; Zelensky said. The tension escalated further when Trump abruptly ended the discussion, ordered Zelensky to leave the White House, and canceled a scheduled joint press conference. The incident came at a time when European leaders, including those from the U.K. and France, were pressing Washington to take a more active role in negotiations. Rubio, however, defended Trump&#x2019;s approach, saying the president had made it clear that Zelensky would be welcome back when he was &quot;ready to make peace and he&#x2019;s serious about peace.&quot; Rubio insisted that Trump is the only world leader capable of ending the war: &quot;Tonight, people will die in Ukraine&#x2026; This is an unsustainable, bloody war that has to come to an end. And right now, the only leader in the world that can even have a chance of bringing about an end to this is named President Donald Trump.&quot; He added that achieving a peace agreement would be complex but argued that Zelensky needed to engage more constructively rather than resist diplomatic efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/he-should-apologize-rubio-slams-zelenskya-after-tense-white-house-meeting/	2025-02-28T18:40:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194552772.jpg
We're looking for peace, we're not looking to go into a 10-year-war,' Trump says	President Donald Trump on Feb. 28 called for an &quot;immediate ceasefire&quot; between Russia and Ukraine, warning President Volodymyr Zelensky that he must pursue peace or risk losing American support. Trump has taken a confrontational stance towards Ukraine, criticizing Zelensky for being &quot;disrespectful&quot; and accusing him of gambling with World War III. Trump has pushed for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, suggesting that Ukraine should make concessions and that he could negotiate an agreement giving Ukraine &quot;almost all of the land.&quot; In a recent heated Oval Office meeting, Trump delivered an ultimatum to Zelensky, adding that &quot;You&apos;re either going to make a deal or we&apos;re out,&quot; and later declared that Zelensky was not ready for peace if America is involved. Shortly after, the U.S. abruptly canceled the signing of a minerals deal with Ukraine. Zelensky&#x2019;s visit followed weeks of intense negotiations, as Ukraine pushed back against the first two draft proposals for a mineral deal, arguing they placed one-sided obligations on Kyiv without offering any security guarantees from Washington. The proposed agreement, which had been under discussion for some time, aimed to create a fund where Ukraine would allocate half of the revenue from the future commercialization of its state-owned mineral resources&#x2014;including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. &quot;We want peace,&quot; Trump told reporters following the meeting which, he said, &quot;didn&apos;t work exactly great.&quot; &quot;He (Zelensky) overplayed his hand (...) we are not looking to go into a 10-year-war and play games, we want peace. He&apos;s going to have to make peace. He&apos;s got to stop the fighting, he&apos;s got to stop the death,&quot; Trump said, adding that Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin &quot;wants to end it.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/were-looking-for-peace-were-not-looking-to-go-into-a-10-year-war-trump-says/	2025-02-28T17:59:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158937171.jpg
This kind of spat is not good for both sides,' Zelensky says following Oval Office clash with Trump	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. In an interview with Fox News on Feb. 28, President Volodymyr Zelensky attempted to mend any fractured relations that may have emerged following a heated exchange in the White House between himself and U.S. President Donald Trump earlier in the day. The 45-minute press briefing, which turned into a shouting match between the two leaders, ended with the canceling of the planned signing of the U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement. &quot;He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace,&quot; Trump posted on Truth Social. Trump later ordered his officials to tell the Ukrainian officials to leave the White House, despite protest from the Ukrainian delegation. &quot;We are very close partners,&quot; Zelensky told Fox News. &quot;I think this kind of spat is not good for both sides.&quot; Following the meeting, Trump said that Zelensky is &quot;not a man who wants to make peace.&quot; Before leaving for his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump told reporters that Ukrainian president was &quot;looking for something that I&apos;m not looking for&quot; and again asserted that Zelenskyy wanted to &quot;fight, fight, fight.&quot; &quot;Either we&apos;re going to end it or let him fight it out, and if he fights it out, it&apos;s not going to be pretty because without us, he doesn&apos;t win,&quot; Trump said. Zelensky pushed back on Trump&apos;s comments during his interview asserting that Ukraine is &quot;ready for peace but we need to be in a good position.&quot; &quot;We want peace... that&apos;s why I visited President Trump,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that he hopes that Trump would show stronger support for Ukraine rather than positioning himself as a mediator in the war. He emphasized that Russia was the aggressor, having launched the invasion. &quot;I want really him to be more at our side,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine&apos;s president told Fox News&apos; Bret Baier that he doesn&#x2019;t feel he needs to apologize to Trump after a heated exchange at the White House. &quot;No, I respect president, and I respect American people, and I think that we have to be very open and very honest and I&#x2019;m not sure that we did something bad,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;I think some things we have to discuss out of media with all respect to democracy and free media.&quot; When asked if Zelensky though the relationship could be salvaged following the tense exchange, Zelensky replied: &quot;Yes, of course, because it&apos;s more than to the president. It&apos;s a historical relations between our people.&quot; When asked is the confrontation, initiated by Vice President JD Vance, was preplanned, Zelensky replied &quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/this-kind-of-spat-is-not-good-for-both-sides-zelensky-says-following-oval-office-clash-with-trump/	2025-02-28T16:48:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2202537831.jpg
Zelensky thanks America for four minutes straight	During his visit to Washington on Feb. 28, President Volodymyr Zelensky had a heated exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance over ways to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Trump and Vance have repeatedly claimed that Zelensky has not been sufficiently grateful for U.S. support throughout the war. The Kyiv Independent has compiled instances where Zelensky has publicly expressed gratitude to the U.S., its people, and its leadership for being Ukraine&#x2019;s largest supporter.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-thanks-america-for-four-minutes-straight/	2025-02-28T16:11:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-01_01-54-56.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Zelensky, Trump get into heated argument while speaking with journalists in Oval Office	Key developments on Feb. 28: President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump held a 45-minute-long press briefing in the Oval Office that ended in a heated argument about American aid to Ukraine, and the canceling of the planned signing of the U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement. In a post on Truth Social after the meeting, Trump said that Zelensky &quot;disrespected the United States of America in the cherished Oval Office.&quot; &quot;He can come back when he is ready for peace,&quot; he added. Zelensky met Trump in Washington on Feb. 28 as the two leaders were expected to sign a framework deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources. But during a press conference, a scuffle began following Zelensky&apos;s answer to U.S. Vice President JD Vance&apos;s comments. In response to a journalist&#x2019;s question that Trump and his administration were aligning themselves with President Vladimir Putin and Russia, Vance interjected, saying that former President Joe Biden had done nothing to end the war in Ukraine through diplomatic means. &quot;The path to peace and the path to prosperity is engaging in diplomacy. What makes America is a good country is America engaging in diplomacy. That is what President Trump is doing,&quot; Vance said. Zelensky responded by explaining the history of Russian aggression against Ukraine that began in 2014 with Russia&#x2019;s invasion in the east and the annexation of Crimea, noting that Moscow had broken a ceasefire deal negotiated in 2019 through diplomatic efforts with France and Germany. &quot;What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?&quot; Zelensky asked. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; &quot;I&#x2019;m talking about the kind of diplomacy that&#x2019;s going to end the destruction of your country,&quot; Vance said in response. It was at that point that Vance became noticeably irritated and began chastising Zelensky. &quot;Mr. President, with respect, I think it&apos;s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media,&quot; Vance said. &quot;Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems. You should be thanking the President for trying to bring an end to this conflict.&quot; Zelensky asked Vance if he&apos;d been to Ukraine himself to see the problems the country faced. &quot;I&apos;ve been... I&apos;ve actually seen and watched the stories,&quot; Vance said. At one point when Zelensky began to respond, Trump said: &quot;You&apos;ve done a lot of talking. Your country is in big trouble. You&apos;re not winning this.&quot; &quot;We are staying, Mr. President, we are staying in our country, staying strong. From the very beginning of the war, we&apos;ve been alone. And we are thankful. I said thanks in this Cabinet,&quot; Zelensky responded. &quot;You are not in a good position. You don&apos;t have the right cards right now,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I&apos;m not playing cards,&quot; Zelensky responded. &quot;You&apos;re gambling with World War III. You&apos;re gambling with World War III! And what you&apos;re doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country. It&apos;s back to you,&quot; Trump said. Trump also said Ukraine had not been alone because &quot;stupid&quot; former President Biden gave Kyiv military aid. &quot;If you didn&apos;t have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks. Okay?&quot; Trump added. &quot;You&apos;ve gotta be more thankful&quot; -- remarkable scenes out of the White House as Trump and JD Vance team up to do Putin&apos;s bidding and demean Zelenskyy pic.twitter.com/wjp8UfqN0G Trump said it was going to be a &quot;very hard thing to do business like this&quot; before Vance falsely suggested Zelensky had never thanked the U.S. for aid. Zelensky once again said he was thankful before Trump accused him of not being serious about wanting a ceasefire. &quot;You&#x2019;re buried there. You&#x2019;re &#x2026; people are dying. You&apos;re running low on soldiers,&quot; he said. &quot;Of course, we want to stop the war,&quot; Zelensky replied. &quot;But you&apos;re saying you don&apos;t want a ceasefire? I want a ceasefire. Because you&#x2019;ll get a ceasefire faster than an agreement,&quot; Trump said. &quot;It&#x2019;s going to make great television,&quot; Trump said after the argument. The press briefing ended shortly after. In one of the videos posted online, Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova is seen shaking her head in disbelief.

Zelensky&apos;s visit was preceded by weeks of tense negotiations as Ukraine rejected the initial two draft mineral deal proposals, presenting them as one-sided obligations for Ukraine without any security commitments on Washington&apos;s side. The long-debated agreement would have established a fund to which Ukraine would contribute 50% of proceeds from the future monetization of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) was instructed by the State Department to terminate initiatives set to help restore Ukraine&apos;s energy grid, NBC News reported, citing two USAID officials working on the matter. The termination was finalized prior to Zelensky&apos;s visit to Washington. &#x201C;It significantly undercuts this administration&#x2019;s abilities to negotiate on the ceasefire, and it&#x2019;d signal to Russia that we don&#x2019;t care about Ukraine or our past investments,&#x201D; a USAID official told NBC News. Russia has launched more than 30 mass strikes on Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure over the three years of its full-scale invasion, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said on Feb. 24. &quot;Each large-scale attack on the energy sector involves 100-200, and now 3,000 different munitions that simultaneously hit power generation facilities, substations, power lines, and gas infrastructure,&quot; Halushchenko wrote on Facebook. Russia continues to target Ukrainian energy infrastructure, testing Ukraine&apos;s resolve as the country endures another winter. Material losses from Russian attacks have amounted to &quot;billions of dollars,&quot; according to the minister. USAID has funded a wide range of initiatives in Ukraine, from energy security to civil society development. Trump ordered a 90-day freeze on all foreign assistance upon taking office, effectively halting USAID-funded programs worldwide. Ukraine is working to secure alternative funding sources for critical programs previously supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and has already reached preliminary agreements on some, Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said on Feb. 7. &quot;The negotiations are ongoing. Ministers in the Ukrainian government have held meetings on critical programs &#x2014; Energy, Infrastructure, Digital Transformation, and Justice Ministries,&quot; she said at a conference attended by the Kyiv Independent. Stefanishyna emphasized that urgent funding has already been identified for recovery efforts, energy resilience, and cyber defense projects. President Donald Trump is considering ending ongoing shipments of military aid to Ukraine following a heated exchange in the White House between Trump and Zelensky, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Feb. 28, citing a senior Trump administration official. Zelensky has repeatedly urged the U.S. to continue shipping arms to Ukraine as a security guarantee that would strengthen Kyiv&apos;s position in future peace negotiations with Russia. After taking office on Jan. 20, the Trump administration was initially inclined to stop all aid to Ukraine, but has since continued to send weapons to the embattled nation. The Trump administration has said it would not support additional weapons shipments, but has not halted weapons shipments that were started under the previous Biden administration. Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his term freezing foreign aid funding for 90 days. Reuters reported in early February that opposing factions within the administration had been debating whether the U.S. should continue providing weapons. The U.S. has provided Ukraine with $65.9 billion in military aid since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Russian officials commented on the heated exchange between Zelensky and Trump at the White House on Feb. 28, calling the clash &quot;historic&quot; and &quot;a livid reprimand from the Oval Office.&quot; Kremlin adviser Kirill Dmitriev called the argument &quot;historic&quot; in a post on X. Dmitriev serves as special envoy to Russian President Vladimir Putin and took part in the recent direct talks between the U.S. and Russia in Saudi Arabia. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev praised Trump for telling &quot;the truth,&quot; calling the argument &quot;a livid reprimand&quot; delivered to an &quot;ungrateful&quot; Zelensky. Medvedev, currently a deputy chairman of Russia&apos;s Security Council, has made numerous inflammatory statements on social media platforms and has openly challenged Ukraine&apos;s right to exist as an independent nation. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni called on Feb. 28 for an &quot;immediate&quot; summit between the United States, EU, and Western allies to discuss Ukraine amid ongoing peace talks. Meloni&apos;s call for the summit follows a heated meeting between Zelensky and Trump in the White House on Feb. 28 that culminated in the Ukrainian delegation being ordered to leave the White House. The meeting ended without an agreement on a mineral deal after a 45-minute press briefing escalated into a heated exchange over U.S. aid to Ukraine and the conditions of a potential peace deal with Russia. Meloni called for the summit to &quot;talk frankly about how we intend to deal with the great challenges of today, starting with Ukraine, which together we have defended in recent years, and those that we will be called upon to face in the future,&quot; according to a statement. &quot;Any division of the West makes us all weaker and favors those who would like to see the decline of our civilization. A decline not of its power or influence, but of the principles that founded it, first and foremost freedom. A division would not benefit anyone,&quot; the statement continued. Italy will be communicating with allies to propose the meeting &quot;in the coming hours.&quot; Meloni&apos;s proposal comes as a number of European leaders on Feb. 28 reaffirmed their support for Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky, following his tense meeting. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that &quot;Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader,&quot; following the exchange. The proposed summit follows one that French President Emmanuel Macron convened in Paris on Feb. 17, that brought together leaders from Europe&apos;s largest nations and Britain, as well as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and top EU officials. European allies have become increasingly concerned that they will not have a role in negotiations between the U.S. and Russia&apos;s about ending the war &#x2014; talks that Kyiv has also been sidelined from. A number of European leaders on Feb. 28 reaffirmed their support for Ukraine and Zelensky, following his tense meeting with Trump at the White House. &quot;Dear Volodymyr Zelensky, dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone,&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on X. Zelensky met with Trump in the Oval Office, where they were expected to finalize a framework deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources. The meeting ended without an agreement after a 45-minute press briefing escalated into a heated exchange over U.S. aid to Ukraine and the conditions of a potential peace deal with Russia. Zelensky left the White House early without signing the minerals deal, which had been the focus of weeks of negotiations between Washington and Kyiv. Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that. In response to the meeting, French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated that Russia is the aggressor in its war against Ukraine. &quot;There is an aggressor, which is Russia, and an attacked people, which is Ukraine,&quot; Macron told reporters in Portugal. &quot;We must thank all those who helped, and we must respect those who have been fighting since the beginning.&quot; According to Christopher Miller, the Financial Times&apos; chief correspondent in Kyiv, Zelensky spoke by phone with Macron and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte following the clash with Trump. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reaffirmed the EU&apos;s commitment to supporting Ukraine. &quot;Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone, dear President Volodymyr Zelensky,&quot; she posted. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas emphasized the EU&apos;s commitment to stepping up assistance to Ukraine, enabling the country to continue resisting the aggressor. &quot;Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It&apos;s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge,&quot; Kallas posted on X. Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people.Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone, dear President @ZelenskyyUa.We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace. Friedrich Merz, leader of Germany&apos;s conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), echoed similar sentiments, saying, &quot;We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war.&quot; German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock emphasized that Germany, along with its European allies, remains firmly on Ukraine&apos;s side against Russian aggression. Moldovan President Maia Sandu underscored Ukraine&apos;s broader role in defending freedom. &quot;The truth is simple. Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia is the aggressor,&quot; she wrote on X. Czech President Petr Pavel expressed strong support for Ukraine, saying that the country stands with Ukraine more than ever. &quot;Time for Europe to step up its efforts,&quot; he said. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala also voiced support, writing, &quot;We stand with Ukraine and on the side of the free world.&quot; Officials from Spain, Lithuania, Latvia, Norway, and the Netherlands also issued statements reaffirming their commitment to Ukraine in the wake of the White House meeting. Russian forces attempted to cross the Russia-Ukraine border in Sumy Oblast near the village of Novenke on Feb. 25 but were repelled, Dmytro Lyhkovii, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, told the Interfax-Ukraine news agency on Feb. 28. Moscow&apos;s troops have since then continued in attempts to carry out attacks in the area, Lykhovii said amid recent reports on Russian forces attempting to storm the border. The spokesperson&apos;s comments follow the DeepState monitoring group marking Novenke as a contested area, suggesting that Russian forces crossed the border into Sumy Oblast. The village of Novenke lies just across the border, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the regional center, Sumy. Northeastern Sumy Oblast borders Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukrainian forces launched an incursion last summer to draw away Moscow&apos;s troops from Donbas and disrupt Russian plans for an offensive from the north. &quot;On Feb. 25, (Russia) stormed this section of the border (at Novenke) with forces of up to two mechanized units, crossed the state border of Ukraine, but was blocked and thrown back to the territory of the Russian Federation,&quot; Lykhovii told Interfax-Ukraine. &quot;Subsequently, Russian troops continue to attempt assault actions, now with infantry groups.&quot; Novenke, Sumy Oblast, as of Feb. 28, 2025. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation, said that Russia has been carrying out infantry assaults near Novenke for several days, leading to localized skirmishes at the border. Kovalenko denied that the attacks would mark the start of a new offensive as Russia does not have &quot;neither the strength nor the means for this.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, the Russian military claimed. Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000 in Kursk Oblast, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 6. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said last November that the incursion thwarted Russia&apos;s plans to invade Sumy Oblast in an attempt to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; in the region.

Editorial: A president just disrespected America in the Oval Office. It wasnâ€™t Zelensky	It&#x2019;s time to say it plainly. America&#x2019;s leadership has switched sides in the war. The American people have not, and they should speak up. In the past several weeks, the U.S. leadership has demonstrated explicit hostility towards Ukraine and aligned its rhetoric and policy with Russia. The animosity culminated today when U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Ukraine&#x2019;s President Volodymyr Zelensky at a meeting in the Oval Office. After a hostile meeting, Zelensky left the White House. Trump reportedly ordered the Ukrainian delegation out. Let this sink in. The president of a battered Ukraine, an ally of the U.S., became the first world leader in history to be kicked out of the White House. Not a dictator, not a disgraced politician &#x2014; the president of Ukraine, a country suffering from the worst invasion in the 21st century. The country that the U.S. administration swore to bring peace to. In an ugly exchange, the president and vice president joined forces to admonish Zelensky for &#x201C;not being grateful&#x201D; enough for the help Ukraine was getting. To that, Zelensky reminded them that he had thanked the American people multiple times, including earlier that day. But it appears that gratitude to the American people isn&#x2019;t what Trump and Vance were looking for &#x2014; they wanted him to grovel and prostrate himself in front of Trump. Kiss the ring. For sure, Zelensky could have done a better job composing himself and restraining his reactions, but it&#x2019;s fair to say that he was put in a situation he couldn&#x2019;t win. If he let Trump and Vance &#x2014; and apparently, it takes two of them to win a verbal argument against one non-native English speaker &#x2014; continue their line of attack on Ukraine, unchecked, he would be seen as weak both at home and abroad. Weakness is something a country at war can&#x2019;t afford to project. Trump didn&#x2019;t get into the same kind of arguments with other world leaders who publicly disagreed with him during recent meetings. He smiled and shrugged when French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer corrected him and Vance on their provocative and false statements about Europe. Will Trump and Vance hit Vladimir Putin with the same attitude they showed towards Zelensky and scold the Russian leader for attacking Ukraine? By now, we&#x2019;ve seen enough to know for sure that they won&#x2019;t. If any ring-kissing happens in their meeting with Putin, the ring will be Russian. During the heated exchange in the Oval Office, Trump even complained that Zelensky has &#x201C;hatred&#x201D; for Putin &#x2014; the man who ordered an invasion of his country, killing thousands of civilians &#x2014; saying it would be &#x201C;tough&#x201D; for him to &#x201C;make a deal with that kind of hate.&#x201D; After the meeting, Trump claimed that Zelensky didn&#x2019;t want peace. That&#x2019;s a dangerous lie. Let&#x2019;s be clear. There is only one force in the world that can bring peace unilaterally, at any moment: Russia. Putin can order his troops to leave Ukraine and end the war any minute he wants. But Putin doesn&#x2019;t want peace, he wants Ukraine. Zelensky, and Ukraine, want a fair peace &#x2014; one that would bring security to the embattled country and pay honor to the enormous price that it paid, losing the best of its people in a bloody fight against the invader. What happened in the Oval Office is unprecedented, but it&#x2019;s not entirely a surprise. Throughout the weeks leading up to it, Trump has demonstrated hostility towards Zelensky and Ukraine, while embracing Russia. We&#x2019;ve seen it in the things he has said and done. At every turn, there were people that stayed optimistic and tried to interpret it in a way that isn&#x2019;t so bad for Ukraine &#x2014; saying it&#x2019;s part of a strategy, or that it&#x2019;s different from what goes on behind the scenes. It appears it&#x2019;s much simpler than that. Today, Trump said that he is both &#x201C;for Ukraine and Russia&#x201D; in the talks. Then, he kicked Ukraine&#x2019;s delegation out of the White House. There is only one simple way to understand what happened: Donald Trump is for Russia. The president of the United States picked Russia&#x2019;s side in the war it started against its democratic neighbor &#x2014; whose only fault was that it wanted to stay a democracy. Trump is choosing to side with a murderous tyrant over a democratically elected leader. Trump and his government are now making sure Ukraine will lose this war. They are also choking their other allies in the process. But most importantly, they are betraying the interests of America, and making it weaker. The tragedy is that Trump is doing it all in the name of millions of Americans who completely disagree with that and are disgusted with Trump&#x2019;s line. The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s emails have been overflowing with words of support, embarrassment, disgust, and apologies from our American readers who support Ukraine and disagree with Trump&#x2019;s actions. But the U.S. remains a democracy, whether its leadership cherishes it or not &#x2014; and in a democracy, the people&#x2019;s voices can and must be heard. If you disagree with America&#x2019;s current trajectory, with the idea that emboldening tyrants is the path to sustainable peace and prosperity, you have the power to make a difference: Call and email your representatives. Demand support for Ukraine. Organize and go to pro-Ukraine rallies. Write, post, speak, advocate. Donate to Ukrainian causes. Disagree. You are America &#x2014; make your voice heard. Americans should stand up and send their political leadership a clear message: We don&#x2019;t support what you&#x2019;re doing, so stop doing it in our name. We don&#x2019;t want an alliance with Russia, and we don&#x2019;t want a betrayal of Ukraine. And frankly, we are embarrassed. Speak up now, before it&#x2019;s too late. America&#x2019;s president may have chosen his side of history. The American people are still free to choose theirs.	https://kyivindependent.com/editorial-a-president-just-disrespected-america-in-the-oval-office-it-wasnt-zelensky/	2025-02-28T14:17:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201823715.jpg

European allies have become increasingly concerned that they will not have a role in negotiations between the U.S. and Russia&apos;s about ending the war &#x2014; talks that Kyiv has also been sidelined from.	https://kyivindependent.com/italy-calls-for-immediate-summit-between-us-europe-following-zelensky-trump-clash/	2025-02-28T14:09:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2159881751.jpg
European leaders reaffirm support for Ukraine after Zelensky-Trump clash	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A number of European leaders on Feb. 28 reaffirmed their support for Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky, following his tense meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House. &quot;Dear Volodymyr Zelensky, dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone,&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on X. Zelensky met with Trump in the Oval Office, where they were expected to finalize a framework deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources. The meeting ended without an agreement after a 45-minute press briefing escalated into a heated exchange over U.S. aid to Ukraine and the conditions of a potential peace deal with Russia. Following the talks, Trump accused Zelensky of &quot;disrespecting&quot; the U.S. in the Oval Office and said the Ukrainian president &quot;is not ready for peace.&quot; &quot;He can come back when he is ready for peace,&quot; Trump posted on Truth Social. Zelensky left the White House early without signing the minerals deal, which had been the focus of weeks of negotiations between Washington and Kyiv. Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that. In response to the meeting, French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated that Russia is the aggressor in its war against Ukraine. &quot;There is an aggressor, which is Russia, and an attacked people, which is Ukraine,&quot; Macron told reporters in Portugal. &quot;We must thank all those who helped, and we must respect those who have been fighting since the beginning.&quot; According to Christopher Miller, the Financial Times&apos; chief correspondent in Kyiv, Zelensky spoke by phone with Macron and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte following the clash with Trump. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reaffirmed the EU&apos;s commitment to supporting Ukraine. &quot;Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone, dear President Volodymyr Zelensky,&quot; she posted. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas emphasized the EU&apos;s commitment to stepping up assistance to Ukraine, enabling the country to continue resisting the aggressor. &quot;Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It&apos;s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge,&quot; Kallas posted on X. Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people.Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone, dear President @ZelenskyyUa.We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace. Friedrich Merz, leader of Germany&apos;s conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), echoed similar sentiments, saying, &quot;We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war.&quot; German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock emphasized that Germany, along with its European allies, remains firmly on Ukraine&apos;s side against Russian aggression. Ukraine is not alone.Germany together with our European allies stands united alongside #Ukraine - and against the Russian aggression. Ukraine can build on unwavering support from Germany, Europe and beyond. Their defence of democracy &amp; their quest for peace &amp; security is ours. Moldovan President Maia Sandu underscored Ukraine&apos;s broader role in defending freedom. &quot;The truth is simple. Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia is the aggressor,&quot; she wrote on X. Czech President Petr Pavel expressed strong support for Ukraine, saying that the country stands with Ukraine more than ever. &quot;Time for Europe to step up its efforts,&quot; he said. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala also voiced support, writing, &quot;We stand with Ukraine and on the side of the free world.&quot; Officials from Spain, Lithuania, Latvia, Norway, and the Netherlands also issued statements reaffirming their commitment to Ukraine in the wake of the White House meeting.	https://kyivindependent.com/european-leaders-reaffirm-support-for-ukraine-after-zelensky-trump-clash/	2025-02-28T13:11:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-497631536.jpg
Mixed reactions from U.S. officials, lawmakers emerge following Oval Office clash	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. lawmakers and officials voiced mixed reaction following a heated exchange between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 28, that culminated in the Ukrainian delegation being ordered to leave the White House. Zelensky departed in his motorcade around 1:45 p.m. local time, without holding a joint news conference scheduled for later in the day, after the two leaders got into a heated argument while speaking with journalists in the Oval Office. A source familiar with the matter told CNN that the mineral deal between the U.S. and Ukraine was not signed following the tense exchange. Elon Musk, tapped by Trump to be the appointed head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) said on X that &quot;Zelensky destroyed himself in the eyes of the American people.&quot; Zelensky destroyed himself in the eyes of the American people Musk, who is often critical of support for Ukraine, reportedly threatened to shut off Starlink in Ukraine unless Kyiv agreed to a minerals deal, a claim he later denied. Musk&apos;s comments echo those of senior Republican Senator Lindsey Graham who told Fox News after the exchance in the White House that he was &quot;proud of President Trump.&quot; &quot;(Trump) wants to end the war and Zelensky felt like he needed to bait Trump in the Oval Office,&quot; Graham said, added that Zelensky &quot;is either going to have to fundamentally change or go.&quot; Graham, a staunch supporter of Trump, has previously visited Ukraine and voiced support for Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast during a visit to Kyiv on Aug. 12. Graham previously called on the Biden administration to support Russia&apos;s inclusion in the list of countries sponsoring terrorism. &#x1F6A8;BREAKING: Unfortunately, America was disrespected and the deal is off. I have never been more proud of President @realDonaldTrump and Vice President @JDVance for standing up for America First. https://t.co/kElKlDg9Qg Democratic lawmakers expressed outrage at the combative meeting between the two leaders, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer declaring that the Trump administration was &quot;doing (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&#x2019;s dirty work.&quot; Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that Trump and Vance&apos;s actions during the meeting were &quot;disgraceful and downright un-American.&quot; &quot;Once again, they&apos;ve sided with a murderous thug, Putin, over our democratic ally, Ukraine,&quot; Sheheen added. &quot;This afternoon&apos;s outrageous display from @POTUS &amp; @VP was disgraceful &amp; downright un-American. Once again, they&apos;ve sided with a murderous thug, Putin, over our democratic ally, Ukraine. I stand with @ZelenskyyUa &amp; Ukraine&apos;s noble fight for freedom &amp; democracy.&quot; -@SenatorShaheen Mixed reactions from officials within the U.S. come amid overwhelming support for Zelensky from Ukraine&apos;s European allies. Following the heated exchange, French President Emmanuel Macron emphasized that Russia is the aggressor in its war against Ukraine. &quot;There is an aggressor, which is Russia, and an attacked people, which is Ukraine,&quot; Macron told reporters in Portugal. &quot;We must thank all those who helped, and we must respect those who have been fighting since the beginning,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/mixed-reaction-from-u-s-officials-emerges-following-oval-office-clash-between-trump-zelensky/	2025-02-28T12:58:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194374940.jpg
NBC: US terminated support for Ukraine's energy grid restoration	The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) was instructed by the State Department to terminate initiatives set to help restore Ukraine&apos;s energy grid, NBC News reported citing two USAID officials working on the matter. The termination was finalized prior to President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s visit to Washington. &#x201C;It significantly undercuts this administration&#x2019;s abilities to negotiate on the ceasefire, and it&#x2019;d signal to Russia that we don&#x2019;t care about Ukraine or our past investments,&#x201D; a USAID official told NBC News. Russia has launched more than 30 mass strikes on Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure over the three years of its full-scale invasion, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said on Feb. 24. &quot;Each large-scale attack on the energy sector involves 100-200, and now 3,000 different munitions that simultaneously hit power generation facilities, substations, power lines, and gas infrastructure,&quot; Halushchenko wrote on Facebook. Russia continues to target Ukrainian energy infrastructure, testing Ukraine&apos;s resolve as the country is enduring another winter. Material losses from Russian attacks have amounted to &quot;billions of dollars,&quot; according to the minister. USAID has funded a wide range of initiatives in Ukraine, from energy security to civil society development. U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a 90-day freeze on all foreign assistance upon taking office, effectively halting USAID-funded programs worldwide. Ukraine is working to secure alternative funding sources for critical programs previously supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and has already reached preliminary agreements on some, Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said on Feb. 7. &quot;The negotiations are ongoing. Ministers in the Ukrainian government have held meetings on critical programs &#x2014; Energy, Infrastructure, Digital Transformation, and Justice Ministries,&quot; she said at a conference attended by the Kyiv Independent. Stefanishyna emphasized that urgent funding has already been identified for recovery efforts, energy resilience, and cyber defense projects.	https://kyivindependent.com/nbc-us-terminated-support-of-ukraine-energy-grid-restoration/	2025-02-28T12:21:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1247620452.jpg
Kremlin officials praise Trump's treatment of Zelensky	Russian officials commented on the heated exchange between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Feb. 28, calling the clash &quot;historic&quot; and &quot;a livid reprimand from the Oval Office.&quot; Kremlin adviser Kirill Dmitriev called the argument &quot;historic&quot; in a post on X. &#xA0; Dmitriev serves as special envoy to Russian President Vladimir Putin and took part in the recent direct talks between the U.S. and Russia in Saudi Arabia. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev praised Trump for telling &quot;the truth,&quot; calling the argument &quot;a livid reprimand&quot; delivered to an &quot;ungrateful&quot; Zelensky. Medvedev, currently a deputy chairman of Russia&apos;s Security Council, has made numerous inflammatory statements on social media platforms and has openly challenged Ukraine&apos;s right to exist as an independent nation. During an Oval Office meeting earlier today, Zelensky, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance got into an increasingly tense argument regarding U.S. aid to Ukraine and Ukraine&apos;s ability to trust a ceasefire with Russia in the absence of concrete security guarantees. In the exchange, Vance berated Zelensky for not being more grateful for U.S. aid. &quot;You&apos;re not in a good position. You don&apos;t have the cards right now,&quot; Trump said, raising his voice and speaking over Zelensky. &quot;I&apos;m not playing cards,&quot; Zelensky responded. Following the argument, Zelensky reportedly left the White House on Trump&apos;s orders, without signing the critical minerals deal between the U.S. and Ukraine. Trump said on social media following the meeting that Zelensky &quot;disrespected&quot; the U.S. and wasn&apos;t ready for peace.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-envoy-calls-trump-zelensky-clash-historic/	2025-02-28T12:03:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1243385348.jpg
Zelensky thanks US after tense meeting with Trump	President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the United States for it&apos;s ongoing support of Ukraine in a social media post following a tense meeting at the White House on Feb. 28. &quot;Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit,&quot; Zelensky wrote on X. &quot;Thank you POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.&quot; Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that. Zelensky&apos;s thanks followed a heated argument with U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance in the White House, during which the American leaders berated him for being insufficiently grateful for U.S. aid. Zelensky left the meeting without holding the planned press conference with Trump or signing the much-anticipated critical minerals deal with the U.S. Trump reportedly ordered Zelensky and the Ukrainian delegation to leave the White House after the Oval Office argument. Following the meeting, Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social that Zelensky had &quot;disrespected&quot; the U.S. and could return to the White House &quot;when he is ready for peace.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-thanks-us-after-tense-meeting-with-trump/	2025-02-28T11:43:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164821112.jpg
There is an aggressor, which is Russia,' says Macron after Zelensky-Trump clash	French President Emmanuel Macron emphasized that Russia is the aggressor in its war against Ukraine following a heated exchange between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Feb. 28. &quot;There is an aggressor, which is Russia, and an attacked people, which is Ukraine,&quot; Macron told reporters in Portugal. He emphasized that supporting Ukraine and sanctioning Russia was the right decision three years ago and remains so today. &quot;We must thank all those who helped, and we must respect those who have been fighting since the beginning,&quot; he added. Zelensky met Trump in the Oval Office as the two leaders were expected to sign a framework deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources. His visit followed weeks of tense negotiations. Ukraine rejected two initial draft proposals, arguing that they imposed one-sided obligations on Kyiv without security commitments from Washington. The meeting ended without a deal after a 45-minute press briefing between Zelensky and Trump turned heated over U.S. aid to Ukraine and the conditions of a potential peace deal with Russia. Following the talks, Trump said that Zelensky &quot;is not ready for peace&quot; and accused him of disrespecting the U.S. in the Oval Office. &quot;He can come back when he is ready for peace,&quot; Trump posted on Truth Social. Zelensky left the White House early without signing a mineral deal with the United States following a heated exchange with Trump. Macron&apos;s trip to Portugal followed a visit to Washington, where he sought to convince Trump to commit to post-war security guarantees for Ukraine. The French president has reportedly failed to receive any clear commitments from Trump, with an undisclosed EU official describing the trip as a &quot;waste of time&quot; in comments for Politico. The issue of security guarantees has been linked to the potential deployment of a European-led peacekeeping force in Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. The Washington Post reported on Feb. 17 that up to 30,000 European troops could be sent to Ukraine to monitor a ceasefire.	https://kyivindependent.com/there-is-an-aggressor-which-is-russia-says-macron-after-zelensky-trump-clash/	2025-02-28T11:42:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1977990485.jpg
Polish PM Tusk says Ukraine 'not alone' after Trump-Zelensky clash	Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk voiced supported for Ukraine following the dispute between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Feb. 28. &quot;Dear Volodymyr Zelensky, dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone,&quot; Tusk wrote on X.

Poland has been a key ally of Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, providing extensive military aid, including tanks, heavy equipment, and ammunition. Warsaw has delivered 45 military aid packages to Kyiv since 2022, totaling over $4 billion, according to former Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland Vasyl Zvarych.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-pm-tusk-voices-support-for-ukraine-amid-zelensky-trump-clash/	2025-02-28T11:21:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183928589.jpg
Zelensky leaves White House early following following heated exchange with Trump; minerals deal left unsigned	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky left the White House early without signing a rare earth mineral deal with the United States following a heated exchange with President Donald Trump on Feb. 28.

We asked Americans about Trumpâ€™s Ukraine policy. Hereâ€™s what they said	The Kyiv Independent invited its American readers to share their thoughts on U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s policy on Ukraine and Russia on Feb. 24, the third-year anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. In less than a day, we received over 400 emails, expressing views that ranged from cautious skepticism about the U.S. approach to Ukraine to outright condemnation of Trump&#x2019;s statements on the issue. After carefully reviewing the responses, we are publishing a selection that reflects both the thematic and geographical diversity of the feedback. &quot;I am extremely disappointed with the Trump administration&#x2019;s handling of the negotiations. How can they negotiate without Ukraine at the table? Why did they publicly give away any negotiation positions? This is nuts! The Trump administration&apos;s position that Russia was provoked to attack Ukraine is preposterous&#x2014;making Russia the victim is preposterous. Calling Zelensky a dictator and not Putin is insane.&quot; &#x2014; Tom Livingston (Spokane, Washington) &quot;Regarding Team Trump&apos;s approach to Ukraine and Russia, I am feeling most of the same emotions as the rest of your American readership: disgust, shame, anger, worry. The Ukrainian people have had to deal with unimaginable tragedy and yet continue to fight relentlessly every day. Thank God for their strength. I only wish they didn&apos;t have to continue being this strong.&quot; &#x2014; Josh Onkala (Dearborn, Michigan) &quot;For America to engineer the conquering of this century&#x2019;s best ally and to punish it by plundering its mineral wealth &#x2014; which is a greater share of GDP than the reparations demanded of Germany at Versailles &#x2014; is shooting itself in the foot and wasting the lives of good Ukrainians.&quot; &#x2014; Eli Crowley (Albuquerque, New Mexico) &quot;While the idea of peace talks overall is a good one, any discussion of peace that involves Ukraine having to give up something should involve Ukraine. With Trump&apos;s increasing comments revealing his pro-Russian sentiment, I feel so ashamed to have him as my president for the next four years. Every comment diminishes the idea I had back in November that I could just ride the next four years out completely fine like 2016 to 2020. Instead, we are going into a world where the president of the &apos;land of the free&apos; is bending over backward for autocracy. This is the most shameful act of a president in my lifetime.&quot; &#x2014; Brian Mai (California) &quot;Americans have always been proud to be the beacon of democracy, and we have always been eager to promote freedom. It looks like those days are gone. I am embarrassed by our &apos;leader,&apos; but as a Christian, I believe God is in control and pray for your country for a fast end to this terrible war.&quot; &#x2014; Jeff Borger (Ocala, Florida) &quot;Although congressional Republicans have largely edged on the side of cautious compliance with the administration, some are now choosing to speak strongly in favor of Ukraine despite the risks. It was refreshing to see Sen. Thom Tillis (N.C.) rearticulate Putin&#x2019;s &apos;threat to democracy&apos; and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick&#x2019;s (Pa.-1) commitment to do &apos;whatever it takes&apos; to bring the war to a just and sustainable end, just to name a few. Although weakened, I am guardedly hopeful that bipartisan support for Ukraine in Congress remains and that Congress can become a voice of reason and a partner for lasting peace in Ukraine.&quot; &#x2014; Cody Fritz (Washington, D.C.) &quot;If we demand that Ukraine hand over its mineral resources in exchange for support, we will signal to our allies that they need not think of us as anything more than short-term partners. This is especially true given that Trump is demanding payment not for future help, but for aid that was already given. If he succeeds, no nation will trust any prior agreement with the United States, and without these agreements, we will be substantially weaker.&quot; &#x2014; David Papiasvili (Brooklyn, New York) &quot;Any &apos;deal&apos; that Trump makes with Putin will surely benefit the aggressor.&quot; &#x2014; Andrew Kelly (Abilene, Texas) &quot;While I want the war to end, I believe Trump is the one who has been &apos;played,&apos; as evidenced by the Kremlin&#x2019;s talking points now coming out of Trump&#x2019;s own mouth. It appears the Trump administration&#x2019;s plan to negotiate peace is to give Putin everything he wants, blame Ukraine for standing up to Russia, and extort precious resources from Ukraine without providing any security guarantees.&quot; &#x2014; Chris Twiggs (Fernandina Beach, Florida) &quot;Any deal between Ukraine and Russia must be very fair to Ukraine, as they were invaded and suffered greatly. What about Russian compensation to Ukraine? What about the return of all Ukrainian children taken to Russia? The deal is about more than money and minerals.&quot; &#x2014; James Casey, Esq., CPP (San Antonio, Texas)&quot;The moment I respected President Trump the most was when he responded against Bashar al-Assad during his first presidency. That strength is needed against Putin. A victory for Ukraine is a victory for all of the free world and free peoples everywhere. I am proud to be Ukrainian. I am proud that Ukraine inspires people around the world to stand up to tyranny.&quot; &#x2014; David Goncharuk (Dalton, Georgia) &quot;Maybe it is because Americans have not had a war on our land and we have become too comfortable. Maybe we have forgotten the value of freedom, and quite possibly, we have no idea what the definition of freedom is altogether. We definitely do not believe just how fast we could lose it. Too many believe conspiracies that Ukraine provoked Russia to have no choice but to invade, and I fear the misinformation has infected both the populace and our government.&quot; &#x2014; Tara Laraway (New York City, New York)&quot;Trump is an absolute disgrace to Americans. The example of how he handled the Gaza situation in an effort to grab land from a vulnerable group of people indicates his motive for peace talks for Ukraine &#x2014; he only wants access to rare minerals. It also showcases his efforts to try and obtain Greenland. I have a tremendous amount of respect for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. Most intelligent and kindhearted Americans feel the same sentiments.&quot; &#x2014; Amanda Killanbury (Midwest) &quot;Trump wants to get credit for bringing the war to an end. But the peace needs to be a righteous peace, not a surrender. I think Trump should use U.S. troops to go in and get some rare earth minerals and open the way to free Donetsk and Luhansk.&quot; &#x2014; Michaela Hochmuth (Bowie, Maryland)&quot;The honorable course that I wish the administration would follow would be to sit down with Zelensky to determine the support level necessary to win this war decisively and then take the required political and military steps to achieve that level of support as soon as possible. Stop discussing support for Ukraine as a political issue and recognize it as a necessity for the safety and security of all countries and peoples. This vacillating support looks like weakness and cowardice and signals the beginning of a new age of expanding imperial powers.&quot; &#x2014; Todd Buchkovich (Tennessee) &quot;Trump has the guts and ability to put Putin in his place but chooses not to. The Russians are hurting&#x2014;economy, supplies, manpower, etc. &#x2014; and now is the time to work toward a better ending for Ukraine. Apply more sanctions wherever needed, supply more and better arms, and provide any other help toward that end. Europe should take a stronger stand than it has in the past, with more money allocated for defense and to help Ukraine&#x2014;along with the U.S. Ukraine can win with the proper help, not the trickled help of the past.&quot; &#x2014; Bob Olaf (Danville, Pennsylvania) &quot;It&#x2019;s frustrating to watch such an ill-informed person play with the lives of millions while remaining completely unaffected himself. Trump treats geopolitics like a reality TV show where everything is just a deal to be made, and the consequences for actual people don&#x2019;t matter. Ukrainians don&#x2019;t get to wake up from this. This isn&#x2019;t some game. It&#x2019;s life or death, and it&#x2019;s sickening that so many people in power are acting like it&#x2019;s anything less.&quot; &#x2014; Michelle Tansey (Yorkville, Illinois) I think Trump&apos;s push to end the war could actually benefit Europe, though at the expense of Ukraine. For Ukrainians, it is even possible that their government might transition from a democracy to a fragile, decentralized system, potentially giving rise to warlord alliances reminiscent of Afghanistan. While this may seem unjust, it is worth noting that the people of Afghanistan faced similar hardships. Life, unfortunately, is often unfair. &#x2014; George Gee (California) &quot;If a peace deal is so easy to achieve, and if Trump is so eager to stop bloodshed, why didn&apos;t he hammer out a peace deal during his first term when there was a hot war in the Donbas?&quot; &#x2014; Catherine Siegel (New York City, New York) &quot;Negotiating without Ukraine at the table disrespects the struggle of a nation fighting against oppression and territorial aggression. It sends a troubling message that the sacrifices of the Ukrainian people are secondary to political maneuvering. This approach not only compromises their sovereignty but also undermines the values we claim to uphold as a nation &#x2014; principles of democracy, self-determination, and respect for human rights.&quot; &#x2014; Jane Rea (Pennsylvania) &quot;I live in the San Francisco Bay Area with two children attending university. My daughter is horrified at Trump&apos;s actions. My son and ex-husband find Trump&apos;s &apos;hard power&apos; appealing. I have to be careful what I say to my son to not drive him away. I refuse to discuss politics. He enjoys watching World War II movies and recently visited Normandy with his grandfather (my dad, who is British). I do not understand how he cannot see the tragedy of not supporting Ukraine. Imagine if the USA did not fight with the Allies against Hitler unless Europe gave up its coal!&quot; &#x2014; Linda Hall (California (California) &quot;Ukraine&#x2019;s fight is about more than territorial sovereignty &#x2014; it is a battle for democracy, self-determination, and the principles of international law. Any approach that suggests &apos;peace&apos; through concessions to Russia is deeply flawed. Russia has repeatedly shown that it does not honor agreements and that any pause in aggression is merely a chance to regroup and strike again. True peace cannot come at the cost of Ukrainian land, people, or future.&quot; &#x2014; Kristy Black (Utah) &quot;I am a former U.S. Marine and a retired law enforcement officer. I have been volunteering in Ukraine since the war began. I am disgusted and livid about the actions of our so-called &apos;president.&apos; It is clear that he has allied himself with dictators and is implementing a transactional foreign policy based not on values or morals, but on profit, greed, and misplaced nationalism. I wore my country&apos;s uniform for almost 30 years. Now, I am embarrassed to be an American.&quot; &#x2014; &#xA0;Mark Cary (Tennessee) &quot;There are so many Americans who support Ukraine in the United States, please don&apos;t take our president&apos;s horrific actions and rhetoric to think that our entire nation feels this way. The propaganda and disinformation in the United States have been extensive, but there are still those of us who support, defend, and advocate for Ukraine &#x2014; and always will. Putin must be stopped. Unfortunately, it appears the United States still has not learned its lesson on appeasement.&quot; &#x2014; Nicole Ellison (North Carolina) &quot;Speaking as a wife whose husband served as a U.S. Department of Defense civilian for 40+ years &#x2014; nearly 10 of which were under Top Secret Security Clearance &#x2014; we&#x2019;ve never been as terrified for the world&#x2019;s safety as we are now. But the only &apos;peace deal&apos; acceptable to us and other true Americans is for Putin to get the fuck out of Ukraine.&quot; &#x2014; Kimberly Willardson (North Carolina)&quot;The VAST majority of Americans do not support our president&#x2019;s betrayal of your country. However, he tends to flip-flop based on who he thinks will win. Go on, show him, show Russia, show the WORLD why you are not to be underestimated, why you are not the underdog in this fight: YOU are the victors of this war, and do not forget it. The world is watching, waiting for you to finish off what we started. Be brave. Be strong.&quot; &#x2014; Skye Anastasion (Salt Lake City, Utah) &quot;I have five adopted children from Ukraine (adopted from Kharkiv in 2010, Khmelnytskyi in 2013 and 2018). My oldest daughter&#x2019;s brother was drafted and sent to the front in 2024. He has been missing since October. I have been a lifelong Republican, and I voted for Trump twice in 2016 and 2020. Trump uses the fact that many Americans do not understand that most of the military aid Ukraine receives went to replenishing our own military equipment as we sent the older items to Ukraine. It was smart for us, smart for Europe, and lifesaving for Ukraine.&quot; &#x2014; Erin Johnson (Virginia) &quot;Outside my house, I fly two flags &#x2014; America&#x2019;s and Ukraine&#x2019;s &#x2014; but I don&#x2019;t know if I can fly the stars and stripes anymore. Currently, Ukraine represents the ideals of the free world better than we do. I regret that we elected Trump, and I can only hope that Europe will step up where we have failed. I am sorry, Ukraine.&quot; &#x2014; Luke Greenway (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) &quot;I believe there is a stronger likelihood that Trump is attempting to strengthen ties with Russia and pursue another &apos;pivot to Asia,&apos; rather than what some pro-Ukraine Republicans suggest &#x2014; that he is trying to pressure Europe into doing more for Ukraine.&quot; &#x2014; Johnny Diaz (NY, New York) &quot;This shift from supporting democratic allies to appeasing authoritarian regimes tarnishes America&#x2019;s global reputation and erodes the principles upon which the nation was built. The lack of empathy in current U.S. foreign policy reflects a broader moral decline. It&#x2019;s disheartening to witness the country I once admired for its commitment to freedom and justice now falter on the world stage. The American flag I knew was a symbol of hope and solidarity. Now, it serves as a reminder of broken promises and misplaced priorities.&quot; &#x2014; Christopher Briscoe (Ashland, Oregon) &quot;I am a long-term supporter of President Trump. My opinion on his handling of the current situation is that I agree with his goal of finding an off-ramp from the war toward peace, but from the knowledge that is publicly available of how that is going, I am having doubts about the current approach. I do not agree with his untruthful rhetoric, and I do not agree with the amount of concessions toward Russia that have been indicated publicly with the lack of concessions in return. Regarding the minerals deal, I agree with the general idea of an economic joint deal between the U.S. and Ukraine involving development of the post-war economy and ties between both nations, but I feel like it needs to include some degree of security guarantees for Ukraine.&quot; &#x2014; Caleb Ford (Missouri) &quot;Although it is true that we have provided billions of dollars to assist Ukraine when the federal government should be investing more in its own people and infrastructure, I do not agree with the American government&apos;s attempt to profit from this war by requiring access to Ukraine&apos;s minerals. It is being painted as an attempt to recoup funds that have been directed to Ukraine, yet we are not doing the same thing to Israel, which has also benefited greatly from our assistance.&quot; &#x2014; Andrew Arslan (New York) &quot;On the positive side, I believe we&apos;re already seeing signs here that there will be massive pushback against Trump&apos;s desire to align the United States with what Reagan called the Evil Empire. Even some normally spineless Republican lawmakers are appalled at Trump&apos;s seeming abandonment of Ukraine.&quot; &#x2014; Valerie Klauscher (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) &quot;Trump is offering Ukraine a Trojan Horse. President Zelensky should be cautious. Trump&#x2019;s loyalties are with dictators, and whatever Trump promises Ukraine, he will have no problem going back on his word.&quot; &#x2014; John Seger (Redmond, Oregon) &quot;America used to be the &apos;good-guys,&apos; I am so sad we are just Putin&apos;s lap dogs now.&quot; &#x2014; Jed Peretz (Portland, Oregon)&quot;My one hope is that even conservative news outlets, like the New York Post and Fox News, question Trump&apos;s rhetoric, which I have rarely seen before, and that the American people as a whole continue to support Ukraine.&quot; &#x2014; Michael O&apos;Connor (New York City, New York) &quot;Ukraine and Russia can, I believe, ultimately achieve a negotiated outcome, one that preserves a secure Ukrainian nation-state, while lessening the threat that Russia sees from a NATO expansion (or similar Western security commitment) into Ukraine. An armed but neutral Ukraine is probably the best hope for peace in Europe; realistic expectations and conversations are the way forward.&quot; &#x2014; John Byrnes (Oak Island North Carolina) &quot;I hope that the rest of the world looks at what is happening in the U.S. and is preparing to treat us as we should be treated &#x2014; as a country in decline, a country going through a constitutional crisis with a democratically elected authoritarian ruler whose primary objectives are all about his own wealth and cronyism. Corruption is rampant. We are no longer a world leader. We should be censured by the rest of the world.&quot; &#x2014; Eva Rick (Montana) &quot;I&#x2019;m disgusted by any potential abandonment of Ukraine. America is tired of the endless Afghan and Iraq wars, sending our finest to fight for countries that wouldn&#x2019;t defend themselves. Supporting Ukraine should have been the perfect antidote; we support, the Ukrainians fight bravely, embarrass Putin, expand NATO, and the U.S. updates its defense industrial base.&quot; &#x2014; Steve Mulvey (Groveland, Florida) &quot;Holding Ukraine hostage over continuing military and recovery support by insisting that the U.S. gets to take as much of their rare earths and resources is an embarrassment to me as a U.S. citizen. It&apos;s like kicking someone when they are down&#x2014;which is exactly the kind of &apos;justice&apos; that Donald Trump likes to mete out to people.&quot; &#x2014; Johnny Roland (Pleasanton, California) &quot;I think all opinions on the outcome of the negotiations and Trump&#x2019;s intentions are premature. Trump&#x2019;s repeated tactics are to praise his opponents in negotiations and, while I don&#x2019;t personally think it&#x2019;s going to work with Putin, I think the opposite &#x2014; calling Putin a &apos;war criminal&apos; etc. &#x2014; would destroy any possibility of a fair agreement.&quot; &#x2014; Bernard Thomas (San Francisco, California) &quot;Trump and his team are trying to break up a fight in the dog park by throwing bones at both parties: this approach intends to force Zelensky to give up and pay up, while purposefully insinuating to Putin that there is a future without retribution for his initial aggression. It is not only insensitive, but dangerous.&quot; &#x2014; Lily Bolash (Connecticut) &quot;I do not believe that Ukraine owes anything to the United States. Ukraine gave up its nuclear capabilities in return for military protection from the U.S. The loss of that is what emboldens Putin to do what he has done. I am confused as to why Donald Trump thinks Ukraine owes &apos;him&apos; anything. I hope your president stands up to him and does not give in.&quot; &#x2014; Elizabeth Lindsey (Katonah, New York) &quot;As an American with connections to Ukraine, I&apos;m absolutely appalled by Trump&apos;s extortionist approach to foreign policy vis-&#xE0;-vis Ukraine. It is nothing short of a monstrous betrayal of a critical ally, parroting Russian disinformation. How can the U.S. be taken seriously as an international partner, if we turn our backs on allies, present deals which amount to economic colonization, and don&apos;t fully support the fundamental rules of international law and sovereignty? I&apos;m shocked and dismayed. Not only that, but Trump&apos;s team has given away any negotiating leverage before talks even started.&quot; &#x2014; Mikaela Inoue (Brunswick, Maine) &quot;There is unfortunately nothing that can be said by even decent Americans to quell the fear that the U.S. is abandoning its commitment to the system that has kept Europe safe since 1945. We should call it what it is &#x2014; a complete and total capitulation to a revisionist, imperialist Russia and a retreat to the isolationism that echoes the interwar period. A chilling truth needs to be recognized: our reversal on Ukraine makes the U.S., at least for the time being, an adversary to open and free societies, and we must be treated accordingly.&quot; &#x2014; Luca Iwasykiw &#xA0;(Washington, D.C.) &quot;The longer Ukraine lasts, the more fragile Russia becomes, and at some point, it will break.&quot; &#x2014; Charles Corfield (Denver, Colorado) &quot;I think that most Americans do not realize that Ukraine gave up a huge stockpile of nuclear weapons and received security guarantees from the U.S. and Russia as signatories. Russia ignored their own promises and did exactly the opposite of those promises by invading Ukraine, starting with Crimea and then trying to destroy the whole country of Ukraine.&quot; &#x2014; Michael Bowe (Winthrop, Maine) &quot;Any peace agreement that cedes Ukrainian territory &#x2014; that, which is currently Russian-occupied or annexed&#x2014;would mean abandoning thousands of Ukrainian citizens and subjecting them to Russian persecution and pro-Kremlin reeducation. Trump&#x2019;s willingness to normalize annexation and occupation seems to serve his own administration&#x2019;s goals, as it turns its own sights on foreign territories.&quot; &#x2014; Marika Olijar and Isabella Palange (Madison, Wisconsin) &quot;Negotiating directly with Russia without European or Ukrainian representatives is a victory for the Russian Federation. Continuing this approach will allow Russia to dictate the future of Europe without opposition. The Russians have previously stated that they want to control territory in southern and eastern Ukraine, and giving this territory to Russia would reward that country for its unprovoked war.&quot; &#x2014; Mark Temnycky (U.S.) &quot;I&apos;m a retired U.S. Marine and have been to Kharkiv (2015) and Odessa (2021). I&apos;m bitterly disappointed with the Trump administration&apos;s policy in this war. In my opinion, President Trump drank the Russians&apos; disinformation campaign Kool-Aid and his ego won&apos;t allow him to admit he&apos;s wrong.&quot; &#x2014; Dudley Garidel (Baton Rouge, Louisiana) &quot;I feel that the U.S. has absolutely betrayed Ukraine. Given the Budapest Memorandum, we should have given Zelensky everything he asked for in a timely manner.&quot; &#x2014; Rich Letrent (Hamilton, NJ USA) &quot;I have fought two wars and was wounded several times for my country. The Marines I lost in those wars knew we were fighting so others could live in relative peace and freedom. We were willing to die just for the possibility of it. They weren&#x2019;t having to pay for their peace, so why would Ukraine have to pay in mineral rights for theirs? The Budapest Memorandum was backed by American values, and Russia knew that. Defending Ukraine should have started in 2014, but we failed, and Europe failed. History and mankind are watching and we are on the wrong side of it.&quot; &#x2014; Thomas W. Whorl (Cambridge, Maryland) &quot;Trump admires Putin because he wants to be Putin, so of course this is unraveling in a terrifying way. And everyone has become so desensitized to all the nonsense mixed with hate speech that we&apos;ve somehow landed here. In what feels like 1930s Germany, except the whole world is involved because social cultures don&apos;t need to bother with physical borders anymore.&quot; &#x2014; Maring Ladd (Chicago, Illinois) &quot;I am appalled by the shifts in policy under the Trump administration. As it begins to partner with Putin and Russia, the Trump administration is becoming complicit in war crimes and crimes against humanity. The approach reminds me of negotiations conducted by mafiosos. The demand for Ukraine&#x2019;s mineral wealth is criminal blackmail. As an old man (77), my solidarity with you and with Ukraine is probably not worth very much, but it is&#x2014;and will be&#x2014;unwavering. Think of me as a student of Timothy Snyder.&quot; &#x2014; Tony Brinkley (Bangor, Maine) &quot;Walk carefully, my friends, Trump is a snake and he cares not for you.&quot; &#x2014; Michael Christie (Michigan) &quot;Although nothing can compare to what sense of betrayal the average Ukrainian must be feeling right now, I have become embarrassed to have seen ourselves align with the dictatorships of Russia and North Korea.&quot; &#x2014; Alex Sanchez (Sacramento, California) &quot;Donald Drumpf (I cannot even bear to say his name) cares only about himself, a classic narcissist. I think he also admires the narcissism of Putin. Both spin lies to gain traction. The good news here might be that Drumpf has notoriously poor follow-through. And his minions are largely unproven idiots.&quot; &#x2014; J. Moor&#x435; (Boulder, Colorado) &quot;The American people, even many who voted for Trump, are horrified at his moves to gut our government of anybody with expertise and his adoption of Kremlin talking points and viewpoints. I can only hope and pray that our Congress grows a spine and shuts this fool down.&quot; &#x2014; JF Smith (Atlanta, Georgia) &quot;There is no precedent in American history for this apparent retreat from support for a democratic nation under attack, let alone for siding with the aggressor nation.&quot; &#x2014; Robert Gillette (Ossipee, New Hampshire) &quot;As a second-generation Ukrainian, I am deeply disgusted by President Trump&#x2019;s blatant betrayal of my friends, my family, and the values that this country claims to uphold. This is not merely a political misstep; it is a moral failing that undermines the very essence of what America claims to represent. For the first time in my life, I feel estranged from this nation, as our ideals of justice and solidarity have been shamelessly discarded by those in power.&quot; &#x2014; Hanna Liszniansky (Cleveland, Ohio) &quot;The American people are not so foolish. We still support your struggle and understand the value of allies like NATO. Our maniac leader wants to surrender your future; we do not.&quot; &#x2014; Dave Roberts (Santa Rosa, California) &quot;Ukraine belongs in NATO and the European Union. We need to have 1991 borders including Crimea. In addition, we need a lasting peace with security guarantees &#x2014; not useless agreements like the Budapest Memorandum or Minsk Accords. Putin belongs in The Hague as he is a war criminal and Trump needs to be impeached and Elon Musk needs to go back to South Africa.&quot; &#x2014; Dr Reagan L (New York) &quot;I have always been proud of my ancestral homeland, but never more so than over the last three years. I know that if Ukraine runs out of rockets, they&apos;ll use shells. If they run out of shells, they&apos;ll use bullets. &#xA0;If they run out of bullets, they&apos;ll use stones. Ukraine may be occupied, but she will never be conquered.&quot; &#x2014; James Derych Editor&#x2019;s Note: The opinions expressed in the op-ed section are those of the authors and do not purport to reflect the views of the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-asked-americans-about-trumps-ukraine-policy-heres-what-they-said/	2025-02-28T11:00:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161353804.jpg
BREAKING: Zelensky 'not ready for peace,' Trump says after heated Oval Office clash	Editor&apos;s note: This story has been updated with the latest details. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 28, after meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House, that Zelensky &quot;is not ready for peace.&quot; &quot;He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace,&quot; Trump posted on Truth Social shortly after the meeting. Zelensky has since left the White House, according to Reuters. Trump said his meeting with Zelensky at the White House was meaningful and revealed things that &quot;could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure.&quot; He also claimed that Zelensky was &quot;not ready for peace if America is involved&quot; because he believed U.S. support gave him an advantage in negotiations. &quot;I don&apos;t want advantage, I want peace,&quot; Trump added. The two leaders held a 45-minute press briefing in the Oval Office, which ended in a heated exchange over American aid to Ukraine and the conditions of a potential peace deal with Russia. The dispute began when Zelensky responded to U.S. Vice President JD Vance&apos;s assertion that Ukraine must accept U.S.-proposed peace terms. As Zelensky attempted to make his case, Trump interrupted: &quot;You&apos;ve done a lot of talking.&quot; Zelensky pushed back, saying, &quot;From the start of the war, we were alone.&quot; Trump countered: &quot;If you didn&apos;t have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s visit was preceded by weeks of tense negotiations as Ukraine rejected the initial two draft proposals, presenting them as one-sided obligations for Ukraine without any security commitments on Washington&apos;s side. The long-debated agreement establishes a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the future monetization of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. Zelensky&apos;s reluctance to pen the initial draft, presented to him by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Kyiv on Feb. 12, prompted Trump to publicly lash out against the Ukrainian president. Last week, Trump denounced Ukraine&apos;s head of state as a &quot;dictator,&quot; accusing him of refusing to hold elections while echoing the Kremlin&apos;s false narratives about Zelensky&apos;s illegitimacy.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-not-ready-for-peace-trump-says-after-heated-oval-office-clash/	2025-02-28T10:42:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201830448.jpg

Ukraine's security guarantees are Europe's responsibility, Trump tells Zelensky	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 28 during a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington that security guarantees for Ukraine would be Europe&apos;s responsibility. Trump said he wants to finalize the peace deal between Ukraine and Russia first, emphasizing that security guarantees are only a minor part of the issue. &quot;I know that France is going to (provide guarantees), I know the U.K. is going to&#x2026; But we would have security in a different form.

BREAKING: Zelensky meets Trump in Washington to sign natural resources deal	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Feb. 28 as the two leaders are expected to sign a framework deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources.

As the U.S. and Ukrainian teams made progress on the deal, the final version of which was obtained by the Kyiv Independent, Trump softened his rhetoric, seemingly retracting his earlier statements. &quot;Did I say that? I can&apos;t believe I would say that,&quot; Trump said during a meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Feb. 27 when asked by a journalist whether he still considers Zelensky a &quot;dictator.&quot; While Ukrainian negotiators succeeded in pushing back on the toughest conditions set by the U.S. in the initial drafts, such as a demand for Kyiv to fill a $500 billion reconstruction fund and a 2:1 investment clause for Kyiv to double the aid given by the U.S., the current framework agreement still contains little in regard to security guarantees. Zelensky said that security commitments would be discussed in future rounds of talks with the U.S. and other partners, though Trump has already signaled he expects European partners to take responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s post-war security.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-trump-in-washington-to-conclude-natural-resources-deal/	2025-02-28T08:26:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-28-at-7_23_46-PM.jpeg
Belarus Weekly: Russia, Belarus confirm Zapad-2025 joint military drills in September	After 3 years of full-scale war, EU imposes sanctions on Belarus&apos; Integral micro-electronics producer for supplying Russia with microchips for its missiles. Russia, Belarus confirm they will hold Zapad-2025 joint military drills in September. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko extends the power of local authorities allowing them to approve heads of private companies. Belarusian journalist Ihar Ilyash goes on trial for &#x2018;extremist&#x2019; interviews. PEN International calls for the release of Belarusian-Polish journalist Andrzej Poczobut. The European Council imposed restrictions on Integral, a Belarusian micro-electronics producer supplying the Russian military, under the European Union&#x2019;s 16th sanctions package, which was adopted on Feb. 24 &#x2013; three years since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Belarus, a staunch ally of the Kremlin, has not sent its own troops to the battlefield, but allowed the Russian military to use its territory and infrastructure extensively when Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has also helped Russia circumvent sanctions. The latest EU package imposes sanctions on JSC Integral, which makes semiconductors that were found as part of the wreckage of Russian missiles such as the R-37, Kh-59M2A, S-300, Kh-101, and Iskander, according to earlier media reports. JSC Integral cooperates with Russian defense sector firms Ulyanovsk Instrument Design Bureau and Radar MMS, and has received $350 million in investment from Russia. Ukrainian flags fly in front of the Berlaymont, the EU Commission headquarters, for the 3rd anniversary of the large scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia on Feb. 24, 2025 in Brussels, Belgium. (Thierry Monasse/Getty Images)Integral has increased its profits fortyfold since 2021, reporting $50 million in profits in 2023 &#x2013; despite being under U.S. sanctions. The new EU measures also block Belarusian citizens&#x2019; access to European crypto-asset platforms to prevent sanction circumvention. Belarusian nationals without valid European residence permits can no longer hold crypto-asset wallets, and are barred from managing positions in crypto-exchange platforms. Other provisions of the 16th sanction package for Belarus mirror trade restrictions already imposed by the EU on Russia. &#x201C;With talks underway to end Russia&#x2019;s aggression, we must put Ukraine in the strongest possible position, and sanctions provide leverage,&#x201D; said Kaja Kallas, the EU&#x2019;s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The new sanction package, adopted on the third anniversary of the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, also targets the Russian shadow fleet of vessels used to circumvent the oil price cap mechanism, support Russia&#x2019;s energy sector, and transport military equipment or stolen Ukrainian grain. In addition, restrictions were imposed on 13 regional banks and 53 trade entities directly supporting the Russian defense sector as the Kremlin wages its war of aggression against Ukraine. The council also suspended broadcasting licenses for a range of Russia-controlled media outlets. Russia and Belarus will hold a major military exercise, titled Zapad-2025, in mid-September this year, Belarusian state-owned news agency Belta reported on Feb. 20, officially confirming the date for the first time. Military allies Russia and Belarus have been conducting the Zapad (&quot;West&quot; in Russian) strategic drills every two years since 2009. The exercises in 2025 were announced in October 2024, though no dates were given. Belarus will host 13,000 Russian troops during Zapad 2025, Belta reports, citing the head of the Department of International Military Cooperation of the Belarusian Defense Ministry, Valery Revenka. Revenka claimed that Belarus is &quot;developing its position&quot; regarding the invitations for OSCE member states to observe the drills, and also declared Belarus&apos;s readiness to conduct a mutual military inspection with Poland of the areas within 80 kilometers of their mutual border. The drills come amid growing concern over a potential buildup of Russian troops in Belarus in 2025. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed Russia plans to deploy 15 divisions, totaling 100,000 to 150,000 troops, primarily in Belarus in preparation for a major military escalation. However, the Lithuanian Armed Forces press office said on Feb. 25 that no redeployment of Russian forces has been detected so far. &#xA0; &quot;At the moment, military intelligence is monitoring Russia&apos;s actions in Ukraine, and there is no indication that forces are being redeployed closer to Lithuania,&#x201D; a statement from the Lithuanian Armed Forces reads. &#x201C;The situation in Belarus remains unchanged: intensive but stable military training,&quot; the statement says. The previous Zapad strategic exercises were held in 2021, and involved 200,000 Russian and Belarusian troops. The exercise was followed by another military drill, &quot;Union Resolve 2022,&quot; which was used to disguise the buildup of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border in late 2021 ahead of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Longtime Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko signed a decree on Feb. 21 granting district and city executive committee chairs the right to approve the heads of organizations operating in the territories they govern, including those under private ownership, Lukashenko&#x2019;s press office reported. Lukashenko first proposed allowing local authorities to govern privately owned companies in November 2024. His administration confirmed on Feb. 6 that a decree was in being drafted, targeting major employers while exempting small businesses. The decree foresees a wholesale expansion of the powers of local authorities. It will enter into effect on March 1. &#xA0; The decree stipulates that local executive committees are to draw up a list of firms operating under their jurisdiction, excluding organizations that are the sole owners of their property. The chairmen of local committees would then have a say in the appointment of the heads of organizations, deputy heads of organizations managing communal property in the area, and key specialists in agricultural organizations on the list. It remains unclear how local authorities will execute the decree. In 2024, payments from organizations accounted for 94.1% of all tax revenues in Belarus, with privately owned companies contributing 55.7%. Belarusian entrepreneur and economic analyst Aliaksandr Knyrovich sees the decree as an attempt by the government to control private enterprises, but described it as an unfeasible formality &#x2013; &#x201C;a monarchic whim that the villeins will try to pretend to fulfill.&#x201D; &#x201C;Two economies have been formed in Belarus: the one that creates value &#x2013; private business &#x2013; and the one that devours it,&#x201D; Knyrovich told the Kyiv Independent. The perceived grandeur of Belarus&#x2019;s state-run economy is an &#x201C;optical illusion,&#x201D; he said, adding that private firms are responsible for 52% of investment. The analyst said such attempts to control private businesses were due to the economic shortcomings in the Russian market of Lukashenko&#x2019;s state-run enterprises, and the administration&apos;s desire to stop the outflow of the workforce from the regions. According to Knyrovich, the government already has enough mechanisms to control private firms &#x2013; virtually non-stop inspections leading to fines or criminal cases. In dire scenarios, prison terms for the leadership are used as a pretext to nationalize an enterprise. However, the analyst said he does not expect the decree to lead to mass nationalization in Belarus. This is not the first non-market economic intervention by Lukashenko&#x2019;s government. In October 2022, on Lukashenko&#x2019;s orders, the government imposed sweeping price caps on consumer goods to stop rising prices. The restrictions have been slightly relaxed since then, but government control over consumer prices remains in place, artificially suppressing inflation that could otherwise reach 10-11% in 2024 instead of 5.5%, according to economists at BEROC &#x2013; the country&#x2019;s leading market economics think tank. Belarusian journalist and co-author of the book &#x201C;Belarusian Donbas,&#x201D; Ihar Ilyash, was put on trial on Feb. 21 on charges of discrediting Belarus and aiding &#x201C;extremist activities,&#x201D; the Viasna Human Rights Center has reported. Formerly a journalist for the Polish-funded satellite TV channel Belsat, Ilyash was detained in late October 2024 over interviews he gave to media that have been designated as extremists by Belarusian authorities. If found guilty, he faces up to three and five years of imprisonment. European and British diplomats, including representatives of Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, Slovakia, the Netherlands, and Sweden, gathered at the Minsk City Court building in a show of solidarity with the political prisoner. &#x201C;Today, we came to support Ihar Ilyash,&#x201D; the German Embassy said in a statement. &quot;There is a lawsuit against him because of his statements about the arrest of his wife, Katerina Bahvalova, for political reasons, and about Belarus&#x2019;s participation in Russia&#x2019;s illegal war of conquest against Ukraine. The right to freedom of speech and expression must be respected.&#x201D; Together with his wife, Belsat correspondent Katerina Bahvalova, Ilyash co-authored &#x201C;Belarusian Donbas,&#x201D; a book documenting Belarus&#x2019;s involvement in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine since 2014. Published in Kyiv in 2020, the book was slapped with an &#x201C;extremist&#x201D; label in Belarus in March 2021. Despite the threat of his arrest, Ilyash opted to stay in Belarus to support his wife. Bahvalova, detained in November 2020 as she was covering a protest rally in Minsk, was among the first Belarusian journalists jailed for their work. When she had almost served her term in full, she was charged with treason and sentenced to another eight years in prison. Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders says there are 39 journalists and five media workers among Belarus&#x2019;s 1,220 political prisoners. Around 35 independent media outlets and 33 individuals have been designated as extremists in Belarus, and 12 journalists have been included on the state list of &#x201C;terrorists,&#x201D; according to a Belarusian Association of Journalists report. Before Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Belarus was considered Europe&#x2019;s most dangerous country for journalists. Worldwide association of writers PEN International on Feb. 24 called for the release of Andrzej Poczobut, a Polish-Belarusian activist and correspondent for Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, who was sentenced to eight years in prison in Belarus in 2023 on charges of &#x201C;encouraging actions aimed at harming national security.&#x201D; PEN International, which advocates freedom of expression worldwide, claimed that Poczobut&#x2019;s case was emblematic of the type of oppression experienced by writers and journalists who speak up for the rights of oppressed minorities. &#x201C;Locked away, deprived of the very freedoms he seeks to protect, his persecution is a chilling reminder of the lengths to which the Belarusian authorities will go to crush dissent,&#x201D; Urtzi Urrutikoetxea, the Chair of the Translation and Linguistic Rights Committee of PEN International, said in a statement.

(Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Poland dismisses Poczobut&#x2019;s charges as politically motivated and has made his release one of three conditions for normalizing relations with Belarus. The rift between Poland and Belarus has grown over the past five years, particularly after the 2020 Belarusian election crisis, during which Poland supported the Belarusian opposition. Relations further soured due to Belarus&#x2019;s involvement in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine and its fomenting of a migration crisis on the borders of the European Union. The release of political prisoners has been the subject of recent discussions between the U.S. and Belarus, with the United States potentially providing sanctions relief in return for the release of those kept captive in Belarus on politically motivated charges, the New York Times reported last week. However, even as Belarus has been negotiating with Washington, and &#x201C;pardoning&#x201D; around 260 political prisoners in small batches in recent months, human rights organizations have said that at the same time even more individuals became political prisoners.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-russia-belarus-confirm-zapad-2025-joint-military-drills-in-september/	2025-02-28T08:06:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-3.28.40-AM.png
Weapons, cash seized as Romania targets far-right politician Georgescu's network, Reuters reports	Romanian prosecutors requested the temporary arrest of 21 individuals linked to far-right politician Calin Georgescu on Feb. 28, days after his detention, Reuters reported. During raids at multiple addresses linked to Georgescu and his associates, prosecutors seized a cache of weapons, including grenade launchers, as well as hidden cash. Georgescu, a pro-Russian politician who has called Ukraine a &quot;fictional state,&quot; won the first round of Romania&apos;s presidential election on Nov. 24. The country&apos;s Constitutional Court later nullified the results, citing &quot;organized manipulation from abroad.&quot; The Romania&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office has charged Georgescu with &quot;incitement to actions against the constitutional order&quot; and other offenses in a six-count indictment. Authorities say a broader investigation into election-related crimes uncovered links to an alleged illegal weapons network. Among the 21 individuals now facing arrest is former French Foreign Legion soldier Horatiu Potra, who served under contract in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. &quot;About the weapons, I will admit to illegal possession, but first I want to say that... rather than die legally, it is better to live illegally,&quot; Potra said, as quoted by Reuters. Romanian intelligence agencies have attributed Georgescu&apos;s unexpected electoral success to &quot;aggressive Russian hybrid attacks, including cyberattacks, information leaks, and sabotage.&quot; The country&apos;s foreign intelligence service (SIE) reported that a &quot;state actor&quot; had backed a sophisticated disinformation campaign to promote the far-right candidate. U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance criticized Romania&apos;s decision to annul the election results, calling it &quot;flimsy&quot; and politically motivated. Billionaire Elon Musk, an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, also weighed in, denouncing Georgescu&apos;s detention in a post on X, the social media platform he owns. Bloomberg reported on Feb. 18 that the Trump administration has pressured the Romanian government to allow Georgescu&apos;s candidacy to proceed, despite intelligence pointing to Russian interference. If elected president, Georgescu has vowed to ban Ukrainian grain exports through Romania and halt military aid to Kyiv. The ongoing criminal case could prevent him from running in Romania&apos;s rescheduled presidential election, set for May 4.	https://kyivindependent.com/weapons-cash-seized-as-romania-targets-far-right-leader-georgescus-network-reuters-reports/	2025-02-28T08:05:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2186353250.jpg
How Ukrainians fund their own fight against Russia	While Ukraine heavily relies on foreign aid, the country&#x2019;s war effort is also funded by its own people. In 2024 alone, individual volunteers and fundraisers have raised nearly $1 billion to buy critical weapons and equipment for the Ukrainian military. But why do ordinary Ukrainians continue donating when international aid exists? And how has Ukraine&#x2019;s unique culture of giving become a lifeline for the country&#x2019;s survival?	https://kyivindependent.com/how-ukrainians-fund-their-own-fight-against-russia/	2025-02-28T07:29:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/telegram-cloud-document-2-5336824738788437908--1-.jpg
Orban opposes Ukraine's EU accession, claiming it would 'destroy' Hungary	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban reiterated his opposition to Ukraine&apos;s accession to the European Union on Feb. 28, warning that it would &quot;destroy&quot; Hungary, the country&apos;s public broadcaster Hirado reported. &quot;It will destroy us. First of all, it will destroy Hungarian farmers and Hungarian agriculture; secondly, it will destroy the entire Hungarian national economy, and I have no idea how we will control the crime that will flood into Hungary with this,&quot; Orban said. While he acknowledged that circumstances could change in the future, Orban insisted that Ukraine&apos;s accession was &quot;unthinkable&quot; under current conditions. Orban, widely seen as the EU&apos;s most pro-Russian leader, has repeatedly opposed military aid for Ukraine, arguing that Western support prolongs the war. He has maintained close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting him despite the full-scale invasion and amplifying Kremlin narratives in Europe. Hungary has used its veto power to stall key EU decisions on Ukraine, including military aid and accession talks. Budapest has also demanded the removal of eight individuals from the EU&apos;s Russia sanctions list and fresh guarantees on Ukraine&apos;s gas transit negotiations before agreeing to renew the restrictions, Reuters reported on Feb. 25. In previous negotiations, Hungary secured exemptions for Moscow Patriarch Kirill and the domestic use of Russian oil products. Kirill, a close ally of the Kremlin, has publicly endorsed Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, yet Budapest has blocked EU efforts to sanction him. Ukraine applied for EU membership in 2022 and achieved candidate status within months. Accession talks formally began in June 2024, with European leaders setting a 2030 target for Ukraine&apos;s potential entry. Unanimity among EU members is required for further progress, giving Hungary leverage to delay or block the process.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-eu-accession-would-destroy-hungary-orban-says-vows-opposition/	2025-02-28T07:18:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1697749423.jpg
Russia interested in lifting US sanctions against oligarchs, energy exports, Zelensky's adviser says	Lifting sanctions was one of Moscow&apos;s priorities during U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia earlier this month, Vladyslav Vlasiuk, the Ukrainian president&#x2019;s commissioner for sanctions, told journalists on Feb. 28. &quot;Our understanding is that they are most concerned about two things. The first thing is those oligarchs who are under U.S., EU and U.K. sanctions, because this is a real problem for them. And the second thing is what prevents Russia from making money &#x2014; energy (sanctions),&quot; he said. After the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on a number of oligarchs linked to the Kremlin. The Biden administration said that such a move would allow the seizure of yachts, money and other assets belonging to Russian oligarchs in U.S. jurisdiction. In early February, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that the U.S. Justice Department is shutting down a program that sanctioned Kremlin-linked oligarchs, launched in 2022. The Biden-era task force seized assets worth about $700 million as of February 2024. At the technical level, Kyiv continues to cooperate with Washington on further sanctions against Russia. Vlasiuk said that the U.S. has a &quot;good appetite&quot; for continuing work on sanctions against Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; a group of aging tankers routinely used for sanction evasion, as well as &quot;everything related to critical components.&quot; The European Union, the U.K., and the U.S. have slapped sanctions on oil-carrying vessels of Russia&apos;s so-called shadow fleet. Ukraine imposed sanctions on Russian &quot;shadow fleet&quot; captains, targeting Russian citizens and one Iranian national engaged in illicit oil exports through ship-to-ship transfers and other methods to bypass price caps. Drones and missiles used by Russia in its daily attacks on Ukraine contain tens of thousands of Western components, according to Ukrainian officials. Moscow continues to avoid sanctions through the use of sanctions evasion networks and shell companies and is also aided in sanctions evasion through its allies, including China, Iran, and North Korea. Washington is less eager for new individual and financial sanctions against Russia, Vlasiuk said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russi-most-interested-in-lifting-us-sanctions-on-oligarchs-energy-sources-zelenskys-adviser-says/	2025-02-28T07:12:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2037956454.jpg
Washington approves new Russian ambassador to US, Russian Foreign Ministry says	Russia has received U.S. approval to appoint Alexander Darchiev as its new ambassador to Washington, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced on Feb. 28. Darchiev&apos;s departure for his post in Washington is expected soon, the ministry said. Darchiev, a veteran diplomat with a half-decade of experience in Washington, previously served as Russia&apos;s ambassador to Canada from 2014 to 2021 and later as the director of the North American Department at the Russian Foreign Ministry. The approval comes amid renewed diplomatic engagement between the U.S. and Russia. A Russian delegation arrived at the U.S. Consul General&#x2019;s residence in Istanbul on Feb. 27 for a second round of talks, following an initial meeting in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. While the first meeting reportedly focused on Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine, the second round did not include discussions on the war, a U.S. State Department spokesperson confirmed. According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the Istanbul discussions centered on embassy operations. The previous Russian ambassador to the U.S., Anatoly Antonov, was dismissed from his post on Oct. 10, 2024. Under the U.S. President Joe Biden administration, the U.S. had largely severed official diplomatic contacts with Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s return to office has shifted U.S. foreign policy. His administration engages more directly with Moscow while adopting a more critical stance toward Ukraine and its allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-approves-russias-new-ambassador-to-washington-as-talks-resume/	2025-02-28T06:52:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1813426206.jpg
Russia proposes resuming direct flights with US during talks in Turkey, Reuters reports	Russia has suggested resuming direct air travel with the United States during diplomatic talks in Istanbul, Reuters reported, citing the Russian Foreign Ministry. Direct flights between the two countries were suspended in 2022 due to Western sanctions over Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Russian Foreign Ministry has not disclosed the U.S. response to the proposal, but Reuters noted that the shares of Russia&apos;s largest airline, Aeroflot, rose 3.8% following the news. The Istanbul meeting between top U.S. and Russian officials lasted six hours and followed a phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 12, as well as a high-level meeting in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. Both countries claim they are seeking to end the Russian-Ukrainian war and explore major business opportunities, but they are first focusing on reestablishing basic diplomatic ties, Reuters wrote. &quot;The need for practical results aimed at creating conditions for improving bilateral relations in the interests of the peoples of our countries was particularly emphasized,&quot; the Russian Foreign Ministry said in its statement. According to the ministry, both sides agreed on steps to ensure the uninterrupted funding of embassies and allow diplomats to work normally after years of expulsions and retaliatory disputes. Russia also raised the issue of reclaiming six embassy properties in the United States that were confiscated between 2016 and 2018. The U.S. State Department&#x2019;s statement on Feb. 27 did not mention any discussion of air travel. Washington said the two sides had identified specific initial steps to &quot;stabilize&quot; the operations of diplomatic missions, including discussions on embassy staffing, visas, and diplomatic banking services with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-proposes-resuming-us-air-links-during-talks-in-turkey-reuters-reports/	2025-02-28T06:44:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-172750694--1-.jpeg
Klitschko announces dismissals of top Kyiv administration officials over corruption accusations	Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko announced on Feb. 28 that Petro Olenych, the deputy head of the Kyiv City Administration, and several other officials embroiled in a corruption probe would be dismissed. A day earlier, Ukraine&apos;s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&apos;s Office (SAPO) released recordings of conversations of Kyiv officials taken as part of a sting operation aimed at exposing functionaries involved in corruption in the city&apos;s land and budget sectors. Yurii Leonov, deputy director of the city&apos;s special housing fund, and Oleksii Mushta, deputy head of an urban infrastructure management agency, will also be dismissed. Kyiv City Council member and head of the land commission Mykhailo Terentiiev is also to resign, according to Klitschko&apos;s statement. &quot;There will be a reorganization in urban planning and land relations. And not only in these areas. As for the high-profile &apos;land case,&apos; the city provides law enforcement with all requested documents and facilitates the investigation,&quot; Klitschko said. The suspects reportedly found suitable land plots and registered ownership of buildings that never existed there in the name of controlled entities, according to the investigation. Subsequently, the applications for ownership for the maintenance of these structures were submitted to the city council, which allegedly helped them avoid a fair tender. On Feb. 7, the High Anti-Corruption Court imposed pre-trial restraints on the Kyiv officials suspected in the case. The court remanded Olenych in custody for two months, until April 6, with the possibility of posting Hr 15 million (nearly $360,000) bail. Olenych was released from the pre-trial detention center on bail on Feb. 21. Olenych said that his family had borrowed the money for bail and that he would file a motion for suspension from office during the investigation. On Feb. 10, NABU said the alleged head of the corruption scheme, former Kyiv City Council member Denys Komarnytskyi, was put on the wanted list in Ukraine. Ten people were charged in the case, seven of whom have been detained.	https://kyivindependent.com/klitschko-announces-several-dismissals-in-kyiv-city-administration-due-to-corruption-accusations/	2025-02-28T06:13:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1886723516.jpg
North Korea tests strategic cruise missiles as Kim orders nuclear readiness, state media reports	North Korea carried out a test launch of strategic cruise missiles to showcase its nuclear deterrence capabilities, the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Feb. 28. According to the KCNA, the missile exercise was conducted &quot;to inform the enemies seriously violating&quot; North Korea&apos;s security environment &quot;of the Korean People&apos;s Army counterattack capability in any space and the readiness of its various nuclear operation means.&quot; The test came as South Korea prepares for the &quot;Freedom Shield&quot; exercises with the U.S. in March. North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, who oversaw the launch, ordered the country&apos;s military to be in full nuclear strike readiness, calling it &quot;the most perfect deterrence.&quot; The strike was reportedly carried out on Feb. 26 west of the Korean peninsula, with the missile flying a trajectory of 1,587 kilometers (986 miles) for 133 minutes before hitting the targets. Tensions on the Korean peninsula are mounting amid North Korea&apos;s series of missile tests intended as a warning to its South Korean neighbors and the U.S. Kim has reportedly received technological assistance for his missile and nuclear programs from Russia in exchange for arms and soldiers provided for Moscow&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces, reportedly suffering significant losses. South Korea&apos;s military believes that Pyongyang could dispatch more than 1,000 additional troops to Russia this year.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-tests-missile-to-showcase-nuclear-readiness/	2025-02-28T05:24:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2152788663.jpg
