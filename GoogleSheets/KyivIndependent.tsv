Over 3,000 North Korean troops killed, wounded in Kursk Oblast, Zelensky says	The number of killed and injured North Korean soldiers fighting alongside Russian forces in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast has surpassed 3,000, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement shared on Telegram on Dec. 23. Russia has reportedly deployed about 12,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in Kursk Oblast since early August. Zelensky warned of the global risks posed by deepening military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang, including the transfer of modern warfare experience and advanced military technology. &#xA0; &#x201C;There are risks of North Korea sending additional soldiers and military equipment to the Russian army, and we will have tangible responses to this,&#x201D; Zelensky said. He added that increased collaboration between Russia and North Korea threatens to destabilize the Korean Peninsula and nearby regions. &#xA0; Zelensky&apos;s estimation, that he said comes from Ukraine&apos;s intelligence, is a significant increase from other recent reports about the North Korean casualties. South Korean MP Lee Sung-kwon told reporters on Dec. 19 that at least 100 North Korean troops have been killed and 1,000 injured, with casualties linked to their lack of experience with terrain and modern drone warfare. Reports of North Korean troops fighting in Kursk Oblast emerged earlier in November, but Russia reportedly started using them in ground assaults in December. Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder confirmed on Dec. 16 that North Korean soldiers had sustained their first casualties during combat in the region. &#xA0; Ukrainian officials note that while North Korean forces are particularly vulnerable to drones, their presence has enabled Russian troops to make limited territorial gains in the oblast, retaking some of the land held by Ukrainian troops. &#xA0; The deployment of North Korean forces follows Ukraine&#x2019;s surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August, marking an escalation of the war into Russian territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-3-000-north-korean-troops-killed-wounded-in-kursk-oblast-zelensky-says/	2024-12-23T08:40:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1125139920.jpg
Assassinations of pro-war figures seek to demoralize Russia, punish war criminals	The Dec. 17 killing of Russian Lieutenant-General Igor Kirillov in Moscow &#x2014; reportedly by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) &#x2014; is the most high-profile assassination of a Russian military official to date. It&apos;s not the first one, however. Military officials, propagandists, and those seen as collaborators by Kyiv have been assassinated in Russia or the Ukrainian territories it occupies since the beginning of Russia&apos;s all-out war in 2022. Analysts say that such assassinations aim to bring war to Russian territory, undermine the enemy&apos;s morale, and divert Russian troops and security personnel from the front line. Another goal is to punish those accused of committing war crimes in Ukraine since it&apos;s impossible to use courts to bring them to justice, they add. In this screengrab from an AFPTV footage, Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defense Forces, speaks at a briefing over an alleged chemical attack on the Syrian city of Douma, at the Patriot park in the Moscow Oblast, Russia on June 22, 2018. (AFPTV / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;These assassinations, particularly just a few kilometers away from the Kremlin, are a humiliation for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin as they demonstrate a failure of Russia&apos;s security agencies and that no one in the regime, civil or military, is safe,&quot; Jamie Shea, a defense and security analyst at Chatham House, told the Kyiv Independent. James Nixey, director of the Russia and Eurasia program at Chatham House, told the Kyiv Independent that such assassinations &quot;put the element of doubt into Russian generals&quot; as &quot;they are not safe either on the front line or in Moscow suburbs.&quot; The Ukrainian authorities have not officially admitted their participation in the assassinations. The SBU did not respond to a request for comment, while Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) declined to comment. Most experts who talked to the Kyiv Independent believe Ukraine is indeed behind most of the assassinations of Russian military officials, propagandists, and those seen as collaborators by Kyiv. &quot;The fact that (Ukrainian) intelligence services can carry out such operations in Moscow severely undermines (Russia&apos;s) morale and combat readiness. Every such operation is a failure of their security architecture,&quot; Ukrainian military analyst Dmytro Zhmailo told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It means they will keep more forces within Russia and move fewer troops to the occupied territories... It forces them to spend more money on security and take more actions &#x2014; strengthening protocols, spending more money, moving more troops.&quot; Erik Stijnman, a military expert at the Netherlands Institute of International Relations (Clingendael), said that &quot;senior officials will increasingly feel that they also are not safe from the effects of the war.&quot; &quot;This can have a strong psychological effect on senior Russian leadership and alternatively give a morale boost to Ukrainian citizens,&quot; Stijnman told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;If this happens regularly, this may have an effect on the perceived effectiveness of the counterintelligence apparatus of the Russians. This may prove to be undesirable for the Kremlin, as it fears that opposition, in general, may rise when it is clear that the Russian intelligence community is also not omniscient.&quot; Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, said that such assassinations &quot;are predominantly aimed at attacking aspects of the Russian military system while increasing the psychological pressure on Russia by bringing the war home to Russians.&quot; &quot;Organizations like the SBU and HUR want to demonstrate their reach and capabilities and divert Russian intelligence efforts into intensive counterintelligence operations on home soil,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. Another goal is &quot;justice &#x2014; showcasing that committing war crimes will have repercussions,&quot; Stijnman said. &quot;Those targeted by Ukraine&apos;s SBU are often war criminals who have been indicted by Ukraine&apos;s justice system and by other countries,&quot; Shea said. &quot;This was the case with General Kirillov, for instance. These people, protected by Moscow, are unlikely to appear before the International Criminal Court in The Hague. So their killing is a form of justice, and very few will mourn their deaths.&quot; Kirillov was the head of the Russian Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defense Forces. On Dec. 16, Kirillov was charged in absentia by the SBU for the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine. But Kirillov is not the first suspected war criminal to be targeted. In July 2023, Stanislav Rzhytskyi, a Russian Navy officer allegedly responsible for missile strikes against Ukrainian civilians, was shot dead in Krasnodar, Russia. Ukrainian media reported that Rzhytskyi commanded the Krasnodar submarine, which launched Kalibr missiles against Vinnytsia on July 14, 2022, killing 27 civilians, including three children. Another similar assassination took place in November 2024, when Russian Navy officer Valery Trankovsky was killed in occupied Sevastopol. Russian Captain Valery Trankovsky. (SBU source) Trankovsky was the chief of staff of the 41st Missile Boat Brigade and a &quot;war criminal who has ordered cruise missile launches from the Black Sea against civilian sites in Ukraine,&quot; an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. He was also reportedly involved in the 2022 attack on Vinnytsia. Yet another alleged war criminal, Sergei Yevsiukov, was killed in a car explosion in Russian-occupied Donetsk on Dec. 9, 2024. Yevsiukov is a former head of Russia&apos;s Olenivka prisoner of war (POW) camp in the occupied part of Donetsk Oblast. The Olenivka camp, notorious for the torture and abuse of Ukrainian captives, was hit by an explosion in June 2022, killing over 50 Ukrainian POWs and injuring more than 150. Kyiv called this a deliberate Russian war crime. The effectiveness of assassinations for Ukraine&apos;s war effort is difficult to determine, analysts say. &quot;The question of their effectiveness is harder to discern: while we can expect there to be nervousness in parts of the Russian system as to the extent to which the Ukrainians are able to identify and surveil targets, even in Moscow, and then successfully launch attacks, it isn&apos;t clear if they are impeding the Russian war effort,&quot; Savill said. &quot;For example, the Ukrainians have publicly identified personnel they believe are involved in the long-range missile strikes, and last year assassinated a Russian navy officer involved. But these strikes have continued, mostly constrained by production problems rather than anything else.&quot; Shea said that &quot;an assassination even of an important military figure like Kirillov will not change the course of the war.&quot; &quot;Russia has hundreds of generals, as Putin has reminded us since his invasion of Ukraine by firing so many of them for corruption and incompetence,&quot; he added. &quot;But the targeted assassinations can disrupt Russia&apos;s war plans and command and control system even if only temporarily, and they can cause many Russians to question what Putin is doing in Ukraine and his failure to guarantee the safety of Russians, as he has always pledged to do. They also help to boost Ukrainian morale at a difficult time on the battlefield in the Donbas.&quot; Stijnman also argued that &quot;(assassinations) will most likely remain a supportive effect within the frame of the war, as the primary reason for this specific operations will instill a sense of justice to Ukraine, but will not directly contribute to the war effort.&quot; There is a consensus among experts that Kirillov and other Russian military officials are legitimate targets for Ukraine&apos;s special services. &quot;Kirillov was a legitimate military target, considering the activities he led and oversaw in his official capacity within the Russian military chain of command,&quot; Karolina Hird, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;As head of the Russian Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defense Forces, Kirillov was personally responsible and oversaw the use of banned chemical weapons against Ukraine.&quot; Savill also argued that &quot;where these targets are part of the Russian military system or industrial production, they are legitimate targets,&quot; and &quot;Kirillov clearly falls into that category.&quot; Stijnman said that &quot;the operation (against Kirillov) seems to have been conducted within the constraints of international humanitarian law, as the attack was discriminatory: the use of a camera to time the attack, thus avoiding collateral damage, indicates as much.&quot; &quot;It seems that the Ukrainian government understands that there is a limit to what actions will be deemed acceptable to the West in order to avoid a decrease in the support for the Ukrainian war effort,&quot; Stijnman added. Shea said that &quot;this practice is more justified, and justifiable, in wartime and in circumstances where the normal course of justice, trials for war crimes and massive human rights abuses, is unlikely to function because of the total non-cooperation and non-compliance of the country responsible, in this case, Russia.&quot; &quot;Russia attacked Ukraine, and Ukraine did nothing to provoke Moscow&apos;s aggression,&quot; he added. &quot;So Kyiv is entitled to justify its targeted assassinations as legitimate self-defense.&quot; Shea said that it&apos;s &quot;noteworthy that Ukraine&apos;s targeted assassinations have not provoked criticism from Ukraine&apos;s principal supporters and providers of military assistance.&quot; &quot;It is accepted that, as long as the individuals targeted are directly involved in Russia&apos;s illegal aggression, this is one way that Ukraine can strike back at an aggressor who has committed thousands of war crimes against Ukraine, especially drone and missile attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure,&quot; he added. However, there is a discussion on whether some other pro-war individuals, such as Russian collaborators and propagandists, constitute legitimate targets. Collaborators have often been targeted since the invasion started. In August 2022, Oleksiy Kovalyov, a former MP from President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s party who joined the Russian occupation authorities in his native Kherson Oblast, was shot dead in then-occupied Kherson. Kirill Stremousov, a deputy head of Russia&apos;s illegal occupation government in Kherson Oblast, died in a car accident in November 2022. Atesh, a Ukrainian partisan group, claimed responsibility for his death. In December 2023, Illia Kyva, a notorious Ukrainian lawmaker who sided with Russia, was killed in Moscow Oblast. Then lawmaker Illia Kyva, member of the now banned pro-Russian party Opposition Platform - For Life, speaks during a rally in Kyiv on Feb. 3, 2021. (Aleksandr Gusev/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Russian propagandists were also targeted. Russian pro-war propagandist Darya Dugina was killed in a car bombing near Moscow in August 2022. Dugina&apos;s father, the Russian ultranationalist Alexander Dugin, is currently wanted by the SBU for promoting genocide against Ukraine. The Washington Post reported, citing its sources, that Dugina&apos;s assassination was conducted by the SBU, but her father was the intended target of the attack.

(Evgenii Bugubaev/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Another propagandist, war correspondent Vladlen Tatarsky, was killed in an explosion in a cafe in central St. Petersburg in April 2023. The blast injured 25 other people. Savill said that &quot;some previous operations have been more dubious in targeting and execution (than Kirillov&apos;s assassination).&quot; &quot;For example, it is harder to make a case that Darya Dugina or Vladen Tatarsky were military targets, and in the case of the latter, he was killed by a bomb in a caf&#xE9; full of civilians, allegedly delivered by an unwitting courier,&quot; he added. Zhmailo disagreed, saying that &quot;anyone even remotely connected to the war is a legitimate target.&quot; &quot;The people (that Ukraine) has (allegedly) targeted have all been implicated in Russia&apos;s illegal war effort, either as military commanders (using illegal tactics such as chemical weapons or the massacres of civilians in violation of the Geneva Conventions), involved in the illegal occupation of sovereign Ukrainian territory, or acting as propagandists for the regime in spreading lies and misinformation,&quot; Shea said. &quot;So they can be classified as enemy combatants.&quot; However, such operations could jeopardize Western support in the future, according to Stijnman. &quot;The more Ukraine will struggle on the battlefield, the more Ukraine may feel the need to continue to counter the Russian threat via such (methods) but ever more via unconventional means,&quot; he said. &quot;The danger is, of course, that the size and scope of these efforts will increasingly create friction with international humanitarian law, possibly degrading Western support... Ukraine will need to walk a tightrope here.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/assassinations-of-pro-war-actors-seek-to-demoralize-russia-punish-war-criminals/	2024-12-23T08:34:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189847816.jpg
First Ukrainian Legion unit trained in Poland deployed to Ukraine, ambassador says	The first unit of the Ukrainian Legion, a volunteer brigade being formed and trained in Poland, has departed for Ukraine, Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to Poland Vasyl Bodnar said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on Dec. 23. Bodnar didn&apos;t clarify how many troops were sent. The initiative aims to bolster Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces by recruiting Ukrainian men living in Poland and other EU countries. The training of the first legionnaires will continue at Ukrainian military grounds, according to Bodnar. The next group of volunteers is scheduled to sign contracts with Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces on Jan. 10 and begin training in Poland. The ambassador described the project as a &quot;success story&quot; despite challenges and criticism from Russian propaganda. &#x201C;Our citizens who join it will have the satisfaction of good training,&#x201D; he said, emphasizing the unit&#x2019;s voluntary nature. Since its unveiling in July, the Ukrainian Legion has attracted over 1,000 applicants. The first recruitment center opened in October at the Ukrainian consulate in Lublin, Poland. The unit is trained by the Polish Armed Forces as part of a joint effort between Kyiv and Warsaw to address Ukraine&apos;s manpower shortages. Ukraine recently reformed its domestic mobilization policies and is in talks with foreign partners to facilitate the return of thousands of draft-eligible citizens who fled abroad. The formation of the Ukrainian Legion reflects Kyiv&apos;s broader efforts to replenish its military ranks as the war is in its third year.	https://kyivindependent.com/first-ukrainian-legion-unit-trained-in-poland-deployed-to-ukraine-ambassador-says/	2024-12-23T07:57:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1621128972.jpg
47% of Ukrainians back NATO accession even while territories stay occupied, survey shows	Nearly half of Ukrainians, 47%, support Ukraine joining NATO even if some of its territories remain under Russian occupation at the time of accession, according to a survey by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation and the Razumkov Center, published on Dec. 22. In case of such an accession, the alliance&#x2019;s umbrella of protection may be extended to occupied territories only after liberation. This represents a 14-percentage-point increase from a similar poll in June 2023. The poll comes as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s hesitance to sustain long-term support for Ukraine adds urgency to defining Ukraine&apos;s post-war security architecture. The poll was conducted face-to-face among 1,518 respondents in Ukraine-controlled areas. It also found that 36% opposed NATO accession under such conditions, down 16 percentage points since June 2023. The strongest opposition to the idea of such limited accession to NATO came from respondents over 50, those from eastern, central, and southern oblasts, and individuals living below the poverty line or without ties to occupied territories. The findings come as Ukraine faces limited battlefield success and growing discussions on security arrangements. While 55% of respondents view NATO membership as Ukraine&apos;s best security option, 60% believe it is the only way to prevent future Russian aggression. Other options, such as neutrality with international guarantees, garnered only 12% support, while non-alignment was favored by just 3%. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 1 that NATO&#x2019;s Article 5 might not immediately apply to active conflict zones, signaling a shift in Kyiv&#x2019;s stance. Zelensky also recently acknowledged that liberating some occupied territories, such as Crimea, might require diplomatic solutions, not military ones. This pragmatic approach aligns with NATO pathways resembling West Germany&apos;s phased accession during the Cold War, an idea supported by 70.3% of Ukrainians in a Dec. 10 survey by the New Europe Center.	https://kyivindependent.com/47-of-ukrainians-back-nato-accession-despite-occupied-territories-survey-shows/	2024-12-23T07:31:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-486250819.jpg
Satellite imagery suggests North Korea to supply more arms to Russia, WSJ reports	North Korea appears to be preparing to supply more arms to Russia on top of some 20,000 containers it had already sent, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Dec. 23 based on its analysis of satellite images. It follows a statement by the South Korean military, which said earlier the same day that North Korea prepares to send more troops and weapons to aid Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. Seoul officials told WSJ that approximately 200 munitions factories in North Korea are running at full capacity to produce weapons, with Russia providing fuel and equipment to assist Pyongyang&apos;s arms production efforts. Satellite images analyzed by WSJ show that some of these factories are being expanded. In return for its arms and ammunition sent to Russia, North Korea might have received as much as $5.5 billion, an analyst told WSJ. By deepening military cooperation with Moscow, Pyongyang hopes to gain practical battlefield experience and the ability to modernize its weapons systems, said. North Korea has emerged as Russia&apos;s leading ally in the full-scale war against Ukraine, providing not only ballistic missiles and artillery ammunition but also soldiers. The two nations signed a defense treaty in June, requiring either state to render military aid to the other in the event of an attack. After reporting the first clashes with North Korean troops in the fall, Ukraine in December announced that Russia had begun using North Korean units in ground assaults in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. South Korean officials have reported that at least 100 North Korean soldiers have been killed while fighting for Russia against Ukraine. According to lawmaker Lee Sung-kwon, North Korean troops are suffering high casualty rates in part due to their inexperience with drone warfare. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia is attempting to hide information about North Korean casualties.	https://kyivindependent.com/satellite-imagery-suggests-north-korea-to-supply-more-arms-to-russia-wsj-reports/	2024-12-23T06:54:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2157649988.jpg
Germany provides Ukraine with 15 Leopard 1 tanks, 2 IRIS-T systems, 2 Patriot launchers	Berlin supplied Ukraine with 15 Leopard 1A5 tanks, one short-range and one medium-range IRIS-T air defense system with missiles, two Patriot air defense launchers, and other aid in its latest delivery, the German government said on Dec. 23. With these deliveries, Germany has delivered on its promise to supply Ukraine with two additional IRIS-T systems before the end of the year as the country braces for intensified Russian aerial strikes during winter. Germany has also handed over a self-propelled Panzerhaubitze 2000 howitzer, two Gepard anti-aircraft guns, 30 Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles (MRAP), seven Caracal air assault vehicles, and 12 Kinetic Defense Vehicles. The latest assistance also includes dozens of reconnaissance drones, including 30 Vector drones, 24 RQ-35 Heidrun drones, and 14 Hornet XR drones. Ukraine further received 52,000 rounds of 155 mm ammunition, shells for Leopard drones, radars, small arms, and other weapons, vehicles, and equipment. Initially criticized for its sluggish delivery of military aid to Ukraine following the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Berlin has become the second-largest provider of military equipment after the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-provides-leopard-tanks-iris-patriot-launchers/	2024-12-23T06:07:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169575198.jpg
Moldova prepares for harsh winter, as Russian-occupied part of country runs out of gas	Moldova enacted a state of emergency, as the country gears up for an energy crisis at the start of 2025 following the end of Ukraine&apos;s obligations to transport Russian gas through its territory. Moldova, and especially the country&apos;s breakaway region of Transnistria, will be hit the hardest following the end of the decades-long agreement. Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean said that the country has enough gas, bought on the international market, to keep the right bank of the Dniester (Nistru) River warm throughout the winter ahead. But, he added, some 360,000 citizens on the left bank of the river, in the Russia-controlled region of Transnistria, &quot;are still dependent on one source of import &#x2014; Gazprom.&quot; The leader of the Russian-controlled Transnistria declared a state of economic emergency on Dec. 6. Heaters, as well as basic goods like rice, grains, matches, salt and so on, have disappeared from shops, hoarded by the local population in anticipation of the crisis ahead. Following decades of relying on free Russian gas, the Moscow-controlled region will now need to pay market prices, lowered by energy bill relief schemes provided by the Moldovan government. Authorities in Chisinau and experts expect that Russia will eventually cover Transnistrian gas needs, however, ensuring transport via the Trans-Balkan pipeline, to keep the region afloat. They add that the rest of the country will most likely be cut off from future cheap Russian gas imports in order to stir dissatisfaction with rising prices ahead of the 2025 parliamentary elections. Transnistria, on the left bank, and the rest of Moldova, on the right bank, divided by the Dniester, are interdependent, as Moldova relies on cheap electricity produced by the Russian-owned MGRES, a company based in the town of Dnestrovsk, de facto controlled by Transnistria. The energy plant can switch to produce electricity with coal rather than gas but the transition may involve a 10 hour blackout, according to Transnistria&apos;s self-declared Economy Minister Serghei Obolonik. &quot;That is dangerous and many things could happen [during that window],&quot; said journalist Irina Tabaranu, who runs the media outlet Zona de Securitate, focused on Transnistria. Shorter blackouts may also affect both parts of the country in 2025, according to the government, as there haven&apos;t been any official announcements concerning the use of the Trans-Balkan pipeline yet. By cutting off Moldova from gas imports, Russia is giving up the leverage it had on the country, said former Energy Minister Victor Parlicov, who was dismissed from his post on Dec. 5. Moldovan pro-Kremlin forces, as well as some pro-European opposition voices, meanwhile, place the blame on the Chisinau government for this new energy crisis. Among the main faults cited was the lack of clarity about the country&apos;s future energy policy and little action to stock up while gas for the country was still cheap. As a result of the shortcomings, Parlicov, together with Victor B&#xEE;nzari, head of state energy provider Energocom, and Sergiu Tofilat, who served as a board member of the Gazprom subsidiary MoldovaGaz were dismissed in early December. Parlicov, B&#xEE;nzari, and Tofilat claim to be mere scapegoats. Vadim Ceban, the interim head of MoldovaGaz, who was involved in the gas acquisitions, is also to leave his job. Taking responsibility for Moldovan citizens in Transnistria and attempting to ensure cheap electricity for all of its population, Chisinau carried direct negotiations with Gazprom on behalf of the breakaway region, claiming an economic and political necessity. The step was unpopular with some parts of Moldovan society. Parlicov went to Saint Petersburg to negotiate with the Russian company&apos;s CEO, Alexey Miller, on Nov. 25, where they differed on a disputed debt unrecognized by a Chisinau-commissioned international audit. Moldovan Energy Minister Victor Parlicov poses for a photo during Istanbul Energy Forum, in Istanbul, Turkey on Nov. 22, 2024. (Hakan Akgun/Anadolu via Getty Images)&quot;It looks stupid to ask for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Transnistria and meanwhile request Russia to continue to give free gas to the region,&quot; Tabaranu from Zona de Securitate said. According to the journalist, this crisis could have been an opportunity to reintegrate the country. &quot;Why do we ask for help from international partners to subsidize our bills year on year rather than asking them to contribute to the reintegration of 11% of our country?&quot; she asks. &quot;Steps towards reintegration cannot be made at the moment due to the presence of Russian troops in Transnistria,&quot; Oleg Serebrian, deputy prime minister for reintegration, told Kyiv Independent, referring to the 2,500 soldiers stationed there. &quot;But we are closing the gap with people on the left bank (of the river) and showing them that Chisinau cares about citizens&quot; there. &quot;They feel the dependence on the Moldovan government.&quot; Meanwhile, Russia accused Chisinau that it coins a &#x201C;plan for a military operation&#x201D; in Transnistria. The Moldovan government rejected the accusations, saying it only relies on &#x201C;peaceful solutions&#x201D; in the reintegration of the country. Experts argue that the Russian disinformation campaign aims to distract from the energy crisis, sow further panic, as well as the grounds for possible provocations in the occupied region. The government in Chisinau is dealing with the looming energy crisis in the backdrop of the upcoming elections set for July. Prime Minister Recean, who has taken over the energy portfolio, said the authorities have reassured citizens they won&apos;t pay higher bills than last winter, although the needs-based subsidy mechanism has been changed from being calculated automatically to a cash-in-hand scheme, generating further distress. A recent sociological study by Zona de Securitate and the think tank Watchdog shows that there is more openness towards reintegration in Transnistria after the start of the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

(Peter Dench/Getty Images)According to the poll, 45% of people would vote for reintegration with Moldova, while 38% would vote against it, and 17% are undecided, would not answer, or would not vote. Furthermore, 25% of voters from the Russian-occupied left bank voted to entrench the country&apos;s path toward the EU into the constitution during the October referendum. Only 5% voted in favor of the EU in the southern autonomous region of Gagauzia, controlled by Chisinau but having a largely pro-Russian elite and population. It is clear that Moldova cannot rely on Russian gas for its electricity. &quot;We are paying the cost for 30 years of &apos;comfort&apos;,&quot; Serebrian said. According to the International Energy Agency, interconnections with Romania are particularly important for Moldova&apos;s energy security. Chisinau is currently able to import some electricity from Romania via the Vulcanesti-Isaccea electric line, as well as several smaller lines. Three further 400 kilovolt (kV) electric lines are due to be built by the end of 2025, 2026, and 2029. Green energy may provide some relief and independence. Moldova has tripled its solar capacity in the past year, according to the National Centre for Sustainable Energy. But &quot;every country could be doing more to deploy clean energy technologies,&quot; including Moldova, said Tim Gould from the International Energy Agency, &quot;especially since a growing number of these technologies are cost-competitive with fossil fuels and can bring important benefits for energy security.&quot; But market prices may be a lot higher than what Moldovans pay now. &quot;Independence has a cost,&quot; Serebrian said.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldova-prepares-for-harsh-winter-as-russian-occupied-part-of-country-runs-out-of-gas-2/	2024-12-23T05:59:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188612910-1.jpg
More than two-thirds of Ukrainians favor idea of restoring nuclear arms arsenal, poll shows	About 73% of Ukrainians supported the idea of Ukraine restoring its nuclear weapons, according to a poll published by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology on Dec. 23. The poll was conducted close to the 30th anniversary of the signing of the Budapest Memorandum, under which Ukraine gave up its Soviet-era nuclear arsenal in exchange for international security guarantees. Around half of the respondents said they would support the development of nuclear weapons even at the price of losing Western aid and coming under sanctions. Despite discussions in the media, Kyiv affirmed its adherence to the nuclear non-proliferation policy and said it has no plans of building nuclear weapons, calling for NATO membership as the only viable security guarantee. The pollsters noted that in 1994 only one-third of Ukrainians supported the idea of their state retaining a nuclear arsenal. &quot;In the minds of Ukrainians, nuclear weapons are one of the options &apos;on the table,&apos;&quot; said Anton Hrushetskyi, the institute&apos;s executive director. &quot;We hope that our Western allies will demonstrate the necessary will and Ukraine will eventually receive effective security guarantees, without the need for Ukraine to consider other difficult solutions for itself, how to protect itself from Russia.&quot; The survey was carried out between Dec. 2 and 17 with 2,000 respondents living in Ukraine-controlled territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/73-percent-of-ukrainians-favor-restoring-nuclear-arms-arsenal-poll-shows/	2024-12-23T05:31:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1239393853.jpg
2025 – A Turning Point for Ukraine	Editor&apos;s note: This article is a special edition of the KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter, looking at challenges and opportunities facing Ukraine in 2025. 2025 is gearing up to be a decisive year for Ukraine. The country&#x2019;s leadership will need to navigate a turbulent international landscape, as well as political and military realities that will constrain its options. Here are 5 major trends to watch in the year to come that will shape expectations for the potential end of the Russia-Ukraine war, or move it to its next stage. The &#x201C;Trump 2&#x201D; Presidency: Instability and Isolationism? President-elect Donald Trump has made ending the Russia-Ukraine war a priority &#x2013; but on what terms? His inbound administration counts many Ukraine sceptics and even Russia sympathizers; he is antagonistic towards allies. Encouragingly, both Trump and his Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg seem interested in maintaining or even increasing military support for Ukraine (if only to boost U.S. defense production ahead of potential conflict with China). But the main source of tension is that, ultimately, the U.S. has far fewer ways to pressure Russia than it does Ukraine. Hence, making a deal happen is more likely to happen at the expense of additional Ukrainian concessions, not Russian ones. Providing security guarantees &#x2013; the key Ukrainian demand &#x2013; goes against the general theme of disengagement and isolationism that runs across much of the Trump support base. Although the U.S. is the only power that can provide the kind of guarantees Ukraine needs, a generally hostile approach to allies will make building a coalition of decisive actors more difficult. Kellogg is currently developing a &#x201C;Trump Victory Plan,&#x201D; replacing Zelensky&#x2019;s version (which has failed to find favor with the new U.S. administration). Both Ukraine and its allies will continue to lobby both Kellogg and Trump, including during the former&#x2019;s upcoming Europe trip. Importantly, Russia will likely also try to humor Trump, pretending to engage in diplomacy (possibly also lobbying for a global &#x201C;grand bargain&#x201D;). This would likely be aimed at buying time, tying up aid, and extracting demoralizing concessions. In the end, however, Russia will likely refuse to go forward with any deal that is not devastating to Ukraine and reduces Moscow&#x2019;s ability to re-escalate on its terms. What will Trump do then? Will he find a way to pressure Russia or, more likely, will he get bored, disengage, and blame former President Joe Biden and Zelensky for leaving &#x201C;a mess&#x201D;. Zelensky&#x2019;s growing domestic challenges A potential ceasefire would likely mean an end to martial law and hence elections. But even without a reduction in fighting both Russian propaganda and the incoming U.S. administration are talking about the legitimacy of Ukraine&#x2019;s leadership. This raises the likelihood that 2025 will see both parliamentary and presidential contests. Neither will be easy for Zelensky. Continued economic hardship, mobilization have weighed on the President&#x2019;s support. Opposition forces are mobilizing, mainly with one strategy &#x2013; attacking the incumbent&#x2019;s record. In the short term, this will make it harder for the Zelensky administration to make needed but unpopular decisions. The big question is whether ex-Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Valerii Zaluzhnyi will run. He has shown no inclination, but this may be a poor indicator &#x2013; if he were to run his best strategy is stay quiet and avoid public comments that could betray his lack of political experience. But this is not the only consideration. Zelensky&#x2019;s control of administrative resources and considerable influence over media (including the united TV broadcast and anonymous social media channels) make it tempting to manipulate the playing field (which could harm relations with allies). Additionally, Russia may require that Zelensky doesn&#x2019;t run as the basis of a peace deal (which would probably be counter-productive). Conversely, would he receive an endorsement from Trump? This raises the question of security guarantees for the President and his allies &#x2013; a factor that will impact their decisions and strategy regarding any elections. Finally, given Ukraine&#x2019;s history of revolutions, a third Maidan is a remote possibility &#x2013; most likely led by the military/ nationalist bloc. Neutralizing any such protests risks sparking a backlash and further unrest. Will Ukraine reach a military breaking point? The situation on the battlefield has grown more critical for Ukraine in 2024. The failure of mobilization to address key personnel shortages has left the country struggling to defend itself effectively. Furthermore, a change in the White House has meant that military aid is no longer a certainty, and Europe would struggle to fill this void. The most critical shortage concerns manpower, something that can be partially remedied by Kyiv, albeit at a significant political cost. The current system created a &#x201C;first instance&#x201D; loophole for desertions; lowering the mobilization age could further plug the gap (although it would require additional reform of the system, as the change from 27 to 25 failed to deliver needed results). While critical to avoiding a Ukrainian loss, Western aid has also been unhelpfully organized: new capabilities were often introduced late, at small scale, publicly and out of sync with battlefield needs. The result has more often served to vaccinate the Russian army against Western solutions than it has turned the tide of the war. As a result, changing the dynamics now requires a proportionally greater level of support than previously &#x2013; and likely more than Ukraine&#x2019;s allies are ready for. An alternative option is deploying European boots on the ground, something that is currently politically unpalatable but that may change in 2025. Despite these challenges, Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to withstand Russian aggression &#x2013; even relying solely on its own resources &#x2013; is likely underestimated. Moreover, Kyiv retains the ability to escalate, or threaten to escalate, in asymmetric ways (e.g., attacks against civilian infrastructure in Russia, invading Transnistria, support for Islamic movements in Africa and the Middle East) that will make Western policy-makers uncomfortable and hence unlikely to drop support. The key question is how long Ukraine can delay giving in. The looming Battle of Pokrovsk will likely serve as a litmus test &#x2013; should the loss be fast, say 2 to 3 months, Russia will likely see Ukraine&#x2019;s capabilities as fundamentally degraded and push for tough conditions. Conversely, holding out till summer (in line with incremental gains secured by Russia in 2023-2024), would likely underscore Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to resist until more favorable terms are met. The fragility of democracy: Hybrid war beyond Ukraine Europe surprised many in 2022 when it quickly condemned Russia and strongly supported Ukraine. But sustaining support in 2025 will be more challenging as higher costs of living, &#x201C;accommodating&#x201D; Ukrainian refugees and Russian influence operations will continue to eat away at public support. Ukraine has already witnessed electoral reversals among allies, notably in Slovakia, France, and the U.S. (and, for a moment, in Romania). However, so far, the actual impact on policy has been fairly muted. That may change in 2025, for two reasons. Firstly, the number of relevant elections is much higher &#x2013; Germany, Czechia, Romania, and Poland, among others, will all face key votes. Although more people went to the polls in 2024, this year may more directly impact Ukraine. Secondly, an even more unpredictable social media space increases the likelihood of chaotic outcomes. The case of Romania, where actual Russian interference may have been overstated (vs. actual domestic factors), could be repeated elsewhere &#x2013; and manipulated by Russia. This is hardly an environment in which Ukraine wants to build a coalition of support. Electoral challenges and hybrid operations may not be aimed so much at directly changing outcomes, but also at tying up the energies of key allies. Germany will face federal elections at a time when a clear European voice in negotiations is needed. France, arguably the key security state for Europe, seems engulfed in endless domestic challenges. Doubtless, Russian meddling will also try to slow down Ukraine&#x2019;s European Union accession and frustrate Kyiv (who, in turn, may use this as an excuse to skip the line on various &#x201C;bureaucratic issues&#x201D; that are core to the EU). Importantly, Russia&#x2019;s hybrid war against the West may eventually backfire. Although it has been highlighted by analysts for years, a mainstream response has been lacking. Could this change in 2025? Is this the year that Russia (finally) collapses? The idea of Russia eventually collapsing, or at least running out of munitions, has been around since 2022. More often than not, these analyses point to 2025-2026 as the moment that shortages (of tanks, manpower, shells/ barrels&#x2026; ) start to compound. One of the chief proponents of such a theory is Ukraine&#x2019;s head of Military Intelligence Kyrylo Budanov. He has previously stated expectations that Russia&#x2019;s economy would start to falter and that weapons stocks would begin to run dry over the coming year and a half. While Russia retains options to address its challenges &#x2013; securing men and arms from allies, increasing payments to new recruits&#x2026; &#x2013; these come at increasingly high trade-offs. In particular, record-high interest rates and labor shortages are constraining the Russian economy. The result of shortages is arguably already visible in Syria, where Russia was unable to prop up its ally. Despite surprising resilience, Russia is also suffering from Western sanctions and pressure on third countries that have acted as supply routes has had some impact. The pressure on Russia is undeniably real, but assessing how quickly this will take effect is highly speculative. The big question is who will blink first &#x2013; a Russian regime all-in on destroying Ukraine or Western allies held hostage by opinion polls?	https://kyivindependent.com/2025-a-turning-point-for-ukraine/	2024-12-23T05:24:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Year-ahead--1.png
Zelensky accuses Slovakia's Fico of helping Putin 'fund its war against Ukraine'	President Volodymyr Zelensky on Dec. 23 accused Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico of undermining Europe&apos;s efforts to become independent of Russian gas and helping Moscow to fund its war against Ukraine. Fico met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Dec. 22 to discuss gas supplies after Kyiv said it would not extend the deal on transiting Russian gas to Europe past Dec. 31. Following the visit, Zelensky lambasted Slovakia&apos;s prime minister in a long post on social media. He called Fico&apos;s Russia visit a &quot;big security issue&quot; for Slovakia and Europe, asking: &quot;Why is this leader so dependent on Moscow? What is being paid to him, and what does he pay with?&quot; &quot;It is worth noting that after their meeting in Moscow, Fico and Putin did not issue joint statements or respond to media questions,&quot; Zelensky said on X. &quot;They simply cannot say publicly anything about what they discussed in the meeting. They are afraid of the public&apos;s reaction.&quot; Under Fico&apos;s leadership, Slovakia took a sharp foreign policy turn, halting military supplies to Ukraine from the Slovak Armed Forces&apos; stocks and adopting more Russian-friendly rhetoric. The prime minister has repeatedly made controversial statements on Ukraine and the war that echo the Kremlin&apos;s talking points, gave an interview with Russian propagandist Olga Skabeyeva, and called for the normalization of relations with Russia. The Ukrainian president said that though Moscow provides significant energy discounts to Fico, such discounts are paid &quot;through sovereignty or murky schemes.&quot; Zelensky referred to a recent European meeting in Brussels at which Fico allegedly did not want to participate in a joint effort to find a replacement for Russian gas. According to Ukraine&apos;s head of state, Fico instead wanted to &quot;assist Russia in pushing American gas and energy resources of other partners away from Europe, implying that he wants to help Putin earn money to fund the war and weaken Europe.&quot; &quot;We are losing people as a result of the war that Putin started, and we believe that such assistance to Putin is immoral,&quot; Zelensky concluded. Zelensky also said that Fico refused compensation for the lost profit during the transition period and is &quot;interested specifically in the Russian gas&quot; worth $500 million per year, as well as profits from oil pipe that runs through Ukraine and &quot;gives another $500 million per year.&quot; Fico previously told the media that Zelensky offered him 500 million euros ($520 million) from frozen Russian assets if Bratislava supports Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership, an offer the Slovak prime minister said he rejected.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-criticizes-fico/	2024-12-23T04:59:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/fico.jpg
We don't have to grovel before a mass murderer' — Czechia blasts Fico over Moscow trip	The Czech government&#x2019;s decision to wean itself off from Russian energy ensured that &quot;we don&apos;t have to grovel before a mass murderer,&quot; Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said on Dec. 22, referring to Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico&#x2019;s visit to Moscow. &quot;It was the Czech government that secured independence from Russian energy supplies so that we don&apos;t have to grovel before a mass murderer,&quot; Lipavsky said on X. Fico held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin on Dec. 22, marking the third visit to Russia by an EU country leader since the start of the full-scale war in 2022. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer met Putin in April 2022, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban visited Moscow for talks with the Kremlin&apos;s chief in July 2024. The Slovak prime minister visited Russia&apos;s capital after Kyiv said it would not extend the deal that facilitated the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine to European countries like Slovakia. Both Fico and Orban have consistently criticized Western support for Kyiv and made statements that echoed pro-Russian talking points, while Hungary and Slovakia are ranked among the top European buyers of Russian fossil fuels. The visit comes as another hit to efforts by Ukraine and the West to isolate Putin on the international scene after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz held a call with the Russian leader, urging him to call off his invasion. Lithuania&#x2019;s President Gitanas Nauseda also condemned Fico&#x2019;s visit to the Kremlin. &#x201C;How cheap is your love? There are those who come to Russia with love and feel gassed to meet a war criminal,&quot; Nauseda wrote. &quot;This is not Lithuania&apos;s way. We choose energy independence and real market prices &#x2014; with no political strings attached.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/czechia-blasts-fico-over-moscow-trip/	2024-12-23T03:58:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2154883507.jpg
Russian cyberattack: Breach occurred at 'top-level account,' MP says	Hackers could have used phishing or bribed employees to breach Justice Ministry registers during a Russian cyberattack last week, Oleksandr Fedienko, head of the parliamentary subcommittee on cybersecurity, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Dec. 23. Phishing is a technique that enables hacking by prompting an employee of the targeted organization to click on a link or download a malicious file disguised as harmless, among others. Behind the scenes of the fierce battles on the front line, Russia and Ukraine are waging a cyberwar, targeting government institutions and strategically important businesses. Fedienko said that the recent cyberattack appeared well-organized, that the attackers had knowledge of the servers&apos; internal architecture, and that the breach occurred at a top-level account. The lawmaker added that the targeted databases had backups and the registers could, therefore, be restored &quot;in a week or two.&quot; First Deputy Justice Minister Mykola Kucheriavenko said on Dec. 22 that the Justice Ministry has faced &quot;serious challenges&quot; after the largest cyberattack in months targeted state registries. Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said the cyberattack on Dec. 19 targeted several government services, including state registers overseen by the Justice Ministry. Officials say the cyberattack had been prepared for months. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) suggested on Dec. 20 that Russia&apos;s military intelligence agency (GRU) could be behind the cyberattack on Ukraine&apos;s government services. Former Justice Minister Denys Maliuska told Ukrainian media outlet Ukrainska Pravda that most of the information Russia stole was &quot;already freely available,&quot; though closed registers were also affected.	https://kyivindependent.com/recent-russian-cyberattack-facilitated-by-top-level-account-mp-says/	2024-12-23T03:29:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/459251170_963204945845598_6558188935354545864_n.jpg
Ukraine receives $1.1 billion from IMF	Ukraine has received a $1.1 billion tranche from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and will direct them to critical budget expenditures, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Dec. 23. The funds come as already the sixth tranche disbursed to Ukraine under the IMF&apos;s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program, raising the amount provided so far to $9.8 billion. External financing, such as the $15.6 billion allocated to Ukraine under the EFF over four years, is crucial for Kyiv as its budget is increasingly strained by Russia&apos;s full-scale war. &quot;We are grateful to the International Monetary Fund for its unwavering support for our country during the full-scale war,&quot; Shmyhal said on Telegram. Kyiv received $42.5 billion in foreign aid last year, and the Finance Ministry has said that the amount needs to increase by at least $12 billion for 2025. &quot;Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine continues to take a devastating social and economic toll on Ukraine,&quot; IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a press statement. &quot;Despite the war, macroeconomic stability is being preserved through skillful policymaking by the Ukrainian authorities as well as substantial external support. ... The financial sector remains stable, but vigilance is needed given heightened risks.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-receives-1-billion-from-imf-2/	2024-12-23T02:43:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/imf.jpeg
Cargo vessel sent to transport Russian military equipment from Syria breaks down in open sea, Ukraine's intel claims	The cargo vessel Sparta sent to Syria to bring out Russian military equipment broke down in the open sea and now drifts near the shore of Portugal, Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR) claimed in a post on Dec. 23. Concurrently, marine traffic monitors show a Vladivostok-bound cargo ship, Ursa Major, previously registered as Sparta III and visually matching the picture published by HUR, moving at a very low speed of little over 1 knot in the open sea between Spain and Algeria. &quot;The cargo ship Sparta, which Russia sent to transport its weapons and equipment from Syria, broke down during movement. A fuel pipe of the main engine failed,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence claimed. &quot;The Russian crew is trying to fix the problem and (the ship) is drifting in the open sea near Portugal.&quot; Marine traffic monitors show the Ursa Major sailing under the Russian flag and previously making port calls in St. Petersburg. The Kyiv Independent could not verify whether the vessel was sent to Syria to transport Russian military equipment as HUR claims. Russia, the main backer of the recently ousted Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, began evacuating its military stationed in its bases in Syria. &#xA0;According to HUR, Russian military assets in Syria are now limited to two bases: the airbase in Khmeimim and the naval base in Tartus. In an earlier statement, the agency claimed that losing the Tartus and Khmeimim bases would significantly damage Russia&apos;s presence in the Middle East and solidify its defeat in the region. According to the agency, the victorious rebel leadership is negotiating with the Kremlin to close their remaining bases in the country no later than February 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/cargo-vessel-shipping-russian-equipment-from-syria-breaks-down-ukrainian-intelligence-claims/	2024-12-23T02:21:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/HUR-Sparta.jpg
NATO chief defends Scholz, calls Zelensky's criticism 'unfair'	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told President Volodymyr Zelensky that his sometimes &quot;harsh criticism&quot; of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is unfair, Rutte told the German news agency DPA in comments published on Dec. 23. In the interview, Rutte said that Scholz&apos;s contributions to Ukraine are commendable. The chancellor ensured that Germany ranks second after the U.S. in military support for Ukraine, something Kyiv should also be grateful for, Rutte noted. The NATO chief nevertheless voiced support for supplying Germany&apos;s Taurus long-range missiles to Ukraine without any restrictions on their use, a bone of contention between Kyiv and Berlin. Calls for Germany to supply Ukraine with Taurus missiles were renewed once the U.S. authorized Ukraine to use its ATACMS long-range missiles against targets in Russia in November. Scholz, who is adamant about not providing Taurus to Ukraine, also recently made headlines by calling Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time after over two years, leading to criticism from Kyiv. &quot;In Europe, it may happen that after one call, there may be a second, third, fourth, fifth... Because sometimes leaders want to (wrestle for) leadership. After that, there may be a wave of actual recognition of Putin,&quot; Zelensky said at the time. &quot;I believe that this does not strengthen Ukraine.&quot; Germany, Ukraine&apos;s main European backer, is currently facing internal turmoil after Scholz lost a confidence vote in the Bundestag on Dec. 16. This paved the way for early parliamentary elections scheduled for Feb. 23. Scholz&#x2019;s opponent, center-right CDU/CSU chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz, has expressed openness to the delivery of Taurus missiles. In the interview, Rutte also said he expects U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to pressure its allies and NATO countries to increase their defense spending. NATO allies reportedly plan to agree on an increase in their defense spending target from 2% to 3% of their gross domestic product (GDP) before their leaders convene for a summit in June 2025. Taking office in January 2025, Trump had hinted at plans to reduce aid for Ukraine and incentivize European countries to pay more for their protection. The Financial Times recently reported that while the incoming U.S. president told European partners he would not abandon Ukraine, he also called for raising the defense spending benchmark to 5% of GDP. Some European NATO countries have yet to reach 2%, while Poland, the biggest spender, is expected to invest 4.7% of its GDP in defense in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-chief-defends-scholz-calls-zelenskys-criticism-unfair/	2024-12-23T01:49:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2157094594.jpg
Moscow begins providing energy aid to Georgia's Russian-occupied Abkhazia region	Russia has begun providing electricity aid to Georgia&apos;s Russian-held Abkhazia region amid a major energy crisis, local authorities told the Russian TASS news agency on Dec. 23. The press service of the Abkhaz energy company Chernomorenergo reported that a schedule from Nov. 1, under which electricity will be unavailable for four hours per day, is in effect. The region has previously faced energy shutdowns for nine-to-11 hours per day, prompting its acting head, Badra Gunba, to appeal to Russia for support on Dec. 21. The crisis was aggravated by a spat between Abkhazia and Moscow that broke out after the local council voted against a controversial investment agreement with Russia following popular protests. Soon after, Russia cut almost all funding to Abkhazia, including money crucial for the region&apos;s energy sector. The region lost all electricity for a day on Dec. 11 after the Enguri hydroelectric power station shut down due to a low water level in a nearby reservoir. Russia has occupied Abkhazia and South Ossetia after a war with Tbilisi in 2008, backing local breakaway leadership. Both regions are internationally recognized as Georgia&apos;s sovereign soil.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-begins-providing-energy-aid-to-georgias-occupied-abkhazia-region/	2024-12-23T01:09:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2173673388.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 3, injure 3 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed at least three civilians and injured at least three others over the past day, regional authorities reported on Dec. 23. The Russian military attacked Ukraine with 72 Shahed-type drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles overnight on Dec. 23, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported on Telegram. Ukrainian air defense shot down 47 drones over nine oblasts while 25 drones were lost in the airspace, the Air Force said. A 56-year-old man was injured in a drone attack on Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported on this Telegram channel. The victim was in a serious condition. Three people were killed, and one was injured after the Russian military attacked 28 cities and villages in Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on his Telegram channel. A gas pipe, shops, and cars were also damaged. One person was injured in Khmelnytskyi Oblast following an attack by Shahed drones, regional authorities reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-4/	2024-12-23T00:40:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1489471985--1-.jpg
Australian citizen fighting for Ukraine allegedly captured by Russia	The Australian government is investigating reports that Russian forces captured an Australian citizen fighting for Ukraine, the Sydney Morning Herald reported on Dec. 23. The man, who identifies himself as 32-year-old Australian Oscar Jenkins, is seen in military fatigues being violently interrogated in a video shared on Russian Telegram channels. The interrogator behind the camera is seen hitting the captive over the head while questioning him in Russian about his identity. The footage was first shared by Russian military correspondent Alexander Sladkov on Dec. 22. &quot;I&#x2019;m Australian... Oscar Jenkins, 32 years old. Live in Australia and Ukraine,&quot; Jenkins responded in English with a native accent and in broken Ukrainian. The man introduces himself as a biology teacher who wanted to help Ukraine and is now based near Kramatorsk, a Ukrainian city in Donetsk Oblast, around 700 kilometers (430 miles) east of Kyiv and 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of the front line. The Sydney Morning Herald confirmed Jenkins&apos; identity as a Melbourne man who studied biology and lived in China since 2015. Australian officials said they are working to confirm Jenkins&apos;s whereabouts and contacting Russian authorities. &quot;We urge the Russian Government to fully adhere to its obligations under international humanitarian law, including with respect to prisoners of war,&quot; Australia&apos;s acting Foreign Minister and Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said. &quot;Our immediate priority is understanding where Mr Jenkins is and confirming his wellbeing.&quot; Australia&apos;s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that the Australian embassy in Moscow is trying to obtain all the details regarding Jenkins but warned that &quot;we know that the Russians often put out information that isn&#x2019;t right.&quot; Russia is believed to focus on capturing foreign volunteers fighting for Ukraine, who it presents as &quot;mercenaries&quot; without a right for protection, for potential prisoner swaps. Citizens from dozens of countries have come to Ukraine to help the country resist Russian aggression, mostly joining the International Legion. In November, Russian forces captured James Scott Rhys Anderson, a former British soldier fighting for Ukraine in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/australian-citizen-fighting-for-ukraine-allegedly-captured-by-russia/	2024-12-23T00:01:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1089926858--1-.jpg
Russia's threat to Europe 'much wider than we imagine,' Italian PM warns	Russia&#x2019;s threat to Europe extends beyond defense to illegal immigration and cybersecurity, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Dec. 22 during an international meeting in Finland. &quot;It&apos;s about our democracy, it&apos;s about influencing our public opinion, it&apos;s about what happens in Africa, it&apos;s about raw materials, it&apos;s about the instrumentalization of migration. We need to know it&apos;s a very wide idea of security,&quot; Meloni was quoted as saying by Reuters. Russia and Belarus have been orchestrating an influx of migrants since 2021, letting thousands of asylum seekers to the European Union&#x2019;s eastern borders with a pledge of safe entry into the EU. In November 2021, Belarusian troops escorted thousands of asylum seekers to the Polish border, cutting through the wire fence to allow refugees to cross. Most of them were violently pushed back by Polish border guards who set up a no-access zone at the border for nine months. Italy&apos;s right-wing prime minister urged the EU to view migration as a distributive problem as well as a security one. &quot;Security also means critical infrastructure, it means artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, raw materials, supply chains. It means a new and more effective foreign and cooperation policy, it means migration,&quot; Meloni said. Meloni cautioned against complacency in the EU, adding that even after Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine ends, its security challenge will not go away. &quot;We have to understand the threat is much wider than we imagine,&quot; Meloni said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-threat-to-europe-much-wider-than-we-imagine-italian-pm-warns/	2024-12-22T23:30:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189976147-1.jpg
Mysterious' fire engulfs Russian Shahed warehouse, Ukrainian intelligence claims	A &quot;devastating&quot; fire broke out at a Shahed drone warehouse at the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in Russia&apos;s Tatarstan, destroying drone parts worth $16 million, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said on Dec. 23. The Alabuga Special Economic Zone hosts the Yelabuga drone factory that produces Shahed-type drones for the Russian military, located more than 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border. According to HUR, the affected warehouse stored 65 drone attack fuselages, as well as engines, navigation systems, and thermal imaging cameras for the production of 400 Shahed-type drones. &quot;Everything burned down,&quot; the agency said without explicitly claiming responsibility for the &quot;mysterious, devastating fire.&quot; Ukrainian intelligence agencies have been previously linked to a number of assassinations and sabotage operations deep in the Russian rear during the full-scale war. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. &quot;HUR reminds that there will be fair retribution for every war crime committed against the Ukrainian people,&quot; the intelligence agency said in a statement. Local authorities did not report any fire or similar incident in the Alabuga zone overnight on Dec. 23. Drones struck Kazan, Tatarstan&apos;s regional center, on the morning of Dec. 21, damaging several buildings but reportedly inflicting no casualties. The Yelabuga drone factory was launched in July 2023, aiming to produce not only Russian equivalents of Iranian-made Shahed drones but also the Albatross reconnaissance drones. Russia regularly employs Shaheds and its domestic-made variants like Geran for strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Ukrainian long-range drones previously struck the Yelabuga facility in early April.	https://kyivindependent.com/fire-engulfs-russian-shahed-warehouse-ukrainian-intel-says/	2024-12-22T22:48:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183433232.jpg

According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,615 tanks, 19,885 armored fighting vehicles, 32,039 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,313 artillery systems, 1,256 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,030 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 20,790 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-776-090-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-12-22T22:12:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188757384.jpg
North Korea preparing to ship more troops, drones to Russia, Seoul says	North Korea is preparing to deploy additional troops and weapons, including kamikaze drones, to aid Russia in its full-scale war against Ukraine, the South Korean military said on Dec. 23. Thousands of North Korean personnel are already stationed in Russia. In recent days, North Korean soldiears have begun engaging in assault operations alongside Russian forces in Kursk Oblast. South Korea&apos;s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) believe that Pyongyang is now planning to send additional military support, the Yonhap news agency reported. &quot;A comprehensive assessment of multiple intelligence shows that North Korea is preparing to rotate or increase the deployment of troops (in Russia), while currently supplying 240 millimeter rocket launchers and 170 millimeter self-propelled artillery,&quot; the JCS said. &quot;There are also some signs of (the North) moving to manufacture and supply suicide drones, first unveiled during Kim Jong Un&apos;s on-site inspection in November.&quot; By deepening military cooperation with Moscow, Pyongyang hopes to gain practical battlefield experience and the ability to modernize its weapons systems, the JCS said. North Korea has emerged as Russia&apos;s leading ally in the full-scale war against Ukraine, providing not only ballistic missiles and artillery ammunition but also soldiers. The two nations signed a defense treaty in June, requiring either state to render military aid to the other in the event of an attack. After reporting initial but limited clashes with North Korean troops in the fall, Ukraine in December announced that Russia had begun using North Korean units in ground assaults. South Korean officials have reported that at least 100 North Korean soldiers have been killed while fighting for Russia against Ukraine. According to lawmaker Lee Sung-kwon, North Korean troops are suffering high casualty rates in part due to their inexperience with drone warfare. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia is attempting to hide information about North Korean casualties.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-preparing-to-ship-more-troops-drones-to-russia-seoul-says/	2024-12-22T21:49:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029588238--1-.jpg
BMW dismisses employees involved in scheme to illegally deliver cars to Russia	The German automaker BMW on Dec. 22 announced that it had uncovered irregularites in car exports from its Hanover branch to Russia and subsequently dismissed employees who were involved. The announcement confirms a report from the news outlet Business Insider, said that over 100 luxury cars had been delivered to Russian buyers despite ongoing sanctions. BMW discovered irregularities that allowed cars to be transferred to Russia from its Hanover branch, the company said in a statement, as reported by Deutsche Welle. The automaker has since suspended sales of the vehicles. &quot;In addition, the BMW Group has decided to dismiss the employees who bear the greatest responsibility for this,&quot; the company said. The U.S. and the E.U. banned the export of high-end automobiles to Russia in March 2022, in the aftermath of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Cars from Europe have nonetheless continued to enter Russia through a variety of schemes to circumvent the ban. Russia&apos;s luxury car imports fell sharply after sanctions were first imposed, but shipments resumed in 2023, largely via intermediaries in third-party countries. BMW is taking steps to prevent illegal exports of its products to Russia via third parties and to fully comply with international sanctions, the company said.	https://kyivindependent.com/bmw-dismisses-employees-involved-in-scheme-to-illegally-deliver-cars-to-russia/	2024-12-22T20:38:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2162698459.jpg
Trump names 5 picks for Pentagon jobs	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Dec. 22 announced five nominees for high-level positions at the Pentagon, including deputy defense secretary. Trump takes office on Jan. 20, 2025, and has begun selecting nominees for top positions in his cabinet from among his loyal supporters. His picks are subject to Senate confirmation hearings. &#xA0; The president-elect named billionaire investor Stephen Feinberg as his pick for deputy defense secretary. Feinberg has no previous Pentagon experience, but has been a major financial backer of Trump&apos;s presidential campaigns. Feinberg will &quot;help Make the Pentagon Great Again,&quot; Trump said via the social media platform Truth Social on Dec. 22. Trump also tapped Elbridge Colby for under-secretary for policy, Michael Duffey for undersecretary for acquisitions and sustainment, Emil Michael for undersecretary for research and engineering, and Keith Bass for assistant secretary for health affairs. Colby, who served in the Pentagon during Trump&apos;s first term, has said that he does not support Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO but does endorse increasing sanctions against Russia. Colby will work &quot;to restore our Military power, and achieve my policy of PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH,&quot; Trump said. Duffey, another former Trump administration official, played a key role in an international incident involving Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. Duffey asked the Pentagon to halt millions of dollars in scheduled military aid to Ukraine following a 2019 phone call between Zelensky and Trump, during which Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden as a &quot;favor.&quot; The infamous call led to Trump&apos;s first impeachment. &quot;Mike will drive change at the Pentagon and, as a staunch proponent of an America First approach to our National Defense, will work to revitalize our Defense Industrial Base, and rebuild our Military,&quot; Trump said. Emil Michael is a former executive at Uber, while Keith Bass is a retired Navy commander. Trump shocked Pentagon officials when he named Fox News host Pete Hegseth as his choice for U.S. defense secretary on Nov. 12. Hegseth lacks military leadership experience and has been accused of sexual assault and alcohol abuse. Reuters reported on Nov. 13 that Trump&apos;s team is planning additional shake-ups at the Pentagon, possibly including dismissals of several military officers. Mr. Trump named Stephen A. Feinberg as his choice for deputy secretary of defense, Elbridge Colby to be under secretary for policy, Michael Duffey for under secretary for acquisitions and sustainment and Emil Michael as under secretary for research and engineering. All should face Senate confirmation hearings.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-names-5-picks-for-pentagon-jobs/	2024-12-22T19:19:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185636867.jpg
Putin threatens 'more destruction' for Ukraine after Kazan drone strike	Russian President Vladimir Putin on Dec. 22 threatened Ukraine with &quot;more destruction&quot; after drones struck several buildings in the Russian city of Kazan the previous day. Drones hit residential buildings in Kazan, located in Russia&apos;s Tatarstan region, the morning of Dec. 21. The strike shattered windows in a high-rise apartment complex, but there were no reported casualties. Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for the attack. &quot;Whoever, and however much they try to destroy, they will face many times more destruction themselves and will regret what they are trying to do in our country,&quot; Putin said in a video address to the local leader of Tatarstan on Dec. 22. The comment comes a few days after Putin on Dec. 19 threatened to launch Russia&apos;s Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) at Kyiv to test Western air defenses. Previously, Putin claimed Russia planned to target &quot;decision-making centers&quot; in Kyiv with Oreshnik missiles. The drone attack on Kazan, which lies about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from the Ukrainian border, prompted school evacuations and temporary suspension of flights at nearby airports. Officials in Tatarstan reported that of the eight drones that attacked Kazan, six struck luxury apartment buildings, one hit an industrial facility, and one was shot down. Kyiv has targeted military and industrial facilities in Russia with drone strikes in an attempt to reduce Moscow&apos;s capacity to launch long-range weapons and finance its full-scale war against Ukraine. Russian aerial attacks against Ukrainian cities escalated sharply in the fall of 2024. Drone strikes surged to record levels in October and November, and Russia dropped at least 100 guided bombs per day nearly every day between Nov. 1-20. Civilian casualties from Russian missiles and aerial bombs increased significantly in 2024 compared to the previous year, the U.N. reported. A Russian guided aerial bomb struck an oncology center in Kherson overnight on Dec. 21. President Volodymyr Zelensky called the attack &quot;a heinous act of cruelty.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-threatens-more-destruction-for-ukraine-after-kazan-drone-strike/	2024-12-22T17:30:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1246324907.jpg
Putin, Slovak PM discuss gas transit, standardizing 'mutual relations,' Fico says after Kremlin meeting	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed gas transit, the war in Ukraine, and standardizing &quot;mutual relations&quot; between Russia and Slovakia during their meeting on Dec. 22, Fico said. Fico held talks with Putin at the Kremlin on Dec. 22 during a visit to Moscow. The meeting with Putin was &quot;a response&quot; to President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s refusal to extend the transit of Russian gas supplies to the European Union via Ukraine, Fico said in a Facebook post following the meeting. &quot;Putin confirmed the readiness of the Russian Federation to continue supplying gas to the West and Slovakia, which is practically impossible given the position of the Ukrainian president after Jan. 1, 2025,&quot; Fico wrote. An agreement to allow the transit of gas from Russia to Europe via Ukraine is set to expire on Dec. 31, 2024. Zelensky confirmed on Dec. 19 that Kyiv will not extend the deal. &quot;We will not engage in extending the transit of Russian gas. We will not give (Russia) the opportunity to earn additional billions on our blood,&quot; Zelensky said. Fico criticized the decision, warning of a looming gas crisis. Within days, he traveled to Moscow in his first visit since his 2023 reelection. His trip represents the third time a European leader has visited Russia since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In his comments following the meeting, Fico also criticized Zelensky&apos;s support for sanctions against Russia&apos;s nuclear program. &quot;With such positions, (Zelensky) is financially damaging Slovakia and threatening the production of electricity in nuclear power plants in Slovakia, which is unacceptable,&quot; he said. According to Fico, he and Putin went on to discuss the war in Ukraine and relations between Moscow and Bratislava. &quot;In a long conversation ... Putin and I exchanged views on the military situation in Ukraine, the possibilities of an early peaceful end to the war, and on mutual relations between the Slovak Republic and the Russian Federation, which I intend to standardize,&quot; he wrote. Fico, who heads the Slovak government for the fourth time in his political career, has been a vocal opponent of military aid for Ukraine and has close ties to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, another Central European populist leader with friendly attitudes toward Putin. Slovakia and Hungary are both heavily reliant on Russian gas, despite the EU&apos;s efforts to wean itself from Russian fossil fuels amid the full-scale invasion. Ukraine&apos;s decision to let the transit agreement expire prompted the state-owned energy companies of Slovakia, Hungary, Italy, and Austria to issue a joint declaration calling for the continuation of gas transit. Slovakia has a long-term contract with Russia&apos;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom and estimates alternative arrangements could cost an additional &#x20AC;220 million ($228.73 million) in transit fees. Fico said in October that he hopes to resume &quot;economic and standard relations&quot; between Russia and Slovakia after the war in Ukraine ends.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-slovak-pm-discuss-gas-transit-standardizing-mutual-relations-fico-says-after-kremlin-meeting/	2024-12-22T16:13:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/ficoputin2-6.png
Trump claims Putin wants to meet with him 'as soon as possible'	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Dec. 22 said that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to hold a meeting with him &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; Trump delivered the remarks to conservative activisits at a rally in Phoenix, Arizona, where he celebrated his victory in the Nov. 5 presidential election. &quot;President Putin said that he wants to meet with me as soon as possible,&quot; Trump claimed. &quot;So we have to wait for this. But we need to end that horrible, horrible war.&quot; Trump emphasized the heavy military losses incurred in the war and repeated his claims that Russia would not have launched the full-scale &#xA0;invasion if he had been president in 2022. &quot;Millions of soldiers have died,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;ve got to stop it, it&apos;s ridiculous. That war would have never happened if I was president.&quot; Earlier this week, Putin on Dec. 19 said that he was prepared to meet with Trump at &quot;any time&quot; to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. Trump will take office on Jan 20, 2025. His return to the White House is expected to mark a significant shift in U.S. policy on Ukraine, with a focus on pressuring Kyiv to make a deal with Moscow. President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Trump on Dec. 7 in Paris, along with French President Emmanuel Macron, in the leaders&apos; first in-person meeting since the election. Zelensky reported that he praised Trump during the meeting, telling him he was the only one Putin feared. Following the meeting with Zelensky, Trump said the Ukrainian president appeared ready &quot;to make a deal and stop the madness&quot; and that Putin should do the same after incurring staggering losses in Ukraine. Trump has nominated retired general Keith Kellogg as his special Ukrainian peace envoy, tasked with leading negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. Kellogg is expected to visit Ukraine before Trump&apos;s inauguration. Kellogg previously co-authored a peace plan that would freeze the front line in Ukraine, take NATO&apos;s accession off the table for an extended period, and partially lift sanctions imposed on Russia. The plan would also cut off military aid to Ukraine unless Kyiv agreed to enter negotiations. The Financial Times reported on Dec. 20 that despite these proposals, Trump intends to continue sending U.S. weapons to Ukraine when he becomes president.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-claims-putin-wants-to-meet-with-him-as-soon-as-possible/	2024-12-22T14:44:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190485862.jpg
Suspilne: more than 1000 applications submitted to join Ukrainian Legion in Poland	Over one thousand applications have been submitted to the Ukrainian Legion in Poland, Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland Vasyl Bodnar said in an interview with Suspilne on Dec. 22. The first contracts with the Ukrainian Armed Forces were signed in November, and the next recruitment phase is set for early January. Bodnar highlighted Poland&apos;s robust support for basic military training, followed by specialized training based on the soldier&apos;s role. After training, recruits are assigned to relevant military units in Ukraine, where they operate under direct command. &#x201C;Poland is a country that is quite seriously helping Ukraine, because it understands that this is a strategic interest for it, for all of Europe, and it is a country that sympathizes with Ukraine with all these terrible events that we are currently experiencing during the almost three years of ongoing war,&#x201D; Bodnar said. The legion was unveiled in July as a volunteer military unit made up of Ukrainian men living in Poland and trained by the Polish Armed Forces. The first volunteer recruitment center was opened in October at the Ukrainian consulate in the eastern Polish city of Lublin. The unit is part of an effort to replenish the ranks of Ukraine&apos;s military as the all-out war with Russia continues into its third year.	https://kyivindependent.com/suspilne-more-than-1000-applications-submitted-to-join-ukrainian-legion-in-poland/	2024-12-22T13:28:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160543138.jpg
New IMF forecast predicts war in Ukraine ending in late 2025 or 2026	The International Monetary Fund&#x2019;s (IMF) updated projections for Ukraine outline two scenarios regarding Russia&#x2019;s ongoing war. The baseline scenario assumes the war will end by late 2025, while the downside scenario predicts it will continue until mid-2026, significantly affecting economic stability. Under the baseline scenario, Ukraine&#x2019;s GDP is expected to grow by 4% in 2024, an increase from earlier forecasts, and inflation is projected to rise to 10% due to factors like rising food prices and currency depreciation. The IMF notes that investments in electricity generation and European imports have mitigated the effects of winter energy shortages. For 2025, GDP growth is forecast at 2.5-3.5%, reflecting improved energy capacity and rising income levels amid easing price pressures. In the downside scenario, a prolonged war would cause deeper economic shocks, including slower GDP recovery, higher inflation, and fiscal deficits exceeding 20% until 2026. This scenario estimates an external financing gap of $177.2 billion, compared to $148 billion under the baseline, with international reserves remaining below IMF criteria until 2027. On December 21, the IMF completed its sixth review of Ukraine&apos;s Extended Fund Facility, approving an additional $1.1 billion tranche. The program will provide Kyiv with $15.6 billion in budget support over four years. Including the latest round of funding, the IMF has already disbursed $9.8 billion.	https://kyivindependent.com/new-imf-forecast-predicts-war-in-ukraine-ending-in-late-2025-or-2026/	2024-12-22T12:21:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2171755093.jpg
Ukraine war latest: For the first time, Ukraine attacks Russian positions using solely ground, FPV drones	Key developments on Dec. 21-22: Ukrainian forces successfully attacked Russian positions using only ground and first person view (FPV) drones instead of infantry, an army spokesperson claimed on Dec. 20. Speaking on national TV, Sergeant Volodymyr Dehtiarov, spokesperson for the Khartiia Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, said &#x201C;dozens of units of robotic and unmanned equipment&#x201D; supported by surveillance drones were used in the assault near the village of Lyptsi, north of Kharkiv. Dehtiarov said the drones included ground systems equipped with machine guns, and kamikaze FPV drones. He did not specify when the attack took place. Commenting on the reports, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said the attack highlighted the difference in attitude towards front line troops shown by Moscow and Kyiv. &quot;Ukrainian officials have repeatedly highlighted Ukraine&apos;s efforts to utilise technological innovations and asymmetric strike capabilities to offset Ukraine&apos;s manpower limitations in contrast with Russia&apos;s willingness to accept unsustainable casualty rates for marginal territorial gains,&quot; the ISW said. Russian military losses in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine have exceeded 750,000 Russian soldiers, and are expected to surpass 1 million Russian troops within six months, U.K. Under-Secretary of Defense Luke Pollard said on Dec. 19. The U.K.&apos;s latest estimate is in line with figures from Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, which, as of Dec. 19, sits at 768,220 troops lost since the start of the war. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. &quot;It is highly likely that they have sustained significant combat casualties, whilst only achieving limited tactical gains,&quot; Pollard told British parliamentarians on Dec. 19. Russia has gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast in recent months but at the cost of heavy casualties. Russian losses reached record highs in November and December, with a daily high of 2,030 troops lost in November, marking the highest daily loss since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Russian losses exceeded 45,000 troops and $3 billion worth of equipment in November. President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed in a rare statement that Ukraine had lost 43,000 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Ukraine is developing numerous new types of drone systems. Military tech developers created a new unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) with the ability to carry explosives and drive under armored vehicles, the project&apos;s spokesperson, Viktoriia Kovalchuk, told Business Insider on Oct. 25. The UGV, named Ratel S or Honey Badger, was developed as part of the Brave1 government initiative. The initiative was launched in April to invest in defense tech innovations that can be utilized by the Ukrainian military, as well as serve as a platform to connect the industry&apos;s stakeholders. &quot;The main idea is that the robot (Ratel S) is used as a mobile warhead that carries anti-tank mines or other explosive devices,&quot; said Kovalchuk, adding that it can run for 40&#x2013;50 minutes at an average speed or for up to two hours at a slower speed. Over 12,340 civilian deaths have been recorded in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) Izumi Nakamitsu said during a U.N. Security Council meeting on Dec. 20. The U.N. report on casualties comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin escalates threats against Ukrainian cities, including threatening on Dec. 19 to launch an Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) against Kyiv. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded civilian casualties in Ukraine from Feb. 24, 2022 to Nov. 30, 2024, Nakamitsu said. Over 12,340 civilians were killed and more than 27,836 were wounded during that period. The U.N. found that in 2024, aerial bombs and long-range weapons caused a greater number of casualties than in the previous year, Nakamitsu said. Aerial bombs killed 341 civilians and wounded 1,803 between Jan. 1 and Nov. 30, according to data from the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. The figures represent a threefold increase in deaths and sixfold increase in injuries from 2023. The OHCHR also found that 42% of Ukrainian civilian casualties in the month of November resulted from Russian attacks with long-range weapons, a &quot;significant increase&quot; from prior months. Russia intensified aerial strikes against densely populated Ukrainian cities in October and November 2024. Drone strikes surged to record levels and Russia dropped at least 100 guided bombs per day nearly every day between Nov. 1-20. Repeated attacks against residential neighborhoods in large cities, including Kharkiv, Odesa, and Sumy, led to high numbers of killed and injured victims. Russia on Nov. 21 launched an Oreshnik missile against the city of Dnipro, supposedly as a response to the U.S. and the U.K. lifting restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s long-range strikes inside Russia. Putin has since used threats of Oreshnik strikes to intimidate Ukraine and scare off Western support for Kyiv. Nakamitsu said that Russia&apos;s escalating attacks are cause for &quot;grave concerns.&quot; An airport in the Russian city of Kazan has suspended flights after Ukrainian drones hit several buildings, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported on Dec. 21. According to the outlet, eight drones attacked the city in the morning hours, with five of them hitting residential buildings across three districts of the city. Russian independent news outlet Meduza reported that four of the eight drones crashed into two high-rise residential buildings and one into a low-rise residential building. Russian state media Kommersant reported that the airports of both Kazan and the neighboring city of Izhevsk had suspended flights. The Kazan mayor&apos;s office has said that schools have been &quot;selectively&quot; evacuated, according to Meduza. No casualties have been reported at this time. Russian state media outlet Tass reported that a drone attempting to attack an industrial plant &quot;missed its target,&quot; according to the press service of the governor of Tatarstan, the republic in which Kazan is located. Kyiv has intensified its drone strike campaign on Russian territory, targeting military and industrial facilities to weaken Russia&apos;s war effort in Ukraine. On Nov. 25, drones operated by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) struck an oil depot in the western Russian city of Kaluga. These attacks follow Ukraine&apos;s first use of U.S.-made ATACMS missiles against Russia and subsequent launches of UK-made Shadow missiles, made possible after Washington eased long-range attack restrictions. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin on December 22, according to the state-owned TASS news agency. This marked his first visit to Moscow since returning to power in 2023. The trip was reportedly planned a few days earlier, with discussions likely centered on Russian gas supplies, though details will emerge after the meeting. Fico becomes the third European leader to visit Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, following Austria&#x2019;s Karl Nehammer and Hungary&#x2019;s Viktor Orb&#xE1;n. This visit comes as Slovakia seeks to secure a gas supply deal for 2024, despite Ukraine&apos;s firm stance against renewing its gas transit agreement with Gazprom. At a prior European Union summit, Fico criticized Ukraine&#x2019;s position, saying, &quot;We are demonstrably facing a gas crisis thanks to President Zelensky.&quot; Slovakia has a long-term contract with Russia&apos;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom and estimates alternative arrangements could cost an additional &#x20AC;220 million ($228.73 million) in transit fees. The Justice Ministry has faced &quot;serious challenges&quot; after the largest cyberattack in months targeted state registries, but a full restoration is expected within two weeks, First Deputy Justice Minister Mykola Kucheryavenko said on Dec. 22. In comments to the Kyiv Independent, Kucheryavenko said that the precise date of the full restoration of the registries would be more clear in the coming days. &quot;The aggressor&apos;s actions were aimed at destabilizing the work of the state registries,&quot; Kucheryavenko said. &quot;The goals of the attack were not achieved.&quot; The cyberattack targeted several government services on Dec. 19, including state registers overseen by the Justice Ministry, Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said. Officials say the cyberattack had been prepared for months. Ukraine launched a criminal investigation. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) suggested on Dec. 20 Russia&apos;s military intelligence agency (GRU) could be behind the cyberattack on Ukraine&apos;s government services. The former Justice Minister, Denys Maliuska, told Ukrainian media outlet Ukrainska Pravda that the majority of the information Russia stole was &quot;already freely available,&quot; though closed a register were also affected. &quot;This is one of the most closed register where information is stored, in which there is no secret, it would seem &#x2014; that someone was born or married,&quot; Maliuska told Ukrainska Pravda. &quot;But at the same time, there is a secret that is strictly protected by law &#x2014; the secret of adoption,&quot; he added. Kucheryavenko said that &quot;preliminary estimates no information from the registries has been lost,&quot; adding that the ministry has backup copies of the data. Behind the scenes of the fierce battles on the front line, both sides are fighting a cyberwarfare crucial to the war efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-for-the-first-time-ukraine-attacks-russian-positions-using-solely-ground-fpv-drones/	2024-12-22T11:34:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1574618594.jpg

Ombudsman reacts to alleged Russian execution of Ukrainian POWs	Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets reacted to a video allegedly showing Russian troops executing Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) on Dec. 22, vowing to report &quot;another crime&quot; to the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to seek justice. &quot;The video shows how Russian soldiers shot five captured Ukrainian defenders,&quot; Lubinets said in a Telegram post, referring to drone footage released by the 110th Mechanized Brigade earlier on Dec. 22 that appears to have captured Russian troops shooting surrendered Ukrainian soldiers from behind. One of the press officers of the 110th, Ivan Sekach, told the Ukrainian media outlet NV that Russian troops had shot four encircled Ukrainian soldiers dead. Another two, he said, were already killed by shelling earlier. He said that the incident took place on the Velyka Novosilka axis in the eastern Donetsk Oblast, where Russian troops have recently intensified their push. Throughout the full-scale war in Ukraine, the visual evidence of Russian troops executing Ukrainian soldiers mounts, showing a stark violation of the Geneva Conventions. It is however difficult to prove such apparent war crimes to the international court, as retrieving such bodies is often impossible. The 110th brigade suffered a similar incident in February when its troops were withdrawing from the small industrial city of Avdiivka in Donetsk Oblast. Two soldiers who barely escaped encirclement told the Kyiv Independent how six of their comrades, who were unable to flee on foot due to their injuries, were shot dead by Russian troops, citing videos that surfaced on the internet. The 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade confirmed in a Feb. 19 statement that five soldiers were killed, and the fate of the last one was uncertain. Yurii Belousov, the head of the department focused on war-related crimes, said in October that Kyiv is aware of 93 POWs who were executed by Russian soldiers across the full-scale war. The number has since passed to include over 100 such cases.	https://kyivindependent.com/ombudsman-reacts-to-alleged-russian-execution-of-ukrainian-pows/	2024-12-22T08:58:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-22-at-18_06_00.png
Full restoration of state registries expected within weeks, Justice Ministry says after major cyberattack	The Justice Ministry has faced &quot;serious challenges&quot; after the largest cyberattack in months targeted state registries, but a full restoration is expected within two weeks, First Deputy Justice Minister Mykola Kucheryavenko said on Dec. 22. In comments to the Kyiv Independent, Kucheryavenko said that the precise date of the full restoration of the registries would be more clear in the coming days. &quot;The aggressor&apos;s actions were aimed at destabilizing the work of the state registries,&quot; Kucheryavenko said. &quot;The goals of the attack were not achieved.&quot; The cyberattack targeted several government services on Dec. 19, including state registers overseen by the Justice Ministry, Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said. Officials say the cyberattack had been prepared for months. Ukraine launched a criminal investigation. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) suggested on Dec. 20 Russia&apos;s military intelligence agency (GRU) could be behind the cyberattack on Ukraine&apos;s government services. The former Justice Minister, Denys Maliuska, told Ukrainian media outlet Ukrainska Pravda that the majority of the information Russia stole was &quot;already freely available,&quot; though closed a register were also affected. &quot;This is one of the most closed register where information is stored, in which there is no secret, it would seem &#x2014; that someone was born or married,&quot; Maliuska told Ukrainska Pravda. &quot;But at the same time, there is a secret that is strictly protected by law &#x2014; the secret of adoption,&quot; he added. Kucheryavenko said that &quot;preliminary estimates no information from the registries has been lost,&quot; adding that the ministry has backup copies of the data. Behind the scenes of the fierce battles on the front line, both sides are fighting a cyberwarfare crucial to the war efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/full-restoration-of-state-registries-expected-within-weeks-justice-ministry-says-after-major-russian-cyberattack/	2024-12-22T06:52:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1985046292.jpg
At least one killed, 10 wounded by Russian attacks over past day, local authorities say	At least one person was killed, and 10 were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day, local authorities reported on Dec. 22. In the southern Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said that one person was killed and six, including a child, were wounded as of the morning of Dec. 22. He said that Russian troops struck the western bank of the Dnipro River with glide bombs and artillery, in addition to launching a ballistic missile strike in the Kherson area. In the central Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Governor Serhii Lysak said that the city of Nikopol and its surrounding areas came under heavy fire throughout the day on Dec. 21. Three were wounded yesterday, including a 16-year-old boy, according to the official. In the eastern Donetsk Oblast, where the fiercest fighting rages on, Russian attacks on front-line areas led to one injury in the city of Pokrovsk, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. The reports of casualties come as Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported shooting down 52 attack drones, including the Shahed type, that Russia launched against the country overnight. It added that it lost track of 44 decoy drones that Russia launched alongside the real attack drones. One drone flew toward Belarus, according to the report. The Air Force said that there were no casualties reported yet from the drone strikes. Russia continues to indiscriminately attack civilian areas regardless of their proximity to the front line, often targeting critical infrastructure to deprive people of electricity, gas, and water.	https://kyivindependent.com/at-least-one-killed-10-wounded-by-russian-attacks-over-past-day-local-authorities-say/	2024-12-22T05:34:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Kherson-1.jpeg
Air Force reports downing 52 Russian drones overnight	Ukraine shot down 52 attack drones, including the Shahed type, that Russia launched against the country overnight, the Air Force reported on Dec. 22. The Air Force added that it lost track of 44 decoy drones that Russia launched alongside the real attack drones. One drone flew away toward Belarus, according to the report. Over the past several months, Russia has intensified its drone attacks across Ukraine, often targeting critical infrastructure to deprive civilians of power, water, and gas. On Dec. 22, drones were shot down over 12 Ukrainian oblasts, such as Poltava, Sumy, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia, the Air Force reported. Apartment buildings and private businesses are among the sites damaged due to the Russian attacks, according to the Air Force. No casualties have been reported thus far, it added. Russia is launching about 10 times as many Shahed-type drones against Ukraine compared to last fall, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in November. The Air Force has reported a sharp rise in Russia&apos;s drone attacks, from 2,023 drones deployed in October to 2,576 in November.	https://kyivindependent.com/air-force-reports-downing-52-russian-drones-overnight/	2024-12-22T02:40:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183433232.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 774,100 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 774,100 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 22. This number includes 1,820 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day.

Media identifies nearly 85,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine	Journalists have identified the names of 84,761 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to a joint investigation by BBC Russia and Mediazona. Since the media outlets&apos; last update in early December, the names of 2,711 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties. The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, regional media reports, and statements from local authorities. According to the outlets&apos; conclusions for the year, 2024 will likely mark the &quot;war&apos;s deadliest year,&quot; with a current count of over 20,000 confirmed deaths over the past 12 months &#x2014; although final conclusions cannot yet be made as data on casualties continues to emerge. The confirmed figures comes as the U.K. announced its casualty estimates earlier in the week, estimating that Russian losses have exceeded 750,000 Russian soldiers, and are expected to surpass 1 million Russian troops within six months. The U.K.&apos;s latest estimate are in line with figures from Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, which, as of Dec. 21, sits at 772,280 troops lost since the start of the war. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. Russia has gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast in recent months but at the cost of heavy casualties. Russian losses reached record highs in November and December, with a daily high of 2,030 troops lost in November, marking the highest daily loss since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Russian losses exceeded 45,000 troops and $3 billion worth of equipment in November. Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures, though a Defense Ministry official recently let slip that the department received 48,000 requests to identify missing soldiers. President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed in a rare statement that Ukraine had lost 43,000 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-identifies-nearly-85-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine/	2024-12-21T19:15:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1249450973.jpg
Fire reported at oil depot in Russia's Oryol Oblast amid drone attack	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Ukrainian drones reportedly struck an oil depot in the suburbs of the Russian city of Oryol overnight on Dec. 22, causing a fire to break out, Oryol Oblast Governor Andrey Klychkov said. Multiple explosions were reported in the city around 12:30 p.m. local time, according to Russian Telegram news channel Astra. Videos posted on social media and shot by local residents show large explosions lighting up the night sky around the city. The extent of the damage caused was not immediately clear. Klychkov claimed that no casualties or injuries had been reported as a result of the attack. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify the claims made by Russian officials and Ukraine&apos;s military has not yet commented on the attack. The attack comes just one week after Ukrainian drones struck the same oil depot in Oryol causing a large fire to break out. The fire reportedly burned for several days following the attack. Over the past year, Ukrainian forces have launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry, which is crucial to sustain Moscow&apos;s war efforts, as well as its military hardware. As Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion continues, Ukraine has also continued to attack Russian targets along the Russia-Ukraine border to inflict damage to the country&apos;s military supply chain. Earlier on Dec. 21, Ukrainian drones reportedly attacked the Russian city of Kazan, located over 1,000 km from the Russia-Ukraine border. The drones hit several buildings and suspended flights in the local airport.	https://kyivindependent.com/fire-reported-at-oil-depot-in-russias-oryol-oblast-amid-ukrainian-drone-attack/	2024-12-21T17:57:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Volga_river__Saratov_Oil_Refinery_P5161319_2200.jpg
Ukrainian boxer Usyk defeats Fury to retain heavyweight championship belt	Ukrainian boxer Oleksandr Usyk defeated U.K.-born Tyson Fury by unanimous decision in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on Dec. 22 to retain his unified heavyweight championship title. The victory, which all judges scored 116-112, comes amid a highly anticipated rematch of a bout that Usyk also won in May. With his victory, Usyk has been undefeated in all of his 23 professional fights. Following his victory, Usyk dedicated his victory to his mother, &quot;and to all the mothers of Ukraine.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky also congratulated Usyk following his victory, adding that Usyk&apos;s win was &quot;so needed by all of us right now.&quot; &quot;By keeping his championship belts, Oleksandr proves: we are Ukrainians and we will not give up what is ours. And no matter how hard it was &#x2013; we will overcome. Whether it&apos;s the ring, the battlefield, or the diplomatic arena &#x2013; we fight and we won&#x2019;t give up what is ours,&quot; Zelensky wrote on social media. In a symbolic move following his victory, Usyk, originally from Crimea, raised a 17th century sabre once owned by Cossack Hetman Ivan Mazepa. The sabre, preserved in the Chernihiv Historical Museum, was carefully transported to Riyadh through the Oleksandr Usyk Charitable Foundation and Ukraine WOW. After the match, U.K. boxer Daniel Dubois and International Boxing Federation (IBF) heavyweight champion entered the ring and challenged Usyk to a bout for Usyk&apos;s championship title. Before becoming a professional boxer in 2013, Usyk competed as an amateur boxer with a record of 335 wins and 15 losses. He was crowned Olympic gold medalist in men&apos;s heavyweight boxing at the 2012 London Games.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-boxer-usyk-defeats-fury-to-retain-heavyweight-champion-belt/	2024-12-21T16:19:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/gettyimages-2190993992-612x612.jpg
Russian attack on cancer treatment center in Kherson 'heinous act of cruelty against civilians,' Zelensky says	Russia&apos;s attack on an oncology center in the city of Kherson overnight on Dec. 21 &quot;was nothing less than a heinous act of cruelty against civilians,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address. Russian forces struck an oncology center with two guided aerial bombs, the Kherson Regional Military Administration reported. In his evening address, Zelensky said that there were no casualties as a result of the attack on the medical facility as patients and medical staff sought shelter. The oncology center, which has operated in a limited capacity since the start of the full-scale invasion, housed the only linear accelerator offering radiotherapy treatment in the city. &quot;The Russians could not have been unaware that this is specifically a medical facility, and one of great value to the residents of Kherson,&quot; Zelensky added. &quot;We will definitely continue to strike Russian military targets &#x2013; with drones and missiles, increasingly with Ukrainian-made ones, specifically targeting military bases and Russian military infrastructure used in this terror against our people. Our defense is entirely just.&quot; Throughout its full-scale invasion, Russia has continuously targeted medical facilities particularly in Ukraine&apos;s eastern oblasts. Ukraine&apos;s Health Ministry reported on July 22 that a total of 1,642 medical facilities have been damaged, and another 214 facilities have been completely destroyed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 &#x2014; although the updated number is likely significantly higher. In July, Russia targeted the Okhmatdyt children&apos;s hospital in Kyiv - Ukraine&apos;s largest children&apos;s medical center - killing 2 and injuring at least 32 more, including children. More recently, a Russian glide bomb attack on Zaporizhzhia on Nov. 8, damaged another cancer hospital. Situated along Ukraine&apos;s front line, Kherson Oblast is the frequent target Russian of attacks. Zelensky has repeatedly called for additional air defense systems from Western allies to better protect critical infrastructure across the country. During a visit to Brussels on Dec. 18, Zelensky called for an additional 19 air defense systems to be provided, according to a Kyiv Independent journalist who attended the briefing.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-cancer-treatment-center-in-kherson-heinous-act-of-cruelty-against-civilians-zelensky-says/	2024-12-21T14:49:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185712185.jpg
Ukrainian woman in serious condition following Germany's Christmas market attack	A Ukrainian woman is in serious condition after a car plowed into a crowd at a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, on the evening of Dec. 20. The incident has claimed five lives and left over 200 people injured, many of them critically. Ukraine&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry confirmed the woman&apos;s nationality on Dec. 21. &quot;Among the victims of the attack on the Christmas market in Magdeburg is a Ukrainian citizen born in 1972. She is in a serious condition in a German hospital.&quot; Ukrainian consular officials are coordinating with the hospital to provide necessary assistance to the injured woman, according to the ministry. Authorities in Magdeburg, the capital of Saxony-Anhalt, reported that the driver believed to be acting alone, was detained shortly after the attack. Investigators are treating the case as premeditated murder and attempted murder. German media identified the suspect as a Saudi Arabian who reportedly sympathized with the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Magdeburg&apos;s City official Ronni Krug expressed the community&#x2019;s sorrow and shock over the car-ramming attack that left at least five people dead and over 200 injured. &quot;We have been deeply shaken by yesterday&#x2019;s car-ramming attack,&quot; and added that no one in the city&#x2019;s administration &quot;slept well&quot; following the tragedy. Krug also announced the closure of Magdeburg&#x2019;s Christmas market in light of the Dec. 20 fatal incident for reasons that are &quot;self-explanatory,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-woman-in-serious-condition-following-germanys-christmas-market-attack/	2024-12-21T14:00:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190304903.jpg
Zelensky meets with CIA director in Kyiv	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 21 that he met with CIA Director William Burns in Ukraine, marking a rare public acknowledgment of their discussions during Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. The United States has been Ukraine&apos;s key ally, providing substantial financial and military aid since the all-out war began nearly three years ago. Washington is also reported to have consistently shared military intelligence to bolster Ukraine&apos;s defense. &quot;Bill Burns visited Ukraine on his final trip as CIA Director. Throughout this war, we&#x2019;ve had many meetings, and I am deeply grateful for his assistance,&quot; Zelensky wrote on X (formerly Twitter), sharing a photo of himself and Burns shaking hands in front of Ukraine&apos;s state crest. Zelensky noted that he and Burns had met multiple times throughout the war, but such encounters were typically kept confidential. &quot;We don&#x2019;t disclose secrets, but we keep in touch. We will likely meet again, and we will surely see how this war ends with a real and lasting peace&#x2014;a peace we are working toward together,&quot; Zelensky said. Burns is set to step down from his role as CIA chief as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares to appoint a successor. The last publicly confirmed meeting between Zelensky and Burns took place in mid-2023 when U.S. officials disclosed in July that Burns had recently made a secret visit to Ukraine. While Zelensky did not specify the exact date of their final meeting, he emphasized its significance as Burns prepares to leave his post just one month before President-elect Donald Trump assumes office. Trump has pledged to end the war swiftly, raising concerns that Kyiv may face pressure to accept peace terms that favor Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-with-cia-director-in-kyiv/	2024-12-21T13:17:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GfVf7lbX0AEgHx3.jpeg
Russian embassy condemns UK plan to use frozen Russian assets for Ukraine aid	The Russian embassy in London criticized the U.K.&apos;s plan to transfer more than two billion pounds ($2.5 billion) to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets, calling it a &quot;fraudulent scheme.&quot; In October, the U.K. announced it would provide Ukraine with a 2.26 billion-pound loan as part of a broader package from the Group of Seven (G7) nations. The funds, backed by frozen Russian central bank assets, are intended to support Ukraine&#x2019;s military, purchase weapons, and rebuild damaged infrastructure. The loans were agreed upon in July by G7 leaders&#x2014;comprising the U.K., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United States&#x2014;along with senior European Union officials. The majority of the frozen Russian assets are held in EU countries. &quot;We are closely following UK authorities&#x2019; efforts aimed at implementing a fraudulent scheme of expropriating incomes from Russian state assets &apos;frozen&apos; in the EU,&quot; the Russian embassy said on social media. U.K.&apos;s Defense Minister John Healey confirmed the funds would be dedicated solely to Ukraine&#x2019;s military. He noted that the money could help Ukraine develop drones with ranges surpassing some long-range missiles. Russia&#x2019;s embassy described the plan as illegitimate. Last week, Russia&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry accused the United States of &quot;robbery&quot; over its transfer of frozen Russian assets as part of the G7&#x2019;s $50 billion loan package for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-embassy-condemns-uk-plan-to-use-frozen-russian-assets-for-ukraine-aid/	2024-12-21T10:25:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2166062306.jpg
Ukraine's General Staff denies Guardian report about air defense personnel being transferred to infantry units	Claims that air defense personnel are being reassigned to infantry roles due to troop shortages are &quot;not credible, and incorrect,&quot; the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said in a Facebook post on Dec. 21. The response follows the publication of a report by the Guardian on Dec. 21, that claimed highly trained air defense specialists were being reassigned to infantry roles, weakening Ukraine&apos;s air defense capabilities. The Facebook post said that while some soldiers from rear units have been reassigned to combat positions, this does not include air defense specialists &quot;tasked with protecting Ukraine&#x2019;s skies.&quot; &#x201C;Reassignments involve military personnel from the Security Forces of Ukraine, some rear mobile fire groups, as well as personnel not involved in the maintenance and operation of high-tech armaments, and military equipment,&#x201D; the statement said. The General Staff also said air defense operations remain effective. &#x201C;The number of shot-down drones has not decreased,&#x201D; the statement said. The Guardian&apos;s report attributed this alleged shift to several factors, including a growing shortage of troops, Ukraine&apos;s refusal to lower the age of conscription despite U.S. insistence, and the deployment of older, less well-trained individuals to the front lines. A source told the Guardian the situation was reaching a critical level, expressing doubts about the air defense&apos;s ability to function effectively. The source also said that many of the redeployed personnel had specialized knowledge of air defense systems, but they were sent to the front lines without adequate preparation for combat roles. Mariana Bezuhla, a Ukrainian MP quoted in The Guardian&apos;s report, commented on the consequences of these alleged decisions on her Telegram channel on Dec. 21. &#x201C;These measures lead to a significant reduction in air defense units, leaving them staffed with inexperienced and older servicemen,&#x201D; she wrote, warning that this could &quot;strain relations with the United States, as Ukraine struggles to mobilize enough personnel to replenish its losses.&quot; She also said that &quot;transferring highly qualified air defense specialists&#x2014;some trained in the West&#x2014;to the front-lines without proper preparation increases the risk of classified information being compromised if they are captured.&#x201D; &#x201C;It&#x2019;s been a long time since our air defense operated at full capacity, and its quality has significantly deteriorated,&#x201D; she added, The news comes amid escalating aerial threats against Ukraine, marked by a Russian attack on Dec. 20. Five ballistic missiles targeted Kyiv, while other oblasts across the country faced widespread attacks. Just a day earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed to &#x201C;test&#x201D; Western air defenses by launching an Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile at the Ukrainian capital.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-redirects-air-defense-personnel-to-frontline-amid-troop-shortages-the-guardian-reports/	2024-12-21T07:34:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2133276712-1.jpg
Slovak PM Robert Fico to visit Putin in Russia next week, Serbian president says	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico will travel to Moscow next week to hold talks on gas supplies with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on Dec. 20. &quot;Robert Fico will meet with Putin on Monday as the leader of a European Union country, which, I don&apos;t have to tell you what kind of reaction will cause among other European leaders from the EU,&quot; Vucic said in an interview with Serbian media. Vucic said he had &quot;learned unofficially&quot; of the upcoming visit. Ukraine has said it will not extend the transit agreement for Russian gas through its territory, set to expire on Dec. 31. The decision has prompted concerns from Slovakia, Hungary and other nations, and Fico on Dec. 20 warned of a looming gas crisis. President Volodymyr Zelensky reaffirmed the refusal during a press conference on Dec. 19, saying that Kyiv would not enable Moscow to earn additional revenue while continuing its war. At a European Union summit, Fico criticized Ukraine&#x2019;s position, saying: &quot;We are demonstrably facing a gas crisis thanks to President Zelensky.&quot; He also suggested that Bratislava might consider &quot;reciprocal measures&quot; if Russian gas transit through Ukraine to Slovakia is halted. Slovakia has a long-term contract with Russia&apos;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom and estimates alternative arrangements could cost an additional &#x20AC;220 million ($228.73 million) in transit fees. The issue highlights ongoing dependence on Russian gas in several EU members, including Slovakia, Hungary, and Austria, despite efforts to diversify energy sources following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Earlier this year, the EU implemented its first sanctions targeting the Russian gas industry, focusing on liquefied natural gas (LNG). Russian President Vladimir Putin also addressed the matter during his annual press conference on Dec. 19, confirming the end of the contract and expressing confidence in Gazprom&apos;s resilience. &#x201C;This contract will no longer exist. Everything is clear. We will survive, Gazprom will survive,&#x201D; Putin said. Slovakia, which has a long-term contract with Russian oil giant Gazprom has been trying to keep receiving gas through Ukraine, saying buying elsewhere would cost 220 million euros ($228.73 million) more in transit expenses.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovak-pm-robert-fico-to-visit-putin-in-russia-next-week-serbian-president-says/	2024-12-21T07:14:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190743977.jpg
Orban says Hungary proposing ‘trick’ to keep Russian gas shipments via Ukraine	Hungary is in talks with Moscow and Kyiv hoping to keep open gas shipments via Ukraine, the country&#x2019;s Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Dec. 21. Ukraine has said it will not extend the transit agreement for Russian gas through its territory, set to expire on Dec. 31. The decision has prompted concerns from Hungary and other nations, and Orban has now hinted at a potentially unconventional solution to keeping the route open for Budapest. &quot;We are now trying the trick ... that what if the gas, by the time it enters the territory of Ukraine, would no longer be Russian but would be already in the ownership of the buyers,&quot; he said in comments reported by Reuters. &quot;So the gas that enters Ukraine would no longer be Russian gas but it would be Hungarian gas.&quot; It&#x2019;s not known how the proposal has gone down in Moscow and Kyiv, but President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Ukraine would not allow Russia to &#x201C;earn additional billions&#x201D; from gas exports while continuing its full-scale invasion. Hungary is broadly seen as the most Moscow-friendly country within the EU and NATO, repeatedly obstructing aid to Kyiv and sanctions against Russia. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has also repeatedly visited Russia throughout the full-scale war, a step that his European colleagues avoided. Along with Slovakia and Austria, Hungary remains reliant on Russian gas, paid for through the now-sanctioned Gazprombank. Hungary receives roughly 4.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas on an annual basis under a 15-year deal signed in 2021. Earlier this month Hungary requested the U.S. to provide the country with a sanctions waiver to further continue payments for Russian natural gas imports through Gazprombank, Szijjarto said. The United States introduced new sanctions on Nov. 21, targeting dozens of Russian banks, including Gazprombank, securities registrars, and financial officials. &quot;Yesterday, we filed our request with the relevant American authorities that calls for Gazprombank being granted an exception from sanctions when it comes to payments for natural gas,&quot; Szijjarto said, amid a visit to Washington ahead of President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s inauguration. After the sanction were initially announced, Szijjarto said on Nov. 22 that sanctions marked an &quot;attack on our sovereignty,&quot; deeming the implementation as a &quot;threat to energy security.&quot; The U.S. had previously refrained from targeting Gazprombank to allow European countries to continue paying for Russian gas supplies, as the bank is the primary channel for energy-related payments. Despite the past restraint, the U.S. Treasury Department said that the most recent sanctions &quot;will make it harder for the Kremlin to evade U.S. sanctions and fund and equip its military.&quot; The Financial Times noted in its reporting that Russia used Gazprombank to purchase military equipment, pay soldiers, and compensate the families of those killed in the war in Ukraine. The new U.S. sanctions are intended to close one of Russia&apos;s few remaining avenues for international banking, barring Gazprombank from conducting transactions in dollars.	https://kyivindependent.com/orban-says-hungary-proposing-trick-to-keep-russian-gas-shipments-via-ukraine/	2024-12-21T04:34:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190226673.jpg
If Putin attacks, we need to be able to wage war,' German Defense Minister says	German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has called for an increase in the country&apos;s defense budget, citing Russia as a key reason, German outlet Spiegel reported on Dec. 21. &quot;From 2028, we need a defense budget of at least 80 billion, more likely 90 billion euros a year to meet the demands we have due to the worsening security situation,&quot; Pistorius said, &quot;If Putin attacks, we need to be able to wage war.&quot; Pistorius is the Social Democratic Party&apos;s defense minister in Chancellor Olaf Sholtz&apos;s government, and had already expressed similar thoughts in November, quoted by Ukrainian media UNN. &quot;Our security is a fragile asset. Germany must accelerate and invest more in its military capabilities,&quot; the German defense minister warned on Nov. 23. Now he has come out in favor of a reform of the debt brake in order to increase funding for military defense. &quot;I think it is politically wrong to cling rigidly to the debt brake in this situation,&quot; Pistorius said. &quot;If we finance the necessary expenditure for our defense from the normal budget, it will stifle the state&apos;s ability to act.&quot; Pistorius also believes that the Bundeswehr (the German Army) could be deployed if peacekeepers are required to enforce a ceasefire in Ukraine. &quot;As the largest NATO country in Europe, and the largest economy in Europe, Germany cannot stand by and do nothing,&quot; Pistorius said. But he made it clear that &quot;as long as the war is not over, there will be no German soldiers on Ukrainian soil.&quot; Pistorius had already advocated to push for a larger defense spending in July, as he considered the planned increase insufficient. This follows Trump&apos;s foreign policy team informing European officials of his plan to push NATO allies to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP, compared to the current 2% requirement.	https://kyivindependent.com/if-putin-attacks-we-need-to-be-able-to-wage-war-german-defense-minister-says/	2024-12-21T02:08:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/Umerov-and-Pistorius.jpeg
Two Russian airports suspend flights after Ukrainian drones target Kazan, media, officials report	An airport in the Russian city of Kazan has suspended flights after Ukrainian drones hit several buildings, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported on Dec. 21. According to the outlet, eight drones attacked the city in the morning hours, with five of them hitting residential buildings across three districts of the city. Russian independent news outlet Meduza reported that four of the eight drones crashed into two high-rise residential buildings and one into a low-rise residential building. Russian state media Kommersant reported that the airports of both Kazan and the neighboring city of Izhevsk had suspended flights. The Kazan mayor&apos;s office has said that schools have been &quot;selectively&quot; evacuated, according to Meduza. No casualties have been reported at this time. Russian state media outlet Tass reported that a drone attempting to attack an industrial plant &quot;missed its target,&quot; according to the press service of the governor of Tatarstan, the republic in which Kazan is located. Kyiv has intensified its drone strike campaign on Russian territory, targeting military and industrial facilities to weaken Russia&apos;s war effort in Ukraine. On Nov. 25, drones operated by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) struck an oil depot in the western Russian city of Kaluga.These attacks follow Ukraine&apos;s first use of U.S.-made ATACMS missiles against Russia and subsequent launches of UK-made Shadow missiles, made possible after Washington eased long-range attack restrictions.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-hit-residential-industrial-building-in-russias-tatarstan-oblast-media-report/	2024-12-21T01:30:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-21-at-09_26_57.png
For first time, Ukraine attacks Russian positions using solely ground, FPV drones	Ukrainian forces successfully attacked Russian positions using only ground and first person view (FPV) drones instead of infantry, an army spokesperson claimed on Dec. 20. Speaking on national TV, Sergeant Volodymyr Dehtiarov, spokesperson for the Khartiia Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, said &#x201C;dozens of units of robotic and unmanned equipment&#x201D; supported by surveillance drones were used in the assault near the village of Lyptsi, north of Kharkiv. Dehtiarov said the drones included ground systems equipped with machine guns, and kamikaze FPV drones. He did not specify when the attack took place. Commenting on the reports, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said the attack highlighted the difference in attitude towards front line troops shown by Moscow and Kyiv. &quot;Ukrainian officials have repeatedly highlighted Ukraine&apos;s efforts to utilise technological innovations and asymmetric strike capabilities to offset Ukraine&apos;s manpower limitations in contrast with Russia&apos;s willingness to accept unsustainable casualty rates for marginal territorial gains,&quot; the ISW said. Russian military losses in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine have exceeded 750,000 Russian soldiers, and are expected to surpass 1 million Russian troops within six months, U.K. Under-Secretary of Defense Luke Pollard said on Dec. 19. The U.K.&apos;s latest estimate is in line with figures from Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, which, as of Dec. 19, sits at 768,220 troops lost since the start of the war. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. &quot;It is highly likely that they have sustained significant combat casualties, whilst only achieving limited tactical gains,&quot; Pollard told British parliamentarians on Dec. 19. Russia has gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast in recent months but at the cost of heavy casualties. Russian losses reached record highs in November and December, with a daily high of 2,030 troops lost in November, marking the highest daily loss since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Russian losses exceeded 45,000 troops and $3 billion worth of equipment in November. President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed in a rare statement that Ukraine had lost 43,000 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Ukraine is developing numerous new types of drone systems. Military tech developers created a new unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) with the ability to carry explosives and drive under armored vehicles, the project&apos;s spokesperson, Viktoriia Kovalchuk, told Business Insider on Oct. 25. The UGV, named Ratel S or Honey Badger, was developed as part of the Brave1 government initiative. The initiative was launched in April to invest in defense tech innovations that can be utilized by the Ukrainian military, as well as serve as a platform to connect the industry&apos;s stakeholders. &quot;The main idea is that the robot (Ratel S) is used as a mobile warhead that carries anti-tank mines or other explosive devices,&quot; said Kovalchuk, adding that it can run for 40&#x2013;50 minutes at an average speed or for up to two hours at a slower speed.	https://kyivindependent.com/for-first-time-ukraine-attacks-russian-positions-using-solely-ground-fpv-drones/	2024-12-21T00:22:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2180352947.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 762,440 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 772,280 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 21. This number includes 1,860 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,594 tanks, 19,841 armored fighting vehicles, 31,891 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,252 artillery systems, 1,256 multiple launch rocket systems, 1027 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 20,685 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-762-440-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022-2/	2024-12-20T23:14:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2150597884.jpg
Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia injures 4, including child	Russia attacked the city of Zaporizhzhia the evening of Dec. 20, injuring four people, including a 12-year-old boy, regional Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. The attack damaged a 9-story apartment building in the city, Fedorov said. Three women and a 12-year-old boy sustained injuries in the attack. Fedorov did not disclose details about their condition. The same night, a Russian drone attack targeted a residential building in the northeastern city of Kharkiv, also injuring a 12-year-old child. Zaporizhzhia is a frequent target of Russian attacks. A missile strike against the city on Dec. 10 killed 10 people and injured 22. The attack also destroyed a private medical clinic and damaged several buildings. Less than a week before that, an aerial bomb attack against the city on Dec. 6 killed 10 people and injured 24, including two children. The Ukrainian military has been building heavy fortifications near Zaporizhzhia in preparations for a potential Russian offensive in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-zaporizhzhia-injures-4-including-child/	2024-12-20T21:33:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/zapo2.jpg
OSCE urges Tbilisi to institute reforms in final report on Georgian parliamentary elections	The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) called on the Georgian government to take action to improve its electoral processes in its final report on Georgia&apos;s October parliamentary elections, published Dec. 20. The pro-Russian Georgian Dream party claimed a sweeping victory in the Oct. 26 elections amid widespread allegations of fraud and intimidation. The disputed results triggered mass demonstrations in Tbilisi. Georgia&apos;s laws provide &quot;an adequate basis for democratic elections,&quot; but recent legislation &quot;marked a step backwards&quot; and election day was characterized &quot;by a tense atmosphere and widespread intimidation of voters,&quot; the OSCE report said. The OSCE also cited unequal financial resources, a polarized media landscape, and the underrepresentation of women as issues undermining the election. &quot;Numerous issues noted in our final report negatively impacted the integrity of these elections and eroded public trust in the process,&quot; said Eoghan Murphy, who led the OSCE election observation mission to Georgia. &quot;To safeguard the democratic principles currently at stake in Georgia, it is imperative that the authorities urgently address all concerns.&quot; The report recommends a number of steps the Georgian government can take to reform its electoral system. These include preventing voter intimidation, undertaking a comprehensive legislative review, changing the process for appointing election commissioners, improving campaign finance oversight, and guaranteeing vote secrecy. The OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) does not recognize or endorse any elections, but instead provides assessments of electoral processes in order to let voters form their own conclusions. Opposition parties in Georgia refused to recognize the result of the Oct. 26 parliamentary vote and said the election was stolen. A Tbilisi court in mid-November dismissed 11 lawsuits filed by opposition parties and civil society groups challenging the result, and Georgia&apos;s Central Election Commission confirmed Georgian Dream&apos;s parliamentary victory on Nov. 16. The ruling party, founded by oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has led Georgia closer to the Kremlin while hindering its accession to the European Union. The controversial foreign agents law adopted earlier this year led the EU to effectively freeze Georgia&apos;s accession process. The parliamentary elections and ensuing political crisis sparked a wave of large-scale demonstrations in Tbilisi. A second round of protests kicked off when Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced that Georgia&apos;s integration into the EU could be postponed until 2028.	https://kyivindependent.com/osce-urges-tbilisi-to-institute-reforms-in-final-report-on-georgian-parliamentary-elections/	2024-12-20T21:05:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188785036.jpg
Over 12,000 civilians killed in Ukraine since Russia's full-scale war, UN says	Over 12,340 civilian deaths have been recorded in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) Izumi Nakamitsu said during a U.N. Security Council meeting on Dec. 20. The U.N. report on casualties comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin escalates threats against Ukrainian cities, including threatening on Dec. 19 to launch an Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) against Kyiv. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded civilian casualties in Ukraine from Feb. 24, 2022 to Nov. 30, 2024, Nakamitsu said. Over 12,340 civilians were killed and more than 27,836 were wounded during that period. The U.N. found that in 2024, aerial bombs and long-range weapons caused a greater number of casualties than in the previous year, Nakamitsu said. Aerial bombs killed 341 civilians and wounded 1,803 between Jan. 1 and Nov. 30, according to data from the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. The figures represent a threefold increase in deaths and sixfold increase in injuries from 2023. The OHCHR also found that 42% of Ukrainian civilian casualties in the month of November resulted from Russian attacks with long-range weapons, a &quot;significant increase&quot; from prior months. Russia intensified aerial strikes against densely populated Ukrainian cities in October and November 2024. Drone strikes surged to record levels and Russia dropped at least 100 guided bombs per day nearly every day between Nov. 1-20. Repeated attacks against residential neighborhoods in large cities, including Kharkiv, Odesa, and Sumy, led to high numbers of killed and injured victims. Russia on Nov. 21 launched an Oreshnik missile against the city of Dnipro, supposedly as a response to the U.S. and the U.K. lifting restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s long-range strikes inside Russia. Putin has since used threats of Oreshnik strikes to intimidate Ukraine and scare off Western support for Kyiv. Nakamitsu said that Russia&apos;s escalating attacks are cause for &quot;grave concerns.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/over-12-000-civilians-killed-in-ukraine-since-russias-full-scale-war-un-says/	2024-12-20T19:22:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/UN.png
IMF approves $1.1 billion in funding for Ukraine	The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved the disbursement of $1.1 billion in funds for Ukraine via the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), the IMF announced on Dec. 20. The funds represent the latest tranche of the EFF program, which will provide Kyiv with $15.6 billion in budget support over four years. The IMF approved the $1.1 billion tranche after completing its sixth review of the EFF agreement. &quot;Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine continues to take a devastating social and economic toll on Ukraine,&quot; IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a press statement. &quot;Despite the war, macroeconomic stability is being preserved through skillful policymaking by the Ukrainian authorities as well as substantial external support. ... The financial sector remains stable, but vigilance is needed given heightened risks.&quot; The IMF said Ukraine showed &quot;better than expected resilience&quot; to attacks on the energy sector, leading to greater economic growth in 2024 than previously forecasted. The agency predicts an economic slowdown in 2025 due to infrastructure attacks, pressures on the labor market, rising inflation, and the uncertainties of war. Funds from the EFF are intended to help stabilize Ukraine, support the country&apos;s postwar recovery, and promote economic growth as Kyiv moves forward on its path to EU membership. Including the latest round of funding, the IMF has already disbursed $9.8 billion in budget support for Ukraine via the EFF. External financing is critical for Ukraine as it faces mounting economic pressure from Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Kyiv received $42.5 billion in foreign aid last year, and the Finance Ministry has said that the amount needs to increase by at least $12 billion for 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/imf-approves-1-1-billion-in-funding-for-ukraine/	2024-12-20T18:16:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2171755093.jpg
Russian drone attack in Kharkiv injures 6, including child	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Russian drone struck an apartment building in Kharkiv on Dec. 20, injuring at least six people, including a child, according to Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service. The drone hit a 9-story residential building in the city&apos;s Saltivskyi district late in the evening, authorities said. The attack damaged several apartments and caused a fire. Six people were injured in the attack, including a 12-year-old child. Emergency responders rescued three people from the rubble. Rescue operations are still ongoing at the site. A second drone attack the evening of Dec. 20 caused minor damage to several homes in the city&apos;s Kyivskyi district, regional police reported. Located less than 30 kilometers from the Russian border, the northeastern city of Kharkiv has suffered relentless aerial attacks over the past two years of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Moscow often targets densely populated neighborhoods with missiles and glide bombs. A Russian missile attack on Nov. 25 targeted central Kharkiv, injuring over 20 people.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-attack-in-kharkiv-injures-6-including-child/	2024-12-20T17:28:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/kharkiv1.jpg
Trump plans to continue US military aid to Ukraine after inauguration, FT reports	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump plans to continue military support for Ukraine, the Financial Times reported on Dec. 20, citing undisclosed sources. Three officials familiar with discussions revealed that Trump intends to keep supplying US military equipment to Ukraine after his inauguration. Trump&apos;s foreign policy team also informed European officials that he plans to push NATO allies to raise their defense spending to 5% of their GDP. NATO member states currently follow a goal of allocating 2% of their GDP to defense spending. British officials noted that Trump sees providing weapons after a ceasefire as aligning with his &quot;peace through strength&quot; philosophy. However, he remains opposed to Ukraine joining NATO and advocates for an immediate resolution to the conflict. This contrasts with his earlier campaign rhetoric, where he suggested cutting off aid to Ukraine and pushing for peace talks. Trump has pledged to quickly bring an end to the war but has not provided details on how he plans to do it. He has not invited President Volodymyr Zelensky to his January inauguration but noted that Zelensky would be &#x201C;welcome&#x201D; if he chose to attend.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-plans-to-continue-us-military-aid-to-ukraine-after-inauguration-ft-reports/	2024-12-20T16:24:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2177668198.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russian An-72 military transport plane damaged in blast near Moscow, Ukraine's intel claims	Key developments on Dec. 20: A power unit of a Russian An-72 military transport plane blew up at the Ostafyevo airfield in Moscow Oblast last week, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Dec. 20. The Russian Navy plane&apos;s main power unit exploded on Dec. 12, the military intelligence agency said without providing details on the cause or circumstances of the explosion. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The An-72 is a Soviet transport aircraft, developed by Antonov, Ukraine&apos;s largest aircraft manufacturing company. The plane is used mainly by the military and has an estimated price tag of around $4.5 million. HUR shared footage of the explosion without explicitly claiming responsibility for the incident. The Ostafyevo airfield is located over 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s border. 0:00/1&#xD7;The footage purporting to show an explosion at the Ostafyevo airfield in Moscow Oblast on Dec. 12, 2024. (Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence)&quot;There will be just retribution for every war crime committed against the people of Ukraine,&quot; the agency said. Previously, Ukraine claimed responsibility for several aircraft sabotage operations inside Russia. In July, a HUR-coordinated operation resulted in damage to three Mi-28 and Ka-226 helicopters on the territory of the Moscow-based National Center of Helicopter Construction of Mil and Kamov, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent at the time. Another operation the same month reportedly led to the destruction of a Mi-8 helicopter at the Samara Kryazh military airfield in Samara Oblast, roughly 800 kilometers (500 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Russia launched a series of missile attacks against Kyiv on the morning of Dec. 20, reportedly killing one person, injuring 12, and causing damage across the city. Multiple explosions were reported in Kyiv around 7 a.m. local time, according to Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that air defenses were operating over the city. Russia attacked the capital with five ballistic missiles of the Iskander-M or the North Korean KN-23 model, the Air Force said. All five missiles were reportedly shot down, with debris falling in several districts of the city. One person was killed and at least 10 injured in the Holosiivskyi district, and at least one was injured in the Shevchenkivskyi district, the State Emergency Service reported. Five people remain hospitalized as of 1 p.m. local time. In the Holosiivskyi district, the missile wreckage damaged office buildings, residential buildings, a gas pipe, and five cars. A fire broke out on the roof of one of the office buildings, and the 15th floor was damaged, possibly trapping people inside, authorities said. Sixteen medical institutions, 17 schools, 13 kindergartens, and 630 residential buildings in the district were left without heating as a result of damaged infrastructure.

(Kyiv City Military Administration/Telegram)Fires were also reported at non-residential buildings in the Solomianskyi and Shevchenkivskyi districts of Kyiv. Initial reports about damage in the Dnipro district have not been confirmed. A blast wave damaged the stained glass windows of the St. Nicholas Roman Catholic Cathedral in the Pechersk district, the Ukraine International Institute of Restoration said. Footage shared by journalist Yan Dobronosov shows damage at an office building across the street. A large-scale fire also broke out in a warehouse in the Boryspil district of Kyiv Oblast, covering 15,000 square meters, the State Emergency Service reported. The fire had been contained as of 4:05 a.m. local time. Stained glass windows of St. Nicholas Roman Catholic Church in Kyiv were damaged by a blast wave during a Russian missile attack on Dec. 20, 2024. (Kyiv City Military Administration/Telegram)In recent months, Russia has continued to intensify its drone and missile attacks targeting different regions of Ukraine. On Dec. 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed to &quot;experiment&quot; on Western air defenses by launching an Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) at Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly called on Western allies to provide more air defenses to the embattled country. On Dec. 18, during a visit to Brussels, Zelensky called for allies to provide an additional 19 air defense systems to protect against Russian strikes on critical infrastructure. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced on Dec. 20 that it had gathered evidence against Colonel General Alexei Kim, the Russian officer allegedly responsible for the Aug. 24 missile attack on the Sapfir Hotel in Kramatorsk, Donetsk Oblast. The strike killed Ryan Evans, a British security adviser for Reuters, and injured six others, including two Reuters journalists. Kim, a deputy chief of Russia&apos;s General Staff, signed the directive and issued the combat order for the Iskander-M ballistic missile strike, according to the SBU. The SBU said that Kim directed one of his missile units to target the hotel despite it being occupied solely by civilians. SBU investigators charged Kim in absentia under Ukraine&apos;s Criminal Code with waging a war of aggression and violating the laws and customs of war. The charges align with Ukraine&apos;s broader efforts to hold Russian military leaders accountable for targeting civilian infrastructure and committing war crimes. This development follows the Dec. 17 assassination of Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, head of Russia&apos;s radiation, chemical, and biological defense forces, in an alleged SBU operation in Moscow. Ukrainian prosecutors had previously charged Kirillov with deploying banned chemical weapons in the conflict. Ukrainian forces withdrew from the area of the Uspenivka and Trudove settlements in Donetsk Oblast after &quot;heavy defensive battles,&quot; the Khortytsia group of forces said on Dec. 20. The statement came in reaction to the DeepState monitoring group claiming that some troops did not manage to pull back after Russia captured the two settlements, completing the capture of the so-called Uspenivka pocket. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry announced the capture of Uspenivka on Dec. 20. Analysts have been long warning that the Russian advance threatens to encircle Ukrainian troops in the area. The sector lies roughly 8 kilometers (5 miles) south of the embattled front-line town of Kurakhove. &quot;Commander-in-Chief (Oleksandr Syrskyi) decided to withdraw Defense Forces units from the said area to avoid encirclement,&quot; the Khortytsia group of forces said, refuting claims about stranded soldiers. &quot;The units, which have been fighting heavy defensive battles against a superior force for a long time, carried out necessary maneuvers to avoid encirclement and continue performing tasks on the Kurakhove-Konstantynopolske axis.&quot; According to DeepState, Russia is regrouping in the newly captured area and attacking in the direction of the Shevchenko-Andriivka section, threatening to create a new pocket. Russian forces are now focusing their efforts on the nearby town of Andriivka. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Throughout the autumn, Russian forces have made operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, particularly near Toretsk, Chasiv Yar, and Kupiansk, while advancing on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast. Syrskyi said on Dec. 19 that Russian forces are carrying out simultaneous attacks along the front line, claiming that &quot;Ukrainian defense forces did not allow Russian forces to breach the defense and achieve operational success in any direction.&quot; Ukraine is increasingly on the back foot of the war as its resources grow thin, and the prospects of vitally important Western aid remain uncertain following the U.S. election victory of Donald Trump.

The World Bank&apos;s Board of Directors on Dec. 18 approved $2.05 billion in Development Policy Operation (DPO) grants, which is part of the U.S.&apos;s $20 billion contribution to the G7 loan. The DPO funds are co-financed by two sources: $1 billion from the Facilitation of Resources to Invest in Strengthening Ukraine Financial Intermediary Fund (F.O.R.T.I.S. Ukraine FIF) and $1.05 billion from the Advancing Needed Credit Enhancement (ADVANCE) Ukraine Trust Fund, supported by the U.K. and Japan. &quot;We are grateful to our partners for their support on the path of economic development and reconstruction,&quot; Shmyhal said on Telegram. The DPO funds will focus on Ukraine&apos;s growth potential, supporting the railway sector, banking, and renewable energy generation, the World Bank said. Funding will also support efforts to increase domestic revenues. The EU said it would begin paying its portion of the G7 loan &#x2014; 18.1 billion euros ($18.8 billion) &#x2014; in January. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico warned of a looming gas crisis on Dec. 20 as Ukraine maintained its refusal to extend the transit agreement for Russian gas, set to expire on Dec. 31, Reuters reported. President Volodymyr Zelensky reaffirmed the refusal during a press conference on Dec. 19, saying that Kyiv would not enable Moscow to earn additional revenue while continuing its war. At a European Union summit, Fico criticized Ukraine&#x2019;s position, saying, &quot;We are demonstrably facing a gas crisis thanks to President Zelensky.&quot; He also suggested that Bratislava might consider &quot;reciprocal measures&quot; if Russian gas transit through Ukraine to Slovakia is halted. Slovakia has a long-term contract with Russia&apos;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom and estimates alternative arrangements could cost an additional &#x20AC;220 million ($228.73 million) in transit fees. The issue highlights ongoing dependence on Russian gas in several EU members, including Slovakia, Hungary, and Austria, despite efforts to diversify energy sources following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Earlier this year, the EU implemented its first sanctions targeting the Russian gas industry, focusing on liquefied natural gas (LNG). Russian President Vladimir Putin also addressed the matter during his annual press conference on Dec. 19, confirming the end of the contract and expressing confidence in Gazprom&apos;s resilience. &#x201C;This contract will no longer exist. Everything is clear. We will survive, Gazprom will survive,&#x201D; Putin said. Slovakia, which has a long-term contract with Russian oil giant Gazprom has been trying to keep receiving gas through Ukraine, saying buying elsewhere would cost 220 million euros ($228.73 million) more in transit expenses. Russia&apos;s Central Bank decided on Dec. 20 to keep its benchmark interest rate steady at 21%, contrary to expert expectations of an increase, Russia&#x2019;s state-owned TASS news agency reported. To rein in accelerating inflation fueled by war spending, Russia&apos;s Central Bank has been raising its interest rate from 7.5% in July 2023 to the current 21% - the highest level since the early 2000s. The tight monetary policy of Elvira Nabiullina, the Central Bank&apos;s chief, has drawn criticism from businesses in Russia&apos;s military-industrial complex. On Dec. 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin also mentioned the problem, saying that some experts believe that the central bank should have started using tools other than rate hikes to fight inflation. Most analysts, including those polled by Russian media outlet RBC, anticipated a hike of 200 basis points to 23%. Ahead of the decision, major Russian banks raised savings deposit yields to 24-25% per annum, reflecting expectations of tighter monetary policy. The Central Bank said that, based on inflation and credit trends, the feasibility of raising the rate further would be assessed at its next meeting. Nabiullina has been involved in a conflict over rate hikes with Sergei Chemezov, the influential CEO of the state-owned defense giant Rostec. &quot;If we continue working this way, most enterprises will essentially go bankrupt,&quot; Chemezov said in October, commenting on increases in the Central Bank&apos;s rate. Former economic advisor and opposition politician Vladimir Milov told the Kyiv Independent in November that both sides have valid concerns. &quot;Chemezov is right that businesses will have to shut down at such a (high interest) rate,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent, &quot;Nabiullina is right that the rate cannot be cut because in that case there will be hyperinflation like in Turkey.&quot; He continued that &quot;there is only one way out &#x2014; finish the war and withdraw Russian troops&quot; from Ukraine. The balance between controlling inflation and maintaining economic stability remains a critical challenge for Russia&#x2019;s Central Bank, as the war economy continues to strain the nation&apos;s financial system.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russian-an-72-military-transport-plane-damaged-in-blast-near-moscow-ukraines-intel-claims/	2024-12-20T14:03:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Russian_Air_Force_-_Antonov_An-72.jpg
Druzhba pipeline disruption halts Russian, Kazakh oil shipments to Europe, Reuters reports	Russian and Kazakh oil shipments to Hungary, Slovakia, Czechia, and Germany via the Druzhba pipeline have been halted since Dec. 19 due to technical issues at a Russian pumping station, Reuters reported, citing anonymous sources. The Druzhba pipeline, one of the world&#x2019;s largest with a capacity of 2 million barrels per day (bpd), is a critical conduit for oil from Russian fields to European refineries. Transneft, the Russian state-owned pipeline operator, identified a problem at the Unecha pumping station in Russia&#x2019;s Bryansk Oblast, near the Belarusian border. Belarus&apos; Belneftekhim confirmed the disruption to oil supplies via Druzhba to the Belarusian state-owned news agency Belta, stating that Belarusian refineries are relying on stored reserves to continue operations. The halt affects its southern branch, which had been transporting 300,000 bpd to EU countries granted exemptions from the EU&apos;s ban on Russian pipeline oil. These countries include Hungary, Slovakia, and Czechia, which rely on Russian supplies. Sources told Reuters that oil deliveries from Russia&apos;s western ports &#x2014; Novorossiisk, Ust-Luga, and Primorsk &#x2014; remain unaffected, and Druzhba&apos;s oil could be rerouted to these ports. While one source suggested the issue might be resolved within days, another indicated that the suspension could last until the end of December. The EU has largely phased out Russian oil imports following Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. However, the Druzhba pipeline&#x2019;s southern branch remains active under exemptions for certain Central European countries. The northern branch primarily transports Kazakh crude oil to Germany via Poland&apos;s Gdansk port, as Poland ceased importing Russian pipeline oil in early 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/druzhba-pipeline-disruption-halts-russian-kazakh-oil-shipments-to-europe-reuters-reports/	2024-12-20T13:37:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1229695804.jpg
Ukraine, US agree on date of peace envoy Kellogg's visit to Kyiv, official says	Ukraine and the U.S. have reached a preliminary agreement on the date of a visit to Kyiv by Keith Kellogg, President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s nominee for Ukraine peace envoy, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said during a Dec. 20 briefing. Tykhyi did not disclose the specific date of the visit for security reasons. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 19 that Kellogg would visit Ukraine before Trump&apos;s inauguration in January. According to Tykhyi, Kyiv intends to use the visit to communicate &quot;important information from the Ukrainian side&quot; that should be considered as the incoming U.S. administration develops its strategy for achieving a just peace. He said that preliminary arrangements had been made, and Kyiv is preparing to host the Trump team representative. Kellogg, 80, previously served as executive secretary and chief of staff of the U.S. National Security Council under Trump and as a top advisor to then-Vice President Mike Pence. His forthcoming visit underscores the significant role the U.S. will likely play in shaping the future of peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. Reuters reported that Kellogg and Frederick H. Fleitz, another senior advisor to Trump, had proposed a peace plan that included freezing the front lines, ceasing military aid to Ukraine unless it agreed to negotiations, and shelving Ukraine&apos;s aspirations for NATO membership. During his presidential campaign, Trump vowed to bring an end to Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, claiming he could broker a deal &quot;that&apos;s good for both sides.&quot; However, his comments, including praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin and skepticism of further U.S. assistance to Ukraine, have raised concerns in Kyiv about the potential shift in U.S. policy.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-prepares-for-trumps-peace-envoy-kellogg-visit-foreign-ministry-confirms/	2024-12-20T13:04:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-643210102.jpg
Ukraine reshuffles diplomatic team, Zelensky announces over 30 new appointments	President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the approval of over 30 Ukrainian ambassadorial appointments abroad during his evening address on Dec. 20. The appointments follow a significant reshuffle within Ukraine&apos;s diplomatic and governmental framework earlier this year. &#x201C;I approved more than 30 decisions, including Nariman Dzhelyal to Turkey, Alyona Getmanchuk as Ukraine&apos;s representative to NATO, and Andrii Melnyk as Ukraine&apos;s representative to the UN,&#x201D; Zelensky said. He added that the formal decrees will follow soon, adhering to diplomatic procedures. Key appointments include: Nariman Dzhelyal: Deputy chairman of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People and a former political prisoner recently released from Russian captivity in June 2024. Alyona Getmanchuk: Ukrainian foreign policy analyst, Director of the New Europe Center, and Associate Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council. Andrii Melnyk: Former Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to Germany, currently serving as Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to Brazil. Ukraine&apos;s parliament on Sept. 5 confirmed Andrii Sybiha as the new foreign minister after Dmytro Kuleba&apos;s resignation, marking a shift in Kyiv&apos;s diplomatic team amid the ongoing challenges posed by war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reshuffles-diplomatic-team-zelensky-announces-over-30-new-appointments/	2024-12-20T12:29:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-20-at-8_13_53-PM.jpeg
Russia buys acceptance with cash, plunging economy into uncertainty	For Russia&apos;s military recruiters, money talks. In July, Russian President Vladimir Putin doubled the federal signing-on bonus for contract soldiers to 400,000 rubles ($3,850) &#x2014; over five times the country&apos;s average monthly wage. Regional governments are expected to top this up further, although the exact amount differs in each area. In the Siberian Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, soldiers receive 2.2 million rubles from city hall ($21,000). In Belgorod Oblast, it&apos;s an additional 2.6 million ($25,200). These benefits &#x2013; as well as payments to veterans and to soldiers&apos; families in the event of their deaths &#x2014; have been vital in enticing men to join the Russian army. Speaking on Dec. 16, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that more than 430,000 people had signed up to join the country&apos;s Armed Forces in 2024 alone. Most troops hail from Russia&apos;s most disadvantaged regions &#x2014; places where the prospect of upfront cash is simply too difficult to ignore. But these payments are also increasingly warping Russia&apos;s social fabric. The funds used to provide local sign-on bonuses, as well as war pensions, are drawn from regional welfare budgets: money traditionally put aside to support vulnerable groups such as disabled people or large families. An investigation by independent Russian news outlet iStories found that war payments increasingly dominate these funds. Data analysis shows that from a sample of 48 Russian regions, more than a third are allocating 25 percent or more of welfare budgets to war-related payments. In some regions, that percentage rises dramatically. In the Stavropol Krai in Russia&apos;s North Caucasus, some 62 percent of social welfare spending has been allocated to providing war pensions and support for wounded veterans. Data analyzed by the BBC and Mediazona to estimate Russia&apos;s war deaths found that as of mid-December, at least 1,342 soldiers from &#xA0;Stavropol Krai had died in Ukraine, although this is likely to be an undercount. More than 200,000 people have reported to service under partial mobilization in Moscow, Russia on Oct. 4, 2022. (Sefa Karacan/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)A further 21 percent of Stavropol Krai&apos;s social welfare budget, or 2 billion rubles ($19.4 million), went to providing sign-on incentives, iStories reported. At the start of 2024, the region offered a relatively modest regional bonus of 100,000 rubles ($968). By the end of the year, that had catapulted to 1.6 million ($15,500). The shift put its bonus on par with neighboring Karachay-Cherkessia, which had already pumped 63 percent of the region&apos;s welfare budget into providing sign-on incentives. These sweeping payments leave little behind for Russia&apos;s most vulnerable. Stavropol Krai paid 83 percent of its 2024 welfare budget to soldiers, veterans, and their families but just 2 percent to children in state care and 4 percent to the unemployed. In Karachay-Cherkessia, war payments outstripped unemployment benefits nine times over. The changing face of Russia&apos;s welfare state reveals how the Kremlin is buying the acceptance &#x2014; if not the support &#x2014; of millions of ordinary Russians while the country&apos;s economic future is bargained to fuel its wartime present. Welfare payments have an outsized impact on Russian society precisely because they are so needed. Most Russians do not live in poverty, says Thomas F. Remington, a visiting professor of government at Harvard University. However, a high proportion hover just above it, struggling to get by. &quot;How we measure poverty always varies, but by reasonable measures, the share of people in poverty (in Russia) is not so great,&quot; Remington says. &quot;But the share of people who are near poverty, those who are just hovering close to the poverty line, living on meager, barely adequate wages or special income such as pensions, there&apos;s quite a high proportion.&quot; In these struggling communities, in particular, war-related payments can win acceptance for the full-scale invasion and the government itself. Using the welfare state to placate particular social groups is a well-worn tactic, says Sarah Wilson Sohkey, associate professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Colorado. Payments may not win a person&apos;s outright support for government policy, but it can make them less likely to protest.

(Olga Maltseva / AFP via Getty Images)Members of the Wagner group looked from a military vehicle in Rostov-on-Don, Russia, late on June 24, 2023. (Roman Romokhov / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;For example, what Putin has done &#x2014; very strategically &#x2014; is that every time there is a presidential election, he boosts pension payments. (Former Russian President Boris) Yeltsin did this, too, repeatedly. Those one-time bumps before every presidential election, very consistently, were really good in ensuring that pensioners would keep supporting them,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s not really buying people&apos;s loyalty, but more their acquiescence.&quot; Making one-off payments in a bid to encourage specific actions, such as joining the army, is also well-inscribed in the Kremlin playbook. In Russia, one-off payments have been made to encourage families to have more children &#x2014; a topic that Moscow has been keen to promote amid a plummeting birth rate. &quot;The welfare state has always been about manufacturing consent,&quot; says Dr. Amanda Zadorian, a visiting assistant professor of politics at Oberlin College. &quot;The kind of direct payments that we see (in Russia) incentivize a very specific behavior, whereas, for benefits like pensions payments, we haven&apos;t really seen increases.&quot; There is some risk that Russia is sowing the seeds of later discontent with generous war benefits. Welfare payments may be propping up Russia&apos;s economy, but they, too, come with a cost: investment in education or healthcare, for example, or support for vulnerable groups. Yet, while Russia&apos;s welfare system has been used to placate the population, its weakening or disintegration is unlikely to cause widespread unrest, says Wilson Sohkey. In many cases, it is the families that rely most on Russia&apos;s state services that are also benefiting from war payments &#x2014; and their focus is survival, rather than political policy. &quot;For Russians from poor rural areas, the money (that comes from joining the army) just means so much to them,&quot; says Wilson Sohkey. &quot;They&apos;re not sitting there with this meta-view of the education system not being very good. They&apos;re getting a big one-time payment that&apos;s sometimes vital for their family&apos;s survival.&quot; The Kremlin has also been able to face down previous protests on welfare issues. When Moscow decided to raise the state pension age in 2018, rallies took place in tens of towns and cities across Russia, already a rare show of defiance. But despite somewhat poor local election results that year, Moscow was still able to pass the reform without difficulty. The one-off nature of sign-on bonuses in particular makes them an easy win for the Kremlin, says Zadorian. Unlike pensions, which require a decades-long commitment, one-time bonuses put little pressure on the government itself, keeping expectations low and removing the threat of potentially unfulfilled promises that could boil into resentment. &quot;If people perceive that something might be being taken away from them, they respond more negatively than if they never had anything in the first place,&quot; says Zadorian. &quot;It&apos;s much easier to create this sense of entitlement.&quot; War-related payments are not only shaping Russia&apos;s social spending. They are also obscuring and accelerating potential economic pain. War benefits, as well as higher salaries for workers producing war-related goods, have acted as a buoyancy aid not only for struggling families, but the Russian economy as a whole. As soldiers&apos; families spend, their new-found wealth is spread throughout their communities, driving Russia&apos;s economy. This growth, however, is unlikely to be healthy or sustainable in years to come. Increased state spending is also driving a growing threat to Russia&apos;s economy: inflation. Prices rose 8.9% in November 2024 compared to the previous year, more than twice the state&apos;s 4% target. In a country where many families spend a large proportion of their income on food, state benefits have cushioned the blow for the most vulnerable. Yet, if inflation continues, it may no longer be enough. &quot;The crunch, if and when it comes, will have to do with high grocery prices. If Putin agrees to relax interest rates and we get into very high inflation and the devaluation of currency, I don&apos;t think that can last long,&quot; says Remington. &quot;That&apos;s when we get rationing; we get hoarding; we get shortages &#x2014; and we get real political protests.&quot; Pouring money, attention, and effort into the military also damages wider productivity, Remington says. While military innovation can be used to create real-world economic benefits for ordinary people, this is not an area where Russia has traditionally excelled. A military cadet stands in front of a billboard promoting contract army service in Saint Petersburg, Ukraine on Oct. 5, 2022. (Olga Maltseva / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;Russia, historically, has not been good at converting the technologies that it develops for the military into benefits for the overall economy. In the Soviet era, military technology was pretty good, but the benefits of it tended not to spill over. In particular, with the invasion of Ukraine, wider industry is now being starved of investment. When you&apos;re producing overwhelmingly for the war, you are not upgrading the level of technological effectiveness,&quot; Remington says. All of this ultimately forecasts trouble for the Russian economy&apos;s longer-term prospects. &quot;The economy is setting itself back a decade by devoting everything to the war. That means that the overall capacity of the economy to maintain a good standard of living for an aging population is diminishing,&quot; Remington says. &quot;They&apos;re consuming their future for the sake of their present.&quot; While some Russians may consider death a risk worth taking for a cash lump sum, it will never &#x2014; economically or otherwise &#x2014; equal a person&apos;s life. &quot;The sign-on bonus money does not replace the economic productivity of a person over the course of their lifetime,&quot; says Zadorian. &quot;In the long term, we&apos;re less likely to see that effect of payments stimulating local economies and more likely to see further dependence on the state.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-buys-acceptance-with-cash-plunging-economy-into-uncertainty/	2024-12-20T12:14:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2084805640.jpg
Several countries interested in deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine, Foreign Ministry says	Discussions regarding the potential deployment of Western peacekeepers in Ukraine are gaining traction, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said during a Dec. 20 briefing. This idea, initially proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron, has reportedly garnered interest from multiple countries. &#x201C;Indeed, in addition to France, there are several other countries that have expressed their readiness to take such a step,&#x201D; Tykhyi said. He reiterated President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s support for Macron&#x2019;s proposal, which the Ukrainian leader expressed during a Dec. 19 briefing in Brussels. Tykhyi emphasized that discussions are still general and lack specific details regarding deployment timing. Paris and London are exploring the deployment of French and U.K. troops to monitor a potential ceasefire along the contact line, a senior NATO official told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) in early December. The official, speaking anonymously, clarified that these discussions are taking place bilaterally in national capitals rather than within NATO structures. The concept of deploying Western troops to Ukraine resurfaced earlier this year. Macron first raised the possibility in February and revisited it in May, suggesting that France might consider sending troops if Russian forces breached Ukraine&#x2019;s front lines. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has also advocated for European troops to lead in monitoring a potential ceasefire, the Wall Street Journal reported on Dec. 12. He has repeatedly emphasized that Europe should take greater responsibility in addressing Russian aggression. Zelensky supported Macron&apos;s proposal but only after securing a clear timeline for NATO membership.	https://kyivindependent.com/several-countries-interested-in-deploying-peacekeepers-to-ukraine-foreign-ministry-says/	2024-12-20T12:07:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2166614075.jpg
Fico criticizes Zelensky over refusal to extend Russian gas transit, warns of crisis	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico warned of a looming gas crisis on Dec. 20 as Ukraine maintained its refusal to extend the transit agreement for Russian gas, set to expire on Dec. 31, Reuters reported. President Volodymyr Zelensky reaffirmed the refusal during a press conference on Dec. 19, saying that Kyiv would not enable Moscow to earn additional revenue while continuing its war. At a European Union summit, Fico criticized Ukraine&#x2019;s position, saying, &quot;We are demonstrably facing a gas crisis thanks to President Zelensky.&quot; He also suggested that Bratislava might consider &quot;reciprocal measures&quot; if Russian gas transit through Ukraine to Slovakia is halted. Slovakia has a long-term contract with Russia&apos;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom and estimates alternative arrangements could cost an additional &#x20AC;220 million ($228.73 million) in transit fees. The issue highlights ongoing dependence on Russian gas in several EU members, including Slovakia, Hungary, and Austria, despite efforts to diversify energy sources following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Earlier this year, the EU implemented its first sanctions targeting the Russian gas industry, focusing on liquefied natural gas (LNG). Russian President Vladimir Putin also addressed the matter during his annual press conference on Dec. 19, confirming the end of the contract and expressing confidence in Gazprom&apos;s resilience. &#x201C;This contract will no longer exist. Everything is clear. We will survive, Gazprom will survive,&#x201D; Putin said. Slovakia, which has a long-term contract with Russian oil giant Gazprom has been trying to keep receiving gas through Ukraine, saying buying elsewhere would cost 220 million euros ($228.73 million) more in transit expenses.	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-criticizes-zelensky-over-refusal-to-extend-russian-gas-transit-warns-of-crisis/	2024-12-20T10:55:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188638934.jpg
Ukraine charges Russian general with killing Reuters employee in Kramatorsk	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced on Dec. 20 that it had gathered evidence against Colonel General Alexei Kim, the Russian officer allegedly responsible for the Aug. 24 missile attack on the Sapfir Hotel in Kramatorsk, Donetsk Oblast. The strike killed Ryan Evans, a British security adviser for Reuters, and injured six others, including two Reuters journalists. Kim, a deputy chief of Russia&apos;s General Staff, signed the directive and issued the combat order for the Iskander-M ballistic missile strike, according to the SBU. The SBU said that Kim directed one of his missile units to target the hotel despite it being occupied solely by civilians. SBU investigators charged Kim in absentia under Ukraine&apos;s Criminal Code with waging a war of aggression and violating the laws and customs of war. The charges align with Ukraine&apos;s broader efforts to hold Russian military leaders accountable for targeting civilian infrastructure and committing war crimes. This development follows the Dec. 17 assassination of Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, head of Russia&apos;s radiation, chemical, and biological defense forces, in an alleged SBU operation in Moscow. Ukrainian prosecutors had previously charged Kirillov with deploying banned chemical weapons in the conflict.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-charges-russian-general-for-killing-reuters-staff-injuring-civilians-in-kramatorsk-hotel-attack/	2024-12-20T09:37:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/66cb5e663c9c0179865149.jpg
Belarus Weekly: EU imposes new sanctions on Belarusian officials, companies supporting regime	The EU imposes new sanctions on Belarusian officials and companies supporting the regime of Alexander Lukashenko. In response to Belarus and Russia&#x2019;s artificial migration crisis, the EU pledged 170 million euros for border security and backed Poland&#x2019;s plan to suspend the right to asylum. Belarus labels exiled National Theater actors as an &#x201C;extremist formation,&#x201D; criminalizing interactions with them for Belarusians inside the country. Minsk arrested seven ex-journalists of the closed newspaper as the pre-election crackdowns continued. EU announces a 30 million euro aid program for Belarusian civil society in 2025. The Council of the European Union on Dec. 16 imposed a fresh set of sanctions against 26 individuals and two companies in Belarus. According to the press release, the restrictions were introduced &#x201C;in view of the situation in the country.&#x201D; The new measures targeted members of the judiciary responsible for politically motivated persecution and the heads of penal facilities where political prisoners are held in &#x201C;inhumane conditions.&#x201D; Belarus has nearly 1,300 political prisoners, who were sentenced in the aftermath of nationwide protests in the wake of the sham 2020 presidential election. At least 2,200 former political prisoners have since been released after serving their full term, while over 50,000 individuals have been subjected to arbitrary detentions throughout the past four years, according to Viasna Human Rights Center. The list of sanctioned individuals also includes the business owners and board members of two companies that benefited from the regime of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko and were involved in sanctions circumvention. The new restrictions impose an asset freeze on the transportation and storage company, Vlate Logistik LLC, which operated two privately owned customs checkpoints at the Belarus-EU border, and Ruzekspeditsiya LLC, which has been facilitating EU sanctions circumvention by exporting sanctioned fertilizers and taking delivery of cars prohibited for sale to Belarus, which are subsequently supplied to Russia. &#xA0; Throughout his 30-year rule, Lukashenko has been repeatedly subjected to European sanctions due to his regime&#x2019;s human rights abuse, disappearances of political opponents, and the instrumentalization of migration. Since 2022, the EU, the United States, and other Western states have introduced sectoral and financial sanctions over Minsk&#x2019;s support for Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. Altogether, the restrictions apply to 287 individuals and 39 entities in Belarus. The European Commission has supported Poland&#x2019;s controversial plan to temporarily suspend the right to asylum for illegal immigrants if they are believed to have been &#x201C;weaponized&#x201D; by Belarus and Russia. The move allows Poland and other EU states to suspend the &#x201C;fundamental rights&#x201D; of migrants if it is suspected that Russia and Belarus organized their transport from their home countries to the EU&#x2019;s border, and facilitated their crossing. To further enhance border surveillance, the European Union pledged 170 million euros ($179 million) of funding to Poland, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Norway. The funds will go towards upgrading electronic surveillance equipment, deploying mobile detection and counter-drone equipment, and enhancing the mobility of border patrols. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced on Oct. 15 the adoption of the contentious plan to temporarily suspend the right to asylum of the waves of irregular migrants from third countries gathering on the country&#x2019;s eastern border and arriving via Belarus and Russia. Brussels accuses Belarus and Russia of the &#x201C;weaponization of migration,&#x201D; describing it as &#x201C;hybrid warfare&#x201D; designed to &#x201C;destabilize&#x201D; European societies, according to the Communication to Support Member States adopted on Dec. 11. Adopting the communication represents a change in the EU&#x2019;s approach to a more conservative stance in its migration policy. Following an initial pushback and demands that Poland implement the provisions of the bloc&#x2019;s migration pact, the EU&#x2019;s executive branch accepted the possibility and outlined the conditions for the suspension of the right to asylum. Despite a subsequent outcry from human rights organizations demanding that the right to asylum in Europe be upheld, the EU Commission decided that the suspension of fundamental rights is possible, although it has to be &#x201C;proportionate, limited to what is strictly necessary in clearly defined cases, and temporary.&#x201D; Minsk began sending migrants to the EU&#x2019;s borders in the summer of 2021, responding to European sanctions introduced over the human rights abuse after the rigged 2020 Belarusian presidential elections and the forced landing of a European commercial flight in Minsk. One of Lukashenko&#x2019;s political opponents on board the plane was arrested, jailed, and has subsequently been used as a regime propaganda mouthpiece. Following an initial abatement of the crisis in 2021, since 2023 the number of illegal arrivals has risen by 66%. Brussels believes Russia is facilitating the renewed hybrid attacks, as 90% of the migrants illegally crossing the Polish-Belarusian border have a Russian student or tourist visa. Poland has stopped 26,000 illicit border crossing attempts in 2024 alone, according to the country&#x2019;s Defense Ministry. Continuous crossing attempts by migrants prompted Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania to build walls along their borders with Belarus. The Belarusian Internal Affairs Ministry has declared former actors of the Belarusian National Theater to be members of an &#x201C;extremist formation,&#x201D; Russian state-run news outlet Sputnik has reported. Over 60 employees of Yanka Kupala National Academic Theater in Minsk resigned from the theater in protest following the rigged 2020 presidential elections, which Lukashenko claimed to have won by a landslide. In exile, the former actors launched a theater group called &#x201C;Volnya Kupalaucy,&#x201D; touring Europe and broadcasting their work on YouTube. Belarus&#x2019;s law enforcers accused the exiled theater group of allegedly &#x201C;preparing to commit attacks on Belarus&#x2019;s sovereignty&#x201D; and &#x201C;discrediting state officials.&#x201D; They banned the group from the Belarusian segment of the Internet. Participation in the group or &#x201C;communicating information&#x201D; to its representatives is now punishable with up to seven years of imprisonment, according to Belarusian law. The group&#x2019;s designation as an &#x201C;extremist formation&#x201D; serves as a confirmation that &#x201C;Belarusian culture is a threat to the regime,&#x201D; the former theater&#x2019;s director and current opposition figure Pavel Latushka told independent Belarusian news outlet Pozirk. In 2020, after the Culture Ministry fired Latushka from his position as a theater director for supporting the movement, sixty employees resigned, leaving the theater idle for nearly three months. Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime has frequently wielded its anti-extremism legislation against expressions of dissent. According to Viasna, at least 4,766 Belarusians are currently recognized as &#x201C;extremists,&#x201D; and countless media outlets and communities of Belarusians abroad have been slapped with the &#x201C;extremist formation&#x201D; label, criminalizing interactions with them for Belarusians within the country. &#xA0; Belarusian authorities have arrested seven former journalists of the regional newspaper Intex Press, the Viasna Human Rights Center reported on Dec. 12. The arrest of the journalists comes amid sweeping raids against opponents of the regime ahead of the January 2025 presidential elections. The first presidential vote since the contested 2020 race &#x2014; which sent the country into a lasting political crisis &#x2014; is set to extend Lukashenko&#x2019;s three-decade rule of the country, which began when he was elected president in 1994. The raids in the western city of Baranavichy targeted seven former employees of the Intex Press, the largest regional newspaper in Belarus. They were accused of &#x201C;facilitating extremist activities.&#x201D; Charges of &#x201C;extremism&#x201D; are frequently brought against independent media in Belarus to obstruct their work, the independent Belarusian Association of Journalists (BAJ) notes in a statement on the arrests. It called for a halt to the &#x201C;witch hunt&#x201D; against journalists. The independent association, which defends media freedoms in Belarus, has also been given an &#x201C;extremist&#x201D; status by the Lukashenko regime. The detentions in Baranavichy brought the total count of jailed journalists to 45, the BAJ reports. &#x201C;Journalists, even after the closure of their publications, continue to face threats and harassment, which hampers their work and creates a climate of fear,&#x201D; said the Brest regional branch of Viasna. Intex Press&#x2019;s print run was terminated in 2021 following the publication of an interview with Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who claimed to have beaten Lukashenko on the ballot in the 2020 presidential elections. Government-run firms refused to print and disseminate the newspaper. The Information Ministry terminated the newspaper&#x2019;s license the following year. &#xA0; The newspaper&#x2019;s online publications were designated extremist in April 2023 and its website was blocked. The international media freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders ranked Belarus fourth among the world&#x2019;s biggest journalist jailers in 2024, along with China, Myanmar, and Israel. The country ranks 167 out of 180 in the annual Press Freedom Index, having dropped ten places since 2023. The European Commission has announced 30 million euros ($31.5 million) in funding for Belarusian civil society in 2025. The EU Commissioner for Enlargement, Marta Kos, announced the funding during a meeting with Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya on Dec. 12. The EU4People of Belarus program will support independent media and civil society actors advocating for democracy in Belarus, and support education, culture, and small and medium enterprises in exile. The announcement coincided with the holding in Brussels of Belarus Days &#x2013; a series of events held between Dec. 9-13. Organized by the European External Action Service, European Commission, and European Parliament, the events brought together 150 Belarusian activists with European officials ahead of the 2025 presidential elections in Belarus in which no independent candidates were allowed to participate. In meetings with European Parliament President Roberta Metsola and EU High Representative Kaja Kallas, Tsikhanouskaya emphasized that the upcoming elections were a &#x201C;sham.&#x201D; She advocated the non-recognition of its results by EU member states, and pressuring the Lukashenko regime with more sanctions. Discussions also included the topic of regional security with EU Commissioner for Defense Andrius Kubilius. In addition, Minister-President of Flanders Matthias Diependaele promised an additional 100,000 euros to be allocated for media support. Since the widely disputed 2020 elections, the European Union has mobilized 170 million ($179 million) euros in support for the Belarusian people and pledged 3 billion euros in economic aid, contingent on a democratic transition in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-eu-imposes-new-sanctions-on-belarusian-officials-companies-supporting-regime/	2024-12-20T08:52:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187888765.jpg
Russia keeps key interest rate at 21%, defying expert expectations	Russia&apos;s Central Bank decided on Dec. 20 to keep its benchmark interest rate steady at 21%, contrary to expert expectations of an increase, Russia&#x2019;s state-owned TASS news agency reported. To rein in accelerating inflation fueled by war spending, Russia&apos;s Central Bank has been raising its interest rate from 7.5 percent in July 2023 to the current 21% - the highest level since the early 2000s. The tight monetary policy of Elvira Naniullina, the Central Bank&apos;s chief, has drawn criticism from businesses in Russia&apos;s military-industrial complex. On Dec. 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin also mentioned the problem, saying that some experts believe that the central bank should have started using tools other than rate hikes to fight inflation. Most analysts, including those polled by Russian media outlet RBC, anticipated a hike of 200 basis points to 23%. Ahead of the decision, major Russian banks raised savings deposit yields to 24-25% per annum, reflecting expectations of tighter monetary policy. The Central Bank said that, based on inflation and credit trends, the feasibility of raising the rate further would be assessed at its next meeting. Nabiullina has been involved in a conflict over rate hikes with Sergei Chemezov, the influential CEO of the state-owned defense giant Rostec. &quot;If we continue working this way, most enterprises will essentially go bankrupt,&quot; Chemezov said in October, commenting on increases in the Central Bank&apos;s rate. Former economic advisor and opposition politician Vladimir Milov told the Kyiv Independent in November that both sides have valid concerns. &quot;Chemezov is right that businesses will have to shut down at such a (high interest) rate,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent, &quot;Nabiullina is right that the rate cannot be cut because in that case there will be hyperinflation like in Turkey.&quot; He continued that &quot;there is only one way out &#x2014; finish the war and withdraw Russian troops&quot; from Ukraine. The balance between controlling inflation and maintaining economic stability remains a critical challenge for Russia&#x2019;s Central Bank, as the war economy continues to strain the nation&apos;s financial system.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-keeps-key-interest-rate-at-21-defying-expert-expectations/	2024-12-20T08:31:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1831274509.jpg
Watchdog urges Zelensky to halt media intimidation, ensure press freedom	The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) called on President Volodymyr Zelensky on Dec. 19 to ensure press freedom in Ukraine and hold accountable those who intimidate journalists. This follows growing concerns about government actions that reportedly obstruct the work of media outlets, including online newspaper Ukrainska Pravda. In a letter, the CPJ highlighted a troubling pattern of restrictions over the past year, saying they &quot;curtail the operations of a free press&quot; and undermine Ukraine&#x2019;s democratic values. The organization also criticized a proposed bill in the Verkhovna Rada that could impose harsher criminal penalties for publishing information from public databases during martial law, saying that it threatens investigative journalism. The CPJ urged Zelensky to take immediate steps to protect media independence and address these issues, emphasizing that such actions are crucial for maintaining Ukraine&#x2019;s international standing. &quot;Any pressure on journalists is unacceptable,&quot; the letter said, calling for a commitment to ensure a free and safe environment for the press in Ukraine. The CPJ&#x2019;s appeal comes after Ukrainska Pravda accused Ukraine&apos;s President&apos;s Office in October of systematic attempts to influence its editorial policy. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) raised similar concerns earlier this year, reporting a decline in press freedom and increased state pressure on media autonomy, even as Ukraine rose slightly in RSF&#x2019;s annual press freedom index. Media watchdogs have expressed concerns that investigative journalists continue to face harassment and surveillance years after incidents that drew public and international condemnation.	https://kyivindependent.com/watchdog-urges-zelensky-to-halt-media-intimidation-ensure-press-freedom/	2024-12-20T07:13:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1247453296.jpg
Zaluzhnyi releases book 'My War,' first in planned trilogy	Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., released an autobiographical book titled &quot;My War,&quot; the first part of a planned trilogy, he announced on Dec. 20. The first part covers Zaluzhnyi&apos;s life from his childhood until the outbreak of the full-scale war. Zaluzhnyi started writing the book in March 2023 before he was replaced as commander-in-chief by General Oleksandr Syrskyi this February. Zaluzhnyi&apos;s wife edited the copy. &quot;This is a storybook for young people, to whom I want to convey an important truth: everything is possible in life if you really want it. Dream and follow your dreams,&quot; Zaluzhnyi said. &quot;This book is about my war. First, the war with my own fears that prevent me from doing anything. Second, the war with people who prevent you from achieving your goals. And finally, the war against circumstances that become obstacles in life,&quot; he added. Zaluzhnyi is widely popular with both the military and the broader population due to his role in leading the resistance against Russia. According to a recent survey by the Future Research Foundation, Zaluzhnyi tops the list of trusted Ukrainians with 70.9%, leaving behind Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The other two books by Zaluzhnyi will be called &quot;Our War&quot; and &quot;Their War,&quot; the Babel media outlet reported in October, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. The date of their release is unknown. Sources claimed that the trilogy does not mark the start of the ex-commander political career.	https://kyivindependent.com/zaluzhnyi-releases-my-war-book-first-in-trilogy/	2024-12-20T06:11:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2162425886.jpg
Ukraine begins receiving first funds covered by frozen Russian assets proceeds	Ukraine is already receiving U.S. funds under the framework of the G7&apos;s $50 billion loan covered by profits from frozen Russian assets, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Dec 20. The World Bank&apos;s Board of Directors on Dec. 18 approved $2.05 billion in Development Policy Operation (DPO) grants, which is part of the U.S.&apos;s $20 billion contribution to the G7 loan. The DPO funds are co-financed by two sources: $1 billion from the Facilitation of Resources to Invest in Strengthening Ukraine Financial Intermediary Fund (F.O.R.T.I.S. Ukraine FIF) and $1.05 billion from the Advancing Needed Credit Enhancement (ADVANCE) Ukraine Trust Fund, supported by the U.K. and Japan. &quot;We are grateful to our partners for their support on the path of economic development and reconstruction,&quot; Shmyhal said on Telegram. The DPO funds will focus on Ukraine&apos;s growth potential, supporting the railway sector, banking, and renewable energy generation, the World Bank said. Funding will also support efforts to increase domestic revenues. The EU said it would begin paying its portion of the G7 loan &#x2014; 18.1 billion euros ($18.8 billion) &#x2014; in January.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-begins-receiving-first-funds-covered-by-frozen-russian-assets-proceeds/	2024-12-20T05:50:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-2038537930.jpg
Russian missile attack damages 6 foreign embassies in Kyiv, Foreign Ministry says	A Russian missile attack on Kyiv damaged a number of foreign embassies on Dec. 20, Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi said at a briefing. The embassies of Albania, Argentina, Palestine, North Macedonia, Portugal, and Montenegro are located in a building heavily damaged by the Russian strike. Russia launched a series of missile attacks against Kyiv earlier in the morning, killing one person, injuring 12, and causing damage across the city, local authorities reported. The capital was attacked with five ballistic missiles of the Iskander-M or the North Korean KN-23 model, all of which were shot down, the Air Force claimed.

Once Ukraine wins, the Kremlin will pay for all lost lives and damage,&quot; the Czech Foreign Ministry said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-damages-embassies/	2024-12-20T05:27:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/--------------2024-12-20-151509.png
Ukraine launched ATACMS, Storm Shadow against Russian chemical plant on Dec. 18, Moscow claims	Ukraine attacked the Rostov Oblast&apos;s Kamensky Combine, one of the largest chemical plants in Russia, with six U.S.-made ATACMS and four British Storm Shadow missiles on Dec. 18, Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Dec. 20. In a later statement, the ministry claimed that its forces intercepted the six ATACMS and three of the four Storm Shadow missiles without commenting on the consequences of the attack. The claims could not be independently verified. The U.S. and the U.K. eased their restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of long-range missiles in November, with ATACMS and Storm Shadow strikes previously reported in two regions bordering Ukraine &#x2014; the Kursk and Bryansk oblasts. Yury Slyusar, the acting governor of Rostov Oblast, which also borders Ukraine, said on Dec. 18 that Russian air defense forces shot down 10 missiles over the region, adding that a residential building was damaged by fallen debris. Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s counter-disinformation center, said the time that the Kamensky Combine was hit in the attack. The Kamensky Combine &quot;is engaged in the production of rocket fuel, specializing in the manufacture of solid fuel components for rocket engines, in particular for multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) and intercontinental ballistic missiles using solid fuel,&quot; Kovalenko said on Telegram. The facility has been sanctioned by the EU, U.K., and U.S. for its role in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry further said that its Dec. 20 missile attack against Kyiv was a &quot;response&quot; to the strike against the chemical plant, claiming to target a Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) command center and a missile manufacturing plant. &quot;The goals have been achieved. All targets have been hit,&quot; the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. Ukraine said that all five ballistic missiles were intercepted over Kyiv, with fallen debris damaging residential and administrative buildings. One person was reported killed and 12 injured. Moscow has, on several occasions, presented its strikes against Ukrainian cities as &quot;retribution&quot; for Ukraine&apos;s actions, even though Russian forces have launched similar attacks throughout the full-scale war regardless of other developments.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-launched-atacms-on-rostov-oblast-chemical-plant-on-dec-18-moscow-claims/	2024-12-20T05:03:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2186337269--1-.jpg
Biden administration to announce its final $1.2 billion Ukraine aid package under USAI, Reuters reports	The Biden administration is planning to announce in the coming days its final aid package under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) worth around $1.2 billion, Reuters reported on Dec. 20, citing unnamed sources. The U.S. provided more than $60 billion in military aid to Ukraine under the Biden administration. The USAI is a Pentagon-led program that supplies arms to Ukraine through contracts with U.S. defense companies. The package is expected to include air defense interceptors and artillery ammunition, one of the sources told Reuters. Separately, the U.S. is also providing assistance to Kyiv through the presidential drawdown authority (PDA), under which Washington supplies Ukraine with military equipment from existing U.S. military stockpiles. It is not immediately clear whether the Biden administration plans to announce further aid packages under the PDA. The New York Times (NYT) reported on Dec. 17 that the U.S. may run out of time to deliver the remaining $5.6 billion in military aid allocated to Ukraine under the PDA before Donald Trump takes office next month. Trump&#x2019;s support for Ukraine hangs in the air as analysts and politicians try to gauge his plans to bring peace to Ukraine, as he promised to end the war within &quot;24 hours&quot; after reelection without revealing details.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-announce-final-package-of-new-arms-for-ukraine-in-coming-days/	2024-12-20T04:19:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173586535.jpg
Lithuania's new PM, ministerial cabinet visit Kyiv	Lithuania&apos;s new ministerial cabinet arrived in Kyiv on Dec. 20, Lithuanian Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas said on X mere hours after Russia&apos;s missile attack against the capital. &quot;It is a privilege &amp; honor to be in Kyiv for my first visit as Prime Minister of Lithuania,&quot; Paluckas said, signalling continuation of Vilnius&apos;s decisively pro-Ukrainian stance. Lithuania has been a staunch supporter of Kyiv&apos;s struggle against Russian aggression, committing 0.25% of its GDP in future yearly military support for Ukraine. &quot;At Kyiv&#x2019;s Wall of Remembrance, with my Cabinet of Ministers, I paid my respects to the fallen heroes of Ukraine, men and women who sacrificed their lives for the freedom of their country, and by that &#x2013; for the freedom of Europe,&quot; Paluckas added. Paluckas took office on Dec. 12 after his Social Democratic Party (LSDP) won the October elections, replacing Ingrida Simonyte.

Bulgaria's parliament no longer supports signing Ukraine security deal	The Bulgarian parliament does not have enough votes to support the signing of Bulgaria&apos;s bilateral security treaty with Ukraine due to a shift in stance from the strongest party, Euractiv reported on Dec. 20. Former Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, head of the conservative-populist Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) party, suggested that the treaty is no longer beneficial amid expectations of peace talks. Debates about a potential ceasefire deal are coming into focus as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump pledged to push Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table while Ukrainian officials signaled openness to a diplomatic resolution. Dimitar Glavchev, the prime minister of Bulgaria&apos;s caretaker government, was expected to sign the deal with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Brussels on Dec. 19. Glavchev unexpectedly backed out of signing the document, saying he needed to seek approval of the parliament first. Kyiv has already penned 25 bilateral security agreements with international partners based on a pledge made by the G7 last July. Bulgaria is one of the few EU countries that are yet to sign such a deal with Ukraine, alongside Hungary, Austria, Slovakia, Malta, and Cyprus. &quot;Six months ago, we would have categorically supported such an agreement,&quot; said Borissov, whose party has supported Ukraine but now joined pro-Russian parties in opposition to the deal. Borissov pointed not only to the ongoing discussions about peace in the international arena but also to internal political reasons, saying that such a deal should be signed by an elected government rather than the caretaker cabinet. Glavchev conceded on Dec. 19 that he would not be signing the document amid the parliamentary opposition and would leave the step to the elected cabinet, the Sofia Globe reported. Borissov did not rule out supporting a bilateral security agreement signed by the next government if &quot;mutually beneficial&quot; to Sofia and Kyiv. The Glavchev cabinet will serve until a new government is appointed following the October elections, in which Borissov&apos;s GERB won 25.52% of the vote, the strongest result. Bulgaria has provided Ukraine with a variety of aid since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, but the matter has been contentious due to significant pro-Russian sentiment in the country and opposition from President Rumen Radev.	https://kyivindependent.com/bulgaria-parliament-doesnt-support-signing-ukraine-security-deal/	2024-12-20T03:29:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1228840330--1-.jpg
Ukraine retrieves bodies of 503 fallen soldiers	Ukraine has repatriated the bodies of 503 soldiers who died fighting against Russia, the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of the Prisoners of War reported on Dec. 20. The Geneva Conventions stipulate that those who lose their lives during war are entitled to a dignified burial. As of early March, Ukraine has identified more than 2,800 bodies and body remains of fallen soldiers, according to Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets. The bodies of 403 soldiers were recovered from Donetsk Oblast, while 57 and 12 bodies were brought back from Zaporizhzhia and Luhansk oblasts, respectively. Another 31 bodies were repatriated from morgues in Russia. &quot;Law enforcement officials and forensic experts will identify the victims as soon as possible,&quot; the headquarters wrote in a post on Telegram. The operation to recover the fallen soldiers involved several government and military agencies, including the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the Interior Ministry, the State Emergency Service, and the Armed Forces. The headquarters also thanked the International Committee of the Red Cross for its assistance. In early December, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that about 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed during the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-retrieves-bodies-of-503-fallen-soldiers/	2024-12-20T03:19:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2161908116.jpg
Russia's GRU possibly behind cyberattack on Ukraine's government, SBU says	Hackers of Russia&apos;s military intelligence agency (GRU) could be behind a cyberattack on Ukraine&apos;s government services, Volodymyr Karasteliov, the acting cybersecurity chief of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), said at a press conference on Dec. 20. In the largest cyberattack in recent months, several government services were targeted on Dec. 19, including state registers the Justice Ministry oversees, Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said. Officials say that the cyberattack had been prepared for several months, without providing further details. Ukraine launched a criminal investigation. Stefanishyna did not specify which registers had been targeted. Later at a press conference, she said the cyberattack did not affect other state information systems. All state registers are currently suspended. &quot;All the Justice Ministry&apos;s data has been saved. Recovery is underway. Registers and all data will be restored. It is a matter of time,&quot; Stefanishyna added. Karasteliov said that the SBU could not yet rule out the possibility of a data leak. Russia has regularly targeted Ukrainian companies and government institutions with cyberattacks since the onset of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In August, a massive Russian cyberattack targeted Monobank, one of Ukraine&apos;s largest banks.	https://kyivindependent.com/gru-may-be-behind-cyberattack-on-ukraine/	2024-12-20T03:18:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-857697192.jpg
Russian missiles strike Kyiv on the eve of holiday season (Photos)	Russia launched five ballistic missiles against Ukraine&apos;s capital on the morning of Dec. 20, highlighting the stark contrast between the approaching holiday season and the realities of war. Though Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported that all projectiles were downed, missile debris fell in at least four of Kyiv&#x2019;s districts, starting fires across the city. At least one person was killed, and 11 injured as first responders continue to deal with the consequences of the attack. The Holosiivskyi district, south of the city center, was hit the hardest by the ballistic missile debris. Residential buildings, office buildings, and a hotel were damaged, with burning debris dropping on the streets and the roofs. Damage to critical infrastructure left 630 residential buildings, 16 medical facilities, 17 schools, and 13 kindergartens without heating amid December temperatures. Non-residential buildings in the Solomianskyi and Shevchenkivskyi districts were also damaged by fallen debris. In the Pechersk district, a blast wave shattered precious stained glass windows of the St. Nicholas Roman Catholic church, the second-oldest Catholic church in Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missiles-strike-kyiv-on-the-eve-of-holiday-season/	2024-12-20T03:08:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190102415.jpg

Russia captures 'Uspenivka pocket,' Ukraine denies reports of failed breakout	Ukrainian forces withdrew from the area of the Uspenivka and Trudove settlements in Donetsk Oblast after &quot;heavy defensive battles,&quot; the Khortytsia group of forces said on Dec. 20. The statement came in reaction to the DeepState monitoring group claiming that some troops did not manage to pull back after Russia captured the two settlements, completing the capture of the so-called Uspenivka pocket. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry announced the capture of Uspenivka on Dec. 20. Analysts have been long warning that the Russian advance threatens to encircle Ukrainian troops in the area. The sector lies roughly 8 kilometers (5 miles) south of the embattled front-line town of Kurakhove. &quot;Commander-in-Chief (Oleksandr Syrskyi) decided to withdraw Defense Forces units from the said area to avoid encirclement,&quot; the Khortytsia group of forces said, refuting claims about stranded soldiers. &quot;The units, which have been fighting heavy defensive battles against a superior force for a long time, carried out necessary maneuvers to avoid encirclement and continue performing tasks on the Kurakhove-Konstantynopolske axis.&quot; According to DeepState, Russia is regrouping in the newly captured area and attacking in the direction of the Shevchenko-Andriivka section, threatening to create a new pocket. Russian forces are now focusing their efforts on the nearby town of Andriivka. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Throughout the autumn, Russian forces have made operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, particularly near Toretsk, Chasiv Yar, and Kupiansk, while advancing on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast. Syrskyi said on Dec. 19 that Russian forces are carrying out simultaneous attacks along the front line, claiming that &quot;Ukrainian defense forces did not allow Russian forces to breach the defense and achieve operational success in any direction.&quot; Ukraine is increasingly on the back foot of the war as its resources grow thin, and the prospects of vitally important Western aid remain uncertain following the U.S. election victory of Donald Trump. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-reportedly-captures-uspenivka/	2024-12-20T01:52:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187899885.jpg
Russian An-72 military transport plane damaged in blast near Moscow, Ukraine's intel claims	A power unit of a Russian An-72 military transport plane blew up at the Ostafyevo airfield in Moscow Oblast last week, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Dec. 20. The Russian Navy plane&apos;s main power unit exploded on Dec. 12, the military intelligence agency said without providing details on the cause or circumstances of the explosion. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The An-72 is a Soviet transport aircraft, developed by Antonov, Ukraine&apos;s largest aircraft manufacturing company. The plane is used mainly by the military and has an estimated price tag of around $4.5 million. HUR shared footage of the explosion without explicitly claiming responsibility for the incident. The Ostafyevo airfield is located over 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s border. 0:00/1&#xD7;The footage purporting to show an explosion at the Ostafyevo airfield in Moscow Oblast on Dec. 12, 2024. (Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence)&quot;There will be just retribution for every war crime committed against the people of Ukraine,&quot; the agency said. Previously, Ukraine claimed responsibility for several aircraft sabotage operations inside Russia. In July, a HUR-coordinated operation resulted in damage to three Mi-28 and Ka-226 helicopters on the territory of the Moscow-based National Center of Helicopter Construction of Mil and Kamov, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent at the time. Another operation the same month reportedly led to the destruction of a Mi-8 helicopter at the Samara Kryazh military airfield in Samara Oblast, roughly 800 kilometers (500 miles) from the Ukrainian border.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-an-72-plane-blows-up-near-moscow/	2024-12-20T01:05:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Russian_Air_Force_-_Antonov_An-72.jpg
Orban to reportedly block EU's Russia sanctions extension until Trump takes office	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban told EU leaders he plans to wait until U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office before deciding on an extension of the bloc&apos;s sanctions against Russia, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 19, citing undisclosed sources. The EU sanctions must be extended by unanimous vote every six months, with the deadline for the next extension set at the end of January. The bloc imposed its 15th package of sanctions earlier this week, targeting Russia&apos;s shadow fleet and defense industry. Trump, Orban&apos;s ally who received the Hungarian prime minister at his Florida residence on Dec. 9, will be inaugurated on Jan. 20 after winning the November presidential election. Orban &quot;surprised&quot; his fellow EU leaders by deciding to block the extension during a summit in Brussels on Dec. 19 in what is considered a &quot;routine&quot; step, Bloomberg wrote. Talking to journalists, the Hungarian prime minister warned Europe against doing &quot;anything that would go against this future transatlantic relationship.&quot; Hungary&apos;s leader has consistently obstructed and delayed sanctions against Russia and military support for Kyiv. He has also lauded Trump&apos;s reelection, expressing expectations of a quick end to the war. Trump&apos;s imminent return to the White House is causing concern in Kyiv and Europe, as the U.S. president-elect hinted at reducing support for Ukraine and pledged to get his country &quot;out&quot; &#xA0;of the war. The soon-to-be U.S. leader is expected to push European partners to take up greater responsibility for ensuring peace and security in Ukraine. This shift comes amid political instability in France and Germany and Russia&apos;s steady advances on the battlefield in Ukraine&apos;s east.	https://kyivindependent.com/orban-to-reportedly-block-eus-russia-sanctions-extension-until-trump-takes-office/	2024-12-19T23:51:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190744266.jpg
Ukraine intercepts Russian sabotage groups attempting to push toward Kherson	Ukrainian soldiers repelled Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups as they were attempting to advance towards the city of Kherson overnight on Dec. 20, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. The reports come amid an anticipated large-scale Russian advance in Kherson Oblast. In early December, Russian troops were carrying out assaults in the southern region to gain a foothold on islands in the Dnipro River delta. Prokudin said earlier that Moscow has assembled &quot;300 boats to cross the river.&quot; Russian forces launched a massive aerial attack on Kherson and its outskirts from the occupied part of Kherson Oblast overnight on Dec. 20, targeting residential areas and critical infrastructure. One person was killed, and at least nine others were injured, according to the local authorities. Kherson and other regional settlements west of the Dnipro River have been subjected to near-daily Russian strikes since Ukraine liberated the area in November 2022 and Russian troops were pushed to the east of the river. Russian troops have intensified ground attacks in several areas along the front line over the past few days but failed to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense lines, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 19. Moscow&apos;s forces keep on advancing in Donetsk Oblast in an attempt to occupy the key towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. Ukraine has also been building heavy fortifications near the southern city of Zaporizhzhia in preparations for a potential Russian offensive in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-intercepts-russian-sabotage-groups-attempting-to-push-towards-kherson/	2024-12-19T23:10:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2186798554.jpg
Russian cyberattack targets Ukrainian government services	Russia conducted a cyberattack on Ukraine&apos;s government services on Dec. 19, Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said in a statement. In the largest cyberattack in recent months, several government services were targeted, including state registers the Justice Ministry oversees. Russia has regularly targeted Ukrainian companies and government institutions with cyberattacks since the onset of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In August, a massive Russian cyberattack targeted Monobank, one of Ukraine&apos;s largest banks. &quot;We are coordinating work on countering cyberattacks and restoring systems. It&apos;s already clear that the attack was made by Russia to disrupt the work of critically important infrastructure,&quot; Stefanishyna said on Dec. 19. &quot;(Russia)... is trying to use this situation... to sow panic among citizens of Ukraine and abroad,&quot; she said, adding that it will take up to two weeks for impacted government services to resume operation. In October, Microsoft warned that Russian hackers were targeting U.S. government officials. Cyberattacks and phishing emails are a part of Russia&apos;s hybrid war against the West over its support of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-cyberattack-targets-ukrainian-government/	2024-12-19T22:25:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-615824148.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 770,420 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 770,420 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 20. This number includes 2,200 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,584 tanks, 19,823 armored fighting vehicles, 31,793 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,220 artillery systems, 1,256 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,027 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 20,600 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-770-420-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-12-19T22:15:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1759371571.jpg
Russian losses exceed 750,000 troops, expected to surpass 1 million within 6 months, UK estimates	Russian military losses in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine have exceeded 750,000 Russian soldiers, and are expected to surpass 1 million Russian troops within six months, U.K. Under-Secretary of Defense Luke Pollard said on Dec. 19. The U.K.&apos;s latest estimate are in line with figures from Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, which, as of Dec. 19, sits at 768,220 troops lost since the start of the war. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. &quot;It is highly likely that they have sustained significant combat casualties, whilst only achieving limited tactical gains,&quot; Pollard told British parliamentarians on Dec. 19. Russia has gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast in recent months but at the cost of heavy casualties. Russian losses reached record highs in November and December, with a daily high of 2,030 troops lost in November, marking the highest daily loss since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Russian losses exceeded 45,000 troops and $3 billion worth of equipment in November. Ukrainian authorities reported 700,000 Russian losses on Nov. 4, less than three months after they announced 600,000 Russian casualties Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures, though a Defense Ministry official recently let slip that the department received 48,000 requests to identify missing soldiers. According to joint investigation by BBC Russia and Mediazona, a Russian independent media outlet, published on Dec. 6, journalists have identified the names of 82,050 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed in a rare statement that Ukraine had lost 43,000 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. In an attempt to mitigate casualties among Russian citizens, Moscow has also made an effort to recruit foreigners into their army. Russia has cooperated with North Korea, with Pyongyang reportedly dispatching 10,000-12,000 soldiers to assist Russia with its war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-losses-to-surpass-1-million-in-months-exceed-750-000-uk-estimates/	2024-12-19T22:12:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/kch-0879-1663360221jewat.jpg
Explosions reported in Kyiv amid Russian missile attack	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched a series of missile attacks towards Kyiv on the morning of Dec. 20. Multiple explosions were reported in Kyiv around 7 a.m. local time, according to Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that air defenses were operating over the city. Klitschko also reported that multiple cars were on fire in the Holosiivskyi district of the city due to the falling debris from a missile. Emergency crews are currently heading towards the scene. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force warned immediately prior that a MiG-31 Russian fighter jet, capable of firing Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, had taken off from a Russian air base. No additional information was immediately available as to any damage or casualties caused by the missile attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/explosions-reported-in-kyiv-amid-russian-missile-attack/	2024-12-19T21:25:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1796953252.jpg
Ukraine must decide between 'carrying on the fight or looking to negotiate ceasefire,' Blinken says	In a wide ranging interview with MSNBC on Dec. 19, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke about the prospects for a potential ceasefire in Ukraine, as well as support for the embattled country ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump in January. &quot;I want to make sure that we&#x2019;re giving the incoming administration and the Ukrainians the strongest possible hand to play going into 2025,&quot; Blinken said in an interview on MSNBC Morning Joe. &quot;Ukrainians have to make fundamental decisions about carrying on the fight or looking to negotiate and try to bring this to a ceasefire. The fundamental question is whether Russia is prepared to do that and to do that in good faith.&quot; &quot;If it moves to that, we want to make sure that the Ukrainians and the Trump administration have the best hand to play to cut the strongest possible deal. And that means trying to reinforce Ukraine&#x2019;s position on the battlefield,&quot; Blinken added. The outgoing official&apos;s comments come as Trump has pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Russia&apos;s war and negotiate a quick peace deal. Ukrainian officials have urged the president-elect to maintain support and adopt a &quot;peace through strength&quot; approach in dealings with Russia The Wall Street Journal reported on Dec. 12, citing undisclosed official sources, that Trump wants European troops to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump reportedly made the comments during his Dec. 7 meeting with Zelensky and French President Macron in Paris. &quot;If this gets to a place where there is a ceasefire, and it&#x2019;s a ceasefire that&#x2019;s on just and durable terms, that would be a good thing. But for it to be durable, there has to be some kind of assurance that Russia is not simply going to rest, refit, and reattack,&quot; Blinken added during the interview. During a visit to Brussels to meet with European leaders on Dec. 19, President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected the idea of freezing the conflict without effective security guarantees, adding that doing so would &quot;buy time&quot; for Russia to regroup ahead of another attack. On Dec. 18, Zelensky said he was &quot;discussing ideas with European leaders&quot; on the potential deployment of European peacekeeping forces to the embattled country. On Dec. 13, Andriy Yermak, head of the Presidential Office, said that Kyiv is not prepared to enter negotiations with Russia as it lacks sufficient Western support to engage from a position of strength.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-must-decide-between-carrying-on-the-fight-or-looking-to-negotiate-ceasefire-blinken-says/	2024-12-19T20:06:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170662132.jpg
5 injured in Russian attack on residential building in Kryvyi Rih	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Russian missile struck a two-story residential building in the city of Kryvyi Rih overnight on Dec. 19, injuring five people, including a child. A 15-year old girl and a man have been found and rescued from under the rubble. The windows of a nearby 10-story building were shattered, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor Serhii Lysak said in a post to social media. Three other people between the ages of 38 and 82 were also injured, the head of military administration in Kryvyi Rih, Oleksandr Vilkul confirmed on Dec. 20. All of the injured are in moderate condition. Kryvyi Rih was previously attacked about a day earlier in a blitz that targeted several cities across Ukraine, killing one and injuring eight. Air attacks against Ukrainian cities are a regular occurrence, with Russia targeting residential buildings and civilian infrastructure, including critical energy infrastructure. Ukraine has struggled to maintain its air defenses against the high numbers of drones and missiles Russia launches. President Volodymyr Zelensky appealed to Western allies during meetings with European leaders in Brussels on Dec. 18, requesting an additional 19 air defense systems to protect critical infrastructure. Denmark pledged $292 million to bolster Ukraine&apos;s air defenses on Dec. 19 as Russian attacks continue.	https://kyivindependent.com/kryvyi-rih-residential-building-hit-in-russian-rocket-attack-victims-excavated/	2024-12-19T18:43:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-19_18-53-29.jpg
5 killed, 7 injured in fire at detention facility housing war deserters in Russia's Sakha Republic	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Five people have been killed and a further seven injured in a fire at a detention center in the city of Yakutsk, which houses Russian soldiers who deserted their units during Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian officials reported. The fire broke out around 2 a.m. local time on Dec. 20, Sakha Republic military authorities said. At least seven people have been hospitalized having suffered smoke inhalation. The identities of those killed is still being established, authorities said. No information was immediately available as to the cause of the fire, or the extent of the damage caused. The Kyiv Independent cannot independently verify details surrounding the incident. Desertion rates during Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion remain relatively high amid Russia&apos;s mounting casualty rates. Although up-to-date statistics on desertion are not readily available, the Russian independent media outlet Mediazona reported in April 2024 that Russian courts had received over 8,200 cases related to mobilization since the start of the war. Yakutsk is located in Russia&apos;s far-east, and is located about 450 km south of the arctic circle. Given the region&apos;s harsh weather conditions, Yakutsk and its surrounding region served as a key location for housing political prisoners during the rule of Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union.	https://kyivindependent.com/5-killed-7-injured-in-fire-at-detention-facility-housing-war-deserters-in-russias-sakha-republic/	2024-12-19T18:05:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1576124699.jpg
Putin says full-scale invasion of Ukraine should have been 'earlier,' says he's open to meeting Trump	In a marathon press conference lasting over four hours on Dec. 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that a full-scale invasion of Ukraine should have begun &apos;earlier.&apos; When asked what he would have done differently if he could go back to February 2022, the month Russia launched its all-out war against Ukraine, Putin responded, &quot;Knowing what&apos;s happening now, back in 2022, I would&apos;ve thought the decision ought to have been taken earlier.&quot; He continued, &quot;We ought to have started getting ready for those developments and the special military operation before.&quot; The Kremlin leader also addressed questions about benefits for soldiers involved in what Russia calls a &quot;special military operation&quot; in Ukraine, particularly in relation to payments for injuries or fatalities. This issue has become a significant point of concern in Russia, reflecting the growing anxiety over mounting casualties and the reasons many Russians continue to enlist. A joint investigation by the BBC Russia and Mediazona, a Russian independent media outlet, has identified over 83,000 Russian troops killed in the war, though the actual toll is believed to be much higher. Putin also expressed willingness to engage in dialogue with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at any time to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. However, he reiterated Moscow&#x2019;s unwavering demands for a peace agreement, including the rejection of any territorial concessions and a firm stance against Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership. Responding to a question about whether he had learned anything about himself during the war, Putin asserted, &quot;I believe that Russia has become much stronger in the past two or three years. Why? Because we are becoming a truly sovereign country. We depend on few people. We are able to stand on our own feet from an economic point of view. We are strengthening our defense capability.&quot; Despite almost three years of ongoing war and the toll of Western sanctions on Russia&#x2019;s economy, Putin attempted to reassure the Russian public, particularly those frustrated by the war and rising inflation. He claimed that Russia was winning the war and that the economy was stable and even growing. However, in a rare admission, he acknowledged that Russia&apos;s inflation rate of 9.3 percent, as reported by the Central Bank chief, was &quot;an alarming signal.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-says-full-scale-invasion-of-ukraine-should-have-been-earlier-says-hes-open-to-meeting-trump/	2024-12-19T17:31:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190074168.jpg
Russian court orders two-month detention for suspect in General Kirillov assassination	A Moscow court ruled on Dec. 19 to place the suspect in the killing of General Igor Kirillov in pre-trial detention for two months. The court announced the decision on its Telegram channel. The suspect, originally from Uzbekistan, faces charges of committing a terrorist act resulting in death, according to a notice on the court&apos;s website. On Dec. 18, Russian security forces detained two suspects over the assassination of a top Kremlin general and his assistant in Moscow. Kirillov was killed in Moscow on Dec. 17, with a bomb attached to a scooter. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed responsibility for the attack. Kirillov, 54, served as the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense unit. One day before his assassination, Ukrainian prosecutors charged him in absentia for deploying prohibited chemical weapons during Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A Kyiv Independent investigation published in August revealed that Russian forces have increasingly used gas attacks against Ukrainian troops. Kirillov&#x2019;s involvement in these operations led to sanctions from both the U.K. and Canada. Speaking to the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 17, a source from Ukraine&#x2019;s SBU described Kirillov as a war criminal and a &quot;completely legitimate target,&quot; as he gave orders to use banned chemical weapons against Ukrainian soldiers.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-court-orders-two-month-detention-for-suspect-in-general-kirillov-assassination/	2024-12-19T15:59:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189847816.jpg
EU leaders call for more military aid to Kyiv, vow any future decisions won't exclude Ukraine	European Union leaders reaffirmed their commitment to Ukraine at a Dec. 19 summit in Brussels, emphasizing that decisions about the war-torn country&#x2019;s future must involve Kyiv and its European allies. The meeting, attended by President Volodymyr Zelensky, highlighted solidarity with Ukraine as it has been fighting against Russian aggression fo over 1,000 days. &quot;Only Ukraine as the aggressed country can legitimately define what peace means &#x2014; and if and when the conditions are met for credible negotiations,&quot; said Antonio Costa, president of the European Council. &quot;So now is not the time to speculate about different scenarios &#x2013; now is the time to strengthen Ukraine for all scenarios.&quot; The European Council urged EU member states to immediately enhance military aid to Ukraine. Leaders called for faster delivery of air defense systems, ammunition, and missiles, as well as additional training and equipment for new Ukrainian brigades. Concerns linger over U.S. foreign policy as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office on January 20. Trump has promised to end the war quickly and has emphasized his rapport with Russian President Vladimir Putin, raising fears in Europe about a potential deal unfavorable to Ukraine. Speculation is growing in Europe about potential peace talks in early 2025 and the possible involvement of European peacekeepers to enforce any agreement. However, EU leaders are cautious, aiming to avoid revealing their strategies to Russia. For now, their focus remains on bolstering Ukraine&#x2019;s position in case Zelensky chooses to pursue negotiations. In Brussels, EU leaders maintained their stance: &quot;Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine, nothing about security in Europe without Europeans.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-leaders-call-for-more-military-aid-to-kyiv-vow-any-future-decisions-wont-exclude-ukraine/	2024-12-19T14:24:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-497631536.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Zelensky blasts Putin’s Oreshnik threats, calling him ‘dumbass’	Key developments on Dec. 19: At a press conference in Brussels on Dec. 19, President Volodymyr Zelensky blasted Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s recent threats of using the new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) against Kyiv to test Western air defense systems in what he called a &quot;high-tech duel&quot; with the West. Putin proposed the &quot;high-tech duel&quot; during his annual press conference on Dec. 19. He suggested launching an Oreshnik at a site in Kyiv while challenging the West to deploy their air defenses to intercept it, claiming the missile was unbeatable. &quot;Do you think this is an adequate person? They are just thugs,&quot; Zelensky said while commenting on Putin&apos;s threats. Later on, Zelensky published a video clip with Putin&apos;s suggestion about a &quot;duel&quot; on X, calling him a &quot;dumbass.&quot; &quot;People are dying, and he thinks it&#x2019;s &apos;interesting.&apos; Dumbass,&quot; Zelensky wrote. Putin&apos;s remarks followed his earlier threats to use Oreshnik missiles to strike at &quot;decision-making centers&quot; in Kyiv. Russia first launched an Oreshnik at the city of Dnipro on Nov. 21. The strike was accompanied by a Russian propaganda campaign claiming the attack was carried out in response to the U.S. and U.K.&apos;s decision to lift restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s long-range strikes inside Russia and aimed at undermining Western support for Kyiv. Zelensky also commented on the 2022 Istanbul negotiations between Ukraine and Russia and Putin&apos;s peace proposal back then, dismissing them as a sham. &#x201C;He simply offered Ukraine to surrender, freeze the conflict, shift allegiance to Russia, and give up our independence,&#x201D; Zelensky said. &#x201C;This person calls these some kind of agreements. He is just an old fantasist living in his own aquarium.&#x201D; The draft of the Istanbul agreement was published in full by The New York Times in June. According to it, both sides agreed to exclude Ukraine&apos;s Crimea from the treaty, leaving it under Russian occupation without Ukraine recognizing Russian sovereignty over it while the status of other Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine was to be decided in later talks between presidents Zelensky and Putin. Ukraine offered to abandon aspirations to join NATO or any other military alliance, but the treaty allowed Kyiv to enter the EU. Russia also demanded the lifting of all sanctions, repealing Kyiv&apos;s laws related to language and national identity, and limiting Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 19 that American and European participation in possible peace negotiations with Russia is crucial while rejecting the idea of freezing the conflict. Ahead of the anticipated U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s focus on ending the war after his inauguration on Jan. 20, Zelensky expressed hope that Europe would be involved in the effort, sharing a strong, united stance. Zelensky warned against granting Moscow a temporary break it seeks through a ceasefire, advocating instead for concerted international pressure to achieve an actual ending of Russia&apos;s war. &#x201C;We need coordinated work for a lasting peace, not just the suspension of hostilities that Putin seeks in order to buy time,&#x201D; Zelensky said. &#x201C;We cannot live with a frozen conflict. When it comes to ceasefire, people know what comes after. How everything will end. You have to know what tomorrow brings in order to have a ceasefire.&#x201D; Zelensky also highlighted the role of the so-called Global South nations, including China, India, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil, in supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial integrity and influencing Russia. He urged Europe to recognize and leverage these countries&apos; potential to advance peace, noting their alignment with the principles of territorial sovereignty. Reports of Trump&#x2019;s intentions to end the war, potentially by pressuring Ukraine to cede territory to Russia or relinquish its NATO aspirations, have raised concerns among Ukraine supporters and in Kyiv. Trump has repeatedly claimed he could end the war in &#x201C;24 hours,&#x201D; but he has not elaborated on his approach. On Dec. 12, he reiterated his belief that European troops should lead efforts to monitor any potential ceasefire, saying that Europe must assume greater responsibility in countering Russian aggression. The EU, however, does not foresee negotiations or a ceasefire in the near future, according to a high-ranking EU official who spoke to the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 18. Ukraine&apos;s Navy and the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) carried out a combined strike against the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast overnight on Dec. 19, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. Russian authorities and Telegram channels reported explosions and fire at the facility earlier the same day, connecting it to a Ukrainian drone attack. The Novoshakhtinsk facility is &quot;the only oil refinery operating&quot; in the region, the General Staff said. It reportedly produces up to 7.5 million tons of oil products annually and specializes in fuel production. The city of Novoshakhtinsk lies around 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Russo-Ukrainian border and over 200 kilometers (120 miles) from the front line. Initially, SBU drones attacked the facility to distract Russian air defenses, providing a &quot;window&quot; for Ukrainian-made missiles to strike the facility, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. The strike resulted in a massive fire and caused significant damage, the source claimed. Yuri Slyusar, the acting governor of Rostov Oblast, said the fire had been extinguished as of 6:45 a.m. local time. One person was reportedly injured in the region due to falling drone debris. The fire also affected the refinery&apos;s ELOU-AVT-2.5 catalytic cracking unit, according to the General Staff. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. Ukraine has previously targeted the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery with drone strikes. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces claimed that a July attack on the refinery destroyed &#xA0;1.5 million tons of oil and oil products worth $540 million. The refinery partially shut down after an attack in March. Ukrainian forces regularly target Russian oil depots in addition to attacks on weapons factories and military airfields. Fossil fuel exports are the primary drivers of the Russian economy and the main source of revenue for the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. International sanctions are affecting growing prices in Russia, but there are also shortcomings by Russian authorities, Russian President Vladimir Putin said during his annual press conference and a call-in program on Dec. 19, state news agency TASS reported. Russian officials have largely dismissed the importance of Western sanctions imposed over the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, boasting about a strong and resilient economy. While independent observers mostly agreed that the sanctions fell short of the desired effect, there are mounting warning signs regarding Russia&apos;s economy ahead of 2025. &quot;The sanctions are having an effect, but they are not of key importance,&quot; Putin said when talking about the surging inflation and prices in Russia. The country&apos;s annual inflation rate rose 9.2-9.3% while the ruble oscillates around 100 to the U.S. dollar. Russia&apos;s central bank sought to curb inflation by instituting the highest interest rates &#x2013; 21% &#x2013; since the early 2000s. According to Putin, inflation is driven by the supply not keeping up with the demand and the rising prices of some products globally. Many experts also connected the development to increased defense spending as Russia invests record sums in its full-scale war against Ukraine. &quot;Some experts believe that the central bank could have used tools unrelated to raising the key interest rate more effectively and earlier,&quot; Putin said. &quot;The central bank began doing this in the summer, but these experts believe this could and should have been done earlier.&quot; The combined effect of sanctions and inflation is beginning to threaten the Russian economy in various sectors, including automotive, aviation, and retail. This development comes amid a growing push by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to launch negotiations in Ukraine as soon as possible, though Moscow has shown little interest in peace talks. Ukraine&#x2019;s Special Operations Forces reported on Dec. 19 that they had killed 12 North Korean soldiers and injured 20 others, preventing their advance in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Russia has reportedly deployed over 10,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in Kursk Oblast since early August. Ukraine&#x2019;s Special Operations Forces used drones and an Mk-19 grenade launcher to counter the North Korean soldier&apos;s attempt to advance, according to the released statement and video. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) earlier reported that 30 North Korean soldiers were killed or injured during ground assaults on Dec. 14-15. A total of at least 100 North Korean troops have been killed while fighting for Russia against Ukraine, a South Korean lawmaker said after an intelligence briefing, the BBC reported on Dec. 19. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The use of North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s ground operations was confirmed earlier in November, but their involvement has intensified recently. Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder confirmed on Dec. 16 that North Korean soldiers were actively participating in combat operations alongside Russian troops in Kursk Oblast and had suffered their first casualties. President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that Russia was trying to conceal the extent of the losses among the North Korean soldiers.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-zelensky-blasts-putins-oreshnik-threats-calling-him-dumbass/	2024-12-19T12:44:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190054860.jpg
G7 discusses slashing Russian oil price cap, complete ban, Bloomberg reports	The G7 countries are considering tightening the price cap on Russian oil, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 19, citing its sources. The move comes as Russia&apos;s fossil fuel industry remains a primary source of funding for its war against Ukraine. Discussions reportedly include lowering the current $60-per-barrel cap to approximately $40 or even implementing a complete ban on Russian oil supplies. While talks are ongoing, no consensus has been reached, according to Bloomberg&apos;s sources. Under the existing terms of the price cap, Western operators are permitted to insure and transport Russian oil only if it is sold below the established threshold. The G7 aims to strike a balance between limiting Russia&apos;s revenues and mitigating potential impacts on global oil markets and maritime security. The cap was originally implemented to curtail Moscow&apos;s oil profits while avoiding a surge in global oil prices. With oil prices softening amid projections of a global surplus in 2025, the G7 appears more willing to consider aggressive measures. Ukraine has also targeted Russia&apos;s oil infrastructure through drone strikes, further disrupting production. Several Russian refineries, including those in Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk, have reduced or suspended operations due to the combined impact of sanctions and Ukrainian attacks. The sector has been forced to sell fuel at a discount and operate under high interest rates, adding strain to its operations.	https://kyivindependent.com/g7-discusses-slashing-russian-oil-price-cap-complete-ban-bloomberg-reports/	2024-12-19T12:39:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1258888534.jpg
Can Ukraine sustain its F-16 fleet if Trump halts US aid?	As the outgoing administration of U.S. President Joe Biden rushes to provide last-minute aid to Ukraine before Donald Trump takes office in January, the State Department has recently announced a $266 million maintenance sales package for Ukraine&apos;s F-16 fighter jets. Trump has made no public comments about the Ukrainian F-16 fleet, but his expected intent to reduce support for Kyiv and get his country &quot;out&quot; of the war poses a question: what will become of Ukraine&apos;s U.S.-made jets if Washington withdraws? F-16s, the fifth-generation fighter jets, have been vital in Ukraine&#x2019;s effort to build a modern Air Force. Taking them out of the game could weaken Ukraine&#x2019;s air defense, leaving the country more vulnerable to Russian aerial strikes. The Netherlands and Denmark were the first to provide Ukraine with the F-16s earlier this year, with the Danish government announcing the delivery of their second batch on Dec. 7. Norway and Belgium also pledged to provide the aircraft from their stocks as they pivot toward more advanced F-35s.

Santiago/Getty Images)While the U.S. has not provided any planes from its arsenal, it plays a key role in training Ukrainian pilots and providing maintenance support. The recently announced U.S. military sales package includes a wide range of maintenance-related systems, such as weapons software, spare parts for jets, and the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). Since the F-16 is a U.S.-made system, European allies need Washington&#x2019;s authorization to be able to provide the jets to Ukraine. This means the Trump administration could, in theory, halt even the European supplies of F-16s. If the U.S. stops all further F-16 upkeep aid, Ukraine&apos;s European allies will likely be capable of compensating if they increase funding. &quot;Europeans can compensate for it if they want to, but Americans must approve their third-party transfer,&quot; Peter Layton, a former Australian Air Force officer, associate fellow at Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), and visiting fellow at Griffith Asia Institute, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;If the Trump administration withdraws authorization for the use of F-16s, the U.S. could block any future aid,&quot; the expert explained. &quot;In this case, the situation will be very difficult.&quot; According to Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at RUSI, another issue is the limited personnel that can train and maintain F-16s in European countries.

(Vitalii Nosach/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)A group of Ukrainian military personnel completed a basic training course for piloting F-16 fighter jets in the U.K., the British Royal Air Force (RAF) reported on Oct. 22, 2024. (Royal Air Force (RAF)/X)&#x201C;Unlike the Americans, Europeans don&#x2019;t have as many personnel available, and most of them have been redeployed from flying and maintaining their F-16s to managing their new F-35 aircraft,&quot; Layton said. &quot;So, Europeans would need to put the personnel back from the new aircraft to assist Ukrainians with the older F-16s. I think this would directly impact European capabilities for using F-35 jets.&quot; Many observers have pointed out that the F-16s are not wonder weapons &#x2013; they can&#x2019;t, in their current numbers, ensure Ukraine&#x2019;s superiority in the air. But these jets are still valuable assets that enhance Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities. F-16s are used in both offensive and defensive operations. The aircraft have been used for intercepting Russian missiles and drones during aerial strikes against Ukraine. They could also be deployed to launch missiles and bombs at Russian positions along the front line. &quot;If you take F-16s essentially out of the equation for now, you probably wouldn&#x2019;t see significant changes in Ukraine&#x2019;s defensive capabilities in the short term,&quot; Bronk said. Ukrainian pilots are still overcoming initial obstacles related to adopting a new weapons system, approaches, and style, &quot;particularly in how they manage the radar system,&quot; Bronk said, referring to the case of a Ukrainian F-16 crashing during a mission in August. &quot;It&#x2019;s also a challenge to transfer experienced pilots to F-16s for tasks like intercepting Shaheds or cruise missiles at night. The workflow is very different from the MiG-29 or Su-27, for example,&quot; the expert added. In the medium term, however, Ukraine could see a &quot;significant degradation in the effort to build an Air Force,&quot; Bronk said. Ukraine could potentially consider European solutions, such as the Mirage 2000 jets pledged by France or Swedish Gripen jets. Ukraine is expected to receive only three Mirage jets in early 2025, while the possible delivery of Swedish Gripen jets hasn&#x2019;t been approved yet. However, Bronk notes that the Mirage 2000 is not ideal for Ukraine&#x2019;s defense needs due to its radar missile limitations. Meanwhile, transferring to yet another platform would require more time and effort, costing Ukraine precious time.	https://kyivindependent.com/can-ukraine-sustain-its-f-16-fleet-if-trump-halts-us-aid/	2024-12-19T12:19:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2165218556.jpg
Belarus sentences 2 Belarusians, Ukrainian to 11-25 years for alleged terrorism	Two Belarusians and one Ukrainian were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 11 to 25 years by Belarusian authorities for their alleged involvement in preparing terrorist acts, the Viasna Human Rights Center reported on Dec. 19. Since the 2020 presidential election in Belarus, which saw Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko claim victory in a falsified vote, the country has witnessed a severe crackdown on dissent. Thousands of opposition leaders, activists, and ordinary citizens have been arrested, tortured, and jailed. Belarusian prosecutors claimed that two men from the group allegedly tried to blow up a section of the railroad, while the third one&apos;s actions were classified as &quot;illegal trafficking of explosives.&quot; The sentences for each individual were not disclosed. The detention of these three men alongside three other individuals was announced by the Belarusian KGB on Sept. 11. On the same day, a government propaganda film about the group was aired on state-controlled television. In the film, some of the detainees appeared beaten, others were in chains. According to Viasna, the propaganda film alleged that one of the detainees contacted Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBUt) seeking to fight for Ukraine. He was allegedly told by the SBU that his skills were needed in Belarus. The sentences come as Lukashenko prepares for the January 2025 presidential election, seeking a seventh term after 30 years in power. Lukashenko has recently pardoned prisoners convicted of extremism, claiming that it was a &quot;humane gesture&quot; toward those who had &quot;gone astray, though these individuals were widely seen as victims of repression following the rigged 2020 election.	https://kyivindependent.com/6-belarusian-ukrainian-activists-sentenced-to-up-to-25-years-in-belarus-for-alleged-terrorism/	2024-12-19T12:14:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1228273652.jpg
One killed, one in captivity: The tragic story of two brothers forever separated by Russia’s war	Warning: This article contains descriptions of graphic scenes. For a moment, Oksana Latanska could not believe her eyes when she looked down at a cold, little body, gray from dust and ashes. It hardly resembled the little boy that she knew so well and whom she saw almost every weekend at the rallies calling for the release of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) from Russian captivity. &#xA0; Only his golden-blonde curls helped her recognize the body, bringing the worst nightmare into reality. It was Maksym Shaulskyi, her friend&apos;s son, who was only 12 years old when a Russian missile strike on his hometown of Kryvyi Rih took his life on Sept. 21. The aftermath of a Russian missile strike on Kryvyi Rih, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, on Sept. 21, 2024. The attack killed three people, including a 12-year-old boy, and injured three others. (Serhii Lysak / Telegram)With a population of around 660,000, Kryvyi Rih is the second most populous city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Due to its proximity to the embattled Donetsk Oblast, the city has suffered multiple deadly attacks by Russian forces since the start of the full-scale war. &quot;I saw what was left from our sunshine. It was excruciating,&quot; Latanska told the Kyiv Independent. The strike also killed Maksym&#x2019;s 75-year-old grandmother, Valentyna Shaulska, and two more civilians, according to the local authorities. According to Latanska, the boy&apos;s biggest dream was to see his older brother Mykyta, one of the defenders of now-occupied Mariupol in Donetsk Oblast, who has been in Russian captivity since 2022. But that dream was shattered by a Russian missile hitting a residential neighborhood of a peaceful city. &quot;It&apos;s a horrible tragedy,&quot; Latanska says. &quot;Maksym was such a wonderful boy&#x2026; Our little sunshine.&quot; Maksym is one of the 578 Ukrainian children killed by the Russian war since Feb. 24, 2022, according to the national database. The U.N. estimates that at least 11,743 civilians have been killed and 24,614 injured since the start of the full-scale invasion. However, the actual number of civilian casualties is likely much higher as it doesn&#x2019;t account for fatalities in the Russian-occupied territories that are inaccessible to international organizations. Latanska, who heads the Steel Guard of Kryvyi Rih non-profit that advocates for the release of Ukrainian POWs, says it was the &quot;common grief&quot; that united her and Shaulskyi&apos;s family shortly after Russia&#x2019;s all-out war began. Latanska&apos;s son, Ukrainian soldier Vitalii, served in the same National Guard unit with Mykyta Shaulskyi. They both defended Mariupol in the spring of 2022 during the brutal Russian siege of the city, both ending up in Russian captivity at the age of 22. Former service member herself, Latanska says that Maksym and Mykyta&#x2019;s mother, Nataliia Shaulska, joined the Armed Forces when one of her sons was already in captivity. The family also has another adult son who lives in Dnipro, according to Latanska. Their entire family regularly took part in the local weekend rallies, part of a national movement aimed at keeping the release of the prisoners on everyone&apos;s agenda. Maksym Shaulskyi&apos;s family in a photo posted on Sep.23, 2024. (Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine / Telegram)Little Maksym rarely skipped them, Latanska says. He and Mykyta were very close, she says, adding that it was the boy&apos;s biggest dream to see and hug his big brother again. Photos of Maksym holding Mykyta&apos;s portrait and calling for his release during one of the rallies in Kryvyi Rih went viral following his death. While Latanska&apos;s son Vitalii was released from captivity in June, Mykyta is still a prisoner of Russia. He is now 25. Latanska says they hope Mykyta will be released soon, but they worry about how he will receive the devastating news that Russia killed his brother and grandmother while he was in captivity. The mother of Mykyta and Maksym, Nataliia Shaulska, returned to civilian life nearly three weeks before her youngest son was killed. She was outside Kryvyi Rih when the missile struck their neighborhood, almost completely destroying their house. &quot;Otherwise, the entire family would have been gone,&quot; Latanska says. She rushed to the site the moment she learned about the tragedy: &quot;When I was looking at his (Maksym&apos;s) body, I thought that the monster who launched the missile might also have children, maybe even of Maksym&apos;s age.&quot; &quot;I thought about how he landed his plane at a Russian airfield, walked into a bakery, and bought some pastry for his family. He walked home and kissed his wife and his sleeping 12-year-old son. And for me, the only fitting punishment is from God, who will take away his family in the most painful way possible, so he feels it himself.&quot; &quot;But even that would not be enough because it would not bring our boy back,&quot; she went on. &quot;No punishment for Russia would be enough.&quot; Women embrace each other as they visit a designated area for commemorating fallen Ukrainian and foreign fighters during the Independence Day of Ukraine, in the Independence Square in Kyiv, Ukraine on Aug. 24, 2024.

Ukraine’s Special Forces report killing 12 North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast	Ukraine&#x2019;s Special Operations Forces reported on Dec. 19 that they had killed 12 North Korean soldiers and injured 20 others, preventing their advance in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Russia has reportedly deployed over 10,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in Kursk Oblast since early August.

Ukraine won't extend Russian gas transit, Zelensky confirms	Ukraine will not extend the transit agreement for Russian gas through its territory, set to expire on Dec. 31, President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed on Dec. 19 during a press conference in Brussels. The decision previously prompted concerns from Slovakia, Hungary, Italy, and Austria, whose state-owned energy companies called for the continuation of gas transit through Ukraine in a joint declaration. Zelensky said that Ukraine would not allow Moscow to &#x201C;earn additional billions&#x201D; while continuing its aggression against Ukraine. &#x201C;We will not engage in extending the transit of Russian gas. We will not give (Russia) the opportunity to earn additional billions on our blood,&#x201D; Zelensky said. Russian President Vladimir Putin, addressing the issue during his annual press conference on the same day, confirmed the end of the contract, expressing confidence in the Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom&apos;s ability to endure the loss. &#x201C;This contract will no longer exist. Everything is clear. We will survive, Gazprom will survive,&#x201D; Putin said. While the European Union has made efforts to reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuels following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many countries, including Slovakia, Hungary, and Austria, remain reliant on Russian gas. The EU only introduced its first sanctions targeting the Russian gas industry, specifically liquefied natural gas (LNG), earlier this year. Following discussions with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that Ukraine is open to negotiating gas transit agreements for non-Russian sources.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-wont-extend-russian-gas-transit-zelensky-confirms/	2024-12-19T10:54:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/upd_GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
North Korean troops in Kursk Oblast boost Russia's manpower, despite vulnerabilities	North Korean troops fighting in Kursk Oblast are especially vulnerable to drones but still managed to help Moscow advance a few kilometers in the partially Ukrainian-occupied region in southwest Russia, according to Western military experts analyzing open-source data. The assessment of drone vulnerability differs from an on-the-ground testimony obtained by the Kyiv Independent, in which a Special Forces serviceman disclosed how North Korean troops were well-protected by Russia&#x2019;s electronic warfare, which effectively counters drones. The contrasting evaluations highlight the opacity of reports from Kursk Oblast, where a third party&#x2019;s troops entered the battle. There are about 12,000 North Korean troops deployed in Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August to bring the war to Russia, a senior Ukrainian official familiar with the intelligence told the Kyiv Independent. Some of them were already sent on assault missions, and they have proven to lack experience with most modern weapons, especially various types of drones, the official added. Each North Korean platoon accompanies a larger company of Russian paratroopers to reclaim Ukrainian positions in Kursk Oblast, according to the official. In exchange for the troop transfer, Russia is paying over $2,000 for each North Korean soldier, though it is unclear how much is allocated for the individual soldier and the Pyongyang government, the official added. Russia could also transfer technologies to North Korea to produce and improve &#x201C;weapon characteristics,&#x201D; a move that could further deepen Moscow-Pyongyang ties, the official said, adding that North Korea is already improving its ballistic missiles by observing Russia&apos;s use of them in Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent couldn&#x2019;t independently verify the information shared by the official. The assessments come a few days after Ukraine&#x2019;s President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 14 that Russia had begun deploying &#x201C;a significant number&#x201D; of North Korean soldiers for assault operations in Kursk Oblast. Russia has launched waves of counterattacks since September to reclaim the thin Ukrainian-occupied salient in Kursk Oblast. The Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) reported the fighting with Pyongyang&#x2019;s troops &#x2013; in particular from the 94th Separate brigade of the North Korean army &#x2013; to be in the lower part of the Ukrainian-controlled salient, as close as a few kilometers from the Ukrainian border, in Kursk Oblast. A South Korean lawmaker told the media on Dec. 19 that at least 100 North Korean troops have been killed and another 1,200 wounded amid the lack of experience with terrain and drone warfare. A senior U.S. military official, cited in a Dec. 17 Associated Press article, said that a couple hundred North Korean troops have thus far been killed or wounded in Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian officials briefed on the intelligence and Western military analysts named drones to be a challenge for North Korean troops, thereby sustaining heavy casualties. Not knowing how to protect themselves from Ukrainian Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAVs), the reality of the first drone war has been &#x201C;a new challenge&#x201D; for the North Korean troops, a source in the HUR military intelligence told the Kyiv Independent. The HUR source said that Russia set up additional positions to counter drones to protect North Korean troops from the vulnerability. Oleksandr, who serves in the intelligence of the 82nd brigade that participates in the Kursk incursion, shows a video of his unit&apos;s drone destroying Russian equipment. (Oksana Parafeniuk for The Washington Post via Getty Images)A serviceman in the Ukrainian Special Forces sabotage and reconnaissance group that identifies as UA_REG TEAM, deployed in Kursk Oblast, said that North Korean troops are well-protected by the umbrella of electronic warfare from drones. &#x201C;From the first day, electronic warfare works quite well at places where the North Koreans are entrenched, which prevents you from conducting quality reconnaissance,&#x201D; the serviceman, who introduced himself as Yaroslav, told the Kyiv Independent. North Korean troops hold a narrow section of the front where they can outnumber Ukrainian troops, according to Yaroslav, who declined to disclose his last name due to security concerns. Their good command of tactics and physical fitness allow them to quickly evade or escape open terrain, he added. &#x201C;(North Korean troops) move quickly in a column one at a time until the first shot is fired and then quickly form a line to maneuver,&#x201D; Yaroslav said. The serviceman also suggested that Russia had given them orders not to leave behind any bodies of North Korean troops, given how quickly they are cleared compared to the bodies of regular Russian soldiers. Ukraine has slowly been losing ground in Kursk Oblast since September, with a senior General Staff official confirming to Reuters in late November that it had lost over 40% of the territory it previously captured in Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian soldiers are increasingly pessimistic about the fate of the Kursk operation, with a growing number questioning the cost of an incursion into another country&#x2019;s territory when the defense of one&#x2019;s own land is uncertain. While confirming that the troops featured in videos of at least two separate assault operations surfacing the internet since Dec. 14 are certainly North Koreans is difficult, the troops operate differently and &quot;in a manner that would be expected of North Koreans,&quot; according to Pasi Paroinen at Finland-based open-source analytical organization Black Bird Group. The apparent North Korean infantry is &quot;very well-spaced out,&#x201D; which helps reduce casualties from indirect artillery or drone fires and makes it harder to target them at once, Paroinen said. The North Korean troops are also moving as a cohesive unit in larger numbers than observed from Ukrainian or Russian troops, he added. John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said exposing the troops to modern realities of the war, including with drones, is &quot;definitely&quot; part of Pyongyang&apos;s goals to bolster its military. &#x201C;Overall, it&apos;ll be important to see whether this North Korean contingent is the beginning of the end of the North Korean deployment or if it&apos;s the prelude to a larger and more steady stream of troops,&#x201D; Hardie told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;At this rate, seeing how badly the latest round of Russian offensives went (in November), I think a lot will now depend on how well the North Koreans will perform &#x2013; if they can tip the scales,&#x201D; Paroinen told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;(North Korean troops) certainly change up the game now that they are using different tactics to what the Ukrainians are used to and they will bring the numbers.&#x201D; The Ukrainian official briefed on the intelligence, speaking anonymously, said that there are no signs that Russia would deploy North Korean troops en masse in Ukraine in the near future, as Moscow is focused on reclaiming the entirety of Kursk Oblast. Paroinen from the Black Bird Group estimated that, as of December, Ukraine still controlled less than 500 square kilometers of Kursk Oblast, which is roughly the size of Chicago.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-especially-vulnerable-to-drones-but-gaining-ground-in-kursk-oblast-experts-say/	2024-12-19T10:44:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1074306244.jpg
Zelensky dismisses ceasefire as Putin’s ploy to regroup, seeks coordinated peace plan	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 19 that American and European participation in possible peace negotiations with Russia is crucial while rejecting the idea of freezing the conflict. Ahead of the anticipated U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s focus on ending the war after his inauguration on Jan. 20, Zelensky expressed hope that Europe would be involved in the effort, sharing a strong, united stance. Zelensky warned against granting Moscow a temporary break it seeks through a ceasefire, advocating instead for concerted international pressure to achieve an actual ending of Russia&apos;s war. &#x201C;We need coordinated work for a lasting peace, not just the suspension of hostilities that Putin seeks in order to buy time,&#x201D; Zelensky said. &#x201C;We cannot live with a frozen conflict. When it comes to ceasefire, people know what comes after. How everything will end. You have to know what tomorrow brings in order to have a ceasefire.&#x201D; Zelensky also highlighted the role of the so-called Global South nations, including China, India, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil, in supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial integrity and influencing Russia. He urged Europe to recognize and leverage these countries&apos; potential to advance peace, noting their alignment with the principles of territorial sovereignty. Reports of Trump&#x2019;s intentions to end the war, potentially by pressuring Ukraine to cede territory to Russia or relinquish its NATO aspirations, have raised concerns among Ukraine supporters and in Kyiv. Trump has repeatedly claimed he could end the war in &#x201C;24 hours,&#x201D; but he has not elaborated on his approach. On Dec. 12, he reiterated his belief that European troops should lead efforts to monitor any potential ceasefire, saying that Europe must assume greater responsibility in countering Russian aggression. The EU, however, does not foresee negotiations or a ceasefire in the near future, according to a high-ranking EU official who spoke to the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 18.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-dismisses-ceasefire-as-putins-ploy-to-regroup-seeks-coordinated-peace-plan-zelensky-says/	2024-12-19T10:17:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/0de35cc483afba4f3068809e809b4d53_1734626087_extra_large.jpeg
Denmark allocates $292 million to bolster Ukraine’s air defense, minister says	Denmark has allocated 2.1 billion Danish kroner (over $292 million) to bolster Ukraine&apos;s air defense, Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen announced on Dec. 19. The announcement comes amid intensified Russian attacks against Ukraine, including one of the largest aerial strikes on Dec. 13, which targeted energy infrastructure across Ukraine. The package includes financial support for the operation of Ukraine&#x2019;s F-16 fighter jets used to counter Russian air targets. &#x201C;One of Ukraine&apos;s most urgent needs right now is the ability to protect itself from Russian air strikes. That is why we are prioritizing more support for air defense,&#x201D; Poulsen said. Denmark has already transferred the second batch of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 7. Denmark has provided Ukraine with about $7.5 billion worth of military aid since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. It was also the first country to offer military aid to Ukraine through direct purchases from Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industry. Denmark is part of a broader coalition effort to bolster aid to Ukraine ahead of the uncertain future of U.S. aid under incoming President Donald Trump. On Nov. 27, the heads of government from Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Norway, Poland, and Sweden reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Ukraine. The countries identified Russia as a significant long-term threat and called for stronger sanctions and enhanced defense measures to counter Moscow&#x2019;s aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/denmark-allocates-292-million-to-bolster-ukraines-air-defense/	2024-12-19T09:13:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-914935130.jpg
‘Just thugs’ — Zelensky blasts Putin’s Oreshnik threats, 'high-tech' duel proposal with the West	At a press conference in Brussels on Dec. 19, President Volodymyr Zelensky blasted Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s recent threats of using the new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) against Kyiv to test Western air defense systems in what he called a &quot;high-tech duel&quot; with the West. Putin proposed the &quot;high-tech duel&quot; during his annual press conference on Dec. 19. He suggested launching an Oreshnik at a site in Kyiv while challenging the West to deploy their air defenses to intercept it, claiming the missile was unbeatable. &quot;Do you think this is an adequate person? They are just thugs,&quot; Zelensky said while commenting on Putin&apos;s threats. Putin&apos;s remarks followed his earlier threats to use Oreshnik missiles to strike at &quot;decision-making centers&quot; in Kyiv. Russia first launched an Oreshnik at the city of Dnipro on Nov. 21. The strike was accompanied by a Russian propaganda campaign claiming the attack was carried out in response to the U.S. and U.K.&apos;s decision to lift restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s long-range strikes inside Russia and aimed at undermining Western support for Kyiv. Zelensky also commented on the 2022 Istanbul negotiations between Ukraine and Russia and Putin&apos;s peace proposal back then, dismissing them as a sham. &#x201C;He simply offered Ukraine to surrender, freeze the conflict, shift allegiance to Russia, and give up our independence,&#x201D; Zelensky said. &#x201C;This person calls these some kind of agreements. He is just an old fantasist living in his own aquarium.&#x201D; The draft of the Istanbul agreement was published in full by The New York Times in June. According to it, both sides agreed to exclude Ukraine&apos;s Crimea from the treaty, leaving it under Russian occupation without Ukraine recognizing Russian sovereignty over it while the status of other Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine was to be decided in later talks between presidents Zelensky and Putin. Ukraine offered to abandon aspirations to join NATO or any other military alliance, but the treaty allowed Kyiv to enter the EU. Russia also demanded the lifting of all sanctions, repealing Kyiv&apos;s laws related to language and national identity, and limiting Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/just-thugs-zelensky-blasts-putins-oreshnik-threats-high-tech-duel-proposal-with-the-west/	2024-12-19T08:08:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/7e69d910db63590990aa61727350f2a8_1734609326.jpeg
Ukraine's brigade commander arrested over alleged power abuse after media investigation	A court in Ternopil took into custody Colonel Oleh Poberezhniuk, the commander of the 211th Pontoon Bridge Brigade, who is suspected of abuse of power, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office reported. The court set the bail for Poberezhniuk at Hr 908,400 ($21,600). He was charged with abuse of office after he allegedly had four of his subordinates help build his house in Khmelnytskyi Oblast in the fall of 2023. While performing the service for Poberezhniuk, the four service members received full salaries and combat payments and were officially listed in a working visit to Mykolaiv Oblast. On Dec. 16, Ukrainska Pravda reported that the unit&apos;s officers had beaten service members, extorted money from them, and even tied one soldier to a wooden cross as a punishment. In response to the media investigation, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi ordered an inspection and suspended Poberezhniuk. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov also ordered an investigation into the alleged abuse, extortion, and humiliation of soldiers. The 211th Brigade, formed in August 2023, performs engineering work, builds defenses in the rear, and does not participate in direct combat. According to Ukrainska Pravda, the cases of abuse surfaced after the start of official checks in the spring of 2024. The outlet&apos;s sources named now-Captain Vladyslav Pastukh, Poborezhniuk&apos;s godson and the son of the unit&apos;s chief of staff, as one of the main perpetrators. The officer was said to have extorted money from soldiers on account of being related to the unit&apos;s most senior officers. Though Pastukh no longer serves in the unit, the media investigation identified almost a dozen cases of fathers and sons or husbands and wives serving together in the 211th Brigade. The revelations come as Ukraine faces mounting challenges in replenishing the ranks of its Armed Forces, facing low enlistment rates and even cases of desertion. Mykhailo Drapatyi, the new commander of the Ground Forces, recently announced wide-ranging reforms focusing on recruitment and training.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-brigade-commander-arrested-over-alleged-power-abuse-after-journalists-investigation/	2024-12-19T05:53:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1738887156.jpg
Ukraine's economy healthier that Russia's in some indicators, The Economist reports	Ukraine&apos;s economy has adapted well to the realities of the full-scale war while Russia&apos;s economy faces increasingly unfavorable forecasts, The Economist wrote on Dec. 18. Although Ukraine appears to be &quot;winning the economic war against Russia,&quot; the outlet&apos;s analysis suggests that further development will depend on how Kyiv manages incoming challenges like workforce and resource shortages or Donald Trump&apos;s presidency. Russia&apos;s invasion caused a major hit to Ukraine&apos;s economy, which suffered a whopping 29.1% fall in GDP in 2022. Since then, the country has made strides in stabilizing the situation, and the GDP is expected to grow by over 4% in 2024 and 2025. In comparison, Russia faces surging inflation and a falling ruble that forced the central bank to institute a 21% interest rate, the highest level since the early 2000s. Ukraine&apos;s central bank also recently raised the interest rate but only to 13.5%. Russia&apos;s expected economic growth is also slowing down, forecasted to grow by 0.5-1.5% next year. The Economist attributed Ukraine&apos;s positive development to the joint efforts of local businesses, the state, and international partners. Ukrainian enterprises have successfully adapted to operating under energy restrictions caused by Russian strikes. Ukraine resumed shipping in the Black Sea despite an attempted Russian blockade, and international support has helped the country&apos;s budget stay afloat. As the full-scale war nears its third anniversary, Ukraine faces &quot;its biggest threats yet&quot; in the shape of labor shortages, energy deficits, and increasingly tight finances, The Economist wrote. The Group of Seven (G7) countries agreed in 2024 to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan backed by proceeds from frozen Russian assets to fund the state&apos;s operations and defense needs. The prospect of further aid nevertheless remains increasingly uncertain amid political instability in major European countries and the incoming Trump administration. The U.S. president-elect has shown little appetite for prolonged support for Ukraine, vowing to bring both sides to the negotiating table and quickly end the war. Kyiv&apos;s problems are multiplied by unfavorable developments on the front. Russia currently holds the upper hand on the battlefield, advancing at a rapid pace in Donetsk Oblast while Ukraine struggles to replenish its ranks to hold back more numerous Russian forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-economy-healthier-that-russias-in-some-indicators-the-economist-reports/	2024-12-19T05:52:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1420136216.jpg
Putin claims Russia wasn't 'defeated' in Syria	Moscow achieved its goals in Syria, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed during his annual press conference and a call-in program on Dec. 19. following the collapse of dictator Bashar al-Assad&apos;s regime. Commenting on the fall of Assad&apos;s regime for the first time, Putin said Russia invaded Syria to prevent the creation of &quot;a terrorist enclave.&quot; &quot;All that is happening in Syria is not a defeat for Russia,&quot; he added. Russia has been Assad&apos;s key supporter, deploying troops in the country since 2015 to back the dictator in the civil war and losing at least hundreds of soldiers in the process. Syrian rebels announced on Dec. 8 that they successfully ousted Assad following a lightning offensive across the country, which culminated with the capture of the capital city of Damascus. Moscow persuaded Assad to flee to Russia with his family after realizing his regime was bound to lose to the opposition&apos;s rapid advance, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 11, citing its sources. The Russian president said at the press conference that he had not met with Assad since he arrived in Moscow. Putin also claimed that most Syrian factions would welcome the continued presence of Russian military bases in the country but said Moscow must first assess its future relationship with them. &quot;We maintain relations with all the groups that control the situation there... The vast majority of them tell us that they would be interested in our military bases remaining in Syria,&quot; Putin claimed. &quot;I don&#x2019;t know. We have to think about this because we must assess our relations with those political forces that are in control and will be in control of the situation in the future.&quot; Putin&apos;s statements contrast with multiple reports indicating Russian forces are preparing to withdraw from their bases in the Middle Eastern country.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-claims-russia-achieved-its-goals-in-syria/	2024-12-19T05:39:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-959602072-1.jpg
Zelensky meets top EU officials in Brussels, discusses 'just peace' approach	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with the new president of the European Council, Antonio Costa, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during a two-day summit in Brussels on Dec. 19. Zelensky and Costa discussed how to support Ukraine and the importance of Western efforts to achieve a &quot;just peace.&quot; &quot;As we approach the start of the new year, we really need unity between the United States, the EU, and European countries,&quot; Zelensky said alongside Costa. &quot;Only together, the U.S. and Europe can truly stop (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and save Ukraine.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky and European Council President Antonio Costa during a meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on Dec. 19, 2024. (Volodymyr Zelensky/X)Among other topics, the officials discussed protecting Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure from Russian aerial attacks and increasing domestic defense production. Separately, Zelensky and von der Leyen also discussed Kyiv&apos;s accession to the EU and the use of frozen Russian assets for Ukraine&apos;s needs. Earlier this month, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it will provide $20 billion in loan assistance to Ukraine, marking its contribution to a broader $50 billion initiative supported by G7 countries. Ukraine is expected to receive 18.1 billion euros ($18.8 billion) in macro-financial aid from the EU as part of the G7 loan. The first tranche will be disbursed in January 2025, Zelensky added.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-top-eu-officials-in-brussels/	2024-12-19T04:36:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GfKP2FIXkAAs7-f.jpg
Shooting reported in Russian-occupied Abkhazia's local council; council member killed	A shooting in the &quot;people assembly&quot; building of Georgia&apos;s Russian-occupied region of Abkhazia left one person dead and another injured, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported on Dec. 19. Vakhtang Golandzia, a member of the assembly that de facto serves as the occupied region&apos;s legislative body, was fatally shot, and his colleague Kan Kvarchia was injured, RFE/RL reported, citing local health authorities. The suspected perpetrator, council member Adgur Kharazia, fled the crime scene, the Apsynpress news agency reported. Kvarchia has been hospitalized with a wound to his arm, according to local officials. The Amra-life Telegram channel alleged that the council was discussing a bill on a mining ban. During the deliberations, Kharazia and Kvarchia got into an argument, after which Kharazia pulled out a gun and opened fire at Kvarchia, the channel wrote. Golandzia was shot after supposedly attempting to intervene. Russia has occupied Abkhazia and South Ossetia after a war with Tbilisi in 2008, backing local breakaway leadership. Both regions are internationally recognized as Georgia&apos;s sovereign soil.	https://kyivindependent.com/shooting-reported-in-abkhazia-local-council/	2024-12-19T04:17:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2173673388.jpg
Ukraine's parliament passes bill dissolving medical commissions after corruption scandals	The Ukrainian parliament on Dec. 19 adopted a bill dissolving the system of medical examination commissions (MSEC) for determining the severity of disabilities. President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a decree in October to disband the commissions after several officials were accused of using corrupt schemes to acquire falsified disability certifications. A total of 259 members of parliament voted in favor of the bill, said Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a member of the opposition Holos party. Obtaining disability status through medical examination commissions allows one to avoid military service and receive a higher pension, among other social benefits. Starting Jan. 1, Ukraine will introduce new expert commissions in major hospitals for assessing people&apos;s medical status based on a new, &quot;modern system,&quot; Zhelezniak said. &quot;The system of medical and social expertise that currently exists in Ukraine was formed before Ukraine gained independence. It does not meet the current challenges that our country faces during the armed aggression by the Russian Federation, nor the current approaches to establishing disability adopted in the world,&quot; the explanatory note to the draft law read. The bill&apos;s authors expect that the new system will help create a transparent procedure for assessing the needs of the applicants. The replacement of commissions is expected to reduce the administrative burden and help reduce appeals against their decisions. The draft law has to be signed by the president before becoming law. Following the National Security and Defense Council meeting on Oct. 22, Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) head Vasyl Maliuk said that the SBU had exposed corruption schemes at medical examination commissions in 2024, resulting in the cancellation of 4,106 fake disability status certificates. Maliuk added that 64 officials at medical examination commissions have been charged with committing crimes, while another nine suspects have been convicted. According to Zelensky&apos;s October decree, all commissions in Ukraine will be eliminated by Dec. 31, 2024. Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General Andrii Kostin submitted his resignation on Oct. 22 following the reports of prosecutors illegally obtaining disability status.	https://kyivindependent.com/parliament-passes-bill-dissolving-medical-commissions-after-corruption-scandals/	2024-12-19T03:36:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167201231.jpg
Russia building ring road around Azov Sea in occupied parts of Ukraine, Putin says	Russia is planning to build a ring road around the Azov Sea, passing through the occupied territories of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin said during his annual press conference and a call-in program on Dec. 19. The road is expected to run through Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast, the occupied Ukrainian towns of Mariupol, Melitopol, and Henichesk in the country&apos;s east and south, and through Dzhankoi in occupied Crimea. Moscow has already built a 40-kilometer-long (25 miles) segment between the Russian city of Taganrog and Mariupol in Donetsk Oblast, according to Putin. &quot;We plan to bring the roads to Russian standards within three years,&quot; he said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Russia is also illegally constructing a railroad between Russia&apos;s city Rostov-on-Don and Crimea, which would run via occupied Donetsk, Mariupol, and Berdiansk in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The railroad will likely serve as an alternative to the Kerch Bridge, which connects the Russian mainland with the Crimean Peninsula and became a critical supply route for Moscow&apos;s forces after the launch of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence said the Russian railway could pose &quot;a serious problem&quot; and is &quot;an important target&quot; for Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-building-ring-road-around-azov-sea-putin-says/	2024-12-19T03:26:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1245201349.jpg
Putin proposes to 'experiment' on Western air defenses by launching Oreshnik at Kyiv	Russian President Vladimir Putin on Dec. 19 mockingly suggested a &quot;high-tech duel&quot; with the West by launching the Oreshnik missile against Kyiv to prove Western air defenses cannot intercept it. Speaking during his annual press conference and a call-in program, Putin again claimed that Russia&apos;s &quot;new&quot; Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) cannot be intercepted by air defenses. &quot;And those Western experts who think (the Oreshnik can be intercepted), let them suggest to us and those in the West who pay them to conduct a technological experiment,&quot; Putin said. &quot;Let&apos;s call it a high-tech duel of the 21st century. Let them determine some site to hit, let&apos;s say, in Kyiv, concentrate all their air defenses there, and we will strike there with the Oreshnik and see what happens.&quot; Russia launched an Oreshnik missile against Dnipro in Ukraine on Nov. 21, supposedly as a response to the U.S. and the U.K. lifting restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s long-range strikes inside Russia. The Oreshnik strike was followed by a propaganda blitz reportedly aimed at scaring off the Western support for Kyiv. Despite Putin&apos;s claims, Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky said that there already are air defense systems that can successfully take down the missile The U.S. operates the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), designed to intercept intermediate-range ballistic missiles. The system has not been supplied to Ukraine and, therefore, has never been tested against the Oreshnik. Speaking at the press conference, the Russian president said that U.S. air defense systems are &quot;costly and ineffective&quot; and said he sees &quot;no problem&quot; if Washington supplies THAAD to Ukraine. Putin also insisted that the Oreshnik missile, which he said has a range of 5,500 kilometers (3,400 miles), is a completely new weapon. Experts disputed this statement, saying that the weapon is based on the existing RS-26 Rubezh system. The Kremlin&apos;s chief previously threatened to strike Kyiv&apos;s &quot;decision-making centers&quot; with the Oreshnik and said Russia would begin mass-producing the weapon. Undisclosed Russian officials told The Moscow Times that mass production is unlikely due to Russia&apos;s technological shortcomings.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-on-oreshnik-kyiv/	2024-12-19T03:03:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189232547.jpg
US reimposes sanctions on entities involved in Nord Stream 2 construction	The U.S. reimposed sanctions against a number of entities involved in the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, the U.S. State Department announced on Dec. 18. Washington imposed sanctions on entities previously sanctioned under the Protecting Europe&#x2019;s Energy Security Act (PEESA) for their involvement in the pipeline&apos;s construction, as well as several new owners of vessels previously blocked under PEESA. The Nord Stream 2 was meant to funnel Russian gas to Germany via the Baltic Sea. Berlin has been heavily criticized by Ukraine, the U.S., and other partners for the project, which they said would deepen Germany&apos;s energy dependence on Russia. The U.S. sanctions list includes 11 Russian companies, including Nord Stream 2 AG, the project operator that provided insurance to the project&apos;s companies, and Matthias Warnig, the former CEO of Nord Stream 2 AG. &quot;We&#x2019;re going to continue to work and ensure that Russia is never able to weaponize its energy resources and its energy positioning for political gain again,&quot; U.S. State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters on Dec. 18. The construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline was almost completed when Russia began concentrating its forces near Ukraine&apos;s border in late 2021 and early 2022 Ukraine for the full-scale invasion. In September 2022, the Nord Stream 1 and 2 underwater pipelines connecting Russia to Germany were blown up under unclear circumstances. Investigations have been ongoing since then but have yet to produce a definitive conclusion regarding the cause of the explosions. Moscow and the West have traded blame for the incident. German investigators reportedly issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian national, believed to be part of the group that blew up the pipeline, the German media reported in August. Kyiv has denied any involvement.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-reimposes-sanctions-on-entities-involved-in-nord-stream-2-construction/	2024-12-19T02:32:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/2021-12-thumbnail-image-882jpeg960x0-q90-crop-upscale.jpg
Putin acknowledges sanctions have impact on Russia's economy	International sanctions are affecting growing prices in Russia, but there are also shortcomings by Russian authorities, Russian President Vladimir Putin said during his annual press conference on Dec. 19, state news agency TASS reported. Russian officials have largely dismissed the importance of Western sanctions imposed over the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, boasting about a strong and resilient economy. While independent observers mostly agreed that the sanctions fell short of the desired effect, there are mounting warning signs regarding Russia&apos;s economy ahead of 2025. &quot;The sanctions are having an effect, but they are not of key importance,&quot; Putin said when talking about the surging inflation and prices in Russia. The country&apos;s annual inflation rate rose 9.2-9.3% while the ruble oscillates around 100 to the U.S. dollar. Russia&apos;s central bank sought to curb inflation by instituting the highest interest rates &#x2013; 21% &#x2013; since the early 2000s. According to Putin, inflation is driven by the supply not keeping up with the demand and the rising prices of some products globally. Many experts also connected the development to increased defense spending as Russia invests record sums in its full-scale war against Ukraine. &quot;Some experts believe that the central bank could have used tools unrelated to raising the key interest rate more effectively and earlier,&quot; Putin said. &quot;The central bank began doing this in the summer, but these experts believe this could and should have been done earlier.&quot; The combined effect of sanctions and inflation is beginning to threaten the Russian economy in various sectors, including automotive, aviation, and retail. This development comes amid a growing push by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to launch negotiations in Ukraine as soon as possible, though Moscow has shown little interest in peace talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-acknowledges-sanctions-have-impact-on-russias-economy/	2024-12-19T02:07:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1246324907.jpg
Ukraine won't limit army's strength as part of potential peace talks, Zelensky says	Ukraine will not agree to reduce its Armed Forces even if Kyiv receives an invitation to join NATO, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists in Brussels overnight on Dec. 19, according to a Kyiv Independent reporter. &quot;Demilitarization&quot; was one of the insincere excuses that Russian President Vladimir Putin used to justify a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Moscow demanded Ukraine to reduce its army to 50,000 people, five times fewer than the country had by 2022, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s (RFE/RL) investigation project Sistema reported in November, citing an obtained first draft of Moscow&apos;s peace offer to Kyiv. According to Zelensky, Western guarantees to provide Kyiv with military and financial aid are not enough to guarantee that Putin will not attack Kyiv again. &quot;Therefore, the best thing is a strong army, a large army, the largest army in Europe. We simply have no right to limit the strength of our army in any case,&quot; the president said. Kyiv&apos;s membership in NATO would be the best security guarantee, Zelensky reiterated during a briefing after meeting French President Emmanuel Macron in Brussels on Dec. 19. &quot;We do not expect (an invitation to NATO) from anyone, (but) we are fighting for this right,&quot; he added. Zelensky also told journalists that Ukraine will make every effort to be strong enough in 2025 to end the war through diplomacy. Earlier, Andriy Yermak, head of the Presidential Office, said that Kyiv is not prepared to enter negotiations with Russia as it lacks sufficient Western support to engage from a position of strength. &quot;We will do everything so that next year we can be strong and move on to diplomacy,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;I don&apos;t believe that Putin wants the war to end, so we will figure it out. In any case, on our part, we are doing everything to end this war fairly for us, for Ukraine.&quot; Ukraine has shifted its rhetoric amid growing expectations of possible ceasefire talks as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said he aims to push Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-wont-limit-its-army-zelensky-says/	2024-12-19T01:32:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185712185.jpg
Ukraine strikes 'only oil refinery operating' in Russia's Rostov Oblast, military says	Ukraine&apos;s Navy and the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) carried out a combined strike against the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast overnight on Dec. 19, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. Russian authorities and Telegram channels reported explosions and fire at the facility earlier the same day, connecting it to a Ukrainian drone attack. The Novoshakhtinsk facility is &quot;the only oil refinery operating&quot; in the region, the General Staff said. It reportedly produces up to 7.5 million tons of oil products annually and specializes in fuel production. The city of Novoshakhtinsk lies around 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Russo-Ukrainian border and over 200 kilometers (120 miles) from the front line. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage that purports to show the aftermath of a Ukrainian strike against the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery, Rostov Oblast, Russia, overnight on Dec. 19, 2024. (SBU source)Initially, SBU drones attacked the facility to distract Russian air defenses, providing a &quot;window&quot; for Ukrainian-made missiles to strike the facility, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. The strike resulted in a massive fire and caused significant damage, the source claimed. Yuri Slyusar, the acting governor of Rostov Oblast, said the fire had been extinguished as of 6:45 a.m. local time. One person was reportedly injured in the region due to falling drone debris. The fire also affected the refinery&apos;s ELOU-AVT-2.5 catalytic cracking unit, according to the General Staff. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify all the claims. Ukraine has previously targeted the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery with drone strikes. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces claimed that a July attack on the refinery destroyed &#xA0;1.5 million tons of oil and oil products worth $540 million. The refinery partially shut down after an attack in March. Ukrainian forces regularly target Russian oil depots in addition to attacks on weapons factories and military airfields. Fossil fuel exports are the primary drivers of the Russian economy and the main source of revenue for the Kremlin&apos;s war machine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-only-oil-refinery-operating-in-russias-rostov-oblast-military-says/	2024-12-19T00:52:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Picture2-1.png
At least 100 North Korean soldiers killed, 1,000 wounded in Russia-Ukraine war, South Korean official says	At least 100 North Korean troops have been killed while fighting for Russia against Ukraine, a South Korean lawmaker said after an intelligence briefing, the BBC reported on Dec. 19. Another 1,000 of Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers have been injured, South Korean MP Lee Sung-kwon told reporters, connecting the high casualty rates to the lack of experience with terrain and drone warfare. The comments come after an undisclosed U.S. official estimated for the media that &quot;a couple of hundred&quot; of North Korean troops have been injured or killed since joining combat earlier this month. &#xA0; Pyongyang has dispatched over 10,000 of its soldiers to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast since early August, Kyiv and Western officials said. &quot;Within the Russian military, complaints have reportedly surfaced that the North Korean troops, due to their lack of knowledge about drones, are more of a burden than an asset,&quot; Lee Sung-kwon said in comments quoted by the BBC. After reporting initial but limited clashes with North Korean troops in the fall, Ukraine said that in December, Russia also began using the soldiers in ground assaults. The full extent of North Korean losses might be hard to ascertain, as President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is trying to hide the casualties. Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder confirmed on Dec. 16 that North Korean personnel had engaged in combat operations alongside Russian troops in Kursk Oblast and suffered their first losses.	https://kyivindependent.com/at-least-100-north-korean-soldiers-killed-seoul-says/	2024-12-19T00:23:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2057474423.jpg
Russia fails to breach Ukraine's defense lines in simultaneous attacks, Syrskyi says	Russian troops have intensified attacks in several areas along the front line over the past few days, but failed to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense lines, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 19. Syrskyi described the battlefield situation as &quot;extremely difficult.&quot; His statement comes as Russia keeps on advancing in Donetsk Oblast in an attempt to occupy the key towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff has recorded a total of 250 front-line clashes over the past day. &quot;In the heavy battles, Ukrainian defense forces did not allow Russian forces to breach the defense and achieve operational success in any direction,&quot; Syrskyi said following a phone call with Admiral Tony Radakin, the head of the U.K.&apos;s Armed Forces. Syrskyi said that, according to Radakin, London will &quot;significantly increase&quot; certain aspects of its support for Ukraine in 2025. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in its defense of the front line. Apart from Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine expects Russian forces to launch larger-scale attacks in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. Syrskyi said on Dec. 17 that Russian forces were also carrying out an intensive offensive in Kursk Oblast, deploying North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in the Russian region since early AUgust.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-fails-to-breach-ukraines-defenses-syrskyi-says/	2024-12-19T00:13:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/photo_2024-02-08-22_12_44.jpeg

Trump's peace envoy nominee to visit Ukraine in early January, Zelensky confirms	Keith Kellogg, nominated by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump as Ukraine peace envoy, will visit Ukraine before Trump&apos;s inauguration in January, President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed to journalists in Brussels overnight on Dec. 19, according to a Kyiv Independent reporter. A day earlier, Reuters reported that Kellogg is planning to visit Kyiv and several European capitals before Trump takes office on Jan. 20 as part of the new administration&#x2019;s effort to address Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Two unnamed sources told Reuters that Kellogg does not intend to travel to Moscow during this trip. &quot;(The visit to Ukraine) will take place in early January. We are waiting for Mr. Kellogg, and then we will talk about what he had meant,&quot; Zelensky said. The president referred to Kellogg&apos;s latest remarks about potential Ukraine-Russia peace talks. &quot;I think both sides are ready,&quot; the incoming envoy told Fox News on Dec. 18. Trump has pledged to quickly bring an end to the war but has not provided details on how he plans to do it. At his first news conference since winning the election, Trump voiced his intention to make &quot;a little progress&quot; toward peace. Zelensky recently said that the country must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025, adding that a war would &quot;end faster&quot; under a Trump administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-peace-envoy-nominee-to-visit-ukraine-in-early-january-zelensky-confirms/	2024-12-18T23:06:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1242112038.jpg
North Korea producing missiles for Russia's use in Ukraine within months, researcher tells UN	North Korea is producing ballistic missiles for use by Russia against Ukraine faster than previously thought, Jonah Leff, the executive director at the independent Conflict Armament Research (CAR) group, told the U.N. Security Council on Dec. 18. Leff said that the researchers from his group examined remnants of four North Korean missiles recovered in Ukraine in July and August. One of them had marks showing it was procured in 2024, according to the researcher. &quot;This is the first public evidence of missiles having been produced in North Korea and then used in Ukraine within a matter of months, not years,&quot; Leff said. North Korea has shaped up to be Russia&apos;s leading supporter in its full-scale war against Ukraine, providing not only ballistic missiles and artillery ammunition but also soldiers. Leff told the U.N. Security Council back in June that his group has &quot;irrefutably&quot; established that Russia is using North Korean missiles against Ukraine. According to Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence, Russian forces have launched at least 60 North Korean ballistic missiles, namely the short-range KN-23/24 model, as of early December. &quot;Their accuracy, in principle, is not very high. We understand that the technology with which they were manufactured is outdated,&quot; Andrii Cherniak, a military intelligence spokesperson, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Leff also said that some of the components found in the missile debris did not originate in North Korea and were produced as early as 2023. &quot;Despite nearly two decades of sanctions on the DPRK, it has demonstrated this year its ability to produce and supply ballistic missiles for use against Ukraine within just a matter of months,&quot; the researcher commented. The DPRK is the official name of North Korea. &quot;Through CAR&apos;s collaborative approach with industry, we have ascertained that these components found in remnants of weapons systems used against Ukraine derived from supplies by third-party distributors, mostly based in East Asia.&quot; Russia has not officially confirmed weapons shipments from North Korea but affirmed a close military and economic relationship with Pyongyang. Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a strategic partnership pact in July, and North Korea has subsequently dispatched over 10,000 soldiers to aid Russian forces in the embattled Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-producing-missiles-for-russia/	2024-12-18T22:50:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2166581524.jpg

Russian hockey player sentenced to prison in Poland for spying	Russian professional ice hockey player Maxim Sergeyev was convicted by a Polish court on Dec. 16 on charges of espionage and sentenced to nearly three years in prison. Sergeyev, who previously played on the OKS Zagliebie Sosnowiec professional ice hockey team in the second division of Poland&apos;s junior league, was arrested in June 2023, the Russian independent media outlet Meduza reported. Authorities said that Sergeyev, 21, spied on and took photos of Polish and NATO military sites, including a military equipment factory. After being recruited by a Russian intelligence official on Telegram, Sergeyev also posted pro-Russian &quot;political content&quot; on social media, writing, among other things, that the war in Ukraine &quot;does not concern Poles.&quot; Sergeyev received a small payment for the content through cryptocurrency transfers. Prosecutors also said that Sergeyev later joined a 16-person Russian cell with the intention of sabotaging a train carrying weapons and humanitarian aid to Ukraine in exchange for 10,000 euros ($10,380). Sergeyev plead guilty to the charges, and will be deported back to Russia in May 2025 once his 2 year and 11 month sentence, which he is currently serving in Lublin, is up. Several European countries have in recent months reported numerous cases of espionage and sabotage suspected of being carried out on the behest of Russia.&#x200B;&#x200B; Alleged Russian spy rings have been discovered in countries including Ukraine, the U.K., and Slovenia. Separately, it was revealed in May that Russia is recruiting violent right-wing extremists to carry out sabotage attacks in Europe and the U.K., raising concerns among intelligence chiefs.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-hockey-player-sentenced-to-prison-for-spying-in-poland/	2024-12-18T21:32:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2058422331.jpg
UK announces $283 million military aid package for Ukraine	Following his visit to Kyiv, U.K. Defence Secretary John Healey announced a 225 million pound ($283 million) military aid package for Ukraine on Dec. 19. According to media reports, the package includes over 92 million pound ($115 million) in equipment to support Ukraine&apos;s navy, including small boats, as well as reconnaissance drones. A further 68 million pounds ($85 million) will be used to supply over 1,000 counter-drone electronic warfare systems. Munitions, spare parts, and equipment will also be included in the package. The latest aid package comes as Healey made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Dec. 18 to meet with Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, in a show of solidarity for the embattled country. &quot;The brave people of Ukraine continue to defy all expectations with their unbreakable spirit... but they cannot go it alone &#x2013; which is why the UK will step up our international leadership on Ukraine throughout 2025,&quot; Healey said in a statement. The delivery of counter-drone electronic warfare systems comes as President Volodymyr Zelensky has been calling on Western allies to provide additional air defense systems as Russia continues it onslaught of aerial attacks against Ukrainian cities. During a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in Brussels on Dec. 18, Zelensky called on NATO allies to provide more air defense. The president later announced during a press briefing with reporters that the country needs 19 air defense systems to protect critical infrastructure across the country, according to a Kyiv Independent journalist present at the briefing. The U.K.&apos;s announcement on Dec. 19 comes amid news that the U.S. may run out of time to deliver the remaining $5.6 billion in military aid allocated to Ukraine before President-elect Donald Trump takes office next month.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-announces-283-million-military-aid-package-for-ukraine/	2024-12-18T20:26:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/gettyimages-2189965534-612x612.jpg
Zelensky, NATO chief Rutte discuss air defense, 'reliability of peace' during meeting in Brussels	President Volodymyr Zelensky visited Brussels on Dec. 18 for talks with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, as Ukraine seeks to secure more air defense as well effective security guarantees from its Western allies. &quot;Our talks focused on strengthening air defense for Ukraine and ensuring the reliability of the peace we are collectively working to achieve,&quot; Zelensky wrote on social media. &quot;We thank Mark, NATO Secretary General, and all our partners for their willingness to more actively enhance our air shield and work together for effective security guarantees,&quot; he added. Zelensky comments come as he continues to hold talks with EU and NATO leaders during a two-day European Summit at the EU Council in Brussels on Dec. 18-19. Over the two days, Zelensky is expected to meet with the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and the EU to discuss military and humanitarian ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s inauguration. Trump has promised to push for peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow. Frugal with details, the president-elect has hinted at reducing military aid to Ukraine to force it to the negotiating table. The Wall Street Journal reported on Dec. 12, citing undisclosed official sources, that Trump also wants European troops to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump reportedly made the comments during his Dec. 7 meeting with Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris. Zelensky said on Dec. 9 that Ukraine &quot;may consider&quot; the proposal, but only after securing a clear timeline for NATO membership. During his visit to Brussels, Zelensky said that he was &quot;discussing ideas with European leaders&quot; on the potential deployment of European peacekeeping forces to the embattled country, according to a Kyiv Independent journalist on the ground. During a press briefing on Dec. 18, Zelensky reiterated his stance, adding that the embattled country &quot;needs security guarantees, which we believe NATO membership offers most effectively.&quot; The president also called on Western allies to deliver an additional 19 air defense systems to protect critical energy infrastructure in the country. Kyiv submitted its application to join NATO in September 2022, and in July 2024, the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership&quot; &#x2014; although Ukraine has not received any definitive news about its future accession.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-nato-chief-rutte-discuss-air-defense-reliability-of-peace-during-meeting-in-brussels/	2024-12-18T19:07:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GfHSHh8WQAAB-TI.jpg
Ukraine 'discussing ideas' with European leaders on potential peacekeeping force, Zelensky says	Ukraine is &quot;discussing ideas with European leaders&quot; on the potential deployment of European peacekeeping forces to the embattled country, President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters during a press briefing on Dec. 18. &quot;We support the idea of strengthening Ukraine. The issue (of peacekeepers) lies in the details. We are discussing these details,&quot; Zelensky told reporters, according to a Kyiv Independent journalist on the ground. Zelensky comments come as he continues to hold talks with EU and NATO leaders during a two-day European Summit at the EU Council in Brussels on Dec. 18-19.

Following their meeting on Dec. 18, Zelensky said that Macron discussed the communications he has had &quot;with other partners to implement all necessary steps to achieve peace.&quot; &quot;I see that some (European leaders) are already showing positive responses to this. It&#x2019;s a complex process. You understand the risks involved,&quot; Zelensky said during his press briefing. Earlier in the day, Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson said in an interview with the Kyiv Independent that the country does not exclude the possibility of expanding its physical presence in Ukraine to strengthen the country&apos;s defenses. Macron has spearheaded the idea of sending troops to Ukraine in some capacity since February 2024. With U.S. President-elect Donald Trump set to return to the White House in January, European leaders are preparing to play a greater role in supporting Ukraine&apos;s defense needs.

Explosions reported at Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in Russia's Rostov Oblast	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Explosions occurred at the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast in the early hours of Dec. 19, Russian media reported. A fire broke out at the facility after a mass drone attack, the Russian Telegram news channel Astra reported, citing eyewitnesses. The outlet also posted video footage of the site in flames. Officials have not commented on the alleged attack. The Kyiv Independent could not confirm the report at the time of publication. Shortly before reports began circulating of the strike on the Novoshakhtinsk refinery, acting Rostov Oblast Governor Yury Slyusar claimed that Russian air defenses shot down seven drones over the region. The reported attack comes on the heels of an alleged strike on the Kamensky Combine, another Russian industrial facility in Rostov Oblast. Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s counter-disinformation center, said the site was attacked on Dec. 18. The Kamensky Combine is one of the largest chemical plants in Russia. The facility produces rocket fuel, including fuel for intercontinental ballistic missiles, Kovalenko said. Ukraine has previously targeted the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery with drone strikes. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces claimed that a July attack on the refinery destroyed &#xA0;1.5 million tons of oil and oil products worth $540 million. The refinery partially shut down after an attack in March. Ukrainian forces regularly target Russian oil depots in addition to attacks on weapons factories and military air fields. Fossil fuel exports are the primary drivers of the Russian economy and the main source of revenue for the Kremlin&apos;s war machine.	https://kyivindependent.com/explosions-reported-at-novoshakhtinsk-oil-refinery-in-russias-rostov-oblast/	2024-12-18T16:00:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1245921994.jpg

World Bank approves over $2 billion in funds for Ukraine	The World Bank&apos;s Board of Directors on Dec. 18 approved $2.05 billion in Development Policy Operation (DPO) grants to Ukraine, part of which is funded by a portion of the new U.S. $20 billion loan backed by frozen Russian assets. The funding supports the Ukrainian government in implementing reforms that will strengthen and stabilize the economy, the World Bank said in press release. The DPO funds are co-financed by two sources: $1 billion from the Facilitation of Resources to Invest in Strengthening Ukraine Financial Intermediary Fund (F.O.R.T.I.S. Ukraine FIF) and $1.05 billion from the Advancing Needed Credit Enhancement (ADVANCE) Ukraine Trust Fund, supported by the U.K. and Japan. The $1 billion grant via the intermediary fund represents the first payment Ukraine will receive from the Group of Seven (G7) plan to issue $50 billion in financing to Kyiv backed by frozen Russian assets. The U.S., which is contributing a loan worth $20 billion to the G7 effort, transferred its portion to the World Bank&apos;s intermediary fund on Dec. 10. &quot;Despite significant challenges, the Government of Ukraine has stabilized the economy and remains focused on its development goals, particularly its ambition to join the European Union,&quot; Bob Saum, World Bank Regional Country Director for Eastern Europe, said on Dec. 18. &quot;There have been significant achievements, and Ukraine continues to advance in its efforts to implement reforms to establish a vibrant market economy. The World Bank Group and our international partners will continue to support the Ukrainian people in realizing their EU aspirations.&quot; The DPO funds will focus on Ukraine&apos;s growth potential, supporting the railway sector, banking, and renewable energy generation, the World Bank said. Funding will also support efforts to increase domestic revenues.	https://kyivindependent.com/world-bank-approves-over-2-billion-in-funds-for-ukraine/	2024-12-18T14:31:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2171755120.jpg
One of Russia's largest chemical plants reportedly attacked in Rostov Oblast	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being edited. The Kamensky Combine, one of the largest chemical plants in Russia, was hit in an attack on Rostov Oblast, Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s counter-disinformation center, claimed on Dec. 18. The factory produces rocket fuel and components of ammunition and explosives, Kovalenko said. Russian officials have not commented on the alleged strike on the Kamensky Combine. Rostov Oblast Acting Governor Yury Slyusar claimed that Russian air defense forces shot down 10 missiles over the region on Dec. 18. Kovalenko posted a video on his official Telegram channel purporting to show explosions at the plant. The Kamensky Combine &quot;is engaged in the production of rocket fuel (specializing in the manufacture of solid fuel components for rocket engines, in particular for multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) and intercontinental ballistic missiles using solid fuel),&quot; Kovalenko said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims at time of publication. The Kamensky Combine has been sanctioned by the E.U., U.K., and U.S. for its role in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. The reported strike comes a week after Ukraine allegedly struck a boiler plant in Rostov Oblast in an overnight missile attack on Dec. 11. Kyiv continues to target military-industrial complex facilities, airbases, and oil refineries in Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/one-of-russias-largest-chemical-plants-reportedly-hit-in-attack-on-rostov-oblast/	2024-12-18T13:35:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/rostov.png
25% of Russian malls may face bankruptcy in 2025	Approximately one quarter of Russia&apos;s shopping centers face pre-bankruptcy conditions and risk closure by 2025, according to reports from industry leaders published by Russian media on Dec. 18. The forecast comes as Russia faces record-breaking interest and inflation rates amid an ongoing economic crisis. Representatives from the Russian Council of Shopping Centers (RCSC) said that about 25% of Russia&apos;s malls are at risk of closure in the coming year. &#xA0;The challenges stem from a combination of factors, including the departure of major foreign companies after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, rising operational costs, and increased competition from online marketplaces. A significant rise in interest rates on commercial loans, driven by the Central Bank&apos;s policies, has exacerbated financial difficulties. Oleg Voytsekhovsky, managing director of the RCSC, said that many shopping centers are unable to refinance existing loans or secure new financing. This has hampered profitability and the ability to maintain and modernize facilities. Pavel Lyulin, RCSC&apos;s vice president, pointed to a sharp increase in property values, leading to higher tax burden on shopping centers. In some cases, taxes have increased by as much as tenfold over the past two years. Lyulin estimated that about half of the income from malls is now consumed by taxes, with additional increases expected in 2025. Russia&apos;s Central Bank raised the interest rate from 19% to 21% in October to curb inflation amid economic strains caused by the war in Ukraine. Central Bank chief Elvira Nabiullina said on Dec. 4 that further rate hikes are under consideration. After the launch of the full-scale invasion, Russia saw an exodus of Western companies reluctant to contribute to the country&apos;s economy and war effort. The combined total of losses for foreign companies that exited Russia since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has exceeded $107 billion, Reuters reported on March 28.	https://kyivindependent.com/quarter-of-russian-malls-may-face-bankruptcy-by-2025-report-warns/	2024-12-18T12:51:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1251631736.jpg
Ukraine war latest: 'Couple hundred' North Korean troops lost fighting for Russia against Ukraine, AP reports	Key developments on Dec. 18: A couple hundred North Korean troops have been killed or wounded fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast against Ukraine, the Associated Press (AP) reported on Dec. 17, citing a senior U.S. military official. The official did not give an exact figure but said the high casualty rate was in part due to the soldiers&apos; lack of battle experience. Russia has reportedly deployed over 10,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in Kursk Oblast since early August. The full extent of North Korean losses is hard to ascertain, as President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is trying to hide the casualties. Ukraine&apos;s Special Operation Forces said that they had killed 50 North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast in three days and injured 47 more. Despite the losses within Russian and North Korean ranks, the Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Kursk Oblast seem to be increasingly on the back foot, facing a Russian advantage in manpower and equipment. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 17 that Russian and North Korean forces are carrying out an intensive offensive in Kursk Oblast for the third day in a row. &quot;For the third day, Russian forces have been conducting intensive offensive operations in Kursk Oblast, actively using North Korean units,&quot; Syrskyi said in an online address to the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities held in Lviv, according to Interfax-Ukraine. Citing Ukrainian soldiers, The Economist wrote that Ukraine likely lost around half of the territory it had captured in the initial phase of the operation in August and September. An officer talking to the outlet connected this development to the redeployment of elite units that first spearheaded the offensive. Ukraine likely seeks to hold on to a piece of Russian territory as a possible bargaining chip ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s expected push for peace negotiations. Sweden does not exclude the possibility of expanding its physical presence in Ukraine to strengthen the country&apos;s defenses, Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson said in an interview with the Kyiv Independent published on Dec. 18. In response to a question over whether Sweden would potentially take part in a more direct physical presence in Ukraine amid talks of potentially deploying peacekeepers to monitor a possible ceasefire, Jonson said he doesn&apos;t &quot;exclude that possibility.&quot; The minister noted that Sweden already has a physical presence in Ukraine through its defense procurement agency that works with the Ukrainian government to purchase military equipment. Jonson also said Sweden does not rule out the possibility of conducting military training inside Ukraine. As of October, Sweden&apos;s military support to Ukraine has amounted to around $4.4 billion since the start of the full-scale invasion. Jonson stressed the necessity of bolstering Ukraine&#x2019;s defenses against Russian aggression and said he supports extending the mandate of the EU Military Assistance Mission (EUMAM), which coordinates military support for Kyiv. He called for urgent measures to secure peace in Ukraine by 2025, describing the situation as &#x201C;absolutely dire and extremely important.&#x201D; &#x201C;The stakes in this war are enormous for the Ukrainian people, but also for the rest of Europe,&#x201D; he said. Russian security forces have detained two suspects over the assassination of a top Kremlin general and his assistant in Moscow, Russian media reported on Dec. 18. Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov was killed in Moscow on Dec. 17, with a bomb attached to a scooter. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed responsibility for the attack. According to Kommersant and several other Russian outlets cited by the independent news website Meduza, the two suspects carried out the killings on the orders of the SBU. They were detained by police who saw surveillance cameras&#x2019; footage from the scene which recorded a pair of suspicious cars. Russian Telegram channel 112 said the suspects had already confessed to authorities. Russian officials have not yet announced the conclusion of the investigation. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. Kirillov, 54, was the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops (RKhBZ). A day before his assassination, Ukrainian prosecutors charged Kirillov in absentia with the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine. Moscow&apos;s forces have been increasingly deploying gas attacks against Ukrainian troops, the Kyiv Independent reported in August, and Kirillov has since been sanctioned by the U.K. and Canada for his role in their use. &quot;Kirillov was a war criminal and a completely legitimate target, as he gave orders to use banned chemical weapons against Ukrainian soldiers,&quot; an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 17. &quot;Retribution for war crimes is inevitable.&quot; Peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow will only be possible when Russia has run out of resources to fight its full-scale war, Andriy Yermak, head of the Presidential Office, said on Dec. 17. &quot;I would like to emphasize once again that only the strong are helped, so we must remain strong,&quot; he told the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities in Lviv, in comments reported by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). &quot;Real negotiations for a lasting peace will begin only when the enemy no longer has the resources to continue the war,&quot; he added. With no military plan in sight to retake lost territories, pressure is mounting on Kyiv to enter into peace negotiations with Russia. Yermak warned that any concessions to Russia would only allow it to replenish its army and launch a new offensive in the future. &quot;If Russia is not forced to make a just peace, there will be no peace. There will be a pause and Moscow will use this pause to restore forces and continue the offensive,&quot; Yermak said. During the same event, President Volodymyr Zelensky slammed Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban for negotiating with Moscow about peace over Ukraine&#x2019;s head &quot;without leverage.&quot; Orban flew to Moscow in July during a so-called &quot;peace mission&quot; and phoned Russian President Vladimir Putin in December. &quot;How will he put pressure on Putin? With a joke, a smile? Let him keep it,&quot; Zelensky said. Slovak President Peter Pellegrini, also argued in December that achieving peace in Ukraine would likely require accepting partial territorial losses and called for the immediate start of peace negotiations. However, some of Ukraine&#x2019;s European allies rejected such ideas, with Poland&#x2019;s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski earlier this month arguing that Western nations should push Russia, not Ukraine, into peace negotiations to stop the war. The U.S. may run out of time to deliver the remaining $5.6 billion in military aid allocated to Ukraine before Donald Trump takes office next month, The New York Times (NYT) reported on Dec. 17. &quot;We will continue to do drawdown packages for the remainder of this administration,&quot; a U.S. official told the NYT. &quot;But $5.6 billion is a substantial amount of authority, so I would certainly anticipate that there could be remaining authority that would transition and be available for the next administration to use,&quot; they added. Although the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden plans to allocate some funds from the presidential drawdown authority, it is unlikely to spend the whole amount. The presidential drawdown authority is a scheme that allows any U.S. President to transfer weapons from the Pentagon&#x2019;s own stockpile instead of ordering them from manufacturers which would take precious time. The U.S. gave more than $60 billion worth of military aid to Ukraine during the Biden administration. Trump&#x2019;s support for Ukraine hangs in the air as analysts and politicians try to gauge his plans to bring peace to Ukraine, as he promised to end the war within &quot;24 hours&quot; after reelection without revealing details. There are concerns that Trump&apos;s victory might lead to the U.S. withdrawing its military support for Ukraine, leaving it up to European allies to help Kyiv resist Russia&#x2019;s war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-couple-hundred-north-korean-troops-lost-fighting-for-russia-against-ukraine/	2024-12-18T12:44:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029632286.jpg
Russian bombers detected in Alaskan air defense zone	The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) reported on Dec. 18 that it had detected and tracked four Russian military aircraft operating within the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). The ADIZ as a designated stretch of international airspace that necessitates the identification of all aircraft for national security purposes. NORAD reported that the Russian planes remained in international airspace and did not breach U.S. or Canadian sovereign airspace. Such events occur &quot;regularly,&quot; the agency said. Russia&apos;s state-owned TASS news agency confirmed the presence of Tu-95MS bombers near Alaska, saying that the flight was part of a planned operation. These aircraft are the same type as those Russia uses to carry out large-scale missile strikes on Ukraine. A number of similar incidents occurred earlier this year. U.S. and Canadian fighter jets on July 25 intercepted Russian and Chinese military aircraft in the ADIZ. NORAD also reported tracking four Russian warplanes in the zone in mid-August. The incidents underscore ongoing tensions surrounding the strategically significant Arctic region, where both Russia and NATO members continue to assert their presence.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-bombers-approach-alaskas-air-defense-zone-norad-says/	2024-12-18T12:19:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1240508647.jpg
‘Not a good idea’ — Trump's peace envoy nominee criticizes Russian general assassination	U.S. General Keith Kellogg, nominated as Ukraine peace envoy by President-elect Donald Trump, criticized the recent assassination of Russian Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov during an interview with Fox News on Dec. 18. Kirillov and his assistant were reportedly killed on Dec. 17 in Moscow by a bomb attached to a scooter. Ukraine&#x2019;s Security Service (SBU) claimed responsibility, calling him a &#x201C;war criminal&#x201D; who allegedly ordered the use of chemical weapons against Ukrainian troops. Kellogg said the incident was a potential violation of the rules of warfare, however, emphasizing that it does not obstruct possible negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. Kellogg acknowledged that Kirillov&apos;s targeting could be seen as legitimate, given the accusations against him. However, he cautioned that killing military officers in their hometowns may &quot;escalate tensions.&quot; &quot;When you kill admirals or generals in their hometown, it&apos;s kind of like you&apos;re extending it. And I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s a smart thing to do,&quot; Kellogg said. He added that the alleged use of a mercenary in Kirillov&#x2019;s assassination was &quot;not a good idea at all.&quot; Russian security forces have detained two suspects over the assassination of a top Kremlin general and his assistant in Moscow. Two sources cited by Russian media outlet RBC indicated that investigators consider Ukrainian involvement the most plausible scenario.	https://kyivindependent.com/not-a-good-idea-trump-peace-envoy-criticizes-russian-lieutenant-assassination/	2024-12-18T12:06:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1242112038.jpg
Kursk operation prompted Russia's first POW exchange initiative, ombudsman says	Amid Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, Moscow has, for the first time, initiated communication with Ukraine on prisoner-of-war (POW) exchanges, Ukrainian Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said in an interview with Ukrainska Pravda on Dec. 18. &#x201C;This year, for the first time, the Russian side personally took the initiative to communicate,&#x201D; Lubinets said. &#x201C;It was at the start of the Ukrainian Armed Forces&#x2019; military operation in Kursk Oblast. I believe the Kursk operation provided strong arguments in favor of Ukraine.&#x201D; Since the beginning of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine and Russia have carried out nearly 60 prisoner exchanges. Around 3,600 Ukrainians have been freed, while tens of thousands &#x2014; both military personnel and civilians &#x2014; are estimated to remain in captivity. During the surprise incursion into Kursk Oblast, Ukraine captured hundreds of Russian conscript soldiers stationed in the region. Some of them were exchanged during the 58th swap carried out on Oct. 18. Lubinets said that Russia continues to engage in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, including in the context of prisoner exchanges, undermining Ukrainian authorities and the negotiation process. In January, a Russian Il-76 plane reportedly carrying 65 Ukrainian POWs crashed in Russia&apos;s Belgorod Oblast. Russia claimed all the POWs died in the crash. Ukraine, however, has not confirmed this and called for an international investigation &#x2014; a proposal Moscow rejected. The Olenivka prison, located in Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast, housed Ukrainian POWs and civilians, many captured after the fall of Mariupol in May 2022. In June 2022, the prison was struck by an explosion that killed at least 54 POWs and injured over 150. According to Ukrainian authorities, Russia deliberately targeted the prison, specifically the part of the building where Ukrainian Azov Regiment members had been moved to. Kyiv has claimed that Russia used artillery or a thermobaric munition in the attack.	https://kyivindependent.com/kursk-operation-prompted-russias-first-pow-exchange-initiative-ombudsman-says/	2024-12-18T11:45:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1752126648.jpg
Two EU accession clusters for Ukraine to open in first half of 2025, EU official says	Two European Union accession clusters for Ukraine are expected to open during the first half of 2025 under Poland&#x2019;s presidency of the EU Council, a high-ranking EU official told The Kyiv Independent on Dec. 18. EU accession negotiations are structured according to clusters and chapters. During the negotiations, a candidate country prepares to implement EU laws and standards. Poland&#x2019;s EU presidency is set to begin on Jan. 5, 2025, with the clusters likely to be opened closer to the summer, according to the EU official. These developments align with Ukraine&#x2019;s ambitious goal of accelerating its integration into the EU. Speaking on Dec. 17, President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized Ukraine&apos;s commitment to advancing its EU accession process. &#x201C;During Poland&#x2019;s EU presidency, we expect to open at least two clusters and six in total. Our goal is very ambitious &#x2014; to open all the clusters next year,&#x201D; he said. The EU&#x2019;s Commissioner for Enlargement, Oliver Varhelyi, said that Ukraine could potentially join the bloc by 2029 if it successfully implements necessary reforms. The European Commission has praised Ukraine&apos;s progress in areas such as judicial reform, the rule of law, and anti-corruption measures. Ukraine was granted EU candidate status in June 2022, with the European Council approving the launch of accession talks in December 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/two-eu-accession-clusters-for-ukraine-to-open-in-first-half-of-2025-eu-official-says/	2024-12-18T10:27:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-497631536.jpg
A shake-up in Ukraine’s drone buying alarms corruption watchdogs	The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers discreetly dethroned the former czar of drone purchases &#xA0;&#x2014; Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov &#x2014; as the result of a one-sided power struggle from the Head of the President&#x2019;s Office, Andriy Yermak, allege observers. A new decree shifted a key office in the drone purchasing process away from Fedorov, and the new leader of the office is, say anti-corruption watchdogs, a yes-man for Yermak, President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s closest ally who has attracted controversy over his ever-growing influence and overreach. Critics fear the responsible agency may stop reporting details on over a billion dollars a year of government drone contracts, leaving them vulnerable to embezzlement. Before February 2022, Fedorov was mostly occupied with putting government services onto mobile apps, as well as improving the lives of Ukrainian techies and IT workers. At the outset of the war, he was early to spot the increasing use of drones by Ukrainian soldiers to make up for the lack of air power and reconnaissance. From his position at the center of a network of recently militarized techies following Russia&#x2019;s invasion, Fedorov became the face of a new &#x201C;army of drones,&#x201D; a government initiative launched in July 2022 to supply the Ukrainian military with unmanned aerial vehicles.

(Sergei Supinsky / AFP via Getty Images)The popularity of such drones was slow to break through the traditional defense apparatus. Then-Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov downplayed the role of civilian drones in military operations, saying in December 2022, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s not idealize these Mavics. I don&#x2019;t have Mavics in my orders, just so you understand. Soldiers aren&#x2019;t asking for them,&#x201D; making fun of them as drones for filming weddings rather than fighting wars. At the time, soldiers were actually sourcing donations for Mavics, with Ukrainian civilians pitching in to send them to their favorite units. Due to Reznikov&#x2019;s attitude, Fedorov ended up spearheading government drone procurement. For his wartime work, Fedorov has become a major public persona within Ukraine and abroad, including a glowing profile in Wired magazine. He hosted a short-lived YouTube series, welcoming private start-ups to the ministry. Fedorov also drove the set-up of Brave1, which links his ministry and the Defense Ministry to sponsor military technology. Despite Fedorov&#x2019;s role, the actual budget for the government&#x2019;s drone purchases initially ended up not in the hands of the Defense Ministry nor the Digital Transformation Ministry, but rather with the State Special Communications Service of Ukraine. The Communications Service is the agency in charge of securing government and military communications and cyber defense. The Cabinet of Ministers granted Fedorov semi-formal authority over the long-overlooked Communications Service as it underwent reforms starting in 2020. As fundraising money flew into Ukraine following Russia&#x2019;s invasion, the Communications Service ended up holding the purse strings for drone fundraising by United24, a Ukrainian-government-run platform to raise money for the war effort. The situation was enshrined into law in June. The Communications Service found itself in possession of a considerable war chest as a result of these changes. The agency&#x2019;s budget for next year includes Hr 46.9 billion &#x2014; about $1.125 billion specifically allocated to drones. The service retains that drone money in a special fund far larger than its regular budget. That fund also dwarfs the size of the whole budget for the Digital Transformation Ministry, which is just under Hr 2.5 billion &#x2014; about $60 million. The service has seen scandals in the past. Former head Yuriy Shchyhol along with his deputy, Viktor Zhora, were arrested for embezzling Hr 62 billion in software last November. Viktor Zhora, a former deputy head of the State Special Communications Service, on Dec. 7, 2022. (Viktor Zhora/X)A year later, the Communications Service saw another shake-up of leadership and, as a result, control over that billion-dollar drone budget. Fedorov&#x2019;s appointee Yuriy Myronenko announced his surprise resignation from his post as head of the Communications Service on Nov. 15. Myronenko was appointed to lead the agency in charge of drone procurement after its previous head resigned amid embezzlement allegations. He himself is a former commander of a drone company in the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Upon resignation, Fedorov took Myronenko into his team: Myronenko was appointed digital transformation vice minister, under Fedorov. Meanwhile, all eyes were on who would replace him at the Communications Service and be in charge of the rich drone budget. Oleksandr Potiy, longtime deputy chief of the Service, took over the job soon after Myronenko&#x2019;s resignation. The service subsequently named Rostislav Zamlynsky as Potiy&#x2019;s deputy. Just a few days later, the Cabinet of Ministers formally established that the Communications Office would report to the cabinet itself, not to Fedorov&#x2019;s Digital Transformation Ministry. Critics, including anti-corruption activists and journalists, were quick to allege that the changes indicate that the lucrative and popular direction of drone procurement was effectively taken over by the allies of Andriy Yermak, head of Zelensky&#x2019;s office. The relationship between Yermak and the new leaders of the Communications Service is not direct but widely treated as fact by critics. &#x201C;Potiy&#x2019;s a basic guy from the military. He&#x2019;s very much under the president&#x2019;s office,&#x201D; Valeriia Radchenko, a communications officer at the Anti-Corruption Action Center tells the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;There will be no super direct connections. These guys are smart enough not to put their own classmates in these positions.&#x201D; &#x201C;He&#x2019;s a man of Yermak&#x2019;s team,&#x201D; says Yuriy Nikolov, a Ukrainian journalist and investigator. Mariana Bezuhla, a member of the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament, also named the ouster at the Communications Service the latest of the &#x201C;intrigues of Yermak&#x201D; in a Dec. 11 Facebook post. Bezuhla is a former member of Zelensky&#x2019;s party who was excluded from it at the start of 2024.

(Viktor Kovalchuk/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)&#x201C;Andriy Yermak thinks politically and sees Fedorov as a competitor. The prospect of a young, ambitious, and independent Fedorov in the role of defense minister is Andriy Borisovych (Yermak)&#x2019;s nightmare,&#x201D; Bezuhla continued, referring to Fedorov&#x2019;s wartime advancement from an initially technological station and his recent moves to expand the influence of drones across the Defense Ministry. Nikolov also points at Yermak allegedly seeing Fedorov as competition and the last standing member of the president&#x2019;s original circle. &#x201C;When Yermak went into the president&#x2019;s office in 2020, he cleared out everyone who helped Zelensky win in 2019,&#x201D; Nikolov told the Kyiv Independent, noting Fedorov as one of few who survived. Others pointed at Zamlynsky, the new deputy head of the Communications Service. His previous tenure was in the Defense Ministry at the time when it was shaken by procurement scandals. Editor-in-Chief of Ukrainian news outlet Censor.Net Yuriy Butusov likewise portrayed the Communications Service reshuffle as an unambiguous power grab on the part of Yermak in a Nov. 24 Facebook post. Butusov has been an outspoken critic of Zelensky and Yermak. &#x201C;The Head of the President&#x2019;s Office, (Andriy) Yermak, will busy himself with the drones, but the money will be allocated by the bureaucrat who controlled the finances under Reznikov,&#x201D; Butusov wrote, illustrating Fedorov&#x2019;s recent efforts to expand the influence of drones across the military. Butusov pointed to new officials who Fedorov had put forward to the chain of drone command, including a vice minister of defense and Vadym Sukharevsky as the first commander of Ukraine&#x2019;s new Unmanned Systems Force. &#x201C;As soon as Fedorov gave voice to this plan, Yermak became his fatal enemy. Yermak tries to control all internal policy.&#x201D; For his part, Fedorov put out an eminently diplomatic statement on his Telegram channel, saying that the stable of ministries said to be jockeying over drone acquisitions have &#x201C;one common goal &#x2014; to defend the country.&#x201D; &#x201C;Please, without the attempts to turn the institutions of government against each other through planted information, rumors, and hunts for empty sensationalism that nobody needs,&#x201D; wrote Fedorov. The concrete consequences of the change-up remain uncertain. Bezuhla claimed that a shortage of drones is already apparent at the front, and that &#x201C;purchases and developments in the sector have fallen critically &#x2014; literally over the course of a month by several times. Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry, over the whole of 2024 has purchased almost no drones.&#x201D; Public concern is so great that the Service has spent the first half of December releasing a series of announcements assuring that &#x201C;the delivery of drones to the front will go according to plan.&#x201D; &#x201C;All of us are working as one team, for we understand well that only quality work from every link will secure high effectiveness of the whole process,&#x201D; reads a quote the announcement attributes to Potiy. One key area of concern on the part of critics is the transparency of the Communications Service&#x2019;s drone acquisitions, specifically their published contracts. &#x201C;As of now (the new Communications Service) can find ways to close information about those contracts. They publish reports of how much they are spending on these drones,&#x201D; explains Radchenko. &#x201C;They can just make the decision to hide this kind of information, and then say that they procured drones for $1 million &#x2014; but not the price per drone.&#x201D; &#x201C;Fedorov&#x2019;s team had the brains to make these purchases public, but, legally, they have the right to make these purchases private,&#x201D; says Nikolov, whose website, Nashi Hroshi (Our Money) &#x2014; specializes in investigations based on Ukraine&#x2019;s public contracts. The ultimate fear is that &#x201C;they could take the same budget to buy half as many drones,&#x201D; Nikolov explains, noting the funds could easily be siphoned off. Two men practice flying a drone during a combat training day in Lviv Oblast, Ukraine, on Feb. 22, 2023. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Limited transparency has been at the heart of many of the scandals surrounding Ukrainian military acquisitions, many of which, unlike those civil drone purchases, aren&#x2019;t publicly reported at all. Concern over Zamlynsky&#x2019;s appointment reflects his presence in the Ukrainian Defense Ministry during a rations acquisitions scandal that helped end Oleksiy Reznikov&#x2019;s tenure as defense minister in 2023. When contacted, the Digital Transformation Ministry over which Fedorov presides directed the Kyiv Independent to the Communications Service. When reached, a press representative for the President&#x2019;s Office, which Yermak leads, directed the Kyiv Independent to the Defense Ministry and did not respond to further questions. A top advisor to Yermak did not return a request for comment. Neither the Communications Service nor the Defense Ministry returned requests for comment. A representative for the Strategic Industries Ministry directed the Kyiv Independent to a deputy minister who could not be reached. Natalia Kushnerska, the head of Brave1, which coordinates defense tech between the Defense Ministry and the Digital Transformation Ministry, would not comment on the situation when reached. Mykhailo Fedorov himself could not be reached.	https://kyivindependent.com/a-shake-up-in-ukraines-drone-buying-alarms-corruption-watchdogs/	2024-12-18T10:03:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2182889803.jpg
Sweden 'does not exclude' more direct physical presence in Ukraine to bolster defense	Sweden does not exclude the possibility of expanding its physical presence in Ukraine to strengthen the country&apos;s defenses, Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson said in an interview with the Kyiv Independent published on Dec. 18. In response to a question over whether Sweden would potentially take part in a more direct physical presence in Ukraine amid talks of potentially deploying peacekeepers to monitor a potential ceasefire, Jonson said he doesn&apos;t &quot;exclude that possibility.&quot; The minister noted that Sweden already has a physical presence in Ukraine through its defense procurement agency that works with the Ukrainian government to purchase military equipment. Jonson also said Sweden does not rule out the possibility of conducting military training inside Ukraine. As of October, Sweden&apos;s military to support to Ukraine has amounted to around $4.4 billion since the start of the full-scale invasion. Jonson stressed the necessity of bolstering Ukraine&#x2019;s defenses against Russian aggression and said he supports extending the mandate of the EU Military Assistance Mission (EUMAM), which coordinates military support for Kyiv. He called for urgent measures to secure peace in Ukraine by 2025, describing the situation as &#x201C;absolutely dire and extremely important.&#x201D; &#x201C;The stakes in this war are enormous for the Ukrainian people, but also for the rest of Europe,&#x201D; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/swedish-defense-minister-does-not-rule-out-eu-nato-troop-presence-in-ukraine/	2024-12-18T09:59:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2017683210.jpg
EU does not expect Ukraine war ceasefire, peace talks in near future, EU official says	The EU does not anticipate potential negotiations or a ceasefire deal between Ukraine and Russia in the near future, a high-ranking EU official told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 18. The official also said that there are no discussions currently ongoing at the EU level on sending European troops to Ukraine to enforce a potential ceasefire. Western leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, have reportedly considered deploying peacekeepers to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump on Dec. 12 reiterated his view that European troops should lead efforts to monitor a ceasefire, which is in line with other previous statements of his that Europe must assume more responsibility in addressing Russian aggression and European security. The EU official&apos;s comments contrast with statements made by Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Dec. 10, who expressed optimism that peace negotiations to end the war in Ukraine could start as early as this winter. President Volodymyr Zelensky has made it clear that Kyiv would only consider peacekeeping proposals after securing a clear timeline for NATO membership.	https://kyivindependent.com/no-eu-troops-in-ukraine-for-now-costa-highlights-integration-efforts/	2024-12-18T09:27:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2183596448-1.jpg
As Lukashenko gears up for new election, Belarusian political prisoners recount horrors they endured in his prisons	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in power for 30 years, is looking to reelect himself for the seventh time. In the run-up to the January 2025 presidential elections, Lukashenko has pardoned prisoners convicted of extremism, claiming that it was a &quot;humane gesture&quot; toward those who had &quot;gone astray.&quot; Far from being criminals, those pardoned were political prisoners incarcerated following the public uprising sparked by Lukashenko&apos;s previous &quot;electoral victory&quot; in 2020. Kiryl, a journalist whose name has been changed due to safety concerns, became one of those political prisoners after Belarusian security services detained him on the streets of Minsk. &quot;A gun was pressed to my back, I was put into a car, a bag was pulled over my head, and I was taken to a forest,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;They beat me without saying anything or making demands and then took me home where a search was already underway. After the search, I was taken for questioning, and they told me to pack my things because I wouldn&apos;t be returning home.&quot; More than 1,300 political prisoners remain in Lukashenko&apos;s prisons, according to the Belarusian human rights organization Viasna. While in custody, they face harassment and abuse by prison authorities, deprivation of medical care, harsh living conditions, and forced labor. The seventh wave of pardons issued in early December brings the total number of political prisoners released since July 2024 to 207 individuals. Those who were freed are speaking out about the ongoing terror their fellow citizens back home continue to face. Most do it anonymously to protect their family, their friends, and themselves from a new round of state-sponsored persecutions. As a journalist, Kiryl started to attract the attention of Belarusian authorities for reporting on Lukashenko&apos;s mishandling of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, during which no quarantine was imposed, and the morgues quickly became overcrowded. He also covered the humanitarian crisis that unfolded in 2021 after Lukashenko&apos;s regime transferred migrants from the Middle East to the Polish-Belarusian border to ignite tensions with the European Union, which had imposed sanctions for the political crackdowns following the 2020 presidential election. The journalist&apos;s last report before being arrested was about Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. During questioning, the security service officers asked Kiryl who had put him up to making the reports, who was paying him, and what ties he had with Poland or Ukraine. &quot;I explained I was reporting on facts,&quot; Kiryl said. &quot;How could I not report on what was happening?&quot; Kiryl was taken to Okrestina, one of Belarus&apos;s most notorious detention centers, where many of the protestors detained during the 2020 revolution were subjected to brutal torture.

(Sergei Gapon / AFP via Getty Images)The International Committee for the Investigation of Torture in Belarus documented over 100 cases of abuse at Okrestina. Former prisoners described men being beaten so severely that others could hear the sound of their bones breaking. Guards also inflicted psychological torture upon the prisoners, telling them, &quot;You&apos;ll die here.&quot; The threat of death extends beyond intimidation, though &#x2014; Viasna has documented at least seven known cases of political prisoners who have died in Lukashenko&apos;s prisons since 2020. In Okrestina, Kiryl was placed in a small cell with 12 other prisoners. All of them were forced to stand throughout the day, and they had to sleep on the floor at night. The prisoners were brought into the corridor twice daily for beatings, and the floors were washed with bleach, making it difficult to breathe. After five days, Kiryl was transferred to a pre-trial detention center where there were &quot;always more people than beds.&quot; There was no natural light in the overcrowded basement cell, and prisoners had to take turns sleeping in shifts. He spent a year there before finally facing trial. During the trial, the prosecutor openly laughed at Kiryl&apos;s lawyer while the judge ignored his defense. The prosecution accused the journalist of &quot;intentional distortion of facts,&quot; charged him with &quot;threatening national security,&quot; and sentenced him to four years in prison. There was a significant surge among Belarusians in demand for independent, high-quality news during the 2020 presidential campaign and the protests that followed, as the public sought accurate information amid a climate of state-controlled media and escalating political unrest. &quot;(People) felt the urge to act because, at that moment, we were deciding the fate of the country,&quot; Iryna Shchasnaia, who worked as an editor in independent media, told the Kyiv Independent. But she realized by the end of that summer that individuals like herself would be targeted in the growing political crackdowns, prompting her to flee the country for Kyiv. During Shchasnaia&apos;s time in Ukraine, the fear of arrest faded, and she continued to work while awaiting to reunite with her husband and child in the fall. Yet, she was filled with a deep longing for Belarus and began planning her return. &quot;I told my friends in Kyiv about my plan. They were frightened for me and said that returning to Belarus was sheer foolishness and suicide. But I stopped listening to anyone, I completely lost my sense of reality. One day, I packed my things and went home to Minsk,&quot; she said. Though she felt a sense of relief upon returning to Belarus and reuniting with her family, the arrest of several acquaintances quickly underscored the growing peril surrounding her. By November, she became increasingly aware that she was being closely monitored by authorities, who, in a stark display of intimidation, were no longer even attempting to conceal their surveillance. On the morning of Nov. 18, security service officers burst into her home. &quot;My mother and my 10-year-old son were home. It was brutal and terrifying. I deeply regret that my loved ones had to witness it,&quot; she said. &quot;Then they took me out of the apartment, and I knew it would be a very long time before I returned home.&quot; That evening, she was charged with &quot;preparing to participate in mass unrest&quot; and taken to Okrestina. &quot;The first days were a blur. I remember constantly worrying about my husband and son. I didn&apos;t know if they had managed to leave the country after my arrest,&quot; she said. By late spring, Shchasnaia had passed through two other pre-trial detention centers. At the first one, she &quot;braced for something terrible&quot; when the guard opened the door to her cell, but she was met by three other women who offered her coffee and something to eat. After being transferred in April to another pre-trial detention center in the eastern city of Mahilyow, Shchasnaia met non-political inmates but &quot;managed to find some common ground with them.&quot; Later, she shared her cell with another political prisoner and recalled how they were a source of deep emotional support for each other. By May 2021, Shchasnaia had been sentenced to four years in prison. She was transferred to a prison in the southeastern city of Homel to serve out her sentence. &quot;Somehow, I had a sense my life turned into hell with this latest development,&quot; she said. &quot;And I was right.&quot; Belarusian political prisoners&apos; uniforms are marked with a yellow tag, making them easily identifiable from other inmates. Under the watchful eye of the prison authorities, they are frequently targeted and accused of fabricated offenses. Kiryl recalled how one young man was sent to solitary confinement for failing to shave even though his face was covered in razor cuts from shaving too often out of fear of that very punishment. Torture in prison has increasingly taken the form of psychological abuse, with methods designed to erode the prisoners&apos; sense of self and hope, according to Kiryl. Yet, it was common practice just a year and a half ago for the head of the penal colony to publicly single out a political prisoner, kick him in the chest, and beat him in front of others. Some prisoners who collaborate with the prison authorities would also try to provoke political prisoners to create problems for them. While political prisoners were not isolated from one another, they understood that if they were seen communicating, they could be punished. &quot;I met one of our well-known opposition politicians there, and although we only talked about some general topics, someone snitched on us &#x2014; both of us were sent to solitary confinement for 10 days,&quot; Kiryl said. Solitary confinement consisted of a concrete floor and open windows, regardless of the season. On one occasion, Kiryl was placed there with a high fever despite deprivation of medical care being against prison regulations. The prison doctor dismissed his fever, saying that &quot;if he can stand, then he&apos;s fine.&quot; Riot police detain a man during a rally to protest against the Belarus presidential election results in Minsk, Belarus on Oct. 11, 2020.

(AFP via Getty Images)&quot;You constantly want to sleep during the day because of the cold, and at night, you can&apos;t fall asleep because you&apos;re freezing,&quot; Kiryl said. &quot;Lack of sleep led to hallucinations. They fed you small portions &#x2014; one ladle of watery broth, three tablespoons of porridge, and a piece of bread. That was a typical lunch in solitary confinement.&quot; The most physically demanding and hazardous labor was another form of psychological punishment for political prisoners, as they were assigned quotas that were nearly impossible to fill. These tasks could include extracting 10 kilograms worth of aluminum wire from dismantled cables or cutting tires from Belaz trucks to be melted down. In addition to solitary confinement, the removal of food packages, and the denial of visitation rights, other forms of punishment for not filling work quotas could include being forced to treat wooden products with bleach without being provided masks or gloves, leading to burns on prisoners&apos; hands and the loss of taste and smell for weeks. Female prisoners face similar harsh treatment at the hands of prison authorities. &quot;There wasn&apos;t a single day (at the prison in Homel) where you didn&apos;t feel your life was in danger,&quot; Shchasnaia recalled. &quot;In winter, you&apos;re made to carry sacks of snow or chip ice from the asphalt. In the summer, you&apos;re called to do &apos;inventory work,&apos; where you haul scrap metal, and no one cares how you feel about it,&quot; she said. The female prisoners were also required to work shifts in a factory, where they were tasked with sewing military uniforms. Refusal to comply led to immediate punishment, often in the form of solitary confinement, where conditions were also &quot;unbearable.&quot; &quot;From the first day in a penal colony, the administration makes it clear how they treat political prisoners,&quot; Shchasnaia explained. &quot;We are perceived as enemies of the people who shouldn&apos;t expect any mercy.&quot; Though intended as a temporary punishment measure, solitary confinement in Belarus has been imposed for extended periods on some of the country&apos;s most prominent political figures. Maria Kalesnikava, who helped lead opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya&apos;s presidential campaign in 2020, was detained by authorities and sentenced to 11 years in prison after she refused to be exiled. Despite being in critical health, Kalesnikava was placed in solitary confinement in November 2022. Her family and lawyers lost contact with her in February 2023, and nothing was known about her condition until mid-November of this year, when a photo surfaced showing her hugging and smiling alongside her father, who was finally allowed to see her. In early December, Lukashenko issued his seventh wave of &quot;pardons,&quot; releasing 29 more political prisoners, including the elderly and those with chronic illnesses. Kiryl was among those who were pardoned, signing a document that secured his release. &quot;Recent releases of political prisoners are partly due to the constant pressure on the regime but also an attempt by Lukashenko to send a signal to the West: &apos;Look, this is an act of humanity, I&apos;m releasing people.&apos; Of course, it&apos;s all a game, and we must not fall for these tricks. We&apos;ve seen this in past years. It&apos;s important to note that while, say, 50 people are released, twice as many are imprisoned during the same period,&quot; Tsikhanouskaya said in an interview with Estonian media in mid-November. &quot;If someone submits a petition for pardon, this should never be condemned &#x2013; because these people are innocent. If it&apos;s their only chance to save their lives, then it&apos;s understandable why they might take this step.&quot; Demonstrators paste photos of opposition supporters killed during the post-election protests on the Okrestina prison wall during a rally demanding to free jailed activists of the opposition in Minsk, Belarus on Oct. 4, 2020. (AFP via Getty Images)Some political prisoners, like Shchasnaia, serve their full sentence. Upon her release in 2024, Shchasnaia was placed under &quot;supervision,&quot; which meant that she was constantly monitored by police, subjected to curfews, and banned from attending public gatherings. If the police recorded three &quot;violations,&quot; then she could be sent back to prison. &quot;I decided not to wait (for them to find reasons to send me back). Two days later, I left Belarus,&quot; she said. Now in exile, Shchasnaia is trying to rebuild her life, but the path forward often seems daunting and unclear &#x2014; thoughts of home in Belarus continue to pull at her. &quot;But returning there means returning to prison,&quot; she said. &quot;So I have to learn to live abroad. I have to believe in a better future. I hope that one day I&apos;ll return to my beloved Minsk.&quot; For Kiryl, the challenges of life in exile, like finding a new apartment or learning a new language, are overshadowed by the newfound freedom of walking the streets and living without fear. &quot;In Belarus, there&apos;s constant fear. You only need to look at the people walking down the street: they&apos;re frightened, grey, broken,&quot; he said. &quot;(But abroad) there&apos;s no anxiety that someone is always watching you, no worry that opening a chat or channel will lead to trouble simply for reading the &apos;wrong&apos; article.&quot; According to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), up to 500,000 Belarusians have fled the country since 2020. As the exile community grows, those who have been abroad longer try to offer guidance in online chat groups, helping newcomers with resources to navigate the challenges of rebuilding their lives. &quot;It&apos;s wonderful to feel that kind of support (from other Belarusians),&quot; Kiryl said. &quot;Most of our conversations are about the future &#x2014; hoping that one day we can return home or at least visit freely.&quot; Belarusians continue to face arrest and imprisonment for their involvement in the 2020 protests against the rigged election. According to Viasna, at least 671 politically motivated repressions, including detentions and searches, were reported in November alone. Given the ongoing attacks against political dissent, no genuine opposition candidates are expected to run in the 2025 presidential election, and protests on the scale of those in 2020 seem unlikely. With the opposition largely silenced, Lukashenko appears poised to secure another five-year presidential term. In the struggle to shine a light on these political prisoners, human rights organizations also find themselves navigating a delicate balancing act &#x2014; working to raise awareness about their plight without inadvertently exacerbating their suffering.

(Grigory Sysoyev POOL/AFP via Getty Images)&quot;The authorities cut off human rights defenders and society from information about political prisoners, and we are sometimes forced to limit our activities so as not to cause more harm to them. A broad information campaign can cause additional repression,&quot; Pavel Sapelka, a board member of Viasna, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The human rights situation in Belarus is catastrophic &#x2014; every political prisoner is under the threat of torture as well as cruel forced labor with virtually no pay. The worst thing is that at any moment, the list of the dead and other victims of the Belarusian regime can increase.&quot; Belarusians in exile, especially those who survived Lukashenko&apos;s prisons, hope the world won&apos;t forget that their fight for democracy is far from over and that countless Belarusians have already spilled blood for it. &quot;This is our personal, national tragedy,&quot; Kiryl said. &quot;but it will be terrifying if we are left alone with it.&quot; Hi, this is Kate Tsurkan. Thank you for taking the time to read this article. The Belarusian people&apos;s ongoing struggle for a better future is both courageous and inspiring. Despite bravely facing Lukashenko&apos;s harsh authoritarian regime, their efforts receive far too little attention. They deserve greater recognition and our unwavering support.

Ukraine delivered 200,000 domestically-produced drones to front-line units so far in December, Umerov says	Ukraine has delivered more than 200,000 domestically-produced drones to front-line units so far in December, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov wrote in a Facebook post on Dec. 18. &quot;Alongside equipment from our partners, more and more Ukrainian-made weapons are already operating on the frontlines &#x2014; a joint effort of defenders and manufacturers,&quot; Umerov said. Domestically manufactured drones help Kyiv close the ammunition gap as they face Russian forces with more artillery shells on the battlefield. Ukraine also aims to ramp up the production of long-range drones and missiles as part of the country&apos;s resilience plan. Zelensky previously said Ukraine aims to produce at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025, used to target Russian warships, naval bases, oil refineries, and airfields inside occupied territories and deep behind enemy lines. The Unmanned Systems Forces was established in September to improve Ukraine&apos;s work with drones, form special drone-specific units, and improve the production, training, and innovation of unmanned vehicles. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks throughout the full-scale with Russia. The Ukrainian military has proven to be a pioneer in drone technology, using innovative ways to undermine Russia&apos;s material and numerical advantage. Aerial drones have been used to ram into Russian helicopters or drop molten metal on ground positions, while naval drones were a key component in upending Russia&apos;s dominance in the Black Sea. In turn, Russia has also widely deployed drone capabilities during the full-scale invasion, both on the battlefield and to attack Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-delivered-200-000-domestically-produced-drones-to-front-line-units-so-far-in-december-umerov-says/	2024-12-18T06:15:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168760161.jpg
Intercepted Russian phone call suggests North Korean troops suffering trainloads of wounded	An intercepted phone call released by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on Dec. 18 suggests North Korean troops are suffering hundreds of casualties fighting for Russia in Kursk Oblast. In the call, a nurse at a Moscow hospital tells her husband, a soldier fighting in Kursk Oblast, that wounded fighters are being brought in by the trainload. &quot;Yesterday there was a train with about 100 people. Today there are 120 &#x2014; that&apos;s already (about) 200,&quot; she says. &quot;How many more are there? God only knows,&quot; she adds. She also claims that wards are being emptied to make way for the North Korean wounded, and hospital staff have trouble communicating with them and are not allowed to speak to them in English. &quot;Are they elite, or what, these Koreans? We are freeing up certain wards for them,&quot; she says. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the veracity or contents of the call, but the claims made are in line with recent Western estimates of North Korean losses. A couple hundred North Korean troops have been killed or wounded fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast against Ukraine, the Associated Press (AP) reported on Dec. 17, citing a senior U.S. military official. The official did not give an exact figure but said the high casualty rate was in part due to the soldiers&apos; lack of battle experience. Russia has reportedly deployed over 10,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in Kursk Oblast since early August. The full extent of North Korean losses is hard to ascertain, as President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is trying to hide the casualties. Ukraine&apos;s &#xA0;Special Operation Forces said that they had killed 50 North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast in three days and injured 47 more. Despite the losses within Russian and North Korean ranks, the Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Kursk Oblast seem to be increasingly on the back foot, facing a Russian advantage in manpower and equipment. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 17 that Russian and North Korean forces are carrying out an intensive offensive in Kursk Oblast for the third day in a row.	https://kyivindependent.com/intercepted-russian-call-suggests-north-korean-troops-suffering-trainloads-of-wounded/	2024-12-18T05:28:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2166040844.jpg
US may not be able to send remaining $5.6bn in military aid to Ukraine before Trump takes office, NYT reports	The U.S. may run out of time to deliver the remaining $5.6bn in military aid allocated to Ukraine before Donald Trump takes office next month, The New York Times (NYT) reported on Dec. 17. &quot;We will continue to do drawdown packages for the remainder of this administration,&quot; a U.S. official told the NYT. &quot;But $5.6 billion is a substantial amount of authority, so I would certainly anticipate that there could be remaining authority that would transition and be available for the next administration to use,&quot; they added. Although the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden plans to allocate some funds from the presidential drawdown authority, it is unlikely to spend the whole amount. The presidential drawdown authority is a scheme that allows any U.S. President to transfer weapons from the Pentagon&#x2019;s own stockpile instead of ordering it from manufacturers that would take precious time. The U.S. gave more than $60 billion worth of military aid to Ukraine during the Biden administration. Trump&#x2019;s support for Ukraine hangs in the air as analysts and politicians try to gauge his plans to bring peace to Ukraine, as he promised to end the war within &quot;24 hours&quot; after reelection without revealing details. There are concerns that Trump&apos;s victory might lead to the U.S. withdrawing its military support for Ukraine, leaving it up to European allies to help Kyiv resist Russia&#x2019;s war.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-may-not-be-able-to-send-remaining-5-6bn-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-before-trump-takes-office-nyt-reports/	2024-12-18T04:27:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170417898.jpg
Slovak PM Robert Fico to discuss gas transit through Ukraine with EU chief	Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico will hold talks with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Dec. 19, to discuss the possibility of continuing its gas transit through Ukraine beyond 2024, Reuters reported on Dec. 18. Slovakia currently imports 3 billion cubic meters of gas per year through Ukraine from Russia&#x2019;s energy giant Gazprom. Kyiv recently said it will not prolong the deal that allowed Russian gas to transit to the EU through Ukrainian territory beyond its expiry date on Dec. 31. &quot;I take into account the decision of the Ukrainian government that they do not want to extend the contract with Gazprom,&quot; Fico told Slovakia&apos;s European Affairs Committee. &quot;But that does not mean we cannot take gas from the east,&quot; he added. Fico also said Slovakia is exploring the possibilities to receive non-Russian gas through Ukraine, and will aim to secure the EU Commission&#x2019;s backing during Thursday&#x2019;s talks for future negotiations. He did not elaborate on who would replace Russian gas in the country&#x2019;s import of energy. Kyiv is open to negotiating gas transit for any origin, except Russian, its Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal told his Slovakian counterpart on Dec. 18. Despite Europe&apos;s efforts to wean itself off of Russian fossil fuels in the wake of a full-scale invasion, many countries remain heavily dependent on Russian gas, with Slovakia, Hungary, and Austria among the main buyers. Landlocked countries in central-Europe have been depending on Ukraine&#x2019;s transit to receive Russia&#x2019;s gas. Slovakia&apos;s state-owned energy company SPP and its partners in Hungary, Italy, and Austria called for continued gas transit through Ukraine in a declaration published on Dec. 17. SPP chairman Vojtech Ferencz said that replacing the entire volume of gas transiting from Ukraine would cost the company an additional 150 million euros ($157 million). A Russian-friendly populist, Fico halted military aid to Ukraine from the Slovak Armed Forces&apos; stocks after taking office in September 2023 in a stark foreign policy reversal. He recently announced he had accepted the Kremlin&apos;s invitation to attend the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow next May.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovak-pm-robert-fico-to-discuss-gas-transit-through-ukraine-with-eu-chief/	2024-12-18T03:23:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188638934.jpg
Zelensky to meet NATO chief Rutte, EU allies during talks in Brussels	President Volodymyr Zelensky will travel to Brussels on Dec. 18. to meet with the leaders of European allies, and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. Zelensky is expected to meet with the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and the EU to discuss military and humanitarian aid a month before Donald Trump enters the White House in January 2025. Trump has promised to push for peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow. Frugal with details, the president-elect has hinted at reducing military aid to Ukraine to force it to the negotiating table. Ukraine&apos;s allies have doubled down on economic and military support for Kyiv in attempts to strengthen the war-torn nation&apos;s hand before any potential peace talks. Keith Kellogg, the Trump administration&apos;s incoming Ukraine peace envoy will visit Kyiv to hold discussions with senior Ukrainian leaders in Kyiv in early January. He will also visit several European capitals, but will not travel to Moscow. His visit underscores the incoming Trump administration&#x2019;s intent to end the conflict as soon as possible. However, former national security and intelligence officials have expressed skepticism regarding the feasibility of Trump&#x2019;s intentions, pointing out that Russian President Vladimir Putin may have little incentive to negotiate under conditions acceptable to Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-meet-nato-chief-rutte-eu-allies-during-talks-in-brussels/	2024-12-18T02:27:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185712185.jpg
Peace talks with Russia only possible when Moscow runs out of resources, Ukraine’s Yermak says	Peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow will only be possible when Russia has run out of resources to fight its full-scale war, Andriy Yermak, head of the Presidential Office, said on Dec. 17. &quot;I would like to emphasize once again that only the strong are helped, so we must remain strong,&quot; he told the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities in Lviv, in comments reported by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). &quot;Real negotiations for a lasting peace will begin only when the enemy no longer has the resources to continue the war,&quot; he added. With no military plan in sight to retake lost territories, pressure is mounting on Kyiv to enter into peace negotiations with Russia. But Yermak warned that any concessions to Russia would only allow it to replenish its army and launch a new offensive in the future. &quot;If Russia is not forced to make a just peace, there will be no peace. There will be a pause and Moscow will use this pause to restore forces and continue the offensive,&quot; Yermak said. During the same event, President Volodymyr Zelensky slammed Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban for negotiating with Moscow about peace over Ukraine&#x2019;s head &quot;without leverage.&quot; Prime Minister Orban flew to Moscow in July during a so-called &quot;peace-mission&quot; and phoned Russian President Vladimir Putin in December. &quot;How will he put pressure on Putin? With a joke, a smile? Let him keep it,&quot; Zelensky said. Slovak President Peter Pellegrini, also argued in December that achieving peace in Ukraine would likely require accepting partial territorial losses and called for the immediate start of peace negotiations. However, some of Ukraine&#x2019;s European allies rejected such ideas, with Poland&#x2019;s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski earlier this month arguing that Western nations should push Russia, not Ukraine, into peace negotiations to stop the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/peace-talks-with-russia-only-possible-when-moscow-runs-out-of-resources-ukraines-yermak-says/	2024-12-18T00:52:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168960421.jpg
Russia detains two suspects over assassination of General Igor Kirillov, Kremlin media reports	Russian security forces have detained two suspects over the assassination of a top Kremlin general and his assistant in Moscow, Russian media reported on Dec. 18. Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov and his assistant were killed in Moscow on Dec. 17, with a bomb attached to a scooter. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed responsibility for the attack. According to Kommersant and several other Russian outlets cited by independent news website Meduza, the two suspects carried out the killings on the orders of the SBU. They were detained by police who saw surveillance cameras&#x2019; footage from the scene which recorded a pair of suspicious cars. Russian Telegram channel 112 said the suspects had already confessed to authorities. One, a 29-year-old male, reportedly said he flew to Moscow where he rented a car, installed cameras to record the explosion, and used a homemade explosive device. According to his alleged testimony, he was promised $100,000 for the murder and was in touch with an SBU officer through a messaging app. Russian officials have not yet announced the conclusion of the investigation. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. Kirillov, 54, was the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops (RKhBZ). A day before his assassination, Ukrainian prosecutors charged Kirillov in absentia with the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine. Moscow&apos;s forces have been increasingly deploying gas attacks against Ukrainian troops, a Kyiv Independent investigation from August found, and Kirillov has since been sanctioned by the U.K. and Canada for his role in their use. &quot;Kirillov was a war criminal and a completely legitimate target, as he gave orders to use banned chemical weapons against Ukrainian soldiers,&quot; an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 17. &quot;Retribution for war crimes is inevitable.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-detains-two-suspects-over-assassination-of-general-igor-kirillov-kremlin-media-reports/	2024-12-17T23:30:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189847816.jpg

Citing Ukrainian soldiers, The Economist wrote that Ukraine likely lost around half of the territory it had captured in the initial phase of the operation in August and September. An officer talking to the outlet connected this development to the redeployment of elite units that first spearheaded the offensive. Ukraine likely seeks to hold on to a piece of Russian territory as a possible bargaining chip ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s expected push for peace negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/couple-hundred-north-korean-troops-lost-fighting-for-russia-against-ukraine-ap-reports/	2024-12-17T22:47:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029632286.jpg

Gazprom shares fall to 16-year low	Shares of Russian gas giant Gazprom fell to their lowest level since January 2009, The Moscow Times reported on Dec. 17. The shares dropped to 106.1 rubles ($1.01) on Tuesday, marking a 2.4% drop from Monday and a 33.5% decline since the start of 2024. The fall began after the European Commission announced its readiness to halt Russian gas transit without significant price impacts, confirming the availability of alternative supply sources. Gazprom&apos;s profits have suffered due to a steep decline in European exports, which have dropped over 80% compared to 2021. Additionally, Austrian oil and gas company &#x201C;OMV&#x201D; recently ended its long-term gas supply contract with Gazprom. Moscow has also heavily taxed Gazprom&apos;s revenues over the last two years and the company paid $28 billion to the government in 2023, accounting for 9% of the government&apos;s revenue last year. Oleg Abelev, head of the analytical department at Rikom-Trust investment company, predicted that Gazprom&apos;s shares will likely hover between 100-115 rubles ($.96-$1.10) per share in the near future.	https://kyivindependent.com/gazprom-shares-fall-to-16-year-low/	2024-12-17T21:30:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
Oscars shortlist includes two Ukrainian documentaries	The Ukrainian documentaries &#x201C;The Porcelain War&#x201D; and &#x201C;Once Upon a Time in Ukraine&#x201D; have been shortlisted for the 97th Academy Awards, the U.S. Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on Dec. 17. &#x201C;The Porcelain War,&#x201D; directed by Brendan Bellomo and Slava Leontyev, is among 15 films selected for the Documentary Feature Film category, chosen from a total of 169 eligible submissions. The film follows three artists who join the Ukrainian army during the war, while continuing to create porcelain figurines as an act of resistance. In the Documentary Short Film category, &#x201C;Once Upon a Time in Ukraine,&#x201D; co-directed by Betsy West and Earl Mack and co-produced by Ukraine and the U.S., advanced to the shortlist. The documentary portrays war through the eyes of Ukrainian children and shows how they use creativity and imagination to cope with the hardships. &#x201C;La Palisade,&#x201D; a film by Philip Sotnychenko, was nominated by the Ukrainian Oscar committee as Ukraine&#x2019;s entry for Best International Feature Film, but it did not make the shortlist. In 2024, the Ukrainian documentary &#x201C;20 Days in Mariupol&#x201D;, directed by Mstyslav Chernov, made history as the first Ukrainian film to win an Oscar, taking home the Best Documentary Feature award. The film also earned the BAFTA award for Best Documentary earlier that year. The documentary recorded the Russian siege of Mariupol in Donetsk Oblast from the perspective of Chernov and his crew during the first weeks of the full-scale invasion. The film comprises 30 hours of footage they shot in Mariupol amid the siege.	https://kyivindependent.com/oscars-shortlist-includes-two-ukrainian-documentaries/	2024-12-17T19:53:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1245538531.jpg
Rheinmetall to provide Ukraine with 20 more Marder infantry fighting vehicles	German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall has received an order to supply Ukraine with 20 additional Marder infantry fighting vehicles, the company announced on Dec. 17. The delivery is scheduled for the first half of 2025, with the contract valued in the tens of millions of euros, funded by Germany. The statement by Rheinmetall noted that the Marder 1A3 model features enhanced targeting capabilities through a laser rangefinder. Rheinmetall has so far transferred about 200 combat vehicles, including over a hundred Marder 1A3 models, to Ukraine directly or indirectly through the so-called circular exchange program. The German manufacturer first received an order for the Marder infantry fighting vehicles in March 2023. In late July, Rheinmetall announced that it had received an order from the Ukrainian government to begin the construction of an ammunition factory in Ukraine. The company previously said it planned to open at least four production plants in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/rheinmetall-to-provide-ukraine-with-20-more-marder-infantry-fighting-vehicles/	2024-12-17T17:47:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2154591881.jpg
Trump's Ukraine peace envoy plans January trip to Kyiv, European capitals, Reuters reports	The Trump administration&apos;s incoming Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, plans to visit Kyiv and several European capitals in early January as part of the new administration&#x2019;s effort to address the Russia-Ukraine war, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Kellogg, who will serve as President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, does not intend to travel to Moscow during this trip, the sources said. Instead, he will hold discussions with senior Ukrainian leaders in Kyiv. Kellogg&apos;s team is also arranging meetings in other European cities, including Rome and Paris, though the itinerary remains subject to change, one source added. The meetings are expected to focus on &quot;fact-finding&quot; to inform the incoming Trump administration, rather than launching formal negotiations, according to the sources. However, the trip signals the urgency Trump has placed on resolving the war in Ukraine. Trump has pledged to end the war within 24 hours of assuming office, however, he hasn&apos;t provided details on how he plans to do it. At his first news conference since winning the election, Trump voiced his intention to make &quot;a little progress&quot; toward ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking from Mar-a-Lago on Dec. 16, he called the war &quot;horrible&quot; and underscored the urgent need to bring it to an end. &quot;We&#x2019;re going to get a little progress. It&#x2019;s a tough one, it&#x2019;s a nasty one, it&#x2019;s nasty.&quot; Former national security and intelligence officials have expressed skepticism, pointing out that Russian President Vladimir Putin may have little incentive to negotiate under conditions acceptable to Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-ukraine-peace-envoy-plans-january-trip-to-kyiv-european-capitals-reuters-reports/	2024-12-17T15:54:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1228656063.jpg
Poland-Ukraine relations show progress on historical issues, defense cooperation, Tusk says	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in Lviv on Dec. 17 to discuss bilateral cooperation, historical reconciliation, and coordination with Western partners. Both leaders reported progress in addressing complex historical issues, including the legacy of the Volyn massacre. Zelensky highlighted the ongoing collaboration between the Ukrainian and Polish Ministries of Culture on historical matters, saying: &quot;There is cooperation, there are meetings, joint work has begun, and there is progress in this.&quot; Tusk acknowledged the challenges but emphasized that history &quot;certainly cannot divide us.&quot; Poland has long sought progress on the exhumation of victims of the 1940s events in Volyn, and Tusk expressed an understanding of Ukraine&apos;s current challenges. He reaffirmed that historical complexities would not undermine the strong alliance between the two states. The leaders also discussed the front-line situation, diplomatic strategies, and the need for a just peace. Tusk underscored the importance of unwavering Western support, warning against speculation of a Ukrainian defeat, which he dismissed as baseless. Zelensky emphasized the shared vision of a strong and secure Ukraine supported by Western unity. Expectations for Poland&apos;s upcoming presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2024 were addressed, along with discussions on defense cooperation. Zelensky expressed gratitude for Poland&apos;s military aid and its support for Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO and EU aspirations. Tusk reaffirmed Poland&apos;s steadfast backing for Ukraine&apos;s European integration and security objectives, calling it vital for regional stability. The ongoing dialogue over the Volyn massacre continues to be a sensitive issue in Polish-Ukrainian relations. While Polish officials characterize the events as genocide perpetrated by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), Ukrainian officials have called for recognizing shared responsibility for the violence, which claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Poles and Ukrainians during World War II. Both sides view continued engagement as crucial for reconciliation.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-ukraine-relations-see-progress-in-historical-dialogue-defense-cooperation-tusk-says/	2024-12-17T13:57:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/ad251d9b370ace3d876b64ad229cbd6c_1734456764.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine's SBU assassinates Russian general charged with chemical weapons crimes	Key developments on Dec. 17: Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops, was killed in Moscow on Dec. 17 in an operation of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent. Kirillov and another Russian service member were reportedly killed in an explosion on the morning of Dec. 17 in the Russian capital. Ukrainian prosecutors previously charged the commander with using banned chemical weapons in the war against Ukraine. According to the source, explosives attached to a scooter detonated when Kirillov and his aide were near the entrance of the house on Ryazansky Prospect in Moscow. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video that purportedly shows the explosion in Moscow, Russia, that killed Russian Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov. (SBU source)&quot;Kirillov was a war criminal and completely legitimate target, as he gave orders to use banned chemical weapons against Ukrainian soldiers,&quot; the source said. &quot;Retribution for war crimes is inevitable.&quot; According to the Mash Telegram channel, the explosion occurred at around 6 a.m. local time when a service car arrived for Kirillov. The pro-state outlet Kommersant reported that the general and his aide were killed by a homemade explosive device of around 300 grams of a TNT equivalent. Russia&apos;s Investigative Committee began investigating the case as terrorism. Two undisclosed sources told the Russian RBC news agency that the investigators consider Ukraine&apos;s involvement the most likely scenario. Moscow&apos;s forces have been increasingly deploying gas attacks against Ukrainian troops, a Kyiv Independent investigation from August showed. Ukrainian soldiers and officers interviewed by the Kyiv Independent acknowledged that the tactic is effective, allowing Moscow to capture positions occasionally without destroying them. In October, the U.K. issued sanctions against Kirillov and his unit over the use of chemical weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine. The officer held senior positions within the radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops since 2012 and was appointed the department&apos;s chief in 2017, Meduza reports. Kirillov has also repeatedly disseminated false narratives about U.S.-backed &quot;bio laboratories&quot; in Ukraine, supposedly researching biological weapons for use against Russia. Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces killed 50 North Korean soldiers and injured 47 others in three days of fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the unit said on Dec. 17. The Special Operation Forces published footage of first-person-view (FPV) drones successfully targeting soldiers and equipment on the battlefield. Russia has reportedly deployed over 10,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in Kursk Oblast since early August. &quot;Soldiers of the 8th Special Forces Regiment of Prince Izyaslav Mstislavich organized a warm welcome for North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast,&quot; the unit said on Facebook. Two armored vehicles, two cars, and one all-terrain vehicle were also allegedly hit. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. After reporting initial but limited clashes with North Korean troops in November, Ukraine said that over the weekend, Russia also began using the soldiers in ground assaults. The Ukrainian military intelligence agency (HUR) said that 30 North Korean soldiers were killed or injured during assaults on Dec. 14-15. The full extent of North Korean losses might be hard to ascertain, as President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is trying to hide the casualties. Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder confirmed on Dec. 16 that North Korean personnel had engaged in combat operations alongside Russian troops in Kursk Oblast and suffered their first casualties. Russian forces are carrying out an intensive offensive in Kursk Oblast for the third day in a row, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 17, as Ukrainian forces are on the defensive in the border region. &quot;For the third day, Russian forces have been conducting intensive offensive operations in Kursk Oblast, actively using North Korean units,&quot; Syrskyi said in an online address to the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities held in Lviv, according to Interfax-Ukraine. Russia reportedly deployed over 10,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in Kursk Oblast since early August. &quot;North Korean mercenaries have already suffered heavy losses,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s commander said, adding that Kyiv&apos;s troops are holding the defenses, destroying personnel and equipment. The Special Operation Forces said that they had killed 50 North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast in three days and injured 47 more. The full extent of North Korean losses is hard to ascertain, as President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is trying to hide the casualties. Despite the losses within Russian and North Korean ranks, the Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Kursk Oblast seem to be increasingly on the back foot, facing a Russian advantage in manpower and equipment. Citing Ukrainian soldiers, The Economist wrote that Ukraine likely lost around half of the territory it had captured in the initial phase of the operation in August and September. An officer talking to the outlet connected this development to the redeployment of elite units that first spearheaded the offensive. Ukraine likely seeks to hold on to a piece of Russian territory as a possible bargaining chip ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s expected push for peace negotiations. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has no leverage over Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Ukraine does not need his mediation in potential peace talks, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 17. &#x201C;Ukraine is a strong country and has proven it on the battlefield throughout Putin&apos;s aggression. Does anyone else in Europe have this experience now? No. Does Orban have such an army? No. How will he put pressure on Putin? With a joke, a smile? Let him keep it,&#x201D; Zelensky said, as reported by Interfax-Ukraine. Hungary has maintained close ties with Moscow despite Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, frequently criticizing EU sanctions on Russia and blocking military aid to Kyiv. Zelensky said that Ukraine needs direct relations with the United States, rejecting Orban&apos;s role as an intermediary. &#x201C;Prime Minister Orban... will not succeed. I won&#x2019;t let him or people like him in,&#x201D; he said, clarifying that his remarks were directed at Orban, not the Hungarian people, who he argued overwhelmingly support Ukraine. Zelensky&#x2019;s comments followed escalating tensions after Orban&#x2019;s recent phone call with Putin and his criticism of Zelensky for allegedly rejecting a Christmas ceasefire proposal. Ukrainian officials have dismissed these claims, emphasizing their focus on achieving a just peace through strength. &#x201C;Negotiations on a sustainable peace will begin only when the enemy does not have the resources to continue the war,&#x201D; Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said on Dec. 17, adding that Ukraine&#x2019;s victory plan was created to bolster its position. For the first time, a majority of Polish citizens support ending the war in Ukraine even if it requires Ukraine to cede territory, Polish Radio reported on Dec. 17, citing a survey by the Polish Center for Public Opinion Research (CBOS). The survey found that 55% of respondents prioritized ending the conflict over Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial integrity, up from 39% in September 2024 and 26% in April 2022. Only 31% of Poles believe Ukraine should continue fighting without concessions to Russia, a significant drop from 46% in September 2024 and 59% in April 2022. CBOS noted that this shift reflects a growing fatigue with the ongoing war, especially as Polish society had previously been predominantly in favor of Ukraine continuing the fight. The survey highlighted that younger Poles aged 18-24, residents of smaller cities, individuals with less education, and those with more conservative views were more likely to support a negotiated peace. In contrast, a recent poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) revealed that nearly two-thirds of Ukrainians remain willing to endure the war &quot;as long as it takes.&quot; This figure has declined slightly from 73% in late 2023 to 63% in October 2024, but the majority still firmly reject territorial concessions. The contrasting attitudes underscore the challenges facing Ukraine as it braces for renewed Russian offensives and continued pressure from some Western quarters for negotiations. Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov recently stated Moscow&#x2019;s aim to fully occupy Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts by 2025, signaling no intent to halt aggression. President-elect Donald Trump also weighed in on the conflict during a Dec. 16 news conference, describing the war as &#x201C;horrible&#x201D; and expressing his intent to make &#x201C;a little progress&#x201D; toward peace, though he provided no specifics. Trump has previously suggested reducing U.S. aid to Ukraine to pressure both sides into negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraines-sbu-assassinates-russian-general-charged-with-chemical-weapons-crimes/	2024-12-17T13:51:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189820966.jpg
MP Boyko calls Putin 'war criminal', apologizes for pro-Russian statement after interrogation	Lawmaker Yuriy Boyko on Dec. 17 apologized for his earlier video interpreted by many as pro-Russian and called Russian President Vladimir Putin a &quot;war criminal.&quot; Boiko made the apology in a TikTok video after he was questioned by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) over his previous statement. &#x201C;I do not want my words to be used by the Russian Federation or war criminal Putin to justify their aggression against our country,&#x201D; Boyko said. &quot;If my words insulted some Ukrainians who are fighting on the front line or working on the home front to achieve victory, I want to apologize.&quot; He added that &#x201C;we should all be united, focused on defeating the foreign enemy, and put aside all internal differences.&#x201D; In his Dec. 14 video on TikTok, Boyko echoed pro-Russian narratives about alleged &#x201C;radicals&#x201D; in Ukraine and restrictions on language and religion. Boyko claimed that &#x201C;radicals&#x201D; were &#x201C;tearing down monuments, renaming cities, forbidding people to speak their native language and attend the church of their choice&#x201D; without citing specific examples or evidence. Boyko, a parliamentary member since 2007 and former deputy prime minister under ex-President Viktor Yanukovych, has a long history in Moscow-aligned political factions. His recent statements and subsequent apology suggest an attempt to navigate Ukraine&#x2019;s political landscape, potentially aiming to rebuild his relevance ahead of potential elections. In wartime Ukraine, however, pro-Russian rhetoric provokes fierce criticism and could hinder Boyko&#x2019;s political rehabilitation.	https://kyivindependent.com/pro-russian-mp-boyko-retracts-claims-on-radicals-condemns-putin-after-public-outrage/	2024-12-17T13:13:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1201665758.jpg
NATO takes lead in coordinating Western military aid to Ukraine, Reuters reports	NATO has assumed responsibility for coordinating Western military aid to Ukraine through the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) center, Reuters reported on Dec. 17, citing its sources. The center, located at a U.S. military base in Wiesbaden, Germany, is now &quot;fully operational.&quot; Established following the Alliance&#x2019;s July 2024 summit in Washington, the organization aims to streamline training programs and the delivery of weapons to Ukraine. It involves approximately 700 personnel, including troops stationed at NATO&apos;s SHAPE headquarters in Belgium and logistics centers in Poland and Romania. This shift marks a greater role for NATO in supporting Kyiv&#x2019;s defense against Russia&#x2019;s invasion. Diplomatic sources noted that the transfer of authority to NATO might have limited impact, as the U.S., under President-elect Donald Trump, could still reduce its support for Ukraine. Trump, who has signaled a potential reduction in U.S. aid, met with President Volodymyr Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Dec. 7. While the meeting did not produce a specific peace plan, Trump advocated for an immediate ceasefire, while Zelensky stressed the importance of security guarantees for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-takes-lead-in-coordinating-western-military-aid-to-ukraine-reuters-says/	2024-12-17T12:30:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2183596448-1.jpg
Russia may encircle Ukrainian forces near Velyka Novosilka, monitoring group says	Russian troops may encircle Ukrainian forces near Velyka Novosilka, located 74 kilometers from the regional center of Donetsk, the monitoring group DeepState reported on Dec. 17. DeepState, an independent mapping project known for its close ties to Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry and widely trusted for accurate territorial updates, highlighted that Russian operations in the area aim to sever logistics and occupy the village. According to DeepState&apos;s map, Ukrainian troops in Makarivka south of Velyka Novosilka have been almost surrounded. Analysts warn that the situation around Makarivka is becoming more critical as Russian troops continue their advances. A recent Russian raid on Novyi Komar, just 4 kilometers north of Velyka Novosilka, achieved partial success, with Russian forces reportedly entering the village. The DeepState monitoring group map, as of December 17. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi previously described the ongoing Russian offensive as &quot;one of the most powerful&quot; since the start of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Over the autumn, Russian forces have achieved operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, particularly near Toretsk, Chasiv Yar, and Kupiansk, while also advancing on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-intensifies-push-to-encircle-ukrainian-forces-in-donetsks-velyka-novosilka-analysts-say/	2024-12-17T12:14:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2162045293.jpg

Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Issue 158	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 158 of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly, covering events from Dec. 9-14, 2024. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. The Cabinet of Ministers completes the composition of Ukrenergo&#x2019;s new supervisory board. On Dec. 10, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the candidacies of three state representatives for Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board, completing the set of board candidates. The three new state representatives are: As we reported earlier, the Cabinet approved four new independent members of Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board on Nov. 27: Patrick Roland Graichen, Luigi de Francisci, Jeppe Sebastian Kofod, and Jan Henrik Montell. See Issue 156 for more detail. According to Ukrenergo&#x2019;s charter, its supervisory board should consist of seven members: four independent members and three state representatives. The new composition of the company&#x2019;s supervisory board is thus complete. All the above candidates are to be appointed as supervisory board members by a decision of the Ministry of Energy in its capacity as the general shareholders meeting of Ukrenergo. As it follows from the information below, such a decision must have been made. On Dec. 12, the newly appointed Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board held its first meeting. Jeppe Kofod (independent member) was elected as the board&#x2019;s Chair, while Anatolii Hulei (state representative) became his Deputy. The supervisory board also established an audit committee, a nomination and remuneration committee, and an investment and strategy committee, as well as &#x201C;made up its mind&#x201D; on their chairs. Ukrenergo did not specify the names of committee chairs. G7 Ambassadors welcomed the appointment of Ukrenergo&#x2019;s new supervisory board. The new board should launch the selection of a new CEO without delay, they emphasized. As we wrote in Issue 146, on Sept. 2, Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board dismissed the company&#x2019;s CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi by a majority vote. The board appointed executive board member Oleksii Brekht as an acting CEO and decided to hold a competitive selection for a new CEO. On the same day, Daniel Dobbeni (independent member and supervisory board chair) and Peder Andreasen (independent member) announced that they had filed their resignation notices. According to the fifth review of the four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Arrangement between Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund, the full supervisory board of Ukrenergo had to be re-established by end-December 2024. This is a conditionality for Ukraine&#x2019;s access to about $1.1 billion under the IMF program. As we wrote in Issue 148, on Sept. 20, the Energy Ministry in its capacity as Ukrenergo&#x2019;s general shareholders meeting decided to hold a competitive selection for three independent members of the company&#x2019;s supervisory board. The fourth independent member would be elected in parallel under a previously launched procedure. The selection of all board members &#x2013; four independent and three state representatives &#x2013; was scheduled to be completed by Dec. 9 Ukrainian energy infrastructure struck for the third time in less than a month. On Dec. 13, Ukraine&#x2019;s Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko reported that Russia had launched yet another massive missile and drone attack targeting energy facilities across Ukraine. This marked the third massive attack since November 2024 and twelfth since the beginning of the year, the Energy Ministry added. Russia&#x2019;s attack occurred during the afternoon of Dec. 12 and morning of Dec. 13, and was characterized by the use of combined weapons, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force said. Russia launched an unprecedented 287 aerial weapons. Ukraine&#x2019;s air defenses intercepted 81 missiles and 80 drones, while 105 drones failed to reach their targets. Later, Ukrenergo confirmed damage to energy facilities in several oblasts. As a result, the transmission system operator had to tighten the power outage schedules for the following days. Rinat Akhmetov&#x2019;s DTEK, Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy holding, reported that Russia attacked its thermal power plants (TPPs) again, severely damaging equipment. This marked the ninth massive attack on its TPPs in 2024, DTEK added. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), five of Ukraine&#x2019;s nine operating nuclear reactor units reduced power output due to the attacks. From March 22 to Nov. 28, Ukraine faced nine massive missile and drone strikes on electricity facilities.&#x202F;See our Issues 124, 125, 127, 129, 131, 134, 145, 154, and 156 for more detail. Following each Russian attack on Ukraine&#x2019;s vital infrastructure, emergency outages occur, often lasting for days due to ongoing repair work. During such outages, people in Ukraine are often left without electricity, heating, water supply, or access to mobile phone networks. The Hague court confirms that Russia must compensate Naftogaz for assets seized in Crimea. On Dec. 13, Naftogaz Group announced that the Supreme Court of the Netherlands dismissed Russia&#x2019;s cassation appeal, upholding the Partial Award of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague concerning compensation for damages caused by the illegal expropriation of the Group&#x2019;s assets in Crimea. This ruling confirms for the second and final time the legality and validity of the Partial Award, Naftogaz explained. &#x201C;This decision strengthens Naftogaz Group&#x2019;s position in enforcement proceedings to recover compensation from Russia for the illegal seizure of assets in Crimea,&#x201D; Roman Chumak, Naftogaz&#x2019;s acting CEO said. As we wrote in April 2023, the Hague&#x2019;s Arbitration Tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration ordered Russia to pay $5 billion to compensate Naftogaz for its losses in Crimea following the 2014 seizure of assets. See our Issue 83 for more detail. As we reported in November 2024, the Helsinki District Court froze Russian assets in Finland at Naftogaz&#x2019;s request. See Issue 154 for more detail. The Cabinet approved the terms of seized Motordetal-Konotop&#x2019;s privatisation. The starting price for the sale of the 100% stake is Hr 278.5 million ($6.6 million at the current exchange rate). All proceeds from this sale will go to the Fund for the Elimination of Consequences of Armed Aggression, part of the state budget. As we reported in Issue 149, on Sept. 26, the auction commission of the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) set the terms for the privatization of Motordetal-Konotop LLC, a plant confiscated earlier from sanctioned Russian senator Sergey Kalashnik. The company was transferred to the management of the SPFU by a ruling of the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) in 2023. Located in Sumy Oblast, Motordetal-Konotop is one of Ukraine&#x2019;s largest producers of piston rings for internal combustion engines, the SPFU said. The company&#x2019;s clients include well-known car brands such as Rolls-Royce, Scania, MAN, Iveco, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Renault, and CAT. See our Issue 149 for more detail. HACC Appeals Chamber confirms the seizure of Ocean Plaza&#x2019;s debts to the Rotenbergs, paving the way for its privatization, the Justice Ministry announced on Dec. 12. According to the ministry, the claim rights of sanctioned Ethoder Investments Limited, a non-resident company related to the Rotenbergs, were seized in favor of the state, namely: The ruling comes into force immediately after its announcement and is not subject to appeal in cassation, the ministry noted. According to Ekonomichna Pravda (EP), in July 2023, the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) seized 100% of the little-known Avangard-Vilarti LLC. The ultimate beneficial owners of this company were the children of Arkady Rotenberg, a sanctioned Russian oligarch close to Vladimir Putin. Avangard-Vilarti, now managed by the SPFU, owns 66.65% of Investment Union Lybid LLC (IU Lybid), which owns Kyiv&#x2019;s Ocean Plaza shopping mall. The remaining 33.35% in IU Lybid is owned by Andriy Ivanov&#x2019;s Lanita Invest LLC. Another company founded by Avangard-Vilarti is Ethoder Investments Limited, to which IU Lybid owes $177.4 million. It is because of this debt that Ocean Plaza has not yet been put up for privatization, the media explained. IU Lybid and Ethoder signed a loan agreement in 2009 for the construction of the Ocean Plaza shopping mall. The future asset was pledged as collateral to secure the agreement, EP said. According to the investors, UDP Holdings of Vasyl Khmelnytsky and Andriy Ivanov, and KAN Development of Igor Nikonov, the mall&#x2019;s construction cost was $300 million. It is unclear who owned Ethoder in 2009 when the loan agreement was signed. Nikonov said that the developers had attracted a &#x201C;pool of private investors.&quot; They sold the mall to the Rotenbergs in 2012 for $280-350 million. In 2019, Khmelnytsky bought back 33.35%, and in 2021, he allegedly resold this stake to Ivanov when they announced the separation of their businesses. IU Lybid stopped all payments on the loan in February 2022. The outstanding loan posed a problem for the SPFU and potential new owners, as the mall building itself served as a collateral, EP wrote in January 2024. According to EP, the SPFU and the Justice Ministry then had several options for solving this problem. Ultimately, they decided to clear the asset through the courts by imposing sanctions on the loan. As we wrote in Issue 106, the SPFU wants to sell the state&#x2019;s 66.65% stake in Ocean Plaza, previously owned by sanctioned Rotenbergs. As we wrote in April 2024 (Issue 127), the starting price was set at Hr 1.65 billion (39.2 million euros at the exchange rate at that time). See Issues 106, 109, 113, and 127 for more detail on Ocean Plaza&#x2019;s privatization.

Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 5	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 5 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Dec. 9-Dec. 15, 2024. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Tax committee approves bills extending tax benefits The Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy has recommended the adoption of two draft laws exempting certain imports and other operations from taxes and customs duties. Specifically, the proposed laws suggest: exempting components imported for the production of ammunition and shells as well as components for all types of drones from customs payments; extending tax benefits for the import of unmanned aerial vehicles, night vision devices, and anti-drone rifles; and introducing personal income tax exemptions for funds raised by volunteers for charitable foundations etc. The Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s parliament, is scheduled to review these draft laws during its sessions on Dec. 17&#x2013;20. Parliament to consider draft law on High Administrative Court According to the agenda shared with MPs, this week the Verkhovna Rada is expected to discuss a draft law establishing a new High Administrative Court. However, the updated draft text has not yet been submitted to parliament. The deadline for this step, as stipulated in the IMF Memorandum, is the end of December. It&#x2019;s worth mentioning that the upcoming sessions of the parliamentary meetings from Dec. 17&#x2013;20 will be the last for the year. As noted in Issue 4, the Rada previously rejected three draft laws on the above-mentioned issue, as they were found to contradict Ukraine&#x2019;s commitments under the International Monetary Fund financial support program (EFF). The benchmark for canceling &apos;Lozovyy amendments&apos; is at risk of not being met on time In December, the deadline approaches for Ukraine to fulfill the IMF Memorandum requirement to amend the Criminal Procedure Code. These amendments have to enable the The Specialized Anticorruption Prosecutor&apos;s Office to manage extradition and mutual legal assistance requests and rationalize consequences from expiration of time limits for pre-trial investigations cancelling so-called &#x201C;Lozovyy amendments.&quot; Currently, the structural benchmark is proposed to be addressed through amendments to another draft law, #10242. The bill is widely criticized by anti-corruption NGOs such as the Anti-corruption Action Center, Dejure Foundation, and Transparency International Ukraine for increasing the risks of criminal liability for investigative journalists. Given that the parliament will hold only one plenary week before the end of the year, there is a risk that the structural benchmark will not be met on time. Moreover, anti-corruption experts insist that the provision to transfer the authority to extend pre-trial investigations within a year from investigative judges to prosecutors must be incorporated into the draft law. Social Policy Ministry proposes pension reform draft law The Social Policy Ministry has unveiled a draft law on pension reform. The proposal includes updating the solidarity-based pension system by introducing a basic pension level, simplifying the calculation of current pensions insured by the state, and establishing a mandatory second-tier pension system based on accumulated savings. Before submission to Parliament, the draft law must receive approval from the Cabinet of Ministers.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-5/	2024-12-17T10:11:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2167201208-1.jpg
Who was Russian General Igor Kirillov, Ukraine’s latest assassination target?	Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov met his demise in Moscow on Dec. 17, reportedly killed by a bomb attached to a scooter planted by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). &quot;Kirillov was a war criminal and a completely legitimate target, as he gave orders to use banned chemical weapons against Ukrainian soldiers,&quot; an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Retribution for war crimes is inevitable.&quot; Born on July 13, 1970, 54-year-old Kirillov was the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops (RKhBZ). According to the think tank and research group Global Security, the RKhBZ are ostensibly &quot;special troops designed to perform the most complex tasks of protecting troops and the population, requiring the use of special equipment.&quot; &quot;They consist of units and divisions for detecting nuclear explosions, radiation and chemical reconnaissance, special processing, aerosol countermeasures, flamethrower, etc,&quot; it adds.

(Contributor/Getty Images)In Ukraine, Kirillov became best known for his alleged role in the use of chemical weapons by Russian forces against Ukrainian troops. Kirillov&apos;s involvement in chemical weapon attacks predates the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In 2018, Kirillov defended Moscow against accusations that Russia and Syria were tampering with evidence and blocking access to the site of a chemical weapons attack that killed more than 40 civilians in the Syrian town of Douma in 2018. A report from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons later found the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad had likely carried out the attack, despite Russia long-claiming otherwise, and spreading debunked conspiracy theories to try and shift blame away from their ally. Recent witness testimony provided in the wake of the fall of Assad provided further evidence that Syrian and Russian authorities lied and intimidated locals to try to suppress what actually happened. Moscow&apos;s forces have been increasingly deploying gas attacks against Ukrainian troops, a Kyiv Independent investigation from August found, and Kirillov has since been sanctioned by the U.K. for his role in their use. Ukrainian soldiers and officers interviewed by the Kyiv Independent acknowledged that the tactic is effective, allowing Moscow to capture positions occasionally without destroying them. According to an SBU investigation, chemical weapons have been used in more than 4,800 cases since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Since 2022, over 2,000 Ukrainian service members have been hospitalized with chemical poisoning, and three have died, Ukrainian Colonel Artem Vlasiuk said earlier this week. &quot;Russian forces mostly use ammunition with toxic substances by dropping them from FPV (first-person-view) drones on Ukrainian positions. When chemical grenades are detonated, their poisonous compounds affect human mucous membranes, especially the eyes and respiratory tract,&quot; the SBU said. Earlier this year, the U.S. State Department confirmed that Russian forces had used the chemical agent chloropicrin in Ukraine. On Dec. 16, Kirillov was charged in absentia by the SBU for the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine. Kirillov was one of 123 &quot;elites and close associates of the (Russian) Regime&quot; sanctioned by the Canadian government in February 2023. And in October of this year, the U.K. issued sanctions against Russian units involved in the use of chemical weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine. Kirillov along with two Russian Defense Ministry scientific centers were also on the list. &quot;The U.K. will not sit idly by whilst (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and his mafia state ride roughshod over international law, including the Chemical Weapons Convention,&quot; British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in a statement at the time. As well as his military endeavors, Kirillov was also a prominent mouthpiece for the Kremlin, and propagator of several debunked conspiracy theories. Shortly after the launch of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Moscow&apos;s propaganda machine went into overdrive in an attempt to convince the world that Ukraine was hosting U.S.-funded bioweapons sites. There was no evidence to support the claims but that didn&apos;t stop the conspiracy theory gaining traction in the West, and even found supporters in the likes of Tulsi Gabbard, Donald Trump&apos;s pick for Director of National Intelligence. Kirillov played a central part in spreading disinformation, claiming to have documents obtained on the first day of the full-scale invasion that showed &quot;the Ministry of Health of Ukraine has set the task of completely destroying bio-agents in laboratories.&quot; &quot;The Pentagon knows that if these documents fall into the hands of Russian experts, then it&apos;s highly likely that Ukraine and the United States will be found to have violated the Convention on the Prohibition of Biological and Toxin Weapons,&quot; Kirillov added. The World Health Organization (WHO) clarified that Ukraine had been advised to destroy high-threat pathogens in labs in order to &quot;any potential spills,&quot; but stressed this was related to routine scientific research and not biological weapons. Later in 2022, Kirillov was also instrumental in spreading false claims that Ukraine was developing a &quot;dirty bomb,&quot; a crude nuclear device designed to contaminate a wide area with radiation, making it inhabitable. &quot;According to the information we have, two organisations in Ukraine have specific instructions to create a so-called &apos;dirty bomb&apos;. This work is in its final stage,&quot; he said in October 2022. He provided no evidence to back up the claim and none has come to light since. Kirillov and another Russian service member were reportedly killed in an explosion on the morning of Dec. 17 in Moscow. The explosion occurred at around 6 a.m. local time when a service car arrived for Kirillov, the Mash Telegram channel reported.

(Alexander Nemenov / AFP via Getty Images)Russian state media outlet Kommersant said the two men were killed by a homemade explosive device that contained the equivalent of around 300 grams of TNT. An SBU source later told the Kyiv Independent it was responsible for the killing, and that explosives attached to a scooter detonated when the pair left the entrance of a house on Ryazansky Prospect in the capital. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Russia&apos;s Investigative Committee has begun a terrorism investigation into the case, and two undisclosed sources told the Russian RBC news agency that investigators consider Ukraine&apos;s involvement the most likely scenario.	https://kyivindependent.com/profile-russian-lieutenant-general-igor-kirillov-war-criminal-and-ukrainian-assassination-target/	2024-12-17T09:56:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189820966.jpg
Zelensky rejects Orban's mediation, says he has no leverage over Putin	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has no leverage over Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Ukraine does not need his mediation in potential peace talks, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 17. &#x201C;Ukraine is a strong country and has proven it on the battlefield throughout Putin&apos;s aggression. Does anyone else in Europe have this experience now? No. Does Orban have such an army? No. How will he put pressure on Putin? With a joke, a smile? Let him keep it,&#x201D; Zelensky said, as reported by Interfax-Ukraine. Hungary has maintained close ties with Moscow despite Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, frequently criticizing EU sanctions on Russia and blocking military aid to Kyiv. Zelensky said that Ukraine needs direct relations with the United States, rejecting Orban&apos;s role as an intermediary. &#x201C;Prime Minister Orban... will not succeed. I won&#x2019;t let him or people like him in,&#x201D; he said, clarifying that his remarks were directed at Orban, not the Hungarian people, who he argued overwhelmingly support Ukraine. Zelensky&#x2019;s comments followed escalating tensions after Orban&#x2019;s recent phone call with Putin and his criticism of Zelensky for allegedly rejecting a Christmas ceasefire proposal. Ukrainian officials have dismissed these claims, emphasizing their focus on achieving a just peace through strength. &#x201C;Negotiations on a sustainable peace will begin only when the enemy does not have the resources to continue the war,&#x201D; Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said on Dec. 17, adding that Ukraine&#x2019;s victory plan was created to bolster its position.	https://kyivindependent.com/keep-the-jokes-zelensky-criticizes-orbans-attempts-at-mediation/	2024-12-17T09:40:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2159697231.jpg
Ukraine sets goal to open all EU negotiation clusters in 2025, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 17 that Ukraine aims to open all negotiating clusters with the European Union in 2025, an ambitious step in the country&#x2019;s EU accession process, Interfax-Ukraine reported. &#x201C;During Poland&#x2019;s EU presidency, we expect to open at least two clusters and six in total. To be honest, our goal is very ambitious &#x2014; to open all the clusters next year,&#x201D; Zelensky said at the All-Ukrainian Congress of Local and Regional Authorities. The EU&#x2019;s Commissioner for Enlargement, Oliver Varhelyi, has said Ukraine could join the bloc by 2029, provided it completes the necessary reforms. Ukraine submitted its detailed reform plan on March 20, outlining its vision for reconstruction and modernization as part of its EU membership aspirations. The European Commission recently commended Ukraine&#x2019;s progress in key areas, including the rule of law, judicial reform, and anti-corruption measures. However, it emphasized that additional reforms are needed to meet EU standards. Ukraine received EU candidate status in June 2022. The European Commission recommended launching accession talks with Ukraine in November 2023, and the European Council approved the decision a month later.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-sets-goal-to-open-all-eu-negotiation-clusters-by-2025-zelensky-says/	2024-12-17T08:27:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178140389-1.jpg
MP expelled from Zelensky's party faces trial on charges of assaulting war veteran	The assault and kidnapping case against Mykola Tyshchenko, an MP who was expelled from President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s party in 2023, has been sent to trial, the State Investigation Bureau said on Dec. 17. The bureau said it had completed the investigation against Tyshchenko on charges of illegally detaining and assaulting a war veteran in Dnipro. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison. The charges stem from a widely circulated video recorded in June showing Tyshchenko and his bodyguards confronting veteran Dmytro Pavlov, who was walking with his child in central Dnipro. The footage shows an argument escalating into a physical altercation, with Pavlov reportedly detained and sustaining injuries. Tyshchenko, who later admitted to being in Dnipro during the incident, claimed he was investigating alleged bot farms. The incident drew significant backlash from activists, soldiers, and public officials. Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak condemned Tyshchenko&apos;s actions, calling them &#x201C;absolutely disgraceful.&#x201D; Yermak also noted his long-standing acquaintance with Tyshchenko, who had previously christened Yermak&apos;s son. Tyshchenko has a history of controversy, including his expulsion from Zelensky&#x2019;s Servant of the People party in January 2023 after an unauthorized wartime trip to Thailand. The incident has amplified calls for Tyshchenko&#x2019;s accountability among activists and military personnel.	https://kyivindependent.com/controversial-lawmaker-tyshchenko-accused-of-assault-risks-5-years-in-prison/	2024-12-17T07:18:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2159182486.jpg
Deals over ideals — Anne Applebaum explains the playbook of autocracies in new book, and how to undermine them	Autocratic regimes like Russia are becoming increasingly bold in their efforts to undermine the principles and norms that came to define the democratic world order in the aftermath of World War II. A month after the start of the full-scale war against Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov even declared &#x201C;this is not about Ukraine at all, but the world order.&#x201D; &#x201C;The current (war) is a fateful, epoch-making moment in modern history,&#x201D; he continued. &#x201C;It reflects the battle over what the world order will look like.&#x201D; As Ukraine&apos;s Western allies grapple with how far they can go in supporting the embattled country against a war of total annihilation, Russia&apos;s intent reveals not only a profound contempt for the Ukrainian people, their history, and culture but also a broader aspiration to reshape the world into a landscape marked by the erosion of individual freedoms and consolidation of power at the top. In her latest book, &#x201C;Autocracy, Inc.,&#x201D; U.S. journalist and historian Anne Applebaum delves into the intricate web of financial, technological, and police networks that autocracies such as Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran have cultivated to bolster one another. She examines how these regimes, in some instances, have begun to operate as if with complete impunity, disregarding international condemnation and withstanding the impact of severe economic sanctions. The autocratic leaders of today, Applebaum argues, are not driven by spreading ideologies of the past such as communism or fascism. They &#x201C;share a determination to deprive their citizens of any real influence or public voice, to push back against all forms of transparency or accountability, and to repress anyone, at home or abroad, who challenges them.&#x201D; The historian and journalist Anne Applebaum participates in the session &#x2018;Democracies in danger&#x2019; in the XXXV Economy Circle meeting in Barcelona, Spain on May 30, 2019. (David Zorrakino/Europa Press via Getty Images)The alliances between these countries are forged through &quot;deals, not ideals,&quot; enabling them to sidestep the burden of Western financial sanctions that many face. The arrangements between these countries frequently involve the exchange of surveillance technology to bolster internal control over their populations or the mutual enrichment of the considerable wealth they have accumulated. Belarus is one of the more striking examples cited by Applebaum. Despite widespread unpopularity among the Belarusian population and condemnation from international bodies like the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has managed to remain in power for the past three decades. The relatively small country is not as isolated as it may seem, nor is it facing a major economic crisis. Belarusian goods are barred from the EU market due to sanctions, and its national airline, Belavia, is prohibited from flying to European destinations. However, as Applebaum notes, Belarus has found alternative economic partners. &#x201C;More than two dozen&#x201D; Chinese companies have invested in its economy, while Russia has long provided the country with a crucial financial lifeline. The relationship between Belarus and Russia is deeply interdependent. When some Belarusian journalists refused to cover up Lukashenko&#x2019;s widespread election fraud during the 2020 presidential election, for example, Russian state-affiliated media sent their own journalists to take their place. Since the onset of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Belarus has effectively served as both a military base for Russian troops and a launchpad for attacks on Ukrainian territory. As autocratic regimes seek out like-minded allies to forge an alternative to the democratic world order, we are witnessing a number of troubling trends, such as the targeting of dissidents abroad. This alarming strategy sends a clear message &#x2014; that these regimes believe they are on the advance and nothing can stop them. According to Applebaum, &#x201C;the conviction, common among the most committed autocrats, that the outside world cannot touch them &#x2013; that the views of other nations don&#x2019;t matter and that no court of public opinion will ever judge them &#x2013; is (a) relatively recent (phenomenon).&#x201D; One disturbing example is the kidnapping of Belarusian opposition journalist Roman Protasevich from a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius in 2021. When the plane crossed through Belarusian airspace, Belarusian air traffic falsely told the pilots of the Irish-owned airline that a bomb was on board. MiG fighter jets were dispatched to force a landing in Minsk, the country&#x2019;s capital, and Protasevich and his girlfriend were taken off the flight. Applebaum describes the incident as having &#x201C;no exact precedent,&#x201D; shattering the illusion that individuals in the democratic world are insulated from autocratic threats. Protasevich&#x2019;s kidnapping ultimately challenged the belief that democratic systems can &#x201C;protect anyone who lives in them from the lawlessness that prevails in (countries like) Russia or Cuba.&#x201D; Autocracies &#x201C;keep track of one another&#x2019;s defeats and victories, timing their own moves to create maximum chaos,&#x201D; explains Applebaum. In the fall of 2023, Applebaum writes, amid the bolstered discourse of &#x201C;Ukraine fatigue,&#x201D; the long-standing conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia reignited as Azerbaijan launched a military offensive on Nagorno-Karabakh, which had already been under a blockade for the past year. In the Middle East, Iranian-backed Hamas militants perpetrated a terrorist attack against Israel that resulted in over 1,000 fatalities and started a new escalation that killed 45,000 people in Palestine. Numerous other conflicts have flared up since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine nearly three years ago. As Applebaum notes, &#x201C;this multifaceted, interconnected, self-reinforcing polycrisis was not coordinated by a single mastermind, and it is not evidence of a secret conspiracy. Instead, these episodes, taken together, demonstrate how different autocracies have extended their influence across different political, economic, military, and informational spheres.&#x201D; Meanwhile, autocracies exploit loopholes in the financial systems of democratic countries, benefiting financially from the very countries they are working to undermine. Autocracies also continue to infiltrate information spaces within democratic societies, aiming to sow seeds of doubt and discord. This includes the &#x201C;fantastical tales of biological warfare (that) began to surge across the internet&#x201D; following Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. The Russian Defense and Foreign Ministries alleged that the U.S. had funded laboratories in Ukraine where experiments on viruses were purportedly being conducted. Although these claims were easily debunked, they proliferated rapidly on platforms like X and formerly Twitter and also gained traction elsewhere, such as in Chinese state media. &#x201C;China had a clear interest in this story, since it muddied recent history and helped relieve China of the need to investigate its own hazardous biolabs, including the one in Wuhan that might have been the true source of the COVID-19 pandemic,&#x201D; Applebaum explains. Even some independent news sites have amplified blatant disinformation. However, as Applebaum explains, many operate as &quot;information laundromats,&quot; disguising themselves as media outlets when their purpose is to disseminate Russian talking points. Readers may find themselves overwhelmed while reading &#x201C;Autocracy, Inc.&#x201D; &#x2014; and justifiably so. In her 2021 article for The Atlantic which partly inspired this book, Applebaum didn&#x2019;t mince words, warning that &#x201C;the bad guys are winning.&#x201D; She paints a grim picture of a possible future where international human rights are no longer guaranteed, and global conflict becomes the norm. At the same time, Applebaum points out that democracies cannot completely sever ties with these autocratic regimes, as cooperation will still be necessary on critical issues like climate change.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Yet, despite these challenges, Applebaum maintains an optimistic outlook and advocates for strategies to confront and counter the rise of global autocracy. These solutions are far from simple &#x2013; if they were, notes Applebaum, they would have been implemented long ago. Applebaum proposes that the solutions she lays out in the book be taken on by coalitions of countries that can be more effective in achieving goals such as working toward eliminating any loopholes that allow for money laundering and dark money. She also calls for undermining the information war rather than engaging in direct confrontation. A key part of this strategy is ensuring the information system &#x2014; given its power over public perception &#x2014; functions under strong laws and regulations, similar to the financial system. &#x201C;Since we first encountered Russian disinformation inside our own societies,&#x201D; Applebaum writes, &#x201C;we&#x2019;ve imagined that our existing forms of communication could beat it without any special effort. But no one who studies autocratic propaganda believes that fact-checking or even swift reactions are sufficient. By the time the correction is made, the falsehood has already traveled around the world.&#x201D; Applebaum also warns against relying too heavily on trade with autocratic countries like Russia and China, calling it an &quot;existential&quot; threat. She recalls Europe&#x2019;s dependence on Russian gas and explains how after Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, the switch to more expensive energy sources triggered inflation. Russia then amplified the crisis through the spread of disinformation, fueling support for far-right movements in countries like Germany. For those living comfortably in democratic societies, the dangers posed by countries like Russia might feel distant. However, North Korean troops supporting Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, as well as Iranian drones and missiles with China-supplied components being used to attack Ukrainian infrastructure underscore how this war is not some isolated event. Ukraine&apos;s struggle is not just a fight against Russia &#x2014; it is emblematic of a larger battle for global democratic values, serving as a wake-up call for the world. As complacency risks setting in among democratic nations, the price of inaction might grow ever steeper. Hi, this is Kate Tsurkan, thanks for reading this article.

UK sanctions 20 Russian 'shadow fleet' tankers, announces financial aid to Ukraine	The United Kingdom sanctioned 20 vessels of Russia&#x2019;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; and pledged 35 million pounds ($44 million) in aid to repair Ukraine&#x2019;s energy grid, the British government said on Dec. 17. Russia&apos;s shadow fleet is composed of semi-legal cargo ships transporting Russian products around the globe in violation of international sanctions. The U.K. sanctions follow similar restrictions imposed by the EU, which recently banned 52 vessels transporting Russian oil above the $60-per-barrel price cap from accessing EU ports and services According to estimates, 70% of Russia&#x2019;s seaborne oil exports are transported by such old and poorly insured tankers, fuelling the Kremlin&#x2019;s war chest and posing a grave danger to the environment. This was exemplified by two tankers reportedly going under due to severe weather conditions in December in the Kerch Strait, carrying approximately 4,000 tons of fuel oil on board each. The Ocean Faye, Andaman Skies, and Mianzimu are among the 20 newly sanctioned ships, the British government said. Each will have carried more than 4 million barrels of Russian oil by the end of 2024. With the latest measures, the U.K. has sanctioned over 100 ships for transporting Russian energy, 93 of which are oil tankers. &quot;As (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&apos;s oil revenues continue to fuel the fires of his illegal war, Ukrainian families are enduring cold, dark nights, often without heating, light or electricity, targeted by Russia&apos;s relentless missile attacks,&quot; British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. The newly pledged 35 million pounds will be used to &quot; carry out vital repairs to the electricity transmission network and provide further power generation capacity and critical protection for energy infrastructure,&#x201D; the statement read. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine&apos;s power grid with mass drone and missile attacks, most recently on Dec. 13, heavily damaging energy infrastructure as the winter sets in.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-sanctions-20-russian-shadow-fleet-tankers/	2024-12-17T05:58:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160310001.jpg
Russian forces heavily attacking in Kursk Oblast for 3rd day, Syrskyi says	Russian forces are carrying out an intensive offensive in Kursk Oblast for the third day in a row, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 17, as Ukrainian forces are on the defensive in the border region. &quot;For the third day, Russian forces have been conducting intensive offensive operations in Kursk Oblast, actively using North Korean units,&quot; Syrskyi said in an online address to the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities held in Lviv. Russia reportedly deployed over 10,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in Kursk Oblast since early August. &quot;North Korean mercenaries have already suffered heavy losses,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s commander said, adding that Kyiv&apos;s troops are holding the defenses, destroying enemy personnel and equipment. The Special Operation Forces said that they had killed 50 North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast in three days and injured 47 more. The full extent of North Korean losses is hard to ascertain, as President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is trying to hide the casualties. Despite the losses within Russian and North Korean ranks, the Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Kursk Oblast seem to be increasingly on the back foot, facing a Russian advantage in manpower and equipment. Citing Ukrainian soldiers, The Economist wrote that Ukraine likely lost around half of the territory it had captured in the initial phase of the operation in August and September. An officer talking to the outlet connected this development to the redeployment of elite units that first spearheaded the offensive. Ukraine likely seeks to hold on to a piece of Russian territory as a possible bargaining chip ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s expected push for peace negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-attacking-in-kursk-oblast-for-3rd-day/	2024-12-17T05:30:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2180021122.jpg
Ukraine's parliament supports bill on multiple citizenship in first reading	The Ukrainian parliament on Dec. 17 supported in the first reading a bill allowing multiple citizenship for Ukrainian citizens, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said. The Ukrainian law currently specifies that Ukrainians can hold only a single citizenship, while multiple citizenship is not recognized. President Volodymyr Zelensky submitted the bill legalizing multiple citizenship in August and stressed its importance as part of his internal resilience plan in November. The bill, supported by 247 lawmakers in the first reading, still has to pass a second reading and be signed by the president before becoming law. The parliament also asked the Constitutional Court to review the document. The legislation lists permissible cases for holding multiple citizenship, simplifies procedures for foreigners to obtain Ukrainian citizenship, and establishes new grounds for losing citizenship, such as receiving a Russian passport or serving in the Russian Armed Forces. The bill is also seen as part of Ukraine&apos;s effort to strengthen ties with the Ukrainians living abroad. Zelensky said the document should allow ethnic Ukrainians born abroad to obtain citizenship. Even before the full-scale invasion, the Ukrainian diaspora has been widespread around the world, with particularly large communities in the EU, the U.S., and Canada. The war drew millions more from their home, with some 6.7 million living as refugees abroad as of August 2024. To foster the relationship with the Ukrainian community abroad, the government launched a new department called the National Unity Ministry, headed by former Naftogaz chief Oleksii Chernyshov.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-parliament-supports-bill-on-multiple-citizenship-in-first-reading/	2024-12-17T04:40:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167567610.jpg
Slovak energy company, partners call for continued gas transit via Ukraine	Slovakia&apos;s state-owned energy company SPP and its partners in Hungary, Italy, and Austria called for continued gas transit through Ukraine in a declearation published on Dec. 17. The deal under which Russian gas transits to the EU via Ukrainian territory is set to expire on Dec. 31. Kyiv said it has no intention of prolonging the deal as Moscow continues to wage its all-out war. &quot;The declaration, drafted by the SPP, is meant to support the continuation of gas transit through Ukrainian territory and to sustain its gas infrastructure since it is the most advantageous solution not only for European buyers but for Ukraine itself,&quot; the company said in a statement. The document will be presented to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen so that she can receive &quot;first-hand information about the threat to the energy and economic security in our region,&quot; the statement read. SPP chairman Vojtech Ferencz said that replacing the entire volume of gas transiting from Ukraine would cost the company an additional 150 million euros ($157 million). Cutting the transit will also increase gas prices ahead of the coming winter and can reduce profits of SPP&apos;s subsidiary Eustream, which cooperates with Ukrainian gas companies, Ferencz added. Despite Europe&apos;s efforts to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels in the wake of a full-scale invasion, many countries remain heavily dependent on Russian gas, with Slovakia, Hungary, and Austria among the main buyers. Only in June this year did the EU approve sanctions against the Russian gas industry, targeting liquefied natural gas (LNG) rather than pipeline gas. Following discussions with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, his Ukrainian counterpart Denys Shmyhal said Kyiv is open to negotiating gas transit for any origin except Russian. &quot;To this effect, if the European Commission officially approaches Ukraine about the transit of any gas other than Russian, we naturally will discuss it and are ready to reach an appropriate agreement,&quot; Shmyhal noted in a statement. Fico, ahead of his talks with Shmyhal, emphasized that maintaining gas transit is not solely a bilateral concern for Ukraine&#x2019;s neighbors but an issue affecting the entire European Union.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovak-energy-company-partners-call-for-continued-gas-transit-via-ukraine/	2024-12-17T04:00:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1247343791.jpg
Latvia announces surprise combat readiness check of its military	Latvia&apos;s Armed Forces on Dec. 17 announced snap military exercises across the country &quot;to test and improve procedures and units&apos; combat readiness.&quot; While the Latvian Defense Ministry said that the drills are &quot;not related to changes in the security environment,&quot; the exercises take place amid surging tensions between NATO and Russia. The partial test will consist of moving units across Latvia to different sites where they will perform assigned tasks. &#x1F4E2; &#x160;odien, 17. decembr&#x12B;, vis&#x101; Latvij&#x101; notiek Nacion&#x101;lo bru&#x146;oto sp&#x113;ku vien&#x12B;bu kaujas gatav&#x12B;bas p&#x101;rbaude.

Latvia, a NATO member country of 1.8 million with a sizeable Russian minority, borders Russia and its key ally in the region, Belarus. One of Ukraine&#x2019;s biggest supporters, Riga has committed to providing military support at the level of 0.25% of its GDP every year and will provide thousands of drones. Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have been raising alarm about a growing Russian threat to the Baltic region and the alliance as a whole. As they prepare for possible conflict, the three nations agreed to build a Baltic defense line in the coming years to strengthen the eastern border with Belarus and Russia. Lithuania, another Baltic state bordering Russia&#x2019;s Kaliningrad enclave, has blocked and fortified a bridge over the Nieman River, linking it to the Russian exclave. The country has also drafted plans to relocate a quarter of its population in the case of war. In light of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, civil preparedness measures have been under review also in Latvia and Estonia.	https://kyivindependent.com/latvia-announces-surprise-combat-readiness-check/	2024-12-17T02:57:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/465153903_985283550296698_6057308511895131157_n.jpg
Ukraine's Special Forces claim to kill 50 North Korean soldiers in 3 days	Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces killed 50 North Korean soldiers and injured 47 others in three days of fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the unit said on Dec. 17. The Special Operation Forces published footage of first-person-view (FPV) drones successfully targeting soldiers and equipment on the battlefield. Russia has reportedly deployed over 10,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in Kursk Oblast since early August. &quot;Soldiers of the 8th Special Forces Regiment of Prince Izyaslav Mstislavich organized a warm welcome for North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast,&quot; the unit said on Facebook. Two armored vehicles, two cars, and one all-terrain vehicle were also allegedly hit. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. After reporting initial but limited clashes with North Korean troops in November, Ukraine said that over the weekend, Russia also began using the soldiers in ground assaults. The Ukrainian military intelligence agency (HUR) said that 30 North Korean soldiers were killed or injured during assaults on Dec. 14-15. The full extent of North Korean losses might be hard to ascertain, as President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is trying to hide the casualties. Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder confirmed on Dec. 16 that North Korean personnel had engaged in combat operations alongside Russian troops in Kursk Oblast and suffered their first casualties.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-special-forces-claim-to-kill-50-north-korean-soldiers-in-3-days/	2024-12-17T02:30:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/SOF.png
South Korea imposes new sanctions over Russia-North Korea cooperation	South Korea imposed sanctions on 11 individuals and 15 entities &quot;engaged in illegal military cooperation between Russia and North Korea,&quot; the South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Dec. 17. The sanctions will enter into force by Dec. 19. Among the sanctioned individuals are high-ranking North Korean military officers deployed to Russia and a senior missile engineer in the North Korean army, as well as an elite unit called &quot;Storm Corps&quot; and their commander, also deployed to Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine. Ukrainian and Western officials issued warnings in the fall of 2024 that over 10,000 North Korean troops had amassed in Kursk Oblast, ready to aid Russia&apos;s attempt to oust Ukrainian forces after Kyiv launched a surprise incursion in the region in August. The sanctions list further includes seven Russian individuals and 13 organizations, including several banks. Seoul accused them of facilitating arms trade between Russia and North Korea, supplying the Russian military with North Korean telecommunications equipment, and helping North Korea&apos;s nuclear and missile program. The sanctions mean that financial transactions with these entities will require Seoul&#x2019;s prior approval. South Korea has committed economic and humanitarian support to Ukraine, recently providing a $100 million loan to help keep Kyiv&apos;s budget afloat. Seoul has not supplied Ukraine with direct lethal support, a step prohibited by the country&apos;s legislation. A Ukrainian delegation to the East Asian country met with the now-impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has signaled the possibility of providing military aid to Ukraine in light of growing cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang. In a recent video address, President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that North Koreans were participating in Russian assaults in the Kursk region. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence has claimed that at least 30 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded on the Kursk front.	https://kyivindependent.com/south-korea-imposes-sanctions-over-russia-north-korea-cooperation/	2024-12-17T02:01:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1238947016.jpg
Ukraine 'strongly condemns' African delegation's visit to Russian-occupied territories	The Foreign Ministry on Dec. 16 condemned the visit of the Pan-African Parliament&apos;s delegation to Ukraine&apos;s Russian-occupied territories. Representatives from a dozen African countries arrived in Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk Oblast earlier in December &quot;to find out the truth of the Russian people.&quot; Their statements, quoted by the Russian state media, parroted Kremlin propaganda lines about the West&#x2019;s proxy war against Russia and the &quot;brotherhood&quot; of the Russian-Ukrainian nations. &quot;Their statements during this visit about opposing colonialism, made on Ukrainian land illegally seized by Russia in the course of its neocolonial war of aggression against Ukraine, are completely absurd,&quot; the statement read. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry strongly protests the visit of the delegation of the Pan-African Parliament.&quot; The Pan-African Parliament is the legislative body of the African Union, a 55-member strong international organization of the African continent. Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion and the blockade of its Black Sea ports threatened imminent famine in developing countries, including much of Africa, until a trade corridor agreement was reached, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. Russia announced in 2023 that it was withdrawing from the Black Sea Grain Initiative, critical for ensuring global food security, effectively collapsing the deal. Subsequently, Ukraine opened a new corridor, restoring its exports via the Black Sea.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-condemns-african-delegations-visit-to-russian-occupied-territories/	2024-12-17T01:18:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1983501762.jpg

SBU behind killing of Russian general charged with chemical weapons crimes, source claims	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops, was killed on Dec. 17 in an operation of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent. Kirillov and another Russian service member were reportedly killed in an explosion earlier the same day at a residence in Moscow. Ukraine previously charged the commander with using banned chemical weapons in the war against Ukraine. According to the source, explosives attached to a scooter detonated when Kirillov and his aide approached the entrance of the house on Ryazansky Prospect in Moscow.

Ukrainian soldiers and officers interviewed by the Kyiv Independent acknowledged that the tactic is effective, allowing Moscow to capture positions occasionally without destroying them.

Defense Ministry to investigate alleged abuse of service members in 211th Brigade	Defense Minister Rustem Umerov on Dec. 16 ordered an investigation into the alleged abuse, extortion, and humiliation of soldiers in the 211th Pontoon Bridge Brigade by their commanders. The announcement comes after Ukrainska Pravda reported that the unit&apos;s officers have beaten service members, extorted money from them, and even tied one soldier to a wooden cross as a punishment. Umerov ordered the ministry&apos;s main inspectorate to investigate Ukrainska Pravda&apos;s revelations, adding that such behavior would be &quot;unacceptable in the third year of the war.&quot; &quot;My position as a minister is clear: all those responsible must be punished.&quot; Defense Ministry spokesperson Dmytro Lazutkin said that the department had not received any reports of abuse of soldiers in the brigade. He described the commanders&apos; alleged behavior as &quot;shameful&quot; and &quot;contradicting the basic principles of building a modern Ukrainian army.&quot; At the same time, Lazutkin said these cases do not happen on a &quot;massive&quot; scale. &quot;The Ukrainian military consists of over a million service members. Various cases happen. We had no information about these cases,&quot; Lazutkin told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. In response to the media investigation, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi also ordered an inspection and suspended Colonel Oleh Poberezhniuk, the brigade commander. The 211th Brigade, formed in August 2023, performs engineering work, builds defenses in the rear, and does not participate in direct combat. According to Ukrainska Pravda, the cases of abuse surfaced after the start of official checks in the spring of 2024. The outlet&apos;s sources named now-Captain Vladyslav Pastukh, Poborezhniuk&apos;s godson and the son of the unit&apos;s chief of staff, as one of the main perpetrators. The officer was said to have extorted money from soldiers on account of being related to the unit&apos;s most senior officers. Though Pastukh no longer serves in the unit, the media investigation identified almost a dozen cases of fathers and sons or husbands and wives serving together in the 211th Brigade. The revelations come as Ukraine faces mounting challenges in replenishing the ranks of its Armed Forces, facing low enlistment rates and even cases of desertion. Mykhailo Drapatyi, the new commander of the Ground Forces, recently announced wide-ranging reforms focusing on recruitment and training.	https://kyivindependent.com/defense-ministry-addresses-alleged-abuse-in-211th-brigade/	2024-12-16T23:29:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1620354990.jpg

Russian general charged with chemical weapons crimes reported dead in Moscow explosion	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops, was reportedly killed in an explosion at a residence in Moscow the morning of Dec. 17, according to Russian media. Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) on Dec. 16 sentenced Kirillov in absentia for the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine. Kirillov and another Russian servicemember, reported to be his personal assistant, were killed in an explosion near the entrance to a residential building in Moscow in the early hours of Dec. 17, according to the Russian Telegram news channel Astra. Russia&apos;s Investigative Committee has opened a criminal case on the incident. The committee reported that the explosion was caused by a device planted on a scooter near the entrance to the building. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these reports. The SBU alleged on Dec. 16 that Kirillov was responsible for &quot;the massive use of banned chemical weapons&quot; against the Ukrainian military. &quot;On Kirillov&apos;s orders, since the beginning of the full-scale war, more than 4,800 cases of enemy use of chemical munitions have been recorded,&quot; the SBU claimed. The U.K. issued sanctions against Kirillov and his unit over the use of chemical weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine on Oct. 8. Ukraine has previously targeted Russian officials who play a key role in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &#xA0; Mikhail Shatsky, a Russian expert involved in modernizing missiles launched against Ukraine, was shot dead near Moscow on Dec. 12, a Defense Forces source told the Kyiv Independent.

West should pressure Russia into peace talks, not Ukraine, Polish FM says	Western nations should push Russia, not Ukraine, into peace negotiations to stop the war, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said at a press conference in Brussels on Dec. 16. Sikorski&apos;s comments come as Europe braces for a withdrawal of U.S. support once President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House. Trump has promised to accelerate negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. As the aggressor in the conflict, Russia should be the one facing pressure to negotiate, Sikorski said. &quot;Both the United States and the European Union must help Ukraine to achieve a better negotiating position for possible future negotiations, which should be encouraged and forced on the aggressor, not the victim,&quot; he said. Sikorski called on Europe and its allies to form a united front against Russia, and said the E.U. should become more &quot;tense&quot; in its response to Russian aggression. Ukraine&apos;s allies have doubled down on economic and military support for Kyiv in attempts to strengthen the war-torn nation&apos;s hand before any potential peace talks. The E.U on Dec. 16 adopted its 15th sanctions package against Moscow, targeting Russia&apos;s shadow fleet and defense sector. Before the package was announced, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha updated his European counterparts, including Sikorski, on the situation in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-fm-sikorski-calls-for-western-pressure-on-russia-to-end-war/	2024-12-16T21:10:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/sikorski-2-1.jpg
North Korean soldiers 'legitimate targets' for Ukrainian military, US official says	North Korean soldiers fighting alongside Russian forces in Kursk Oblast are already &quot;legitimate targets&quot; for the Ukrainian military, U.S. State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Dec. 16. The remarks came the same day that the Pentagon confirmed the first North Korean casualties in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. &quot;North Korean soldiers who were deployed to Kursk are already legitimate targets,&quot; Miller told reporters during a press briefing. &#xA0; &quot;They entered a war, and they are, as such, combatants and are legitimate targets for the Ukrainian military. &#xA0;We have seen North Korean soldiers who have been killed in action on the battlefield inside Russia.&quot; Miller warned that if North Korean personnel crossed the border from Russia into Ukraine and engaged in combat, the U.S. would consider it a significant escalation in the war. &quot;And if they were to cross the border into Ukraine, that would be yet another escalation by the Government of Russia and also an escalation by the Government of North Korea ... That would absolutely be an escalation,&quot; he said. Miller declined to say what the U.S. response would be to such an escalation by Moscow and Pyongyang. &quot;I&apos;m not going to preview that publicly,&quot; he said. President Volodymyr Zelensky reported on Dec. 14 that North Koreans had begun engaging in assault operations with Russian troops fighting aginst Ukraine in Kursk Oblast. Ukraine and the U.S. had sounded the alarm on the deployment of North Korean soldiers in the region for months prior. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) said on Dec. 16 that at least 30 North Korean personnel had been killed or wounded in assaults in Kursk. Zelensky then alleged that Russia has gone to great lengths to hide North Korean losses, including burning soldiers&apos; bodies. Thus far, North Korean units have only been deployed in Kursk Oblast, the Russian border region that Ukrainian troops attacked in a shock offensive in August. North Korean troops have not yet engaged in combat on the Ukrainian side of the border. Russia and North Korea have deepened their economic and military ties since the full-scale invasion of February 2022. The two nations signed a defense treaty in June, requiring either state to render military aid to the other in the event of an attack.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-soldiers-legitimate-targets-for-ukrainian-military-us-official-says/	2024-12-16T20:33:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2155312256.jpg
Russia to mass-produce Oreshnik ballistic missiles, Putin claims	Russia plans to begin mass production of its Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), Russian President Vladimir Putin alleged at a defense ministry board meeting on Dec. 16. Russia first launched the experimental Oreshnik missile in an attack against Dnipro on Nov. 21. Putin claimed the strike was a response to Ukraine&apos;s use of U.S. and British long-range missiles to attack Russian territory. Putin said on Dec. 16 that large-scale Oreshnik production was a goal for the &quot;near future.&quot; &quot;In the near future, serial production of such systems should be ensured to protect the security of Russia and our allies,&quot; he said. A former Russian defense engineer previously told the Moscow Times that mass production of Oreshnik missiles would take years, due to bureaucratic and technological difficulties in Russia. The Oreshnik is an IRBM capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Putin has boasted that the missile travels at 10 times the speed of sound. He has also alleged that the weapon cannot be intercepted by air defense systems, a claim refuted by President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Kremlin has leveraged possession of Oreshnik missiles in escalating anti-Western rhetoric and threats against Ukraine. A week after the strike on Dnipro, Putin on Nov. 28 threatened to target &quot;decision-making centers in Kyiv&quot; with Oreshnik strikes. An unnamed U.S. National Security Council representative warned on Dec. 13 that Russia was considering launching an Oreshnik missile at Ukraine over the upcoming weekend. No such attack took place. The intense media attention devoted to the Oreshnik in the aftermath of the Dnipro strike was the result of an orchestrated Russian attempt to stir panic in the West, four Russian officials told the Moscow Times in early December. Some defense experts say the Oreshnik missile is likely not an entirely new development, but rather an upgraded version of Russia&apos;s RS-26 missile. The RS-26, also known as the Rubezh, was first produced in 2011. Russia has yet to use the Oreshnik in any attacks against Ukraine since the strike on Nov. 21. &#xA0; &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-announces-mass-production-of-oreshnik-missiles/	2024-12-16T19:23:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185738307.jpg
Russia trying to hide North Korean losses in Ukraine war, Zelensky claims	The Russian military is attempting to hide the losses of North Korean soldiers fighting in the war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on Dec. 16. Zelensky&apos;s remarks came after Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) and the U.S. Pentagon on Dec. 16 reported that North Korean troops suffered casualties in assault operations alongside Russian forces in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Russia is not only involving North Korean soldiers in assaults on Ukrainian positions, but is also trying to hide the losses of these people,&quot; Zelensky said via his official Telegram channel. The Russian military has attempted to keep the presence of North Korean units secret throughout their training and deployment, Zelensky said. He also claimed that Moscow has resorted to extreme tactics to disguise the identities of North Korean soldiers killed in combat. Russia tries to &quot;burn the faces&quot; of North Korean soldiers after they are killed, Zelensky alleged. His post shared a video purportedly showing Russian personnel setting fire to the bodies of North Korean fighters on the front line. The Kyiv Independent could not confirm Zelensky&apos;s claim or the veracity of the video. &quot;There is no reason for Koreans to fight and die for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;And even after their deaths, all that awaits them from Russia is mockery.&quot; Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder confirmed on Dec. 16 that North Korean personnel had engaged in combat operations alongside Russian troops in Kursk Oblast and suffered their first casualties. The confirmation came after Zelensky reported on Dec. 14 that North Koreans were participating in Russian assaults in the Kursk region. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence has claimed that at least 30 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded on the Kursk front. Ukrainian and Western officials issued warnings in fall 2024 that over 10,000 North Korean troops had amassed in Kursk Oblast, ready to aid Russia&apos;s attempt to oust Ukrainian forces after Kyiv launched a surprise incursion in the region in August. The first clashes between North Korean and Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast were reported in early November. Zelensky and Western officials have accused Russia of dramatically escalating the war against Ukraine by involving a foreign state in the conflict.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-trying-to-hide-north-korean-losses-zelensky-claims/	2024-12-16T17:54:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187689001.jpg
Russian gas transit deal ends on December 31, won't be renewed, PM Shmyhal says	Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Dec. 16 that the deal allowing Russian gas to transit through Ukraine will not be extended beyond the end of the year. His statement comes as several European countries intensify efforts to secure alternative energy supplies. Following discussions with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, Shmyhal said Ukraine is open to negotiating gas transit for any origin except Russian. &quot;To this effect, if the European Commission officially approaches Ukraine about the transit of any gas other than Russian, we naturally will discuss it and are ready to reach an appropriate agreement,&quot; Shmyhal noted in a statement on his Telegram channel. &quot;I stressed that Ukraine&apos;s agreement with Russia on gas transit comes to an end on 1st January 2025 and will not be extended.&quot; Shmyhal added that significant progress has been made over the past year to ensure EU countries have sufficient energy supplies, particularly gas. Slovakia and other nations relying on Russian gas transiting through Ukraine are engaged in discussions to prevent disruptions when the contract expires. Fico, ahead of his talks with Shmyhal, emphasized that maintaining gas transit is not solely a bilateral concern for Ukraine&#x2019;s neighbors but an issue affecting the entire European Union. Fico previously said his goal to ensure continued eastern gas supplies to avoid increased costs associated with alternative transit routes. Slovakia holds a long-term contract with Russian energy giant Gazprom. Slovak Economy Minister Denisa Sakova said earlier in Brussels that European countries and companies collectively require around 15 billion cubic meters of Russian gas next year via Ukraine and are negotiating ways to secure new supplies. Slovakia is aiming for an agreement covering gas deliveries for the next two to three years. The EU, meanwhile, has set a target to phase out Russian fossil fuels by 2027.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-gas-transit-deal-ends-on-december-31-wont-be-renewed-pm-shmyhal-says/	2024-12-16T16:55:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-467548811.jpg
EU imposes sanctions on Chinese companies, North Korean minister over Ukraine war	The EU imposed fully fledged sanctions on Dec. 16, including asset freezes and visa bans, on Chinese firms for supplying Russia&apos;s military for the war against Ukraine. The bloc has also added North Korea&apos;s defense minister to its sanctions blacklist after the secretive state sent troops to Russia to reinforce its military. The move &#x2014; part of the EU&apos;s 15th round of sanctions during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine &#x2014; represented an effort to tackle the crucial role allegedly being played by China in keeping Russia&apos;s war machine going. The EU said it was blacklisting four Chinese companies for &quot;supplying sensitive drone components and microelectronic components&quot; to the Russian military, according to AFP. Two other firms and one Chinese businesswoman were hit for circumventing EU sanctions aimed at stopping equipment flowing to Moscow. Among the companies was Xiamen Limbach, alleged to have supplied engines for long-range attack drones used by Russia against Ukraine. The EU has previously targeted Chinese firms for supporting Russia&apos;s military. But until now, the bloc has imposed bans on European firms doing business with Chinese companies rather than the tougher sanctions now being applied. The EU also took aim at North Korea in the latest package after Pyongyang dispatched troops for Russia to fight Ukraine. The 27-nation bloc added defense minister No Kwang Chol and deputy chief of the general staff Kim Yong Bok to a number of North Korean officials already blacklisted. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported that at least 30 North Korean soldiers were killed or wounded during assault operations near the villages of Plekhovo, Vorozhba, and Martynovka on Dec. 14-15. North Korean soldiers have been stationed in Kursk Oblast since October, initially taking on support roles. Their recent involvement in ground assault operations highlights the growing military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-imposes-sanctions-on-chinese-companies-north-korean-minister-over-ukraine-war/	2024-12-16T15:42:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1882258789.jpeg
Estonia urges NATO allies to boost defense spending to counter Russian threat, Reuters reports	Estonia plans to propose that members of the U.K.-led Joint Expeditionary Force, a coalition of northern European NATO countries, commit at least 2.5% of GDP to defense spending in response to the ongoing threat from Russia, Prime Minister Kristen Michal said on Dec. 16. Currently, only 23 of NATO&apos;s 32 members are on track to meet the alliance&apos;s target of spending at least 2% of GDP on defense. &quot;Everybody in NATO and in the EU right now has the feeling in their backbone that you should increase defense expenditure because of what is happening all over the world and with Russia,&quot; Michal told Reuters, emphasizing that &quot;Europe as the wealthiest region of the world has to spend more on defense, security, and security.&quot; Michal will host the Joint Expeditionary Force leaders in Tallinn this week, with discussions set to focus on Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of oil tankers. He called the fleet &quot;an environmental disaster waiting to happen.&quot; Estonia has significantly increased its defense budget, allocating 3.2% of GDP to defense in 2024, more than double its spending since the all-out war in Ukraine began nearly three years ago. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pledged to raise the U.K.&#x2019;s defense spending to 2.5% of GDP, but only after a defense strategy review and when financially feasible. Meanwhile, incoming U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed a desire to end the war in Ukraine quickly, though he has not provided details on his plans. Michal emphasized the importance of securing lasting peace and suggested seizing 200 to 300 billion euros of Russia&#x2019;s frozen assets to help rebuild Ukraine. He also proposed additional taxes on Russian goods, aiming to raise another 300 billion euros. &quot;That would bring lasting peace,&quot; Michal said, explaining that such measures would cripple Russia&#x2019;s ability to continue hostilities, including hybrid attacks, while strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s military resources. &quot;Ukraine is part of Europe; it should be a member of NATO,&quot; Michal added.	https://kyivindependent.com/estonia-urges-nato-allies-to-boost-defense-spending-to-counter-russian-threat-reuters-reports/	2024-12-16T13:30:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-477566314.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia sets goal to fully occupy 4 Ukrainian regions in 2025	Key developments on Dec. 16: Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said during a Defense Ministry meeting on Dec. 16 that Moscow aims to seize the entirety of Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts in 2025. Speaking at a Defense Ministry meeting, Belousov reiterated Russia&apos;s commitment to achieving what he described as the &quot;goals announced by President Vladimir Putin in June.&quot; &quot;In 2025, Moscow plans to achieve victory in the war,&quot; he added. On June 14, Putin stated that Russia would agree to a ceasefire and peace talks only if Ukraine withdrew from the four Ukrainian oblasts and formally abandoned its aspirations to join NATO. Putin&apos;s additional demands include recognizing Crimea and Sevastopol as part of Russia. &quot;As soon as Kyiv declares readiness for such a decision and begins a real withdrawal of troops, as well as officially abandons its NATO ambitions, we will immediately cease fire and begin negotiations,&quot; Putin said at the time. Despite Russia&apos;s claims, large portions of these regions remain under Ukrainian control. Regional capitals Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are firmly held by Ukraine, while Moscow occupies parts of Donetsk and Luhansk, territories it initially invaded in 2014. During the Dec. 16 meeting, Belousov also emphasized the need for Russia to prepare for potential conflicts with NATO within the next decade. Putin&apos;s declaration of the illegal annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts in September 2022 was widely condemned internationally. The Kremlin continues to struggle in its attempts to secure full control over these regions amidst fierce Ukrainian resistance. President-elect Donald Trump expressed his intent to make &#x201C;a little progress&#x201D; in ending the war in Ukraine at his first news conference since winning the presidential election. Speaking from Mar-a-Lago on Dec. 16, Trump described the conflict as &#x201C;horrible&#x201D; and emphasized the urgent need to stop it. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re trying to get the war stopped, that horrible, horrible war that&#x2019;s going on in Ukraine, Russia, Ukraine,&#x201D; Trump said. He added, &#x201C;We&#x2019;re going to get a little progress. It&#x2019;s a tough one, it&#x2019;s a nasty one, it&#x2019;s nasty.&#x201D; The President-elect criticized the high human cost of the conflict, claiming the death toll &#x201C;on both sides&#x201D; is likely far higher than reported. Trump attributed the heavy casualties to Ukraine&#x2019;s flat terrain, adding that &#x201C;the only thing that stops a bullet is a body, a human body.&#x201D; Trump confirmed he had not invited President Volodymyr Zelensky to his January inauguration but noted that Zelensky would be &#x201C;welcome&#x201D; if he chose to attend. The president-elect previously met with Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Dec. 7 to discuss the war. According to Reuters, the meeting did not yield a specific peace plan, though Trump called for an immediate ceasefire, while Zelensky underscored the need for security guarantees. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is racing to deliver additional aid to Ukraine, announcing a $988 million military aid package on Dec. 7. However, Trump has signaled plans to reduce such assistance once in office to push Ukraine into negotiations that could include territorial concessions. Although critical of Biden&#x2019;s decision to allow Ukraine to use U.S. ATACMS missiles against Russian territory, Trump reiterated that he does not plan to &#x201C;abandon&#x201D; Ukraine. Instead, he aims to use U.S. support as leverage to pressure Kyiv and Moscow to reach a peace agreement. Ukraine is now among the nations with laser weapon capabilities, Colonel Vadym Sukharevskyi, commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces, announced on Dec. 16, as reported by Interfax-Ukraine. Speaking at the &quot;European Defense Industry: Prospects for Cooperation with the Ukrainian Defense Industry&quot; conference, Sukharevskyi said Ukraine&apos;s laser system, called Tryzub, can down aircraft at altitudes exceeding 2 kilometers. &quot;This laser is real and operational,&quot; he emphasized, adding that efforts are underway to scale up its capabilities. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t immediately verify Sukharevskyi&apos;s claim. Sukharevskyi also discussed the development of &quot;mother drones,&quot; or &quot;queen drones,&quot; which carry two FPV (first-person view) light attack drones. These drones, capable of flying over 70 kilometers into enemy territory, serve as repeaters and hit deep targets. He described this innovation as a &quot;breakthrough&quot; in Ukraine&apos;s drone technology. The Unmanned Systems Forces, established less than six months ago, already include combat and research units operating across air, land, and sea. Ukraine&apos;s defense industry has gained momentum since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov recently announced the serial production of Palianytsia, a lightweight missile-drone hybrid, further advancing Ukraine&apos;s military capabilities. North Korean troops have joined combat operations in the Kursk Oblast, marking the first confirmed engagement of North Korean soldiers alongside the Russian military, Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder said on Dec. 16. &quot;We do assess that North Korean soldiers have engaged in combat in Kursk. We have indications that they have suffered casualties, both killed and wounded,&quot; Ryder said, as reported by Reuters. While the U.S. lacks precise casualty figures, Ryder added that North Korean troops began combat operations last week. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) claimed that at least 30 North Korean soldiers were killed or wounded during assault operations near the villages of Plekhovo, Vorozhba, and Martynovka on Dec. 14-15. Fresh reinforcements from North Korea&apos;s 94th Separate Brigade are reportedly being deployed to replace the losses. The HUR also alleged that a &quot;friendly-fire&quot; incident on Dec. 14 resulted in North Korean troops killing eight Russian soldiers. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify HUR&apos;s claims. North Korean soldiers have been present in Kursk Oblast since October, initially serving in support roles. Their recent participation in ground assault operations reflects a deepening military collaboration between Pyongyang and Moscow amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine. Russia should prepare for multiple scenarios, including a war with NATO, in the next 10 years, Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said during a Defense Ministry meeting on Dec. 16, the Interfax news agency reported. Speaking about a possible confrontation with the alliance, Belousov pointed to unspecified changes in NATO countries&apos; doctrines and conclusions reached during the Washington summit in July. &#x201C;(Preparing for war) is indicated by the decisions that were made at the North Atlantic Alliance summit held in July of this year. This is also reflected in the doctrinal documents of the United States and other NATO countries,&quot; Belousov said. During NATO&#x2019;s 75th-anniversary celebration and summit in July, Ukraine received more air defense systems, $43 billion in funding, a NATO representative in Kyiv, and new bilateral security agreements, as well as the pledge that its path toward membership is &quot;irreversible.&quot; Tensions between NATO and Russia have been mounting since the allied countries began providing arms and other support to Ukraine after the outbreak of the full-scale invasion. Moscow has issued a number of veiled and overt threats to the West over its support for Kyiv, including warnings of a possible nuclear response. Multiple Western officials have raised warnings about a possible open clash with Russia in the coming years, with NATO leaders calling for increasing the defense spending benchmark from 2% to 3% of gross domestic product. Speaking at the meeting, Belousov claimed that Ukraine lost &quot;almost 1 million people&quot; during the full-scale war, a figure much higher than the numbers provided by Kyiv and the Western media. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine suffered 43,000 soldiers killed and 400,000 injured, while The Economist estimated Kyiv&apos;s casualties at 60,000-100,000 killed and 400,000 injured. Belousov also announced the planned creation of a military branch dedicated to unmanned systems, which should be finalized in the third quarter of 2025. Ukraine already established the Unmanned Systems Forces in September this year. Russian President Vladimir Putin also spoke at the meeting, accusing the West of &quot;pushing Russia to a red line from which we can no longer retreat.&quot; He further said that NATO is increasing its military presence near the Russian border and in other regions of the world. The Kremlin&apos;s chief went on to accuse the U.S. of preparing a deployment of missiles with a range of &quot;up to 5,500 kilometers&quot; in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, saying that Russia will lift &quot;all restrictions&quot; on the deployment of its own weapons if Washington takes this step. Russia withdrew from multiple treaties on nuclear arms during the full-scale war and deployed a new intermediate-range ballistic missile, Oreshnik, in a strike against Dnipro in November. Putin also claimed that Russian forces had conquered 189 settlements in Ukraine this year and that &quot;over 1,000&quot; people sign contracts with Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry every day to join the war. The European Union will train 75,000 Ukrainian military personnel as part of its EUMAM training mission by February 2025, EU chief diplomat Kaja Kallas announced at a press conference following the Foreign Affairs Council on Dec. 16. &quot;The EU must continue supporting Ukraine militarily. By the end of winter, the EU will have trained 75,000 Ukrainian service members,&quot; Kallas said. Kallas also highlighted that the EU has provided Ukraine with 4.2 billion euros in budget support this month and will begin allocating 1.5 billion euros monthly starting January 2025. Kallas emphasized the importance of further aid, echoing Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha&apos;s call during the ministerial meeting for increased ammunition supplies, stronger air defenses, and expanded support for Ukraine&apos;s defense industry. &quot;We must give Ukraine what it needs to win the war,&quot; Kallas stressed. Launched in October 2022, the European Union Military Assistance Mission in support of Ukraine (EUMAM) has already trained approximately 60,000 Ukrainian troops as of August 2024, primarily in Germany and Poland. The mission focuses on improving the operational capabilities of Ukrainian forces to bolster their resistance against Russia&apos;s aggression. The EU&apos;s previous top diplomat, Josep Borrell, hailed EUMAM as the &quot;most successful training mission the EU has ever launched.&quot; With this expanded commitment, the EU continues to strengthen its military support for Ukraine as the war enters its third winter.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-its-a-tough-one-trump-says-following-questions-on-how-he-plans-to-stop-russias-war-against-ukraine/	2024-12-16T12:14:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2165190554.jpg
Ukraine condemns Hungary’s ‘peacekeeping’ proposals, calls them manipulative	The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry has criticized Hungary&apos;s &quot;peacekeeping&quot; statements as unrealistic and manipulative, calling on Hungarian officials on Dec. 16 to stop distorting the realities of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine for political gain. The ministry accused Hungary of effectively advocating for Ukraine to surrender to Russian aggression while obstructing international efforts to support Kyiv. &#x201C;Hungarian officials once again claim that they can stop the war. However, these statements do not reflect reality. Following Hungary&apos;s &apos;peacekeeping&apos; calls to Moscow, deadly missiles and drones are striking Ukrainian cities and communities,&#x201D; the ministry said in a statement. &#x201C;Hungary&#x2019;s actual proposals are even further from peacemaking than its statements,&#x201D; it added, noting that Budapest&#x2019;s continued unilateral contacts with Moscow undermine collective efforts to achieve a just and sustainable peace. The response came after Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto claimed on Dec. 15 that President Volodymyr Zelensky had &#x201C;forcefully but politely&#x201D; declined Prime Minister Viktor Orb&#xE1;n&#x2019;s proposal for a Christmas ceasefire. Hungary, which maintains close ties with Moscow despite Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has consistently criticized EU sanctions against Russia and blocked initiatives to provide military aid to Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-condemns-hungarys-peacekeeping-stance-calls-it-manipulative/	2024-12-16T11:52:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2157690664.jpg

It&#x2019;s a tough one, it&#x2019;s a nasty one, it&#x2019;s nasty.&#x201D; The President-elect criticized the high human cost of the conflict, claiming the death toll &#x201C;on both sides&#x201D; is likely far higher than reported.

Bundestag votes no confidence in Scholz government, elections set for February	Chancellor Olaf Scholz failed a confidence vote in the Bundestag on Dec. 16, paving the way for early parliamentary elections scheduled for Feb. 23. Out of 717 lawmakers who participated in the vote, only 207 supported Scholz&#x2019;s government, matching the size of his Social Democratic Party (SPD) faction. A total of 394 MPs expressed no confidence, while 116 abstained. The SPD faces criticism for its defense policies, including its refusal to deliver Taurus long-range missiles to Ukraine. According to a leaked draft of the party&apos;s election platform, the SPD remains opposed to the missiles, citing that providing them could escalate Germany&#x2019;s involvement in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Scholz has maintained this stance despite calls from Kyiv and other Western allies. Friedrich Merz, leader of the opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU), has voiced support for supplying Taurus missiles to Ukraine. Merz, whose CDU/CSU alliance is leading in the polls ahead of the February election, visited Kyiv and pledged a more assertive approach to arming Ukraine. &quot;We want your army to be capable of hitting military bases in Russia. Not civilians, not infrastructure, but military targets from which your country is being attacked,&quot; Merz said during his visit, although he cautioned that the missiles would not be a &#x201C;miraculous&#x201D; solution to the conflict. The CDU&#x2019;s election platform reportedly commits to comprehensive support for Ukraine, including diplomatic, financial, humanitarian, and military aid. Merz has also argued that Germany could lift restrictions on the Taurus missiles without becoming a direct participant in the war, following precedents set by the U.K. and U.S. As the elections approach, defense and foreign policy are likely to remain central issues, with the CDU positioning itself as a stronger ally to Ukraine compared to Scholz&#x2019;s SPD.	https://kyivindependent.com/bundestag-votes-no-confidence-in-scholz-government-elections-set-for-february/	2024-12-16T09:28:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2183251616-1.jpg
Ukraine possesses laser weapons, advanced drone technologies, commander says	Ukraine is now among the nations with laser weapon capabilities, Colonel Vadym Sukharevskyi, commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces, announced on Dec. 16, as reported by Interfax-Ukraine. Speaking at the &#x201C;European Defense Industry: Prospects for Cooperation with the Ukrainian Defense Industry&#x201D; conference, Sukharevskyi said Ukraine&#x2019;s laser system, called Tryzub, can down aircraft at altitudes exceeding 2 kilometers. &#x201C;This laser is real and operational,&#x201D; he emphasized, adding that efforts are underway to scale up its capabilities. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t immediately verify Sukharevskyi&apos;s claim. Sukharevskyi also discussed the development of &quot;mother drones,&quot; or &#x201C;queen drones,&#x201D; which carry two FPV (first-person view) light attack drones. These drones, capable of flying over 70 kilometers into enemy territory, serve as repeaters and hit deep targets. He described this innovation as a &#x201C;breakthrough&#x201D; in Ukraine&#x2019;s drone technology. The Unmanned Systems Forces established less than six months ago, already include combat and research units operating across air, land, and sea. Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industry has gained momentum since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov recently announced the serial production of Palianytsia, a lightweight missile-drone hybrid, further advancing Ukraine&#x2019;s military capabilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-unveils-laser-weapon-and-advanced-drone-technologies-commander-says/	2024-12-16T08:34:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156537456.jpg
EU imposes new sanctions on Belarusian officials and companies supporting Lukashenko regime	On Dec. 16, the Council of the EU adopted restrictive measures against 26 individuals and two companies linked to the regime of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko. The sanctions target judges who sentenced opposition figures, law enforcement officials involved in persecuting dissidents, and heads of penitentiaries where political prisoners are held. Additionally, the measures apply to individuals and companies benefiting from privileges under Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime and involved in circumventing existing European sanctions. Among the sanctioned entities are Belarusian companies Vlate Logistik and Ruzekspeditsiya, along with their owners and co-owners. Lukashenko, in power since 1994, is widely regarded as a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. His leadership has been surrounded by accusations of rigged elections, including the 2020 presidential election, during which opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya gained widespread public support. Despite claims that Tsikhanouskaya won the election, Lukashenko declared victory, sparking mass protests. The demonstrations in Minsk and across Belarus were violently suppressed with Russia&#x2019;s backing. According to the Belarusian human rights group Viasna, more than 50,000 citizens have been detained for political reasons since 2020. The EU continues to apply pressure on Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime as part of broader measures targeting human rights abuses and support for Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-imposes-new-sanctions-on-belarusian-officials-and-companies-supporting-lukashenko-regime/	2024-12-16T08:01:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2153837875.jpg
As US pushes Kyiv to lower draft age, why won’t Ukraine conscript younger men?	One thing stands out when looking at Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces &#x2014; it is made up predominantly of older men. Ukraine has never publicly released information about the age of its troops, but the average age is reportedly around 43 years old. Exact figures on the size of Ukraine&#x2019;s armed forces are also not publicly known, with estimates ranging from the hundreds of thousands to around 1 million. Time journalist Simon Shuster, who published a book profiling President Volodymyr Zelensky in January 2024, quoted one of Zelensky&#x2019;s aides who was concerned about the age of Ukrainian troops. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re grown men now, and they aren&#x2019;t that healthy to begin with,&#x201D; the unnamed aide told Shuster. &#x201C;This is Ukraine. Not Scandinavia.&#x201D; With some exceptions, Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 are not allowed to leave the country during martial law, but only men over 25 are eligible for the draft. Until earlier this year, the minimum draft age was 27. Despite lowering the draft age to 25, news emerged in mid-October that U.S. lawmakers were pressuring Kyiv to further lower the draft age. Presidential Office advisor Serhii Leshchenko wrote on X that &#x201C;politicians from both parties&#x201D; were pushing Ukraine to start mobilizing its 18-25-year-olds. The unnamed U.S. lawmakers reportedly cited the fact that America drafted men aged 18-26 during the Vietnam War when some 2.2 million U.S. soldiers were conscripted to fight through the selective service process. The average age of an American soldier in Vietnam was around 22 years old. The conscription of young men to fight in Vietnam was a major catalyst of the anti-war movement, drawing hundreds of thousands to protest and an estimated 30,000 men to emigrate to avoid the draft. Active conscription ended in the U.S. in 1973. In more recent wars, American soldiers were statistically older, with the average age of an American soldier in the Gulf War around 27 years old. Data from 2010 shows the average age of an American soldier deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan was 33.4 years old. Zelensky has refused to budge on changing the conscription age and has instead continued to press for the delivery of more U.S. military aid. Western allies provided enough aid to fully equip only 2.5 out of the 10 Ukrainian brigades that Ukraine had requested support for, Zelensky said in an interview with Sky News published on Nov. 29. The Associated Press reported at the end of November that the Biden administration is still pushing for Ukraine&#x2019;s draft age to be lowered. &#x201C;The pure math of Ukraine&#x2019;s situation now is that it needs more troops in the fight,&#x201D; AP quoted an unnamed senior Biden administration official. In addition to men, women aged 18 to 60 with a medical or pharmaceutical education have been required to be on the military register since 1992 but are still allowed to leave the country. Until April 2024, Ukrainian men only became eligible for conscription at 27. Ukraine&#x2019;s draft age was lowered to 25 in April when Ukraine updated several laws on mobilization to ramp up the number of available troops amid Russia&apos;s ongoing war. The laws simplified the process for identifying eligible conscripts, introduced additional penalties for those dodging the draft, and lowered the minimum age of compulsory military service from 27 to 25. There are no official figures for the number of men who have escaped mobilization abroad, but over 20,000 have reportedly illegally left Ukraine. Law enforcement agencies have uncovered around 600 criminal networks that help evade military service by aiding them in fleeing abroad. Despite reports, Kyiv has said it does not have concrete plans to bring back military-aged men who are in the EU forcibly.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Other men are dodging the draft in Ukraine by staying away from official employment and keeping a low profile to avoid being noticed by draft officers. Exact estimates of how many men are avoiding the draft internally are impossible to know. After signing the law lowering the age of military service, President Zelensky said that Ukraine&#x2019;s military needs younger men because they are physically fitter than older men and can master technology used on the battlefield faster. &quot;This is a request from the military command in response to the specific needs of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,&quot; Zelensky said in an interview with French YouTuber Hugo Travers. &quot;With all due respect to our fighters, there&apos;s a difference between a 25-year-old combatant and a 50-year-old one.&quot; Younger fighters can also master the different technologies used on the battlefield, Zelensky said. &quot;This is a modern type of war,&quot; especially in terms of technologies such as aerial and maritime drones and cybersecurity. &quot;The new generation masters new technologies much more rapidly,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine is unlikely to lower the age further. One argument Kyiv has cited is that its armed forces already suffer from a lack of equipment, a situation made worse by delays in military aid from partners like the U.S. &#x201C;It doesn&apos;t make sense to see calls for Ukraine to lower the mobilization age, presumably in order to draft more people, when we can see that previously announced equipment is not arriving on time,&#x201D; Dmytro Lytvyn, Zelensky&apos;s communications adviser, wrote on X on Nov. 27. &#x201C;Because of these delays, Ukraine lacks weapons to equip already mobilized soldiers.&#x201D; Zelensky repeated this argument in an interview with Sky News on Nov. 29, when he said that Ukraine will &quot;never have enough resources&#x201D; if the West doesn&apos;t provide enough aid. &quot;They speak about mobilization, but the real problem (is) with 10 brigades which our partners didn&apos;t equip.&quot; U.S. State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said during a meeting with journalists on Dec. 9 that the U.S. was ready to take over the training of new Ukrainian soldiers and provide them with the necessary weapons if Ukraine changes its mobilization policy.

(Jose Colon/Anadolu via Getty Images)&#x201C;Ultimately, the decisions about the composition of its military force are those are decisions that the Ukrainians have to make for themselves,&#x201D; Miller said. Later on Dec. 9, Zelensky wrote on social media that Ukraine will not use &quot;the youth of soldiers&quot; to make up for its gaps in military equipment and training. &#x201C;The priority should be providing missiles and lowering Russia&apos;s military potential, not Ukraine&apos;s draft age. The goal should be to preserve as many lives as possible, not to preserve weapons in storage.&quot; Regardless of training or equipment, one reason why Ukraine&#x2019;s draft age is not 18 likely relates to concerns about the country&#x2019;s demography. &#x201C;If you have a look at Ukraine&apos;s demographic tree, it makes perfect sense,&#x201D; retired Australian Major General Mick Ryan told the Kyiv Independent. Like other countries that gained independence after the fall of the Soviet Union, Ukraine &#x201C;saw a fairly significant drop-off in birth rates, and that&apos;s now manifesting as a smaller population of people under 30 than a lot of other countries, say, in Europe or the U.S. or Australia.&#x201D; Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated Ukraine&#x2019;s serious demographic crisis. Ukraine&apos;s population has declined by over 10 million since Russia first invaded in 2014 and fell to an estimated 37 million by January 2024.

(Roman Pilipey / AFP via Getty Images)Ukraine has the lowest birthrate in Europe and an increasingly aged population, with 30% of the population of retirement age. &#xA0; From Ukraine&#x2019;s perspective, &#x201C;we understand we need young men to fight, but we also need young men to have kids,&#x201D; Ryan said. &#x201C;This is kind of a pragmatic balance that the Ukrainians are trying to achieve, and it&apos;s the kind of dilemma that no country would really want to have to resolve because there&apos;s probably no resolving it.&#x201D; However, the U.S. is &#x201C;probably using a harsher calculus,&#x201D; Ryan said. &#x201C;They&apos;re probably coming from the perspective of &#x2018;if you don&apos;t win the war, your demography won&apos;t matter.&#x2019;&#x201D; &#x201C;There just is no single or simple solution to this. Every potential solution involves trade-offs and every potential solution will have political, human, and societal impacts.&#x201D; The lowering of the draft age appears to be an unpopular sentiment in Ukraine, even among those already serving in the military. Maria Berlinska, a Ukrainian activist and veteran, spoke out against the pressure from Ukraine&#x2019;s partners to lower the draft age, writing on Facebook that she was &#x201C;categorically against it.&#x201D; &#x201C;Sending yesterday&apos;s schoolchildren to the front who have not yet seen life is unreasonable and dishonest,&#x201D; Berlinska argued. Her thoughts were echoed by 43-year-old Ukrainian soldier and writer Artem Chekh, who wrote on Facebook on Dec. 10 that men under 25 &#x201C;have not yet lived.&#x201D; &#x201C;The most absurdity is noticeable in the U.S., where you can&apos;t legally drink until 21, but you could be taken to war,&#x201D; Chekh said. In her post, Berlinska argued that Ukraine should receive manpower from abroad, rather than asking more Ukrainian youths to fight. &#x201C;We are now holding back the invasion of the Axis of Evil countries, we are keeping security for all of Europe, for many NATO countries, with a shield. Therefore, it is time for their armies to get involved, it is time to send their people here.&#x201D; &#x201C;Do you want our children to fight? Ok, no problem, just together with your children.&#x201D; Katya Denisova and Chris York contributed to this report.	https://kyivindependent.com/as-us-pushes-for-ukraine-to-lower-draft-age-why-wont-ukraine-conscript-younger-men/	2024-12-16T07:18:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2162045293.jpg
Russia sets 2025 goal to fully occupy 4 Ukrainian regions, Defense Minister says	Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said during a Defense Ministry meeting on Dec. 16 that Moscow aims to seize the entirety of Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts in 2025. Speaking at a Defense Ministry meeting, Belousov reiterated Russia&#x2019;s commitment to achieving what he described as the &quot;goals announced by President Vladimir Putin in June.&quot; &quot;In 2025, Moscow plans to achieve victory in the war,&quot; he added. On June 14, Putin stated that Russia would agree to a ceasefire and peace talks only if Ukraine withdraws from the four Ukrainian oblasts and formally abandons its aspirations to join NATO. Putin&#x2019;s additional demands include recognizing Crimea and Sevastopol as part of Russia. &quot;As soon as Kyiv declares readiness for such a decision and begins a real withdrawal of troops, as well as officially abandons its NATO ambitions, we will immediately cease fire and begin negotiations,&quot; Putin said at the time. Despite Russia&#x2019;s claims, large portions of these regions remain under Ukrainian control. Regional capitals Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are firmly held by Ukraine, while Moscow occupies parts of Donetsk and Luhansk, territories it initially invaded in 2014. During the Dec. 16 meeting, Belousov also emphasized the need for Russia to prepare for potential conflicts with NATO within the next decade. Putin&apos;s declaration of the illegal annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts in September 2022 was widely condemned internationally. The Kremlin continues to struggle in its attempts to secure full control over these regions amidst fierce Ukrainian resistance.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-sets-2025-goal-to-fully-occupy-four-ukrainian-regions-defense-minister-says/	2024-12-16T07:05:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2152227305.jpg
Ukraine charges Russian general over use of banned chemical weapons	Ukrainian prosecutors charged Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops, in absentia with the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on Dec. 16. According to the SBU&apos;s investigation, chemical weapons have been used in more than 4,800 cases since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Since 2022, over 2,000 Ukrainian service members have been hospitalized with chemical poisoning, and three have died, Ukrainian Colonel Artem Vlasiuk said earlier this week. &quot;Russian forces mostly use ammunition with toxic substances by dropping them from FPV (first-person-view) drones on Ukrainian positions. When chemical grenades are detonated, their poisonous compounds affect human mucous membranes, especially the eyes and respiratory tract,&quot; the SBU&#x2019;s statement said. When detonated, the irritating gases force Ukrainian soldiers finding cover in the trenches to leave and expose themselves to Russian gunfire, the statement noted. Ukraine handed over soil samples that prove the use of banned materials to independent laboratories of the International Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for examination and were confirmed to breach international humanitarian law. Russia&apos;s use of gas attacks is rising, a Kyiv Independent investigation from August showed. Ukrainian soldiers and officers interviewed by the Kyiv Independent acknowledged that the tactic is effective, allowing Moscow to capture positions occasionally without destroying them. The U.K. issued sanctions against Kirillov and his unit over the use of chemical weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine on Oct. 8. Earlier this year, the U.S. State Department confirmed that Russian forces had used the chemical agent chloropicrin in Ukraine. &#xA0;The announcement was part of a larger statement about introducing new U.S. sanctions against more than 280 individuals and entities.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-charges-russian-general-over-use-of-banned-chemical-munitions/	2024-12-16T06:14:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1239649816.jpg
Assad releases first statement since fleeing to Russia, claims he never considered 'seeking refuge'	Toppled Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has released his first public statement since fleeing Syria, claiming he never considered &quot;stepping down or seeking refuge&quot; despite leaving the country for Russia. In a post on the official Facebook page of the Syrian presidency, Assad said he was releasing the statement to address &quot;misinformation and narratives far removed from the truth&quot; in the wake of his overthrow. Syrian rebels announced on Dec. 8 that they successfully ousted Assad from power following a lightning offensive across the country, which culminated with the capture of the capital city of Damascus. Moscow persuaded Assad to flee to Russia with his family after realizing his regime was bound to lose to the opposition&apos;s rapid advance, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 11, citing its sources. In the statement, Assad attempts to dispute this version of events. &quot;First, my departure from Syria was neither planned nor did it occur during the final hours of the battles, as some have claimed,&quot; he said. &quot;On the contrary, I remained in Damascus, carrying out my duties until the early hours of Sunday 8th December 2024.&quot; Assad claims that after rebel forces closed in on Damascus, he moved to Latakia &quot;in coordination with our Russian allies to oversee combat operations&quot; at a military base. When the base itself came under drone attack, Assad claims Moscow requested &quot;an immediate evacuation to Russia on the evening of Sunday 8th December.&quot; &quot;This took place a day after the fall of Damascus, following the collapse of the final military positions and the resulting paralysis of all remaining state institutions,&quot; he added. Despite detailing Moscow&apos;s request to evacuate him, Assad then goes on to claim that at &quot;no point during these events did I consider stepping down or seeking refuge, nor was such a proposal made by any individual or party.&quot; &quot;The only course of action was to continue fighting against the terrorist onslaught.&quot; Assad does not explain how he continued &quot;fighting against the terrorist onslaught&quot; once he fled Syria, but goes on to try and paint himself in a positive light as someone who couldn&apos;t &quot;forsake his own people or betray the army and nation to which he belongs.&quot; &quot;I have never sought positions for personal gain but have always considered myself as a custodian of a national project, supported by the faith of the Syrian people, who believed in its vision,&quot; he said. On Dec. 15, the Financial Times (FT) reported that Assad airlifted $250 million in cash to Moscow between 2018-19. Quoting financial records seen by the newspaper, the FT said Syria&apos;s central bank flew nearly two tonnes of $100 bills and 500 euro notes into the country, which were then deposited in sanctioned Russian banks. The outlet said the transfers occurred at a time when Syria was heavily indebted to Russia for its military support, and while Assad&apos;s relatives were buying up assets in Russia including luxury apartments. Assad also claims to have only ever acted as a defender of the Syrian people. &quot;I have carried an unwavering conviction in their will and ability to protect the state, defend its institutions, and uphold their choices to the very last moment,&quot; he said. &quot;When the state falls into the hands of terrorism and the ability to make a meaningful contribution is lost, any position becomes void of purpose, rendering its occupation meaningless. This does not, in any way, diminish my profound sense of belonging to Syria and her people &#x2014; a bond that remains unshaken by any position or circumstance.&quot; After a popular uprising in 2011, Assad imprisoned, tortured, and disappeared tens of thousands of Syrians. His armed forces indiscriminately destroyed entire cities, and repeatedly used chemical weapons against Syrian civilians.	https://kyivindependent.com/assad-releases-first-statement-since-fleeing-to-russia-claims-he-never-considered-seeking-refuge/	2024-12-16T06:01:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187892433.jpg
Russia must be ready for potential conflict with NATO 'within 10 years,' defense minister says	Russia should prepare for multiple scenarios, including a war with NATO, in the next 10 years, Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said during a Defense Ministry meeting on Dec. 16, the Interfax news agency reported. Speaking about a possible confrontation with the alliance, Belousov pointed to unspecified changes in NATO countries&apos; doctrines and conclusions reached during the Washington summit in July. &#x201C;(Preparing for war) is indicated by the decisions that were made at the North Atlantic Alliance summit held in July of this year. This is also reflected in the doctrinal documents of the United States and other NATO countries,&quot; Belousov said. During NATO&#x2019;s 75th-anniversary celebration and summit in July, Ukraine received more air defense systems, $43 billion in funding, a NATO representative in Kyiv, and new bilateral security agreements, as well as the pledge that its path toward membership is &quot;irreversible.&quot; Tensions between NATO and Russia have been mounting since the allied countries began providing arms and other support to Ukraine after the outbreak of the full-scale invasion. Moscow has issued a number of veiled and overt threats to the West over its support for Kyiv, including warnings of a possible nuclear response. Multiple Western officials have raised warnings about a possible open clash with Russia in the coming years, with NATO leaders calling for increasing the defense spending benchmark from 2% to 3% of gross domestic product.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-preparing-for-possible-conflict-with-nato/	2024-12-16T05:00:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2152474190.jpg
Assad airlifted $250m in cash from Syria to Russia over two years, FT reports	Toppled Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad airlifted $250m in cash to Moscow between 2018-19, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Dec. 15. Quoting financial records seen by the newspaper, the FT said Syria&apos;s central bank flew nearly two tonnes of $100 bills and &#x20AC;500 notes into the country, which were then deposited in sanctioned Russian banks. The outlet said the transfers occurred at at time when Syria was heavily indebted to Russia for its military support, and while Assad&apos;s relatives were buying up assets in Russia including luxury apartments. Moscow deployed its troops to Syria in 2015, providing support to the Assad regime against multiple anti-government forces. Syrian rebels announced on Dec. 8 that they successfully ousted Assad from power following a lightning offensive across the country, which culminated with the capture of the capital city of Damascus. Moscow persuaded Assad to flee to Russia with his family after realizing his regime was bound to lose to the opposition&apos;s rapid advance, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 11, citing its sources. One expert told the FT the transfers of cash from Domascus to Moscow were were evidence of &quot;a combination of securing their ill-gotten gains and Syria&#x2019;s patrimony abroad.&quot; &quot;The regime would have to bring their money abroad to a safe haven to be able to use it to procure the fine life&#x2026; for the regime and its inner circle,&quot; David Schenker, US Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs from 2019 to 2021, said. With Assad now ousted, the future of Russia&apos;s military presence in Syria has been thrown into question. Satellite imagery collected by Maxar on Dec. 13 suggested Russia is preparing to scale back its military operations. Two AN-124 heavy military transport planes were spotted at Khmeimim air base, located in Latakia on Syria&#x2019;s Mediterranean coast, with their nose cones lifted, signaling readiness to load cargo. A Ka-52 attack helicopter was also being dismantled, likely in preparation for transport, while components of an S-400 air defense system were being packed up. Imagery from the Tartus naval base, also on the Mediterranean coast, showed minimal changes. Photos taken earlier in the week revealed two Russian frigates stationed off the coast, with no major activity suggesting an immediate departure, according to CNN. Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, described the activity as part of a larger consolidation effort at Khmeimim and the nearby Tartus naval base. &quot;In short, a withdrawal is underway,&quot; Kofman wrote on X. Russia was reportedly evacuating its forces from Syria as one of its military bases faced siege, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Intelligence (HUR) reported on Dec. 10. HUR claimed that Russian troops in Syria are voicing frustration with their commanders over what they described as a chaotic withdrawal process. The Kremlin emphasized the importance of securing its military bases and diplomatic missions in Syria, with spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying on Dec. 11 that Moscow has maintained contact with Syria&#x2019;s new leadership. He declined to disclose the number of Russian troops in the country or comment on potential evacuations.	https://kyivindependent.com/assad-airlifted-250m-in-cash-to-moscow-over-two-years-ft-reports/	2024-12-16T04:20:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2162733024.jpg
Norway to provide $242 million for Ukrainian naval defense against Russian Black Sea threats	Norway will allocate 2.7 billion Norwegian kroner ($242 million) to bolster Ukraine&#x2019;s navy and help it deter Russian threats in the Black Sea, the country&#x2019;s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere announced on Dec. 16. &quot;It is essential to protect the Ukrainian population and Ukrainian infrastructure from attacks by Russia&#x2019;s Black Sea Fleet&#x2026; (and to) protect exports by sea of grain and other products,&quot; Stoere said in a statement. The money will be channeled through the Nansen Support Program, Norway&apos;s civil and military support program for Ukraine. The Black Sea remains heavily mined due to Russia&apos;s full-scale war, seriously threatening civilian vessels. Minesweeping capabilities would help Ukraine strengthen security in the Black Sea, and enable continued shipping. &quot;Mines pose a significant threat to maritime security and safe passage in the Black Sea, and mine clearance operations are very difficult,&quot; Norway&#x2019;s Defense Minister Bjorn Arild Gram said. &quot;The systems we are providing will enhance the ability of Ukrainian forces to detect and defuse mines along their coastline,&quot; he added. Following the announcement, the Nansen program&#x2019;s total value grew to 137.7 billion kroner ($13.2 billion). The program initially was set to spend 75 billion kroner ($7 billion) from 2023 to 2028. Norway is ranked 12th in the world in terms of the amount of aid provided to Ukraine, having so far provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian, financial, and military support, according to the Kiel Institute&apos;s Ukraine Support Tracker.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway-to-provide-242-million-for-ukrainian-naval-defense-against-russian-black-sea-threats/	2024-12-16T03:41:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1877343521.jpg
Ukraine produces almost 100 new Peklo missile-drones, media reports	Almost 100 of Ukraine&apos;s new Peklo missile-drone hybrids have been produced as the weapon entered serial production, Ukrainska Pravda reported on Dec. 16. The news comes amid Ukraine&apos;s efforts to ramp up production of long-range drones and missiles as part of the country&apos;s resilience plan. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine aims to produce at least 30,000 long-range drones next year. While some details of Peklo&apos;s capabilities remain undisclosed for security reasons, Zelensky highlighted the weapon as a &quot;fundamentally new type.&quot; The Peklo has a range of 700 kilometers (430 miles) and a speed of 700 km/h (430 mph). Officials reportedly said that the system has already been successfully deployed. The weapon represents a mix of drone and missile capabilities, functioning as a long-range drone equipped with a jet engine and more advanced guidance system, Ukrainska Pravda wrote. According to the outlet, 70% of Peklo&apos;s components are produced in Ukraine, but importing the rest into the country represents a serious bottleneck. The interchangeability of elements bridges estimated gaps in supply; for example, Peklo can reportedly run on different engines, depending on their availability on the market. Long-range domestic weapons are critical to Ukraine&#x2019;s defense strategy. They provide the country&apos;s military with an alternative to Western arms, whose use is often restricted. They also compensate for the lack of artillery ammunition on the battlefield. Achieving the target number of missile production next year also means that Ukrainian rockets will be smaller than usual, contradicting Russia&#x2019;s bet on bigger missiles such as the recently developed Oreshnik.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-produces-almost-100-peklo-missiles/	2024-12-16T02:55:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-06-at-1_51_00-PM.jpeg
30 North Korean soldiers killed, injured in Kursk Oblast assaults, Ukraine's intelligence claims	At least thirty North Korean soldiers were killed or wounded during assault operations in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) claimed on Dec. 16. Following the attacks that took place on Dec. 14-15 near the villages of Pliekhovo, Vorozhba, and Martynovka, North Korean losses have to be replenished by fresh soldiers from North Korea&apos;s 94th Separate Brigade, HUR claimed. Three soldiers also reportedly went missing. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify HUR&#x2019;s claims. Ukrainian and Western officials warned in the fall that over 10,000 North Korean troops had amassed in Kursk Oblast, ready to aid Russia&apos;s attempt to oust Ukrainian forces in the region. The move represents an unprecedented escalation in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. The first limited clashes between North Korean and Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast were reported in early November, with North Korean soldiers recently joining ground assault operations. North Korean troops also allegedly opened fire and killed eight Russian soldiers on Dec. 14 in a &quot;friendly-fire&quot; incident.	https://kyivindependent.com/30-north-korean-troops-killed-wounded-hur-says/	2024-12-16T02:19:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-492165484.jpg
EU adopts 15th package of sanctions against Russia	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. The Council of the EU adopted on Dec. 16 its 15th package of sanctions against Russia, targeting the Russian shadow fleet of tankers and the military-industrial complex. The new listings include 54 persons and 30 entities &quot;responsible for actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine,&quot; the statement read. &quot;This package of sanctions is part of our response to weaken Russia&#x2019;s war machine and those who are enabling this war, also including Chinese companies,&quot; said Kaja Kallas, the EU&apos;s chief diplomat. &quot;It shows the unity of EU member states in our continued support to Ukraine. Our immediate priority is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position.&quot; The new package of sanctions targets shipping companies helping Russia to sell its crude oil, filling Moscow&apos;s coffers amid the full-scale war. &#xA0;The EU also banned 52 vessels transporting Russian oil above the $60-per-barrel price cap from accessing EU ports and services. Russia has largely avoided the price cap by using a fleet of older, uninsured tankers, forcing the Western countries to tighten and refine the existing sanctions. The latest package further targets a chemical plant, a Russian airline company providing support to the military, and defense companies. For the first time, the EU imposed full-blown sanctions &#x2013; including a travel ban and asset freeze &#x2013; &quot;on various Chinese actors supplying drone components and microelectronic components&quot; to Russia. Individual listings include the Russian military unit responsible for a deadly strike against the Ohkmatdyt children&apos;s hospital in Kyiv in July, top managers of energy companies, individuals involved in the deportation of Ukrainian children, dissemination of propaganda, and sanctions circumvention, and two senior North Korean officials. The EU sanctioned North Korean officials after Pyongyang dispatched over 10,000 troops to aid Russia&apos;s war. North Korean soldiers recently saw combat with Ukraine during ground assaults in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. The bloc further added 32 entities to the list of those directly supporting Russia&apos;s military-industrial complex, including companies based in China, India, Iran, Serbia, and the United Arab Emirates.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-adopts-15th-package-of-sanctions/	2024-12-16T02:07:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1882258789.jpeg
Russian attacks against Ukraine injure 6 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine injured at least six civilians over the past day, regional authorities reported on Dec. 16. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 27 of the 49 drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force said. Nineteen drones were reportedly lost across the country thanks to electronic warfare countermeasures. Russian attacks against Kharkiv Oblast injured two people &#x2013; a 48-year-old woman in Kharkiv and a 54-year-old woman in the village of Kutkivka, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Two other people were injured during strikes against Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. In Mykolaiv Oblast, two men aged 50 and 53 were hospitalized following a drone attack against the city of Mykolaiv, according to Vitalii Kim, the regional governor. Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Khmelnytskyi, Luhansk, Sumy, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts were also attacked, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-113/	2024-12-16T01:59:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Donetsk-Oblast-Dec-16.jpg
Russian ex-Defense Ministry official suspected of embezzling $5.8 million	Vladimir Shishov, the former deputy head of the Russian Defense Ministry&apos;s military property department, is suspected of involvement in the embezzlement of 600 million rubles ($5.8 million), Russian Interior Ministry official Andrey Kurnosenko told the state-owned TASS news agency in an interview published on Dec. 16. According to the charges, Shishov embezzled 600 million rubles with the help of businessman Dmitry Levchenko, the manager of the RNGS Capital company. The ex-Defense Ministry official served in one of the highest echelons of state service. Shishov was arrested on suspicion of fraud in October 2023 in a case that the Russian media linked to fraud regarding the supply of timber for Russian troops in the occupied parts of eastern Ukraine. The embezzled money was allocated for a &quot;special infrastructure project,&quot; Kurnosenko said. Since April, several Russian high-ranking military officials have been arrested on charges ranging from bribery to abuse of power after the dismissal of Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov. In mid-May, Russian President Vladimir Putin also dismissed his longtime ally Sergei Shoigu from the post of defense minister. Shoigu was replaced by former First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov. Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) recently reported a sharp increase in registered criminal proceedings for bribery in the Russian military. Transparency International&apos;s 2023 corruption perception index saw Russia drop to its worst score in years, while Ukraine&apos;s score has improved, continuing the decade-old trend.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-charges-ex-defense-ministry-official-with-embezzlement/	2024-12-16T00:50:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Moscow_Frunzenskaya_Embankment_at_Pushkinsky_Bridge_08-2016.jpg
Ukrainian drones destroy Russian ammunition depot in Donetsk Oblast, SBU source claims	The Security Service of Ukraine&apos;s (SBU) drones successfully attacked &#x430; Russian ammunition depot near the occupied village of Markine in Donetsk oblast a &quot;few days ago,&quot; an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 16. &quot;There were thousands of ammunition rounds for armored personnel carriers, tanks, anti-tank guided missiles, mines, grenades, and millions of rounds of ammunition of various calibers,&quot; the source said. A nearby fuel and lubricants depot was also destroyed as explosions could be heard in the area throughout the night, the source added. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Ukraine has been increasingly capable of striking ammunition and weapon depots in the rear to stall the Kremlin&apos;s logistics, hindering Russia&apos;s operations on the front line. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video that purports to show an explosion at a Russian ammunition depot near occupied Markine, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, overnight on Dec. 16, 2024. (SBU source)Some of Ukraine&apos;s domestically produced drones have become capable of traveling 1,500 kilometers (over 900 miles), reaching depots in the rear that were thought to be at a safe distance from the front line. Some of the examples this year include the strikes against the Russian towns of Tikhoretsk and Toropets with drones, setting ablaze over 30,000 tons of ammunition, allegedly including ballistic missiles. Ukraine has also been targeting oil refineries to prevent Moscow from adequately rotating its troops, resupply, and fortify its positions.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-hit-russian-ammunition-depot-in-donetsk-oblast-sbu-source-claims/	2024-12-16T00:23:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/SBU-Dec-16.png
South Africa will not invite Putin to next G20 summit over ICC arrest warrant	Russian President Vladimir Putin will not be invited to the next G20 summit due to a pending arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC), a spokesperson of the South African president told Russia&#x2019;s state-owned TASS news agency on Dec. 15. South Africa, which has chaired the organization since Dec. 1, was also unable to host the Russian leader in August during their BRICS meeting in Johannesburg. &quot;The legal situation has not changed since the BRICS summit in Johannesburg. We cannot influence the ICC&apos;s decisions in any way,&quot; spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said, according to TASS. The next G20 summit is scheduled for Nov. 21-22, 2025. South Africa, the largest economy on the continent, has claimed neutrality in the Russia-Ukraine war but continued to strengthen its economic and political ties with Moscow. The country is a member of the BRICS group alongside Russia, China, and others, and it even carried out joint naval drills with the two countries last year. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Putin over allegations of war crimes, specifically the forced deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia following Moscow&apos;s invasion in early 2022. This forces the Russian leader to carefully select his travel destinations, as any country in the ICC must arrest him under the warrant. South Africa is a signatory of the ICC&apos;s Rome Statute. In November, Putin also chose not to travel to Brazil for the last G20 summit but sent his Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in his place. The G20 group includes several countries that have fostered closer economic cooperation with Russia throughout its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including China and India. Putin visited Mongolia, a member of the ICC, in September of this year, where the Russian president received a warm welcome in Ulaanbaatar.	https://kyivindependent.com/south-africa-will-not-invite-putin-to-next-g20-summit/	2024-12-15T23:58:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1257512425.jpg
Trump's team seeks 'permanent end' to Russia-Ukraine war, national security advisor nominee says	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s team is discussing how to end the Russia-Ukraine war permanently rather than merely &quot;pausing&quot; it, Trump&apos;s pick for national security advisor, Mike Waltz, told CBS News on Dec. 15. Trump, taking on Jan. 20, 2025, said he aims to bring a swift end to the war without revealing specifics on how to achieve the goal. Some ideas floated with the president-elect&apos;s team reportedly include delaying Ukraine&apos;s entry into NATO in exchange for arms while freezing the war along the current front lines. &#xA0; When asked whether the upcoming Trump administration plans to restrict how Ukraine can use U.S. arms, Waltz said that a &quot;blank check... just isn&apos;t a strategy... This just, kind of, forever war that we seem to be backing into.&quot; Trump recently criticized the outgoing Biden administration&apos;s decision to permit Ukraine to strike targets within Russian territory with ATACMS missiles. At the same time, the president-elect indicated he does not plan to &quot;abandon&quot; Ukraine and instead leverage the U.S. assistance for Kyiv to push Russia to the negotiating table. &quot;What does success look like in line with our interests? How do we end the war? Who&apos;s at the table? How do we drive, you know, all sides to the table, and what&apos;s the framework for an agreement? Those are things that we&apos;re thinking through with his fantastic team that he&apos;s assembling,&quot; Waltz said. Waltz added that since Trump&apos;s reelection, his team has been in contact with European partners and Ukraine on how to end this war &quot;in a way that restores stability, stops the carnage, and hopefully makes this a permanent end, not just a pause.&quot; Trump met with President Volodymyr Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Dec. 7 to discuss the ongoing war. Reuters reported that while the three did not discuss specifics of any concrete peace plan, Trump called for an immediate ceasefire, while Zelensky stressed the necessity of security guarantees. Trump also reportedly called for Europe to take greater responsibility in ensuring security once a ceasefire is reached. When asked about Trump&apos;s meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Mar-a-Lago on Dec. 9, Waltz noted that Hungary&apos;s leader &quot;has regular engagement with the Russians&quot; and &quot;a good relationship with President Trump.&quot; Trump&apos;s team will take a &quot;hard look&quot; at Orban&apos;s proposal for a Christmas truce as a &quot;first step&quot; to &quot;stop the fighting,&quot; Waltz added. Budapest claimed that Kyiv rejected a proposal for a Christmas truce and a prisoner exchange with Russia, while a Ukrainian official said that Hungary never discussed the idea with Ukraine. Orban has maintained warm ties with Russia throughout the full-scale war and criticized military support for Ukraine while also lauding Trump&apos;s reelection.	https://kyivindependent.com/waltz-on-ending-war-in-ukraine/	2024-12-15T23:21:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2162467139.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 763,510 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 763,510 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 16. This number includes 1,070 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,563 tanks, 19,736 armored fighting vehicles, 31,480 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,151 artillery systems, 1,256 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,025 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 20,372 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-763-510-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-12-15T22:12:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2003914665.jpg
Sinking of two Russian oil tankers may cause 'significant environmental impacts,' Greenpeace warns	The sinking of two Russian tankers in the Kerch Strait on Dec. 15 may cause &quot;significant&quot; environmental damage, Greenpeace Ukraine warned. The two tankers, which reportedly sank due to severe weather conditions, were carrying approximately 4,000 tons of fuel oil on board each. &quot;Any oil or petrochemical spill in these waters has the potential to be serious,&quot; the head of Greenpeace Research Laboratories, Dr. Paul Johnston said in a statement issued by Greenpeace Ukraine. &quot;If the ships sink, then there is the potential for releases of oil and petrochemicals over a longer time span.&quot; Johnston added that the type of oil spilled will make a difference to the environmental impact, with heavy residual fuel oils causing more visible damage than marine gas oils which tend to break up easier. It was not immediately clear as to what type of oil was spilled in the sinking of the tankers, which were originally built around 50 years ago and were hastily converted in the 1990s from full-fledged tankers to &quot;river-sea&quot; class vessels. &quot;If (the oil) is driven ashore, then it will cause fouling of the shoreline which will be extremely difficult to clean up,&quot; Johnson added. Greenpeace noted that a 2007 Russian oil tanker spill in the Black Sea, which release 1,200 tons of oil, resulted in &quot;severe&quot; environmental damage which was observed upwards of one year after the incident. Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine has caused massive environmental damage, including the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka Dam and subsequent flooding, widespread forest fires, and the devastation of wide stretches of farm land. According to a joint study conducted by Ukraine&apos;s Environment Ministry and climate NGOs released on June 13, the total damage associated with greenhouse gas emissions from the first two years of the full-scale invasion has exceeded $32 billion. That number does not include other types of environmental damage caused throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion which likely amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars. In October, the Kyiv School of Economics Institute warned that Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of old and poorly insured tankers pose significant environmental risks, as these often uninsured and aging vessels increase the danger of oil spills.	https://kyivindependent.com/sinking-of-two-russian-oil-tankers-may-cause-significant-environmental-impacts-greenpeace-warns/	2024-12-15T20:31:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1822474446.jpg
Peace cannot be achieved without territorial loss for Ukraine, Slovak president says	Slovak President Peter Pellegrini, speaking to Slovakia&apos;s public broadcaster STVR on Dec. 15, argued that achieving peace in Ukraine would likely require accepting partial territorial losses and called for the immediate start of peace negotiations. &quot;When it comes to peace, I believe that realism must be maintained. Today, probably no sensible person in Europe believes that peace can be achieved without some partial territorial losses for Ukraine,&quot; Pellegrini said. Pellegrini&apos;s comments come ahead of the January inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump who has vowed to get Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table for peace talks. Pellegrini has also previously indicated his objection to immediately providing Ukraine with an invite to the NATO military alliance, stating that immediate accession was &quot;not realistic&quot; during wartime. Pellegrini is an ally of Prime Minister Robert Fico, who has been a vocal critic of military aid for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. On Dec. 2, the Russian-friendly, populist prime minister criticized the EU&#x2019;s new leadership over their supporting words for Ukraine, saying that the made by EU chief diplomat Kaja Kallas and new president of the European Council, Antonio Costa, &quot;did not correspond to the conclusions of the European Union.&quot; Fico halted military aid to Ukraine from the Slovak Armed Forces&apos; stocks after taking office in September 2023 in a stark foreign policy reversal. He recently announced he had accepted the Kremlin&apos;s invitation to attend the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow next May.	https://kyivindependent.com/peace-cannot-be-achieved-without-territorial-loss-for-ukraine-slovak-president-says/	2024-12-15T18:14:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1711526769.jpg
Scholz's Social Democratic Party rejects sending Taurus missiles to Ukraine in election program, media reports	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s Social Democratic Party (SPD) reportedly rejected the delivery of Taurus missiles to Ukraine in the party&apos;s program for the upcoming February elections, the Berliner Morgenpost reported on Dec. 15, citing a leaked draft program. Scholz has long been adamant in his refusal to provide the country&#x2019;s Taurus long-range missiles to Ukraine, even as other major backers of Ukraine, including the United States, have delivered long-range weaponry. Fearing it could draw his country into the war, Scholz has repeatedly refused Kyiv&apos;s request for the cruise missiles, with President Volodymyr Zelensky previously suggested that Germany&#x2019;s refusal to provide Ukraine with long-range missiles is linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s nuclear saber-rattling. &quot;We stand by Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s decision not to deliver the Taurus cruise missile from the Bundeswehr&apos;s stocks,&quot; the SPD program reportedly reads, adding that weapons deliveries should come with &quot;prudence and a sense of proportion.&quot; Despite the weapons refusal, the program also indicates that &quot;the SPD is clearly committed to diplomatic, military, financial and humanitarian support for the Ukrainians in their fight against Russian aggression, which is contrary to international law - for as long as necessary.&quot; The SPD&apos;s program comes in direct contrast with that of German Chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz&apos;s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) who previously voiced support for providing Ukraine with the Taurus missiles. Merz, whose conservative CDU/CSU alliance is leading in the polls ahead of the Feb. 23 election, previously visited Kyiv for talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky, promising a more decisive strategy on long-range strikes against Russia. &quot;We want your army to be capable of hitting military bases in Russia. Not the civilian population, not infrastructure, but the military targets from which your country is being attacked,&quot; Merz said. Talking to Bild, Merz nevertheless said that the Swedish-German cruise missiles with a range of 500 kilometers (310 miles) would not be a &quot;miraculous&quot; game-changer in the war. The politician also stressed he agrees with Scholz that Germany must not become a party at war, but he pointed out that neither the U.K. nor the U.S. became belligerents when lifting restrictions on the weapons they provided. In the CDU&apos;s section of the election platform on foreign and security policy, the CDU has reportedly pledged to continue supporting Ukraine &quot;with all necessary diplomatic, financial, humanitarian, and military assistance.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/scholzs-social-democratic-party-election-program-rejects-sending-taurus-missiles-to-ukraine-media-reports/	2024-12-15T16:48:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2183251616-1.jpg
Pope Francis refers to Ukraine, Russia as 'brothers,' calls for peace during Sunday Mass	During Sunday prayer on Dec. 15, Pope Francis referred to Russia and Ukraine as &quot;brothers,&quot; while reiterating calls for peace in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. &quot;They are brothers, cousins. Let them come to an understanding. War is always a defeat. Peace to the whole world,&quot; the pope said during a visit to the French island of Corsica. As a precursor to Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin has repeatedly framed its invasion as an effort to reunite the two nations as &quot;one people,&quot; relying on numerous false historical claims. In the lead-up to the invasion, Russian President Vladimir Putin invoked biblical imagery, describing the two countries as a &quot;brotherhood&quot; and comparing their relationship to that of Cain and Abel. The pope has earned a controversial reputation in Ukraine with his earlier remarks that relativized the responsibility of Russia&#x2019;s war, encouraging Ukrainians to have the &quot;courage&quot; to negotiate for peace. During his Sunday prayer on Dec. 8, Pope Francis called upon politicians and global leaders to bring about a ceasefire across the globe ahead of Christmas. His words came as Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is about to enter its third year, with 2024 marking the 10th anniversary of Russia&#x2019;s illegal occupation of Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, as well as the Crimean Peninsula. In October, Pope Francis met President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Vatican to exchange symbolic gifts. Zelensky received a bronze bas-relief with a flower and an inscription, &quot;Peace is a fragile flower,&quot; while Pope Francis received a painting of the Bucha massacre. Chances that the Russian military would halt for Christmas appear slim as they gather speed in eastern Ukraine, ratcheting up their offensive operations before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/pope-francis-refers-to-ukraine-russia-as-brothers-calls-for-peace-during-sunday-mass/	2024-12-15T15:44:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1580497031.jpeg
Hundreds' of North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia in Kursk Oblast, ambassador says	In an interview with CBS News on Dec. 15, Ukraine&apos;s ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova said that &quot;hundreds&quot; of North Korean troops are fighting alongside Russian troops in Kursk Oblast. &quot;We have seen hundreds of (North Korean soliders) on the battlefield already, and (Ukraine is) successfully fighting them as we are fighting with the Russians,&quot; Markarova told CBS News. &quot;We see them now in Kursk Oblast only, and our brave defenders were not only able to kill a lot of them, but also keep the positions.&quot; Markarova&apos;s statement come immediately after comments made by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Dec. 14 that a &quot;significant number&quot; of North Korean soldiers have begun fighting alongside Russian forces in assault operations in Kursk Oblast. &quot;We already have preliminary data that the Russians have begun to use North Korean soldiers in their assaults &#x2014; a significant number of them,&quot; Zelensky said in a video address. Ukrainian and Western officials in fall 2024 warned that over 10,000 North Korean troops had amassed in Kursk Oblast, ready to aid Russia&apos;s attempt to oust Ukrainian forces in the region. The move represents an unprecedented escalation in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. The first clashes between North Korean and Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast were reported in early November. Zelensky reported on Dec. 1 that North Korean soldiers had already been killed fighting for Russia, but did not specify figures. Ukrainain forces launched a shock offensive into Kursk Oblast in August. Russia began a counterattack in September and has reportedly taken back 40% of the territory initially captured by Ukraine. During her interview with CBS News, Markarova called on more military aid as Pyongyang&apos;s and Moscow&apos;s relationship continues to strengthen. Moscow has continued to train thousands of North Korean soldiers on the battlefield with modern weaponry and equipment, while providing live combat experience. &quot;Ukrainians are still capable of defending our own country. We&apos;re asking for the military support,&quot; Markarova said. &quot;It&apos;s still a question of artillery and weapons and air defense, most importantly, and the more we can have, the more efficiently we can defend.&quot; When asked whether the idea of a Christmas truce on the battlefield was possible, Markarova responded that &quot;if Russia wants to seriously stop (the war), they can stop it anytime.&quot; Moscow&apos;s losses on the battlefield continue to mount, with reported daily losses of well over a thousand troops in recent months.	https://kyivindependent.com/hundreds-of-north-korean-troops-fighting-alongside-russia-in-kursk-oblast-ambassador-says/	2024-12-15T15:29:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/markarova.jpg
Lithuania and Estonia introduce new sanctions against Georgian officials	Lithuania and Estonia have imposed sanctions against Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze and several government officials, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budris announced on X on Dec. 15. Lithuania expanded its sanctions list to include 17 individuals, while Estonia sanctioned 14 officials earlier that day. The Baltic states had previously imposed sanctions on Bidzina Ivanishvili, founder of the ruling Georgian Dream party, and members of the Interior Ministry for human rights violations. Similar actions have already been taken by the U.S., which on Dec. 12 announced visa bans on approximately 20 Georgian individuals accused of &quot;undermining democracy.&quot; &#x201C;Lithuania supports the people of Georgia and their European dream,&#x201D; Budris said. &quot;It is time for joint action at the EU level!&#x201D; Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsakhkna also posted about the sanctions on X. &quot;The violence perpetrated by the Georgian authorities against protesters, journalists &amp; opposition leaders is criminal and against human rights. I call on all EU countries to react &amp; to take actions,&quot; he wrote. The measures follow ongoing protests in Georgia, sparked by Kobakhidze&#x2019;s decision to suspend EU accession negotiations until 2028. Over 220 people have been arrested during the ensuing crackdown, with dozens reported injured as the Georgian police deployed tear gas and water cannons.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-and-estonia-introduce-new-sanctions-against-georgian-officials/	2024-12-15T11:47:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2186867239.jpg
Ukraine war latest: North Korean troops joining Russian assaults in Kursk, Zelensky says	Key developments on Dec. 14-15: A &quot;significant number&quot; of North Korean soldiers have begun fighting alongside Russian forces in assault operations in Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Dec. 14. Ukrainian and Western officials in fall 2024 warned that over 10,000 North Korean troops had amassed in Kursk Oblast, ready to aid Russia&apos;s attempt to oust Ukrainian forces in the region. The move represents an unprecedented escalation in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. &quot;Today, we already have preliminary data that the Russians have begun to use North Korean soldiers in their assaults &#x2014; a significant number of them,&quot; Zelensky said in a video address. &quot;The Russians include them in combined units and use them in operations in Kursk Oblast.&quot; North Korean troops have not yet joined Russian forces in any other areas of the front, but this could change, Zelensky said. Zelensky also reported that North Korean units have sustained &quot;noticeable losses.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin has &quot;dragged another state into this war,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;And if this is not escalation, then what is the escalation that so many have been talking about?&quot; The first clashes between North Korean and Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast were reported in early November. Zelensky reported on Dec. 1 that North Korean soldiers had already been killed fighting for Russia, but did not specify figures. Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened their alliance over the course of the full-scale war. The two nations signed a defense treaty in June, requiring either state to render military aid to the other in the event of an attack. North Korea has reportedly provided Russia with over 100 ballistic missiles and 5 million artillery shells. In exchange, Moscow has allegedly given Pyongyang economic support and assistance with its nuclear weapons program. Ukrainain forces launched a shock offensive into Kursk Oblast in August. Russia began a counterattack in September and has reportedly taken back 40% of the territory initially captured by Ukraine. Ukrainian intelligence agencies destroyed a Russian train carrying 40 fuel tanks in the Russian-occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast on Dec. 14, an intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent. The source said that the aim of the operation was to disrupt a supply line used to transport fuel from Crimea to Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The operation was carried out jointly by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the Ukrainian army&apos;s Tavria Group, the Military Intelligence Agency (HUR), and the Special Operations Forces (SSO). The operation began with the SBU organizing a sabotage mission to destroy railroad tracks near the village of Oleksiivka in the Bilmak district, the source said. As the train carrying 40 fuel tanks was moving along the tracks, an explosion derailed the train, and some of the tanks ignited, according to the source. Using HIMARS rockets, the Ukrainian forces targeted the locomotive and the outermost cars, preventing Russian forces from ripping apart the tanks and saving some of the fuel. The operation resulted in the complete destruction of the locomotive and 40 fuel tanks, effectively crippling a key supply line to Russian forces in the region and rendering the targeted rail line inoperable, the source said. The operation follows another alleged operation by the Atesh partisan group, which said it had sabotaged a key railway in Zaporizhzhia Oblast on Nov. 16, knocking out electrical equipment and disrupting Russia&apos;s military supply chain. Ukraine has been strengthening its defensive positions near the city of Zaporizhzhia in anticipation of a potential Russian offensive in the region. Local authorities, including the citys&apos; mayor, Oleksandr Fedorov, have confirmed the ongoing construction of multi-level fortifications designed to bolster the city&#x2019;s defense. This effort comes amid growing concerns over Russian military movements in the region. On Nov. 25, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine is closely monitoring Russian troop movements in southern Ukraine, noting that the threat of a renewed offensive remains high. The escalation in the south follows a broader trend of intense military activity, with Russia also concentrating its efforts along the eastern front. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian forces have been pushing aggressively toward key towns such as Pokrovsk and Kurakhove, aiming to break through Ukrainian defenses. A total of 292 combat clashes were recorded along the extensive eastern front line on Dec. 14, according to a new operational summary from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Russian forces continue their assaults employing diverse weaponry and tactics to strike Ukrainian positions, with a concentrated focus on Kharkiv, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts. According to the report, Russian forces conducted one missile strike, utilizing two missiles aimed at Ukrainian unit positions and settlements. They also carried out 61 aviation strikes, involving 99 Controlled Aerial Bombs (KABs), over 5,000 artillery shelling incidents, including 158 rocket salvo system attacks, and deployed more than 3,000 kamikaze drones across various regions. In response, the Defense Forces conducted 35 targeted strikes against Russian troop concentrations, armaments, and military equipment. These efforts resulted in the destruction of one unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control point, three artillery systems, and two air defense systems. Ukrainian forces successfully defended their positions and repelled numerous enemy attacks across multiple regions, including Kupiansk, Lyman, and Pokrovsk. In these areas, Ukrainian defenders thwarted 52 attacks. Other key locations, such as Toretsk, Kurakhiv, Kramatorsk, and Siversk, also saw significant resistance. Despite these official updates, Stanislav Buniatov, a platoon commander of the 24th Separate Assault Battalion Aidar, expressed concerns about the situation in Kurakhiv on his Telegram channel, stating, &quot;The advantage in manpower and firepower is multiple; in such conditions, it is very difficult, one might say unrealistic, to hold defense in dense construction.&quot; These concerns were echoed by DeepState, which reported on its Telegram channel that, as of Dec. 15, Russian forces had captured the city council in Kurakhiv and raised their flag over it. In the northern areas of Volynsk and Polisk, the operational situation remains stable, with no signs of offensive group formations by Russian forces. The situation on Dec. 15 showed a slight intensification in combat compared to the previous day, according to data shared by the General Staff. The number of combat clashes increased from 205 to 292, and Russian airstrikes rose from 38 on Dec. 13 to 61 on Dec. 14. These updates follow reports of a dire situation near Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, as Russian forces continue to gain ground, putting additional pressure on Ukrainian defenses. Recent reports indicate that Russian troops have successfully advanced to key locations, and Ukrainian forces are struggling to hold the line against a well-equipped and larger Russian military, despite efforts to recapture lost positions. Two Russian tankers have suffered significant damage in the Kerch Strait due to severe weather conditions and have already sunk, Russian media outlets Mash and Baza reported on Dec. 15. Russia&apos;s Emergency Situations Ministry also reported that the tankers, Volgoneft 212 and Volgoneft 239, had been damaged. Both vessels were carrying approximately 4,000 tons of fuel oil on board each, according to Baza. The Volgoneft 212 has 13 crew members aboard, while the Volgoneft 239 has 14. Both crews have requested assistance. In response, Russia&apos;s Emergency Situations Ministry stated that a Mi-8 helicopter with rescuers was deployed and that 13 sailors were evacuated from the Volgoneft-212, but one of them had died. The ministry has primarily focused on ongoing rescue operations, offering few details on the current condition of the tankers. According to eyewitness accounts reported by Mash, the Volgoneft-212 was cut in half by waves near the coast of Kerch, while the Volgoneft-139 sank within minutes after waves created a hole in the hull, causing a crack that split the ship in two. Mash reported that both tankers were built around 50 years ago and were hastily converted in the 1990s from full-fledged tankers to &quot;river-sea&quot; class vessels. The rushed modifications included cutting the ships in half, discarding the center, and welding the bow and stern together, leaving a large seam that failed under the impact of powerful waves. This seam ultimately split apart, contributing to the vessels&#x2019; sinking. Baza reported that investigators have opened two criminal cases following the sinking of the tankers, though this has not been confirmed by official sources. Russian-occupied Crimea is home to the Russian Black Sea Fleet but successful Ukrainian strikes on Crimea have forced Moscow to relocate much of its naval forces from the peninsula to the Russian port city of Novorossiysk. Ukraine has repeatedly struck Russia&apos;s vessels since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Around 30% of Russia&#x2019;s Black Sea Fleet is lost or disabled, according to the Ukrainian military. North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces in Kursk Oblast killed eight members of a Russian unit in a &quot;friendly fire&quot; attack, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) claimed on Dec. 14. Earlier in the day, President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that a &quot;significant number&quot; of North Korean troops had joined Russian assault operations in the Kursk region. While engaged in combat in Kursk Oblast, a group of North Korean soldiers opened fire on members of the Chechen Akhmat unit fighting for Russia, HUR reported via its official Telegram channel. The attack allegedly killed eight Russian soldiers. The Kyiv Independent was unable to verify the report. HUR said the incident was the result of the language barrier between Russian and North Korean troops, which continues to be a &quot;difficult obstacle&quot; on the battlefield. An estimated 200 servicemembers fighting with Russian and North Korean units have been killed as of Dec. 14, HUR claimed. Zelensky previously announced that North Korean personnel had begun incurring &quot;noticeable losses,&quot; but did not provide a figure. Ukrainian and Western officials in fall 2024 warned that over 10,000 North Korean troops had amassed in Kursk Oblast, ready to aid Russia&apos;s attempt to oust Ukrainian forces in the region. The Russian military has instituted special protocols in places where North Korean personnel are located, HUR said. Russian soldiers must undergo inspections before entering these areas, and their phones and electronic devices are confiscated. The first direct clashes between North Korean and Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast were reported in early November. According to Zelensky, North Korean personnel have not been deployed to any other areas of the front, but that could change in the future. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-north-korean-troops-joining-russian-assaults-in-kursk-zelensky-says/	2024-12-15T11:14:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1125139920.jpg
Trump picks former intelligence director Richard Grenell as 'envoy for special missions'	Richard Grenell, former U.S. ambassador to Germany, will serve as President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s &quot;special missions envoy,&quot; Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Dec. 14. In his post, Trump stated that &#x201C;Ric will work in some of the hottest spots around the World, including Venezuela and North Korea [and] ... will continue to fight for Peace through Strength, and always put America first.&#x201D; The New York Times describes Grenell as &#x201C;a loyalist known for unbridled social media attacks on Mr. Trump&#x2019;s perceived critics.&quot; He previously served as U.S. Ambassador to Germany during Trump&#x2019;s first term, as acting National Intelligence Director in 2020, and as Special Presidential Envoy for Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations from 2019 to 2021. Grenell&#x2019;s name emerged during Trump&#x2019;s selection process for the U.S. Ukraine peace envoy, where he was a prominent contender, though the role ultimately went to Keith Kellogg. Michael O&#x2019;Hanlon, director of research in the Foreign Policy program at the Brookings Institution, told the Kyiv Independent that he was &#x201C;more hopeful&#x201D; about Kellogg&#x2019;s selection, contrasting him with Grenell, whom he described as more radical. Ukrainian analyst Volodymyr Fesenko agreed, noting that &#x201C;Grenell is more radical and more inclined to apply strong pressure [to Ukraine].&#x201D; Grenell&apos;s perspective on Ukraine is consistent with the &quot;peace through strength&quot; approach, which involves leveraging military power, economic pressure, and assertive diplomacy to deter aggression and secure peace, as Trump&apos;s advisor Robert C. O&#x2019;Brien elaborated in Foreign Affairs in June 2024. &#xA0; In 2022, he &#x201C;applauded&#x201D; Elon Musk&#x2019;s controversial peace proposal but called for an even &#x201C;stronger [peace] deal.&#x201D; Musk&#x2019;s plan, which proposed Ukraine&#x2019;s neutrality, recognition of Crimea as Russian, and a UN-supervised vote on other occupied territories, ignited widespread criticism. By July 2024, Grenell suggested that peace in Ukraine could involve creating &#x201C;autonomous zones,&#x201D; though he did not provide details. &#x201C;Autonomous regions can mean a lot of things to a lot of people, but you got to work through those details,&#x201D; he said. Grenell also expressed the belief that Ukraine should delay its NATO membership ambitions. It remains unclear what priorities and actions this newly created role will entail, as it currently has no established precedent.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-picks-former-intelligence-director-richard-grenell-as-envoy-for-special-missions/	2024-12-15T09:36:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2173291826.jpg
The Week Ahead: Key Developments Impacting Global Politics & Markets	Editor&apos;s note: This article is a shortened on-site version of KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter covering events from Dec. 16 to Dec. 22. Sign up here to start your week with an agenda of Ukraine-related events, delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday. Central banks accounting for over 40% of the world&#x2019;s economy will set rates next week &#x2013; incl. a possible record hike in Russia. With inflation expected to reach 9% in 2024 and pressure on the ruble, analysts now expect the Russian Central Bank to increase rates to a record 23% (up 200 basis points). Much of the world is dealing with combinations of low growth, high debt, budget deficits and the fallout of politically destabilizing inflation &#x2013; potentially making macroeconomics a surprise 2025 geopolitical driver. The biggest central bank, the US Federal Reserve, faces uncertainty between a booming economy and highly inflationary Trump tariff plans. It is expected to modestly cut rates (25 basis points) on Wednesday, Dec. 18.The Verkhovna Rada&apos;s final plenary week of the year will take place Dec. 17&#x2013;20. A significant focus will be the first reading of the bill addressing the construction of Units 3 and 4 at the Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant. Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko is strongly advocating for this construction project. Additionally, lawmakers will consider legislation on multiple citizenships. The presidential election campaign in Croatia is underway, with the first round set for Dec. 29. Current polls show incumbent President Zoran Milanovi&#x107; leading at 35%, while Dragan Primorac holds second place with 24.5%. Maria Selak Raspudi&#x107; trails significantly in third place at 8%. Milanovi&#x107;, known for his pro-Putin stance, advocates for Croatia&apos;s withdrawal from both the EU and NATO. While Primorac, the former Minister of Education and Science, has a viable path to victory through his nomination by the ruling HDZ party and its allies, his campaign&apos;s low visibility and limited political profile may hinder his chances. The dismissal of Ukrainian Institute of National Memory head Anton Drobovych may move forward talks on Volyn exhumations &#x2013; a key source of Polish-Ukrainian tensions. Drobovych often frustrated Poles, most recently claiming Poland had not delivered a list of locations for exhumation work (shortly after a significant communique by Foreign Ministers Andrii Sybiha and Rados&#x142;aw Sikorski seemed to resolve the matter). The issue remains complex, notably given Polish presidential elections next year (and possibly in Ukraine).

Zelensky rejected opportunity to discuss Christmas truce with Orban, Hungarian minister claims	President Volodymyr Zelensky has &quot;forcefully but politely&quot; rejected a call from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb&#xE1;n to discuss a Christmas ceasefire, Hungarian Foreign Minister P&#xE9;ter Szijj&#xE1;rt&#xF3; claimed on Dec. 15. He said that Hungary had proposed organizing a telephone conversation between Zelensky and Orban on the issue but Zelensky had not accepted the proposal. Zelensky&apos;s spokesman Serhiy Nikiforov did not respond to a request for comment. Hungary has maintained close economic and diplomatic relations with Moscow despite Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It has repeatedly criticized EU sanctions against Russia and obstructed efforts to provide military aid to Kyiv. Szijj&#xE1;rt&#xF3;, quoted by Hungarian news agency MTI, said that the Hungarian peace mission had &quot;tried everything in the past six months&quot; in connection with a proposed Christmas ceasefire and prisoner exchange in Ukraine. &quot;Christmas is approaching, and when we talk about Christmas, peace gets special emphasis, which is why Hungarian diplomacy - with the prime minister surely taking the lead - took some serious steps recently in order to improve the situation for people living in the affected area, even before the war finally ends,&quot; he first said to MTI on Dec 13. &quot;We have therefore proposed a Christmas ceasefire and a large exchange of prisoners, so that more people can celebrate Christmas at home and in peace even in that part of the world.&quot; The foreign minister said that the Hungarian government presented this proposal to Russian President Vladimir Putin and and to several Russian government officials who allegedly demonstrated &quot;an openness to considering the proposal and carrying out the related talks.&quot; Szijj&#xE1;rt&#xF3;, however, explained on Dec. 15 that Zelensky had, &quot;in a gesture that is quite unprecedented in diplomacy, forcefully but politely refused the opportunity to negotiate.&quot; &quot;There is an offer on the table that has not been comparable in the past thousand days. It is not up to Hungary whether both parties consider and accept this offer. One party has considered it and finds it suitable for acceptance, but the other party has taken a position of rejection,&quot; he stated. Szijj&#xE1;rt&#xF3;&apos;s statement follows a parallel one by the Hungarian Head of the Prime Minister&apos;s Office Gergely Gulyas. He said on Dec. 12 that Hungary would not give up the goal of a cease-fire, &quot;even though the current Ukrainian government is apparently uncertain about the issue of war and peace, at least until the new U.S. president takes office.&quot; This topic has been in the spotlight since Hungarian Prime Minister Orb&#xE1;n said on his X profile on Dec. 11 that Budapest had proposed a ceasefire. &quot;It&apos;s sad that President Zelensky clearly rejected and ruled out this today,&quot; he said. &quot;We did what we could!&quot; But Dmytro Lytvyn, an advisor for Zelensky, told Suspline that denied the claim that Orban had approached Ukraine with his ceasefire and prisoner exchange proposal. Guly&#xE1;s mentioned on Dec. 12 that Orb&#xE1;n had met with Pope Francis in the Vatican and President-elect Donald Trump in Florida, as well as held phone conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo&#x11F;an, but he made no reference to any talks with Zelensky.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-rejected-the-opportunity-to-negotiate-christmas-truce-hungary-foreign-minister-says/	2024-12-15T08:46:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GSH76_oXwAAKjOP.jpeg

Ukraine destroys Russian train with 40 fuel tanks in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, source claims	Ukrainian intelligence agencies have destroyed a Russian train carrying 40 fuel tanks in the Russian-occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast on Dec. 14, an intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent. The source said that the aim of the operation was to disrupt a supply line used to transport fuel from Crimea to Zaporizhzhia Oblast.

Georgia's opposition parties appeal to EU following election of pro-Russian president, Sova reports	Georgia&apos;s opposition leaders have urged the EU to reject the pro-Russian presidential candidate and take broader steps to support European values in the country, Sova news outlet reports. In their joint letter, addressed to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Kaja Kallas, and the foreign ministers of EU member states, the opposition leaders express their concerns. The letter was signed by Nika Melia of the &#x201C;Coalition for Change,&#x201D; Tina Bokuchava of &#x201C;Unity &#x2013; National Movement,&#x201D; Mamuka Khazaradze of &#x201C;Strong Georgia,&#x201D; and Zaza Tavadze of &#x201C;Gakharia for Georgia.&#x201D; The leaders argue that the only solution to the current crisis is &quot;to hold new elections under an improved electoral system, with a politically balanced electoral administration and neutral state institutions.&quot; The letter also criticizes Bidzina Ivanishvili, the founder of Georgian Dream, for his plan to elect Mikhail Kavelashvili as the sixth president of Georgia, calling it a move that exacerbates the already tense situation. The authors remind the EU that Kavelashvili was one of the initiators of the controversial foreign agents law and is frequently involved in anti-Western propaganda. They urge the EU to take urgent measures to support the Georgian people and protect European values. These measures include the release of all detained politicians, activists, and peaceful demonstrators; the introduction of targeted sanctions against those responsible for &quot;undermining democracy;&quot; the suspension of visa-free travel and visa restrictions for Georgian Dream officials; and the declaration of the &quot;self-proclaimed regime&quot; of Ivanishvili as illegitimate. Similar actions have already been taken by the U.S., which on Dec. 12 announced visa bans on approximately 20 Georgian individuals accused of &quot;undermining democracy.&quot; The opposition leaders emphasize that the Georgian people are &quot;courageously resisting Russian-backed authoritarianism and fighting for their democratic European future.&quot; They stress that EU support is vital to their success, stating, &quot;Your clear voice, together with decisive action, will play a crucial role in de-escalating the alarming situation in Georgia and restoring constitutional order.&quot; Protests have erupted in Georgia against the ruling Georgian Dream party, fueled by accusations of democratic backsliding and alignment with Russian interests. The party&apos;s suspension of Georgia&apos;s EU accession process until at least 2028 and allegations of election violations, including restrictions on overseas voting, have intensified public outrage. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, a pro-EU leader, has criticized these actions and vowed to remain in office until a legitimate parliament is elected. President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Zourabichvili on Dec. 7 and to expressed solidarity with the Georgian people, condemning the Ivanishvili-led government for undermining Georgia&apos;s democratic aspirations. He also emphasized the importance of international backing for Georgia&#x2019;s fight for democracy.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgias-opposition-parties-appeal-to-eu-following-election-of-pro-russian-president-sova-reports/	2024-12-15T02:33:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2186926312.jpg
292 front-line clashes recorded over the past day, General Staff reports	A total of 292 combat clashes were recorded along the extensive eastern front line on Dec. 14, according to a new operational summary from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Russian forces continue their assaults employing diverse weaponry and tactics to strike Ukrainian positions, with a concentrated focus on Kharkiv, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts. According to the report, Russian forces conducted one missile strike, utilizing two missiles aimed at Ukrainian unit positions and settlements. They also carried out 61 aviation strikes, involving 99 Controlled Aerial Bombs (KABs), over 5,000 artillery shelling incidents, including 158 rocket salvo system attacks, and deployed more than 3,000 kamikaze drones across various regions. In response, the Defense Forces conducted 35 targeted strikes against Russian troop concentrations, armaments, and military equipment.

2 injured in Mykolaiv amid Russia’s overnight missile and drone attack, Governor reports	Two people were injured and an infrastructure facility was damaged in the city of Mykolaiv amid Russia&#x2019;s overnight drone and missile attack, Governor Vitalii Kim reported on Dec. 15. According to the governor, in the early hours of Dec. 15, Ukraine&#x2019;s air defense forces shot down four drones over Mykolaiv oblast. Despite these efforts, one drone struck the city at 6:57 a.m., damaging an infrastructure facility and injuring two civilian workers. These attacks are part of Russia&#x2019;s ongoing aerial campaign against Ukraine, which included the launch of 108 drones and an anti-aircraft missile during an overnight attack on Dec. 15 The attack targeted multiple oblasts, including Chernihiv, Sumy, Kyiv, Poltava, Cherkasy, Khmelnytskyi, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, and Dnipropetrovsk. Russia launched a total of 108 drones at Ukraine from the Russian regions of Kursk, Orel, Bryansk and Millerovo, with the military successfully downing 56, the Air Force said in a Telegram post. Forty-nine unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) went off the radar, and their exact trajectories remain unknown. Three of the drones malfunctioned and returned to Russian territory. Debris from downed drones caused damage to residential buildings and private properties during the overnight assault, according to local authorities. The attack highlights a continuing escalation in Russia&apos;s use of kamikaze drones, marking the third month in a row of intensified drone strikes across Ukraine. Data from Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reveals a steady rise in drone activity, with 2,576 drones deployed by Russian forces in November, up from 2,023 in October, signaling a clear uptick in aerial assaults. In response, Ukraine is enhancing its drone capabilities to counteract these threats. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Dec. 5 that over 30,000 DeepStrike attack drones will be added to Ukraine&#x2019;s arsenal by 2025. Designed for autonomous long-range missions and precision strikes, these next-generation drones are expected to significantly strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s defensive and offensive capacities.	https://kyivindependent.com/2-injured-in-mykolaiv-amid-russias-overnight-drone-attack-regional-governor-reports/	2024-12-15T01:06:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2162084813.jpg

UK’s Starmer urges G7 to intensify pressure on Putin with sanctions	British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has emphasized the importance of inflicting &quot;maximum pain&quot; on Russian President Vladimir Putin through additional sanctions and enhanced military support for Ukraine. Talking during a video conference with G7 leaders, Starmer highlighted Putin&apos;s unwillingness to make concessions and argued for bolstered aid to Ukraine to position the country as strongly as possible for the future. He noted that the international community must increase economic pressure and military assistance to achieve this goal. The remarks come amid ongoing efforts by G7 nations to finalize a $50 billion aid package for Ukraine using Russian assets, as recently noted by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. On Dec. 9, the U.K. announced new sanctions targeting the illicit gold trade, which it says finances Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. &quot;Russia uses the illicit gold trade to launder money and evade sanctions, in doing so bolstering (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&apos;s war efforts,&quot; the U.K. government said in a press release. The measures include asset freezes on five individuals, including Anto Joseph, CEO of Paloma Precious, which has reportedly purchased over $300 million worth of Russian gold. The British government reported in 2023 that gold brought $15.5 billion to the Russian economy in 2021, making it one of the country&apos;s most valuable commodities after energy exports.	https://kyivindependent.com/uks-starmer-urges-g7-to-intensify-pressure-on-putin-with-sanctions-military-aid/	2024-12-14T19:47:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187414183.jpg
Ukraine calls for FIFA apology over map of Crimea	Ukraine has criticized FIFA for an &quot;unacceptable error&quot; after a map displayed during the 2026 World Cup draw appeared to exclude Crimea from the country&apos;s territory. The map, used to show nations that cannot be drawn to play against each other for geopolitical reasons, highlighted Ukraine but excluded Crimea, which is internationally recognized as part of its territory. Crimea has been under Russian occupation since 2014, though only a few countries recognize it as Russian territory. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi demanded a public apology from FIFA, calling the oversight a violation of international law. &quot;FIFA has not only acted against international law but has also supported Russian propaganda, war crimes, and the crime of aggression against Ukraine,&quot; he wrote on X, adding a corrected version of the map with Crimea included as part of Ukraine. Are you OK, @FIFAcom?By redrawing international borders in yesterday&#x2019;s broadcast, you not only acted against international law, but also supported Russian propaganda, war crimes, and the crime of aggression against Ukraine.We fixed the map for you and expect a public apology. pic.twitter.com/UAr7voKqGi FIFA acknowledged the issue, saying it was &quot;aware of an issue&quot; and had since removed the map. However, the Ukrainian Football Association has taken further action, sending a formal letter to FIFA Secretary-General Mathias Grafstr&#xF6;m and UEFA Secretary-General Theodore Theodoridis, according to BBC. In the letter, the association expressed &quot;deep concern&quot; over the incident and referenced decisions made by FIFA and UEFA since 2014, which reaffirm Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity. &quot;The cartographic image of Ukraine displayed on December 13, 2024, is completely unacceptable and looks like an inconsistent position of FIFA and UEFA,&quot; the letter read. The controversy comes as preparations continue for the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted in North America and feature an expanded format with 48 teams. The tournament is set to begin on June 11 in Mexico City and conclude on July 19 in New Jersey, spanning a record 39 days. Ukraine was drawn into Group D, where they will face Iceland, Azerbaijan, and the winner of France&apos;s Nations League quarter-final against Croatia.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-calls-for-fifa-apology-over-map-of-crimea/	2024-12-14T17:39:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177085517.jpg
Serbia claims US plans to sanction Russian-backed energy firm	Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on Dec. 13 that the United States is planning to impose sanctions in the coming days on the country&#x2019;s sole gas supplier, citing its Russian ownership. The Petroleum Industry of Serbia (known by its local acronym NIS), primarily owned by Russia&#x2019;s Gazprom Neft and its parent company Gazprom, is Serbia&#x2019;s exclusive gas supplier and controls the main pipelines delivering gas from Russia to Serbian households and industries. &quot;The British are also joining the sanctions, which then means everyone. This is probably one of the hardest pieces of news,&quot; Vucic said during an interview on a government-linked private television station, according to AFP. Neither the United States nor the United Kingdom has commented on the reported sanctions. Serbia, an EU candidate country, has maintained close ties with Moscow and refused to impose sanctions against Russia since the invasion of Ukraine. &quot;I think this is part of broader geopolitical pressure on Russia,&quot; Vucic added, warning that the move would significantly impact Serbia, which relies heavily on Russian gas. He noted that Serbia is negotiating a new gas arrangement with Russia, as the current deal expires in March 2025. Vucic suggested that reducing Russian ownership of NIS to below 50 percent might be a solution, allowing Serbia to purchase a larger stake. He added that the sanctions, if implemented, are expected to take effect from Jan. 1. According to NIS&apos;s website, Gazprom Neft owns 50 percent of the company, Gazprom holds 6.15 percent, and the Republic of Serbia owns 29.9 percent, with the remaining shares distributed among citizens, employees, and other minority shareholders.	https://kyivindependent.com/serbia-claims-us-plans-to-sanction-russian-backed-energy-firm/	2024-12-14T15:52:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189211336.jpg
North Korean troops open fire on Russian unit, Ukraine's military intelligence claims	North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces in Kursk Oblast killed eight members of a Russian unit in a &quot;friendly fire&quot; attack, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) claimed on Dec. 14. Earlier in the day, President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that a &quot;significant number&quot; of North Korean troops had joined Russian assault operations in the Kursk region. &#xA0; While engaged in combat in Kursk Oblast, a group of North Korean soldiers opened fire on members of the Chechen Akhmat unit fighting for Russia, HUR reported via its official Telegram channel. The attack allegedly killed eight Russian soldiers. HUR said the incident was the result of the language barrier between Russian and North Korean troops, which continues to be a &quot;difficult obstacle&quot; on the battlefield. An estimated 200 servicemembers fighting with Russian and North Korean units have been killed as of Dec. 14, HUR reported. Zelensky previously announced that North Korean personnel had begun incurring &quot;noticeable losses,&quot; but did not provide a figure. &#xA0; Ukrainian and Western officials in fall 2024 warned that over 10,000 North Korean troops had amassed in Kursk Oblast, ready to aid Russia&apos;s attempt to oust Ukrainian forces in the region. The Russian military has instituted special protocols in places where North Korean personnel are located, HUR said. Russian soldiers must undergo inspections before entering these areas, and their phones and electronic devices are confiscated. The first direct clashes between North Korean and Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast were reported in early November. According to Zelensky, North Korean personnel have not been deployed to any other areas of the front, but that could change in the future.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-open-fire-on-russian-unit-ukraines-military-intelligence-claims/	2024-12-14T13:07:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2157765664.jpg
Outnumbered and outgunned, Ukraine struggles to halt Russian advance near Pokrovsk	Russian troops are closing in on Pokrovsk from the east and south. After the capture of Shevchenko village just south of the city, Russian forces are less than 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from this key logistics hub sitting on the western edge of Donetsk Oblast. &quot;The fighting is extremely fierce. The Russian invaders are throwing all available forces forward, trying to break through the defense of our troops,&quot; Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrskyi said. Ukraine had been suffering from an extensive infantry shortage, as well as disputes within the military command leading the defense. Pokrovsk is the last stronghold in the southwestern part of Donetsk Oblast, holding back Russian forces from advancing further toward Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and the regional capital of Dnipro, home to 1 million people and serving as the main hub for Kyiv&apos;s operations in the southeast. Stanislav Buniatov, a platoon commander of the 24th Separate Assault Battalion Aidar, wrote on his Telegram that &quot;everyone has already accepted that Russian troops will enter Pokrovsk.&quot; However, he added, not everyone understands what consequences this will have for Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and Russia&apos;s further advance in the area. &quot;Dnipropetrovsk Oblast is not built up with villages like Donetsk Oblast, so that progress will be faster there,&quot; Buniatov said, adding that once Russia enters the next oblast of Ukraine, it will again dictate the conditions for the full ceding of these territories under Russian control. Around 11,000 people remain in Pokrovsk, which was home to over 60,000 before the full-scale war, according to the local military administration. Most utility companies and local businesses have stopped functioning. There is also no gas supply or heating in the city due to the power lines damaged or destroyed by constant Russian shelling. Although gunfire and explosions can already be heard in the city, a few mines near Pokrovsk continue to operate. Local authorities have been urging residents to evacuate for several months, adding that &quot;there is no safe place in Donetsk Oblast as of now.&quot; Evacuation is a challenge, however, with human lives at stake. Since September, the state-owned railway, Ukrzaliznytsia, has canceled evacuation trains from Pokrovsk due to the risk of Russian attacks and now runs them from Pavlohrad in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, 100 kilometers (62 miles) away from the embattled city. Evacuation by buses or cars remains available from Pokrovsk. While locals are considering whether they are ready to evacuate and leave their old life behind, Russian troops have advanced and gained a foothold in the villages of Novotroiitske and Shevchenko in December, according to the crowd-sourced monitoring website Deep State. The Shevchenko village is roughly less than 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from Pokrovsk.

(Kostya Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)Nazar Voloshyn, a spokesman for the Khortytsia group of forces, said the Ukrainian army is trying to recover lost positions near Pokrovsk, particularly near the neighboring villages of Shevchenko and Vidrodzhennia. &quot;The enemy attacked our fortifications in the Pokrovsk direction, west of Vidrodzhennia and south of Novotroiitske, and as a result of prolonged fighting, two of our positions were destroyed, and one was lost,&quot; Voloshyn said on national television. Gustav Gressel, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations Berlin office, suggested that Russia is planning an attack on the city from the south to surround it and cut off the main logistical routes connecting the Ukrainian-controlled territories to the front line. According to Gressel, Pokrovsk may face the same fate as Avdiivka, captured by Russian forces in February 2024. &quot;Now, Russian forces can reach the city (of Pokrovsk) with mortars and, of course, artillery. But the proximity to the E50 (route) and the rail line to Dnipro is even more problematic,&quot; Gressel told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The Russians may soon physically reach the rail line to Zaporizhzhia, putting the E50 under fire. This will have consequences for logistics in the whole southeastern perimeter.&quot; Meanwhile, even since the capture of Avdiivka, Russian military tactics had changed significantly. Now, Russian forces are sparing no resources in bombarding Ukrainian cities with guided aerial bombs and drones, and Pokrovsk is no exception. Drones provide access to better awareness of the terrain, the location of the opponent&apos;s positions, and critical infrastructure. Drones also provide control of important logistics routes, cutting off essential supplies. Gressel calls the factor of drones a decisive one in the Pokrovsk direction, adding that their qualitative evolution, namely the development of resistance to interference and an increase in flight range, plays an even more significant role. &quot;Unfortunately, the Russians learned and adapted quite a lot in this field,&quot; he added. This is not Russia&apos;s only advantage in this front-line sector. One key reason Russian forces advance rapidly is their superior manpower. While the Ukrainian government has made efforts to update mobilization legislation and recruit more people, there has not been a major effect in the hottest spots of the front line. Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), said that Ukraine cannot properly staff its combat units and conduct rotations due to a lack of personnel. At the same time, Russia continues to push. Finding the weakest points in the Ukrainian army&apos;s defense, Russian troops are also resorting to non-standard solutions, such as unarmed and even civilian vehicles are now commonplace and used for attacks, Borsari added. &quot;Constant assaults, even when unsuccessful, erode Ukrainian combat power as they drain ammunition and supplies, leaving Ukrainian units unable to deal with successive waves of vehicles and infantry,&quot; Borsari told the Kyiv Independent. Russia, which has suffered record losses this fall and winter, will not relinquish its goal of capturing Pokrovsk. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military has criticized the actions of the general command, explaining that the military is being given &quot;unrealistic&quot; tasks with its resources.

(Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu via Getty Images)&quot;The main reason for the disaster in the Pokrovsk sector is the high command, which sets unrealistic tasks for the units. Generals who do not understand the units&apos; capabilities and do not know the situation on the zero line,&quot; Serhii Filimonov, commander of the Da Vinci Wolves Battalion of the 59th Brigade, wrote on his Telegram. Alina Mikhailova, the head of the Ulf medical service in the Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, also criticized General Yurii Lutsenko in her social media, accusing him of heavy losses, both in terms of territory and human lives, in Donetsk Oblast. These comments were left without a public response from the Ukrainian General Staff and Syrskyi himself. However, according to the Financial Times, Lutsenko had been removed from his position as commander of the Donetsk operational and tactical group. Ukrainian military officials had not confirmed the sacking. Borsari echoed the stance of Buniatov from Aidar, saying that the Kremlin wants to grab as much territory as possible and be in a position of strength at the negotiating table. Borsari believed that Ukraine had a chance, albeit a slim one, to defend the city. Gressel also saw no easy way for Ukraine to keep Pokrovsk but noted that he would be surprised if the city was captured by the end of this year. In the meantime, all that remains for the Ukrainian forces is to hold the line.	https://kyivindependent.com/outnumbered-and-outgunned-ukraine-struggles-to-halt-russian-advance-near-pokrovsk/	2024-12-14T12:06:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2184405015.jpg
Ukraine sending humanitarian aid to Syria to prevent 'food crisis,' Zelensky says	Ukraine is preparing to send humanitarian aid to Syria in order &quot;to help prevent a food crisis,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Dec. 14. The announcement comes a week after the Russia-backed regime of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad collapsed on Dec. 8 amid a large-scale rebel offensive. Kyiv will contribute to stabilization in Syria in the aftermath of Assad&apos;s fall, Zelensky said. &quot;We are ready to help Syria prevent a food crisis,&quot; he said. &quot;Including through the Grain from Ukraine humanitarian program. I have instructed the government to organize food deliveries in cooperation with international organizations and partners willing to help.&quot; Zelensky called on global partners to assist in ensuring a stable peace in Syria, which endured years of civil war &quot;ignited with ... Russia&apos;s involvement.&quot; Kyiv launched the Grain From Ukraine initiative in fall 2022. Since then, the program has saved 20 million people from hunger, according to Zelensky. Ukraine is one of the world&apos;s leading agricultural producers and has been a major supplier of grain and other products to countries in Africa and Asia.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-sending-humanitarian-aid-to-syria-to-prevent-food-crisis-zelensky-says/	2024-12-14T11:30:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/6826cae7ed32a7227b9f7697efd4a2de_1700922247_extra_large.jpeg
Kyiv delayed minerals deal with US to let Trump take credit, NYT reports	Ukrainian authorities postponed signing an agreement with the United States on processing and extracting rare earth minerals, in order to let U.S. President-elect Donald Trump claim credit for the deal when he takes office, the New York Times (NYT) reported on Dec. 14. Trump begins his second presidential term on Jan. 20, 2025. He has promised to make a quick end to Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, sparking fears in Kyiv that Washington will withdraw military aid when Trump returns to the White House. In a bid to secure Trump&apos;s support ahead of the inauguration, the Ukrainian government has appealed to Trump&apos;s ego and reputation as a businessman, the New York Times reported. One attempt involved delaying a significant minerals deal. Ukraine, home to large deposits of critical minerals, including cobalt, graphite, and lithium, planned to sign the deal with U.S. President Joe Biden. U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal announced plans for the deal in August 2024 after their visit to Kyiv. Ukrainian authorities then twice delayed signing the agreement, the NYT said, citing officials on both sides of the negotiations. The delays offer the opportunity for the Trump administration to claim an early victory at the start of his term. &quot;This war is about money,&quot; Graham told Fox News in November. &quot;So Donald Trump&apos;s going to do a deal to get our money back, to enrich ourselves with rare earth minerals. A good deal for Ukraine and us, and he&#x2019;s going to bring peace.&quot; Trump has repeatedly criticized the level of support the Biden administration provided to Ukraine and signaled Kyiv should brace for reduced assistance once his term begins. In a Dec. 12 interview, Trump said he would not &quot;abandon&quot; Ukraine. &quot;I want to reach an agreement, and the only way you&apos;re going to reach an agreement is not to abandon,&quot; he said. Trump&apos;s comments came a few days after his first in-person meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky since the U.S. presidential election. Zelensky praised Trump during the meeting, telling him he was the only one Russian President Vladimir Putin feared. &quot;I told President Trump that Putin fears only him and, perhaps, China,&quot; Zelensky said on X. Following his meeting with Zelensky, Trump said the Ukrainian president appeared ready &quot;to make a deal and stop the madness&quot; and that Putin should do the same after incurring staggering losses in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-delayed-minerals-deal-with-us-to-let-trump-take-credit-nyt-reports/	2024-12-14T10:48:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/2024-12-10-19_27_27.jpg

Explosion in Dnipro center kills 1, injures 2 police officers	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. An explosion in a central neighborhood of Dnipro on Dec. 14 killed one person and injured two police officers, Ukraine&apos;s National Police reported. The cause of the explosion is currently unknown. The explosion occurred at around 2:45 p.m. local time, the police said. Police investigators and explosives experts are working to determine the circumstances of the explosion. One person was killed, according to preliminary information. Two police officers were injured and have been taken to the hospital. Dnipro, Ukraine&apos;s fourth-largest city, has served as a key logistics and humanitarian hub during the full-scale war. The city has recently been a target of intensified Russian attacks. Russia launched its Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) at Dnipro Nov. 21, marking the first time such a weapon has been deployed against Ukraine during the war. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed on Dec. 13 that Russia is preparing to attack Ukraine with another Oreshnik missile this weekend.	https://kyivindependent.com/explosion-in-dnipro-leaves-one-dead-multiple-injured-preliminary-reports-say/	2024-12-14T09:43:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/dnipro.jpeg
North Korean troops joining Russian assaults in Kursk, Zelensky says	A &quot;significant number&quot; of North Korean soldiers have begun fighting alongside Russian forces in assault operations in Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Dec. 14. Ukrainian and Western officials in fall 2024 warned that over 10,000 North Korean troops had amassed in Kursk Oblast, ready to aid Russia&apos;s attempt to oust Ukrainian forces in the region. The move represents an unprecedented escalation in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. &quot;Today, we already have preliminary data that the Russians have begun to use North Korean soldiers in their assaults &#x2014; a significant number of them,&quot; Zelensky said in a video address. &quot;The Russians include them in combined units and use them in operations in Kursk Oblast.&quot; North Korean troops have not yet joined Russian forces in any other areas of the front, but this could change, Zelensky said. Zelensky also reported that North Korean units have sustained &quot;noticeable losses.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin has &quot;dragged another state into this war,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;And if this is not escalation, then what is the escalation that so many have been talking about?&quot; The first clashes between North Korean and Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast were reported in early November. Zelensky reported on Dec. 1 that North Korean soldiers had already been killed fighting for Russia, but did not specify figures. Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened their alliance over the course of the full-scale war. The two nations signed a defense treaty in June, requiring either state to render military aid to the other in the event of an attack. North Korea has reportedly provided Russia with over 100 ballistic missiles and 5 million artillery shells. In exchange, Moscow has allegedly given Pyongyang economic support and assistance with its nuclear weapons program. Ukrainain forces launched a shock offensive into Kursk Oblast in August. Russia began a counterattack in September and has reportedly taken back 40% of the territory initially captured by Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-joining-russian-assaults-in-kursk-zelensky-says/	2024-12-14T09:15:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/zel.png

German CDU party highlights support for Ukraine in election program, European Pravda reports	The Christian Democratic Union (CDU), one of Germany&#x2019;s leading political parties, has reaffirmed its support for Ukraine as part of its platform in the upcoming German parliament elections, European Pravda reported on Dec. 14. In its section on foreign and security policy, the CDU has reportedly pledged to continue supporting Ukraine &quot;with all necessary diplomatic, financial, humanitarian, and military assistance.&quot; The New Voice of Ukraine also reported that the CDU is advocating for a minimum defense spending limit of 2% of GDP, aligning with NATO&#x2019;s target, though it is not proposing a higher threshold. In addition to its backing for Ukraine, the CDU has called for maintaining and, if necessary, intensifying, sanctions against Russia. CDU party chairman Friedrich Merz traveled to Kyiv on Dec. 9 to &quot;get an overview of the current situation in Ukraine [and] above all, to gain insight into how an end to the fighting and a lasting peace can be achieved,&quot; according to the CDU&#x2019;s official website. While in Ukraine, Merz emphasized the CDU&#x2019;s steadfast commitment to Germany&#x2019;s support for Ukraine through financial aid, humanitarian assistance, and military equipment. &quot;If our support for Ukraine weakens, this war will last longer. If it remains consistent, it will end sooner,&quot; he stated. The conservative politician also proposed issuing an ultimatum to Russian President Vladimir Putin to cease aggression. Failing that, he suggested that the West should remove all restrictions on long-range strikes and that Berlin should supply Taurus missiles to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-cdu-party-highlights-support-for-ukraine-in-election-program-european-pravda-reports/	2024-12-14T06:55:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/e99dfedf4f71ca1b5c178d4d5f33105c_1733742724_extra_large.jpeg
Defense minister outlines military, financial plans for 2025 with Baltic, Nordic Allies	Defense Minister Serhii Boiev held talks with representatives of the foreign ministries of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Sweden to outline plans for military and financial assistance to Ukraine in 2025, the Defense Ministry reported on its website on Nov. 14. During the meeting, the parties reviewed the results of this year&apos;s cooperation and identified priorities for assistance to Ukraine in the coming year. Boiev also briefed the delegates on the operational situation at the front and shared details of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Victory Plan. He reiterated Ukraine&apos;s position that an invitation to NATO membership is an integral part of the country&apos;s long-term security guarantees and highlighted the strengthening of air and missile defenses, the formation of military reserves, and support for the defense industry as critical areas of focus. &#x201C;Comprehensive defense of Ukraine remains our main task, and in addition to stabilizing the situation at the front, we need to be confident in the volume of assistance for 2025,&#x201D; he said. The meeting also addressed concerns about North Korea&apos;s possible military involvement in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. The Baltic representatives expressed concern about the growing cooperation between Russia and North Korea, following updated intelligence reports provided by Ukraine. The potential for strengthening EU sanctions against Russia as part of the upcoming 16th round of sanctions was another key topic of discussion. On the defense industry front, Boev expressed gratitude to the countries participating in the European Union Military Assistance Mission (EUMAM) for their role in training Ukrainian forces and highlighted the capabilities of domestic manufacturers, urging greater cooperation with partner nations to increase Ukraine&apos;s defense production capacity. This followed a Nov. 27 statement by the leaders of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Norway, Poland and Sweden pledging to increase their support for Ukraine in response to Russia&apos;s ongoing full-scale invasion and a Nov. 13 commitment by the U.S. to tighten restrictions until the next administration takes office.	https://kyivindependent.com/defense-minister-outlines-military-and-financial-plans-for-2025-with-baltic-and-nordic-allies/	2024-12-14T06:52:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/small_whatsapp-image-2024-12-14-at-13-30-20-2-db63c2a044.webp
US weighs sanctions on Russia's shadow fleet, Chinese banks supporting war effort, Reuters says	Washington is considering more sanctions on &quot;shadow fleet&quot; tankers and has not ruled out targeting Chinese banks if they are found to be involved in Russia&#x2019;s war effort, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Reuters in an interview on Dec. 13. The U.S. is weighing additional measures against entities facilitating sanctions evasion in oil trade ahead of the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. In her interview, Yellen emphasized the Biden administration&#x2019;s commitment to using sanctions as a critical tool to support Ukraine, signaling that efforts to intensify restrictions will continue until the next administration takes office. &quot;There are a number of possibilities here... we&apos;re always looking at oil revenues and if we can find ways to further impair Russian oil revenues, that would, I think, strengthen Ukraine&apos;s hand. That remains on our list,&quot; she said. Regarding Chinese banks, Yellen noted ongoing discussions between U.S. Treasury officials and their Chinese counterparts to identify activities potentially tied to Russia&#x2019;s war effort. &quot;I absolutely would not rule out the possibility we would sanction an individual bank if we had the necessary level of... evidence to be able to put sanctions on,&quot; she said. &quot;But we also do have a channel where we&apos;ve been able to discuss specific concerns, and sometimes that could be adequate as well.&quot; As Russia&#x2019;s economy increasingly shifts toward military spending, the distinction between commercial activities and those supporting the war effort has blurred. Yellen pointed out that Chinese authorities are keenly aware of the risks posed by potential U.S. sanctions. &quot;Authorities in China recognize that our use of these sanctions would be a serious threat with very adverse consequences,&quot; she said. &quot;They want to trade with Russia, but they do not want their banks sanctioned.&quot; Other Ukraine allies have also taken steps to target sanctions evasion networks. In September, the U.K. sanctioned 10 tankers from Russia&#x2019;s &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; vessels linked to illicit oil trades supporting Moscow&#x2019;s war efforts. In November, it targeted 30 more. On Dec. 11, European Union ambassadors agreed on a 15th sanctions package against Russia, specifically focusing on the &quot;shadow fleet.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-weighs-sanctions-on-russias-shadow-fleet-chinese-banks-supporting-war-effort-reuters-says/	2024-12-14T04:48:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2180569402.jpg
Russia's focus on Ukraine weakened support for Syria's Assad, UK Defense Ministry says	Russia&#x2019;s focus on the war in Ukraine has significantly reduced its ability to support Syria&#x2019;s Assad regime, increasing the risk of losing key military assets in the region, the U.K. Defense Ministry reported on Dec. 13 via X. Russian officials almost certainly view the collapse of the Assad regime as detrimental to their &quot;regional interests&quot; and damaging to their image as a &quot;security guarantor,&quot; the ministry said. In Syria, Russia&apos;s primary goal has been to maintain control over critical military assets, including its largest overseas naval base in Tartus and the airbase in Khmeimim. These installations provide Moscow with strategic access to the Near East and Mediterranean Sea, enabling it to project military power across Africa and beyond. However, the potential collapse of Assad&#x2019;s regime has &#x201C;almost certainly increased the risk to the security of these assets,&#x201D; according to the report. U.K. Defense Intelligence noted that Russia&apos;s leadership has prioritized the conflict in Ukraine, likely undermining its ability to sustain support for Assad in Syria. In light of these developments, Russia is expected to focus on repairing its international reputation as a reliable partner. The intelligence update predicts Moscow will &#x201C;highly likely seek to engage diplomatically with all relevant actors&#x201D; to secure guarantees for its military bases and preserve its regional influence. Kaja Kallas, the European Union&#x2019;s representative for foreign affairs, commented that the Assad regime&#x2019;s potential collapse underscores the growing weakness of its allies, including Russia. According to Kallas, this situation highlights the limits of Russia&#x2019;s capacity to support its partners while managing its prolonged war in Ukraine. As Assad&#x2019;s regime teetered, Russia had already begun withdrawing military equipment and naval assets from Syria. On Dec. 10, Ukraine&#x2019;s Defense Intelligence (HUR) reported that Russia was evacuating forces as one of its key military bases came under siege. Satellite imagery corroborates these reports, showing a visible reduction in Russia&#x2019;s military presence at critical facilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-focus-on-ukraine-weakened-support-for-syrias-assad-uk-defense-ministry-says/	2024-12-14T03:11:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1239661576.jpg
Ukraine downs 58 of Russian 132 drones launched overnight, Air Force reports	Ukrainian air defense intercepted 58 drones out of 132 launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported on its Telegram channel on Dec. 14. The attack targeted 11 oblasts, primarily in southern and central Ukraine, with Russia deploying 132 Iranian-made Shahed drones, according to the report. Defensive operations were carried out across all targeted oblasts, with air defense systems active in Chernihiv, Sumy, Kyiv, Poltava, Cherkasy, Vinnytsia, Odesa, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, and Kirovohrad. The Air Force reported that 72 drones failed to reach their targets, while two returned to Russia. The overnight assault followed a massive aerial attack on Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure earlier on Dec. 13. During that offensive, Russia launched approximately 290 missiles and drones across multiple regions. President Volodymyr Zelensky said at least 93 missiles were fired, including some supplied by North Korea, with Ukrainian forces successfully intercepting 81 of them. Eleven missiles were shot down by F-16 fighter jets. Moscow&#x2019;s forces also deployed nearly 200 drones in the Dec. 13 strike, which Zelensky described as &quot;one of the largest against our energy grid.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-downs-58-of-russian-132-drones-launched-overnight-air-force-reports/	2024-12-14T02:08:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183433232.jpg
Over 2,000 Ukrainian military personnel hospitalized for chemical poisoning since start of full-scale war, Ukrainian colonel says	Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, more than 2,000 Ukrainian servicemen have been hospitalized with chemical poisoning, and three have died, Ukrainian Colonel Artem Vlasiuk said during a Dec. 13 press briefing. A total of 4,800 incidents involving chemical weapons, including tear gas and chemical agents typically intended for riot control, have been documented against Ukrainian forces since the war began, said Vlasiuk, who serves with the Support Forces&#x2019; Radiation, Chemical, and Biological Protection Command, at a briefing in Kyiv. Russian forces deliberately conceal their use of such weapons under the cover of &quot;intense artillery, rocket, and bomb attacks,&quot; making it difficult to track, collect samples, and investigate these violations for prosecution against Russia. In an interview with the Kyiv Independent in October, Vlasiuk said the lack of specific equipment has hindered the Ukrainian military&#x2019;s ability to identify new or mixed types of gases and develop effective protective measures for its personnel. He added that since the invasion began, more than 2,000 servicemen showing symptoms of chemical poisoning have been treated in military and civilian medical facilities for varying levels of exposure to known or unidentified substances. &quot;As for the deceased servicemen, unfortunately, we now have three such fatal cases,&quot; he said. &quot;Currently, the intensity of K-51 tear gas grenade use has somewhat decreased due to the climate, as temperature drops reduce their effectiveness,&quot; he added. He noted that the use of K-51 tear gas grenades by Russian forces has recently decreased due to colder temperatures, which reduce their effectiveness. &quot;These means are prohibited for use. Ukraine, as a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention, and its Armed Forces, which safeguard its independence and sovereignty, fully comply with international law and the requirements of the Convention.&quot; His remarks come after the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a United Nations watchdog, confirmed on Nov. 18 that riot control agents have been used on the battlefield in Ukraine. The OPCW reported that Russian drones have deployed gas grenades into Ukrainian dugouts and trenches, forcing soldiers into open fields where they are left vulnerable to drone strikes and artillery fire.	https://kyivindependent.com/2-000-servicemen-poisoned-3-dead-from-russian-chemical-weapons-since-start-of-war-ukrainian-colonel-says/	2024-12-14T02:02:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1697702705.jpg
Norway to relocate Ukrainian F-16 pilot training base to Portugal, Norwegian defense minister says	Norway will continue training Ukrainian F-16 pilots as part of its support for Ukraine&#x2019;s defense and will relocate its training base from Denmark to Portugal, Norwegian Defense Minister Bj&#xF8;rn Arild Gram announced in a Dec. 13 press release. Since 2023, Norway has provided aircraft, instructors, and technical support for the training program in Denmark. In 2025, Portugal will take over as the host nation for the initiative. The operation is part of a broader Air Defense Coalition aimed at strengthening the Ukrainian Air Force. In addition to military instructors, Norway&#x2019;s Kongsberg Aviation Maintenance Services (KAMS) will contribute personnel to support technical training for Ukrainian pilots. Gram added that future training locations will be decided by the coalition. &#x201C;The fight the Ukrainians are waging is existential, and it is critical for both Norway and Europe&#x2019;s security,&#x201D; Gram said in the statement published on the Norwegian government&#x2019;s website. &#x201C;It is crucial that we maintain and expand Western support for Ukraine, continually seeking new ways to assist their defense efforts.&#x201D; The coalition has also played a significant role in supplying military assets to Ukraine. On Dec. 7, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Denmark, a key member of the coalition, had delivered a second batch of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, boosting its air defense capabilities. This followed a Nov. 27 declaration by the leaders of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Norway, Poland, and Sweden, pledging to strengthen their support for Ukraine in response to Russia&#x2019;s ongoing full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway-to-relocate-ukrainian-f-16-pilots-training-in-portugal-norway-defence-minister-says/	2024-12-13T23:59:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1620259298.jpeg
General Staff: Russia has lost 761,160 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 761,160 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 14.

Russia appears to be withdrawing military assets from Syria, satellite images suggest	Satellite imagery collected by Maxar on Dec. 13 suggests Russia is preparing to scale back its military presence in Syria. Two AN-124 heavy military transport planes were spotted at Khmeimim air base, located in Latakia on Syria&#x2019;s Mediterranean coast, with their nose cones lifted, signaling readiness to load cargo. A Ka-52 attack helicopter was also being dismantled, likely in preparation for transport, while components of an S-400 air defense system were being packed up. Imagery from the Tartus naval base, also on the Mediterranean coast, showed minimal changes. Photos taken earlier in the week revealed two Russian frigates stationed off the coast, with no major activity suggesting an immediate departure, according to CNN. Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, described the activity as part of a larger consolidation effort at Khmeimim and the nearby Tartus naval base. &quot;In short, a withdrawal is underway,&quot; Kofman wrote on X. Russia was reportedly evacuating its forces from Syria as one of its military bases faced siege, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Intelligence (HUR) reported on Dec. 10. HUR claimed that Russian troops in Syria are voicing frustration with their commanders over what they described as a chaotic withdrawal process. The Kremlin emphasized the importance of securing its military bases and diplomatic missions in Syria, with spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying on Dec. 11 that Moscow has maintained contact with Syria&#x2019;s new leadership. He declined to disclose the number of Russian troops in the country or comment on potential evacuations. Russia has maintained a military presence in Syria since 2015, primarily to support now overthrown Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad&#x2019;s regime during the country&#x2019;s civil war. Damascus has been supportive of the Kremlin during the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-appears-to-be-withdrawing-military-assets-from-syria-satellite-images-suggest/	2024-12-13T20:49:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188481917.jpg
EU to impose first sanctions on Russian intelligence over disinformation campaigns, Bloomberg reports	The European Union is set to impose its first sanctions targeting Russia for disinformation and hybrid activities. The proposed measures target more than a dozen individuals and three entities, including Russian intelligence officers and media entrepreneurs, according to Bloomberg. The sanctions aim to counter destabilizing operations globally. In addition, the EU plans to sanction around two dozen Belarusian individuals for alleged human rights violations or ties to President Alexander Lukashenko&#x2019;s government, as part of a broader package expected to be approved by EU foreign ministers on Dec. 16 in Brussels. The proposals follow EU ambassadors&apos; approval of a 15th sanctions package against Russia, targeting its &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of aging tankers used to bypass oil export restrictions, the Hungarian Presidency of the EU Council announced on Dec. 11. The sanctions also apply to individuals and entities aiding Russia&#x2019;s military and technological advancements by evading export controls. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen praised the move, saying on X that &quot;...the EU and its G7 partners are committed to keeping pressure on the Kremlin.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-to-impose-first-sanctions-on-russian-intelligence-over-disinformation-campaigns-bloomberg-reports/	2024-12-13T19:42:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1882258789.jpeg
Russian authorities block Viber messaging app	Russia&apos;s communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, announced on Dec. 13 that it had blocked access to the Viber messaging app. The move is part of a broader crackdown on social media platforms by Russian authorities. According to Roskomnadzor, the ban was imposed due to alleged violations of regulations aimed at combating terrorism, extremism, and drug trafficking. Viber had a significant presence in Russia, with approximately 26% of the Russian population aged 12 and older using the app as of October 2023. About 14% of users accessed it daily, according to reports by state-owned TASS news agency. In 2023, Viber was fined one million rubles (approximately $11,880) for failing to remove content deemed &quot;false&quot; regarding Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. Additionally, Russian authorities restricted access to X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook in 2022, shortly after the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Following these actions, Russia also imposed a complete ban on Facebook and Instagram in March 2022. As of December 2024, Viber has faced fines totaling over 1.8 million rubles (around $17,402) for violations of national legislation. Viber, owned by Japanese multinational Rakuten, was acquired by the company for $900 million in February 2014.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-authorities-block-viber-messaging-app/	2024-12-13T17:28:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2170821225.jpg
Macron expected to raise possibility of peacekeepers in Ukraine at upcoming EU summit, RFE/RL reports	French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to raise the possibility of deploying European soldiers to Ukraine at the upcoming EU leaders&apos; summit on Dec. 18-19, if a ceasefire deal is eventually reached between Russia and Ukraine, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported on Dec. 13, citing EU diplomats. Two EU diplomats told RFE/RL that the issue will likely be raised to ensure the EU&apos;s presence in potential peace negotiations, that are expected to begin once U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated in January. European powers are expected to take center stage in helping Kyiv resist and deter Russian aggression as Trump signaled intent to reduce support and get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war. The Wall Street Journal reported on Dec. 12, citing undisclosed official sources, that Trump wants European troops to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump reportedly made the comments during his Dec. 7 meeting with Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, making it clear he wants to see Europe take up the leadership in deterring Russian aggression. On the other hand, Zelensky reportedly conveyed to Trump during the meeting that &quot;peace needs guarantees because a ceasefire alone isn&apos;t enough,&quot; Reuters&#x2019; reported, citing a source in Zelensky&apos;s office. Macron has spearheaded the idea of sending troops to Ukraine in some capacity since February. On Dec. 12, Macron visited Poland to discuss with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk the possibility of sending soldiers to Ukraine after a potential ceasefire deal. Following the meeting Tusk dismissed speculation on peacekeepers by signalling that the country is &quot;not currently planning such actions.&quot; Recent reports suggest that the U.K. and France are considering deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has also not ruled out the possibility. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responded on Dec. 9 to Macron&apos;s suggestion of deploying foreign peacekeepers, saying Ukraine &quot;may consider&quot; the proposal but only after securing a clear timeline for NATO membership. Andriy Yermak, head of the Presidential Office, said on Dec. 12 that Ukraine is currently not prepared to enter negotiations with Russia as it lacks sufficient Western support to engage from a position of strength. Zelensky is expected to attend the EU summit in Brussels on Dec. 19 to meet with European Union and NATO leaders, an undisclosed source from the president&apos;s team told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 13.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-expected-to-raise-possibility-of-peacekeepers-in-ukraine-at-upcoming-eu-summit-rfe-rl-reports/	2024-12-13T16:45:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2033880055.jpg

Biden administration sharing information on Ukraine war with Trump's team ahead of potential peace talks, NBC reports	Members of President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s incoming administration have held discussions with White House officials as part of the incoming administration&apos;s ongoing effort to establish a ceasefire once Trump is inaugurated in January, NBC News reported on Dec. 13, citing sources familiar with the talks. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has held multiple conversations with Trump&apos;s incoming National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, focused on sharing information but not strategies for expected peace negotiations, sources told NBC News. A spokesperson for Trump&apos;s transition team confirmed that the two officials were in contact, adding that &quot;the goal is for the world to understand there is a desire for the time of transition to be seen as a strong America, working for peace and stability around the world, until President-elect Trump is sworn in.&quot; Trump, who will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, has repeatedly suggested that he would end the war within 24 hours, but has so far refrained from detailing the specifics of his plan. According to NBC, no concrete plan to end the war has yet to have been presented. In September, Trump said that he would negotiate a deal &quot;that&apos;s good for both sides,&quot; however, since being elected in November, Trump has subtly shifted his rhetoric, hinting that he would will not &quot;abandon&quot; Kyiv. Following his meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Paris on Dec. 7, Trump said the Ukrainian leader is ready &quot;to make a deal and stop the madness&quot; and that Russian President Putin should &quot;act&quot; after incurring staggering losses in Ukraine. Zelensky recently said that the country must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025, adding that a war would &quot;end faster&quot; under a Trump administration. The Wall Street Journal reported on Dec. 12, citing undisclosed official sources, that Trump wants European troops to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump reportedly made the comments during his Dec. 7 meeting with Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, making it clear he wants to see Europe take up the leadership in deterring Russian aggression. On the other hand, Zelensky reportedly conveyed to Trump during the meeting that &quot;peace needs guarantees because a ceasefire alone isn&apos;t enough,&quot; Reuters&#x2019; reported, citing a source in Zelensky&apos;s office. NBC reported, citing its sources, that the Trump administration will likely reject Ukraine&apos;s NATO accessions as a means to get Russia to the negotiating table. The incoming Trump administrations&apos; work on moving forward with peace negotiations falls in line with comments made by Trump&apos;s incoming Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, on Dec. 13. Kellogg, who said the administration is &quot;putting together some plans to actually go out and just listen,&quot; to Kyiv and Moscow ahead of potential peace negotiations added that he believed the war &quot;will be resolved in the next few months.&quot; Despite Kellogg&apos;s comments, Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office Head Andriy Yermak said on Dec. 12 that the country is not prepared to enter negotiations with Russia as it lacks sufficient Western support to engage from a position of strength. Yermak held discussions with U.S. officials during a visit to Washington last week, which multiple sources described to NBC News as &quot;positive.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-administration-sharing-information-on-ukraine-war-with-trumps-team-ahead-of-potential-peace-talks-nbc-reports/	2024-12-13T14:46:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2173993733.jpg
War will be 'resolved in next few months,' Trump's Ukraine peace envoy believes, plans to 'listen' ahead of peace talks	The Trump administration&apos;s incoming Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, said on Fox News on Dec. 13 that a resolution to the Russia-Ukraine war may be imminent following the January inauguration, ahead of potential peace negotiations. &quot;I truly believe this will be resolved in the next few months,&quot; Kellogg said in an interview on Fox Business. &quot;The only person who can do this is President Donald Trump, and he will do it. They&apos;re tired of killing each other out there. This is time,&quot; Kellogg added. Kellogg, a former national security advisor to Vice President Mike Pence, was nominated to the post in November following Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. presidential election. Kellogg, 80, co-authored a peace plan that would freeze the front line in Ukraine, take NATO&apos;s accession off the table for an extended period, and partially lift sanctions imposed on Russia. According to his proposals, the U.S. will continue sending military aid to Ukraine and provide security guarantees to Kyiv to prevent further Russian aggression. The plan does not stipulate a reduction in the Ukrainian army&apos;s size or recognizing occupied territories as Russian de jure. His proposal would see the U.S. ceasing military aid to Ukraine unless the country agrees to hold peace negotiations with Russia. When asked by Fox News whether Kellogg is planning to visit to either Moscow or Kyiv, Kellogg responded that the incoming administration was &quot;putting together some plans to actually go out and just listen.&quot; Trump, who will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, has repeatedly suggested that he would end the war within 24 hours, but has so far refrained from detailing the specifics of his plan. In September, Trump said that he would negotiate a deal &quot;that&apos;s good for both sides.&quot; While Trump has pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Russia&apos;s war and negotiate a quick peace deal, Ukrainian officials have urged the president-elect to maintain support and adopt a &quot;peace through strength&quot; approach in dealings with Russia President Volodymyr Zelensky recently said that the country must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025, adding that a war would &quot;end faster&quot; under a Trump administration. On Dec. 13, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha echoed comments made by Zelensky stating that he was &quot;convinced that we will get an additional chance, additional opportunities to bring a just peace for Ukraine closer.&quot; The Wall Street Journal reported on Dec. 12, citing undisclosed official sources, that Trump wants European troops to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine.

Ukraine war latest: Russia launches one of the largest aerial attacks on Ukraine's energy grid	Key developments on Dec. 13: Russia launched a large-scale aerial attack against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure early on Dec. 13, firing around 290 missiles and drones across multiple regions. &quot;The enemy continues its terror. Once again, the energy sector across Ukraine is under massive attack,&quot; Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said. Air defense is active in Kyiv Oblast, the regional administration said. Explosions were also reported in the Odesa, Vinnytsia, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Cherkasy oblasts. Russian forces deployed cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missiles, the Air Force reported. Russia launched at least 93 missiles, including those supplied by North Korea, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Eighty-one were shot down, including 11 intercepted by Ukraine&apos;s F-16 fighter jets. Moscow&apos;s forces also deployed close to 200 drones, making it &quot;one of the largest strikes on our energy grid,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;As a result of the mass missile-drone attack, energy facilities in multiple regions were damaged,&quot; the state energy operator Ukrenergo said. Repair works are underway, but the scope of emergency shutdowns will increase, according to the statement. Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast suffered the &quot;most massive attack during the full-scale war,&quot; Governor Svitlana Onyshchuk announced. Cruise missiles and drones struck critical infrastructure facilities in the region, but no casualties were reported at the moment. Six energy facilities were targeted in Lviv Oblast, according to regional authorities. Neighboring Ternopil Oblast was also impacted, the regional military administration said without revealing details. &quot;There are no casualties. Critical infrastructure facilities are operating normally,&quot; the Ternopil Oblast authorities said on Telegram. Earlier in the morning, officials said that half of the region&apos;s residents were without power due to emergency shutdowns. Two people &#x2013; employees of a civilian enterprise &#x2013; were injured in the village of Myrne in Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported initially. The number of injuries later rose to four. Five of Ukraine&apos;s nine operational nuclear reactor units have reduced power output due to the attack, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said. The Polish Air Force scrambled its fighter jets as Russian drones and missiles entered western Ukraine, a usual precaution Warsaw takes during Russian mass strikes. &quot;This is (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&#x2019;s &apos;peace&apos; plan &#x2013; destroying everything. This is how he wants to negotiate, by terrorizing millions of people,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Oil gives Putin enough money to believe in impunity. A strong reaction from the world is needed: a massive strike &#x2013; a massive reaction.&quot; Ukrainian forces are repelling Russian assaults near Uspenivka, Hannivka, Trudove, and Romanivka in Donetsk Oblast and &quot;are taking necessary measures&quot; to prevent encirclement, the Khortytsia group of forces reported on Dec. 13. The statement comes as analysts raise concerns about a growing risk of Ukrainian units being encircled in the area. The DeepState monitoring group reported on Dec. 12 that Russian forces are intensifying their assault on Uspenivka, 43 kilometers (26 miles) from occupied Donetsk. Russia has reportedly gained control of key routes between Uspenivka and Hannivka, threatening to cut off Ukrainian units in what has been dubbed the Uspenivka pocket. The sector lies roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the front-line town of Pokrovsk and 15 kilometers (9 miles) north of occupied Vuhledar. The Khortytsia group cautioned against &quot;emotional interpretations&quot; of the battlefield situation, saying that such reactions could complicate the situation and benefit Russian forces. According to the official statement, the Ukrainian military repelled Russian assaults on the outskirts of settlements. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi has previously described the ongoing Russian offensive as &#x201C;one of the most powerful&#x201D; since the full-scale invasion began. Throughout the autumn, Russian forces have made operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, particularly near Toretsk, Chasiv Yar, and Kupiansk, while advancing on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast. The newly appointed commander of Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces, General Mykhailo Drapatyi, unveiled plans for fundamental reforms in the branch on Dec. 12, aiming to enhance its effectiveness on the battlefield. The proposed changes include a revamped recruitment system with &quot;zero tolerance for corruption,&quot; improved military training tailored to front-line needs, and integration of advanced technology into training and operational processes. The announcement comes amid reports of personnel shortages in Ukraine&apos;s military. Mobilizationefforts have slowed in recent months, leaving front-line units undermanned. Drapatyi emphasized that the Ground Forces should become an &quot;elite&quot; military unit, focusing on personnel, technology, and transparent management. The commander highlighted the importance of reforming training curricula and centers to better prepare soldiers for modern warfare. Social support for service members will also be prioritized under Drapatyi&#x2019;s leadership. The Associated Press reported on Nov. 27 that the U.S. has urged Ukraine to lower its draft age to address these shortages. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller reiterated on Dec. 9 that Washington is prepared to provide additional training and weapons if Kyiv implements this measure. Drapatyi has a distinguished record, including commanding the 58th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade and playing a critical role in the liberation of Mariupol in 2014. President Volodymyr Zelensky, who appointed Drapatyi on Nov. 29, stressed that internal changes in the military are vital to achieving Ukraine&#x2019;s strategic objectives. Russia is considering launching an Oreshnik nuclear-capable intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) once again at Ukraine this weekend, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Dec. 13, citing an unnamed representative of the U.S. National Security Council. Russia launched an Oreshnik missile without a nuclear warhead at the city of Dnipro in Ukraine on Nov. 21. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed the strike was in response to Ukraine&apos;s use of U.S. and British long-range missiles to attack Russian territory. The unnamed official said that Russia wanted to use the weapon to intimidate Ukraine and its supporters, but the Oreshnik &quot;does not change the rules of the game on the battlefield.&quot; &quot;As (Vladimir) Putin has said publicly, Russia intends to launch another experimental Oreshnik missile at Ukraine, and it is possible that Russia could do so in the coming days,&quot; the source told FT. The Oreshnik is likely not a new Russian development but a modification of the RS-26 missile, also known as the Rubezh, Fabian Hoffmann, a defense expert and doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;I think basically they (Russians) just took apart the RS-26 or just cannibalized it and then put together this new missile with a couple of upgrades and a new paint job.&quot; First produced in 2011, and successfully tested in 2012, the Rubezh is a 36,000 kilogram, nuclear-capable, intermediate-range ballistic missile with a known range of 5,800 kilometers.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-launches-one-of-the-largest-aerial-attacks-on-ukraines-energy-grid/	2024-12-13T13:02:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-13_13-06-12-1.jpg
30 years since start of First Chechen War, Kadyrov's Chechnya remains one of the most brutal places on Earth	In December 1994, Russian troops launched a brutal and eventually unsuccessful military campaign against Chechen rebels, effectively beginning the First Chechen War. Thirty years later and two wars since, Chechnya, under strongman Ramzan Kadyrov, has become a key pillar of Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s oppressive regime. After losing the first and winning the second Chechen War, Russia has consolidated its hold over the region, home to 1.5 million people, with the help of Kadyrov&apos;s father, Akhmat, and loyalist forces under his command. The now pro-Kremlin Chechen Republic has become a state within a state, exporting brutality and silencing critics of both Kadyrov&apos;s and Putin&apos;s regimes. The Kadyrov family has been able to successfully muster a private army of what local authorities claim to be 70,000 Chechen fighters loyal to the warlord. Chechen militants and police officers have been abducting, torturing, and murdering activists, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and those suspected of disloyalty to the regime. In exchange for maintaining peace in Chechnya, Kadyrov has been given free rein far beyond the borders of his tiny republic, reportedly carrying out extrajudicial killings in Grozny, Moscow, and Berlin. &quot;The trauma of (the Chechen War) in the early 2000s still looms over the Kremlin like a specter,&quot; Vadim Dubnov, a Caucasus expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The last thing Moscow needs now is instability in the North Caucasus, particularly in Chechnya.&quot; Harold Chambers, a North Caucasus expert at the Jamestown Foundation, agreed, saying that &quot;Putin needs Kadyrov to maintain the status quo in Chechnya.&quot; &quot;Reintegrating Chechnya was and is the cornerstone of Putin&apos;s legitimacy,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. Putin&apos;s decision to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine further tied the survival of Kadyrov&apos;s regime to that of Putin&apos;s and vice versa. Kadyrov and his loyal troops now play a central role in keeping Putin&apos;s regime afloat. &quot;The Kadyrov family&apos;s dominance of (Chechnya&apos;s) ruling structures is only growing. Essentially, Kadyrov has made his family Putin&apos;s only option to rule Chechnya within the current Russian political system,&quot; Chambers said. Kadyrov and his father Akhmat, then Chechnya&apos;s grand mufti, fought against Russia during the First Chechen War from 1994 to 1996. They switched their allegiance to Russia during the Second Chechen War, which lasted from 1999 until 2000, with some skirmishes taking place until 2009. Akhmat Kadyrov became the Russian-installed head of Chechnya in 2000 and was killed in a terrorist attack in 2004. His son, Ramzan, consolidated power by 2007. Kadyrov repeatedly proclaimed his loyalty to the Russian president and called himself &quot;Putin&apos;s foot soldier.&quot; Grozny&apos;s central street and Chechnya&apos;s police academy have been named after Putin. The archival photo shows Chechen leader Akhmad Kadyrov (R) and his son Ramzan standing in front of Ramzan&apos;s house in Tsentoroy, Kadyrov&apos;s native village, some 40 km from Chechen capital Grozny, Chechnya on Jan. 30, 2004.

(Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP via Getty Images)Despite these statements, Kadyrov has turned Chechnya into a semi-independent fiefdom, with Chechen law enforcers fully subordinated to Kadyrov and not to Moscow. Kadyrov claimed in October that he had 70,000 troops at his disposal. Some of Kadyrov&apos;s troops are formally subordinated to the Interior Ministry&apos;s National Guard (Rosgvardiya), and other units are under the Defense Ministry&apos;s jurisdiction. In 2015, however, Kadyrov permitted Chechen law enforcement agencies to fire at federal troops if their actions were not authorized by the Chechen government. &quot;Having forced the (Russian) forces out of Chechnya, (Kadyrov) became, in fact, the head of an independent regime, connected with Putin through a personal union,&quot; Nikolai Petrov, a Russia expert at Chatham House, told the Kyiv Independent. Chambers agreed, saying that &quot;Kadyrov has grown so powerful in part because of his unique status within Russia&apos;s political system.&quot; &quot;He has leveraged this position to gain a degree of autonomy otherwise unseen in Russia,&quot; he added. &quot;The other main explanation for how he became so powerful is his unique relationship with Putin. This relationship extends beyond patronal to something more akin to familial.&quot; Chambers added that &quot;there is a level of trust between (Kadyrov and Putin) that has allowed Kadyrov to overcome all of his colossal failures and violations.&quot; Dubnov said that &quot;within Chechnya, there is only one master.&quot; &quot;(If anyone visits Chechnya), they will deal with Kadyrov, not Putin, and Kadyrov will decide everything there,&quot; he said. &quot;Nothing will happen there if Kadyrov doesn&apos;t want it. In this sense, he is independent &#x2014; but only as long as he maintains stability in Chechnya.&quot; Ryhor Nizhnikau, a Russia expert at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, told the Kyiv Independent that Kadyrov is among the top representatives of the Russian political elite and can be compared to a member of the Soviet politburo, the de facto collective presidency of the USSR. The Chechen government has also received lavish subsidies from the Russian authorities in what analysts see as an effort to buy Kadyrov&apos;s loyalty. This has allowed the Chechen government to launch large-scale construction projects in the republic. &quot;Chechnya remained part of Russia because Kadyrov served Putin, for which Putin paid him,&quot; Russian political analyst Dmitry Oreshkin told the Kyiv Independent. With no serious challenge to his rule, Kadyrov has also expanded his influence beyond Chechnya&apos;s borders. People in several Russian regions who criticized Kadyrov have been forced to publicly apologize to him or face abduction or murder. His business empire also extends beyond Chechnya. In recent months, he has been involved in a dramatic conflict with Dagestani billionaire Suleiman Kerimov over the control of Russia&apos;s largest online retailer, Wildberries. Kadyrov&apos;s men broke into Wildberries&apos; office not far from the Kremlin in Moscow in September and started a shootout that resulted in two people being killed and around 10 being injured. He has also tried to extend his influence abroad, presenting himself as a protector of Muslims worldwide. Kadyrov has lashed out at journalists of the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo who were killed in 2015 by terrorists after ridiculing the prophet Muhammad. In 2017, Kadyrov also organized rallies in support of Myanmar&apos;s Muslim Rohingya people, who were persecuted by the country&apos;s government. Journalists and human rights groups have published a lot of evidence implicating Kadyrov&apos;s regime in murders, torture, kidnappings, and other human rights violations. About a dozen of Kadyrov&apos;s opponents have been killed. Sulim Yamadayev, a Russian officer whose unit clashed with Kadyrov&apos;s forces, was assassinated in the United Arab Emirates in 2009. A local court has convicted two Chechens for the murder, and the United Arab Emirates police believe lawmaker Adam Delimkhanov, Kadyrov&apos;s closest associate, to be the organizer of the crime. Another assassination of a Kadyrov critic, Chechen militant Umar Israilov, took place in Austria in 2009. Several Chechens have been found guilty by an Austrian court for the murder, and Austrian police believe it was ordered by Kadyrov.

(Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images)The most high-profile murder in which Kadyrov could be implicated occurred in 2015, when Russian liberal politician Boris Nemtsov, a major critic of both Kadyrov and Putin, was shot dead near the Kremlin in Moscow. A Russian court has convicted Zaur Dadayev, an ex-top commander of Kadyrov&apos;s Sever (North) police battalion, and several other Chechens for Nemstov&apos;s murder. Kadyrov&apos;s regime has also cracked down on Chechnya&apos;s LGBTQ+ community. In 2017, dozens of men were arrested and tortured in Chechnya on suspicion of being homosexual, and at least three were killed, according to the independent Russian publication Novaya Gazeta and Human Rights Watch. Kadyrov has actively supported Russia&apos;s aggression against Ukraine, becoming one of the loudest pro-war figures following the launch of the all-out invasion in 2022. Kadyrov&apos;s fighters, most of whom are formally part of Russia&apos;s National Guard, have participated in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine since February 2022. They have been involved in war crimes on Ukrainian territory, according to the Slidstvo.info investigative journalism project. Kadyrov&apos;s fighters have published a number of staged combat videos from Ukraine on TikTok and other social platforms, gaining the nickname &quot;TikTok forces.&quot; According to the Conflict Intelligence Team, an open-source intelligence outfit, Kadyrov&apos;s fighters have mostly engaged in staged operations, and there is little evidence of their effectiveness in combat. This triggered speculation that Kadyrov was reluctant to send his troops to war, since he would need a significant force to preserve his power in Chechnya. He has routinely issued flamboyant threats against Ukraine and its allies during the full-scale invasion. Kadyrov threatened to attack Poland in May 2022 unless it stopped arms supplies to Ukraine. In July 2022, he boasted that his fighters were ready to &quot;go forward and easily take over Kyiv and NATO countries.&quot; Chechen dictator Ramzan Kadyrov poses with a Tesla Cybertruck, mounted with a machine gun, in a video posted on Aug. 17, 2024. (Ramzan Kadyrov/Telegram)After Ukrainian forces liberated the town of Lyman in Donetsk Oblast in September 2022, Kadyrov called for using tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine to improve the military situation. In early December, Kadyrov threatened to use Ukrainian prisoners of war as a human shield against Kyiv&apos;s drone attacks on the region. He publicly toured his region in a seized Ukrainian Bradley armored fighting vehicle, showed off Ukrainian POWs, and suggested that one of them commit suicide. Yet, despite his bravado and constant calls to destroy Ukraine, Kadyrov refused to implement Putin&apos;s mobilization of conscripts in Chechnya when the move was announced in September 2022. Kadyrov&apos;s troops had also fought in Syria on the side of Russian-backed dictator Bashar al-Assad, whose regime collapsed on Dec. 8. &quot;Any parallel army with a separate commander is also a potential threat to Putin, more so when he appears weak, as he currently does, with his army so overstretched in Ukraine that he could not support his ally Assad and now faces the potential loss of his military bases in Syria,&quot; Samantha de Bendern, a Russia expert at Chatham House, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Putin will need Kadyrov more than ever for his shadow diplomacy in the Middle East, although the Chechen leader could be a liability in Syria as his forces fought on the side of the deposed regime.&quot; She added that &quot;Kadyrov&apos;s foreign policy advisor, Ziyad Sabsabi, spent many years studying in Damascus, and he could be a useful conduit for Putin&apos;s discussions with the new government if he wants to keep a foothold in the country and keep some sort of presence on his bases.&quot; &quot;The swift victory of (Islamist group Tahrir al-Sham) in Syria has the potential to inspire a myriad of anti-regime movements all over Russia, especially in the republics where there is a strong Muslim presence,&quot; de Bendern said. &quot;In this context, Kadyrov&apos;s iron grip on Chechnya will be all the more important to Putin.&quot; So far, there is little indication of any serious threat to Kadyrov&apos;s authority inside Chechnya. One of the Islamist insurgent groups in the North Caucasus, the Caucasus Emirate, was dissolved in 2016. Another one, the Caucasus Province of the Islamic State, has kept a low profile since its last leader was killed in 2021. &quot;Insurgents are not currently a real threat to Kadyrov&apos;s power,&quot; Chambers said. &quot;There have been around ten shootouts or attacks in Chechnya since 2020, with most of them occurring in 2020 or 2021. Most of the attacks have been isolated, with the militants killed or captured.&quot; Petrov agreed, saying that &quot;the main threat to Kadyrov&apos;s power is not so much the Islamists, but the numerous representatives of the clans he suppressed within Chechnya.&quot; Dubnov said that &quot;in Chechnya, Kadyrov&apos;s main capital is his monopoly on communication with Moscow.&quot; Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin talks to head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov following his meeting with Emirati counterpart at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia on Oct. 21, 2024. (Artem Geodakyan / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;If he loses this, he will become less attractive to the local elites and less formidable to the population,&quot; he said. &quot;Kadyrov has many enemies, even within Chechnya itself, because it&apos;s a society that does not forget blood feuds. For now, the situation is frozen, but if it unfreezes, I don&apos;t think Kadyrov will survive for very long.&quot; But it also works the other way around. It is not clear what Kadyrov will do if Putin&apos;s regime faces a serious crisis. &quot;As the balance of power shifts, maintaining control over the firebrand Kadyrov will be more important than ever for Putin,&quot; de Bendern said. &quot;Could Kadyrov turn into Putin&apos;s Frankenstein, the monster who turns on its creator? While there is no prospect of Kadyrov taking over the Russian presidency, he could become a significant destabilizer in a fragilized Russia should Putin&apos;s rule look under threat.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/30-years-since-start-of-first-chechen-war-kadyrovs-chechnya-remains-one-of-most-brutal-places-on-earth/	2024-12-13T12:19:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2154362075.jpg
Zelensky to meet with EU, NATO leaders in Brussels on Dec. 19	President Volodymyr Zelensky will visit Brussels on Dec. 19 to meet with European Union and NATO leaders, an undisclosed source from the president&apos;s team told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 13. Brussels will host a two-day European Summit in the EU Council buildings on Dec. 18-19. Following a phone call with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Dec. 11, Zelensky announced a personal meeting with him &quot;next week in Brussels.&quot; During his visit, Zelensky will meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to discuss support for Ukraine in the war against Russia. The president will also meet with the leaders of the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Poland, according to Reuters. &quot;It won&apos;t be a meeting that has concrete decisions, but more political to discuss the coming weeks and months,&quot; said a source familiar with the meeting told Reuters. Ukrainian officials stressed earlier that NATO membership is the only path toward a just and lasting peace. While acknowledging that the country cannot become a full member amid the full-scale war, Kyiv asked the allies to at least extend an invitation now as a clear signal of support. NATO previously said that Ukraine is on an &quot;irreversible&quot; path toward membership, but its members have failed to reach a consensus on an invitation. The U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia are reportedly among the main opponents of the step.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-meet-with-eu-nato-leaders-in-brussels-on-dec-19/	2024-12-13T12:15:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188161946.jpg
Former prosecutor general reportedly appointed Ukraine's ambassador to Netherlands	Former Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin has been appointed as Ukraine&apos;s ambassador to the Netherlands, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said on his Telegram on Dec. 13. Several Ukrainian media outlets, including Suspilne, also reported that Kostin had been appointed as ambassador to the Netherlands. Meanwhile, it is still unknown who will replace Kostin as prosecutor general. &quot;As for the post of prosecutor general, the decision on Kostin&apos;s successor has not yet been made, but is being prepared,&quot; a source in the president&apos;s team told Suspilne. Kostin submitted his resignation on Oct. 22 following a National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) meeting headed by President Volodymyr Zelensky. The session addressed the &quot;immoral situation&quot; surrounding the fake disabilities of prosecutors, and &quot;many shameful facts of abuse&quot; were revealed, according to Kostin. Following the meeting, Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) head Vasyl Maliuk said that his agency had exposed corruption schemes at medical examination commissions, resulting in the cancellation of 4,106 fake disability status certificates. Maliuk added that 64 officials at medical examination commissions had been charged with crimes, while another nine suspects had been convicted. Medical examination commissions (MSEK) are bodies tasked with determining the severity of a disability. Corruption schemes at medical examination commissions linked to draft evasion have been reported in Rivne, Mykolaiv, Khmelnytskyi, and Kharkiv oblasts. Kostin had served as prosecutor general since July 28, 2022, replacing Iryna Venediktova. Prior to that, he was a member of parliament from 2019 to 2022 and headed the legal policy committee. From 2012 to 2019, Kostin was a deputy chairman of the Odesa Oblast Bar Association. He has been a member of the International Bar Association since 2000.	https://kyivindependent.com/former-prosecutor-general-appointed-ukraines-ambassador-to-netherlands-lawmaker-says/	2024-12-13T10:53:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/kostin.jpeg
Russia mulls attacking Ukraine with Oreshnik nuclear-capable missile this weekend, FT reports	Russia is considering launching an Oreshnik nuclear-capable intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) once again at Ukraine this weekend, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Dec. 13, citing an unnamed representative of the U.S. National Security Council.

The West is pushing Ukraine toward concessions that will backfire	French President Emmanuel Macron and Polish Premier Donald Tusk met on Dec. 12 in Warsaw. High on the agenda was how to support Ukraine in the &#x201C;new Transatlantic context.&#x201D; On the sidelines of the visit, the &#xC9;lys&#xE9;e emphasized that &#x201C;France&#x2019;s position is that it is necessary to support Ukraine for as long and as intensely as necessary for it to approach negotiations from a position of strength when the time comes.&#x201D; The two leaders also discussed the possibility of a European peacekeeping force in Ukraine &#x2014; boots on the ground &#x2014; in the event of a ceasefire. However, Tusk insisted during his press conference that &#x201C;no such actions are foreseen at the moment.&#x201D; At the same time Macron and Tusk were addressing these issues, NATO&#x2019;s new Secretary General Mark Rutte delivered his first major speech. Speaking about Russia, he warned that &#x201C;danger is moving toward us at great speed&#x201D; and that European allies are unprepared to deal with the threat. In 2023, only 23 of 32 NATO allies reached the agreed-upon 2% GDP defense spending target &#x2014; a figure that is insufficient to ensure the safety of the Transatlantic space. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte looks on as he answers journalists&apos; questions during a NATO Foreign Ministers&apos; meeting at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, on Dec. 3, 2024. (John Thys / AFP via Getty Images)So, is this newfound European resolve good news for Ukraine? It could be, but there are significant dangers lurking behind the rhetoric. The most obvious message is that the buzzword of the moment is &#x201C;negotiations.&#x201D; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged that some form of temporary territorial concessions may be necessary in exchange for what he calls ironclad security guarantees. The message from Warsaw is that the well-worn phrase &#x201C;as long as it takes&#x201D; now has a clear end goal: negotiating from a position of strength. This new rhetoric reflects a growing sense that under a future Trump administration, the U.S. might withdraw some or all of its military aid unless Ukraine agrees to negotiate with Russia. The European Union cannot replace U.S. military aid without doubling its current support for Ukraine. The EU lacks the capacity to do so, and as Rutte emphasized in his speech, massive increases in defense spending and production capacity will be required to meet Europe&#x2019;s own needs in the face of growing threats&#x2014;not only from Russia but also from China and the increasingly volatile Middle East. A bad peace for Ukraine would only exacerbate European insecurity. Rutte is also correct to highlight the need for increased European defense spending and domestic production. Spending on non-European production could hinder the continent&#x2019;s ability to respond to direct threats, such as Russia continuing to menace Ukraine. Delays in France and the U.K. approving the use of Storm Shadow/SCALP missiles for strikes inside Russian territory stemmed from these missiles&#x2019; partial dependence on U.S. technology, which led to U.S. hesitation over potential Russian retaliation. Future European defense spending risks similar vetoes, underscoring the importance of prioritizing homegrown solutions. Rutte&#x2019;s speech emphasized the need for innovation and technology, calling on governments to invest and industry to take risks. His remarks echo former Ukrainian Chief of Staff Valerii Zaluzhnyi&#x2019;s article in The Economist in November 2023. A win-win solution for Europe and Ukraine would involve European companies investing in Ukraine&#x2019;s growing defense industry. However, such investments will require government-backed or private insurance, and without robust security guarantees for Ukraine, only the bravest will take the plunge. Which brings us to the thorniest question: What security guarantees for Ukraine would be worth more than the paper they are written on? Zelensky is adamant that nothing less than NATO membership will suffice for Ukraine. He is correct. The Budapest Memorandum demonstrated that in the nuclear age, bilateral or multilateral security guarantees without a nuclear umbrella are meaningless when facing a nuclear-armed adversary. Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s nuclear blackmail has shown that nuclear deterrence works. While his arsenal has not deterred Ukraine from striking inside Russian territory or even from sending forces into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, it has deterred Ukraine&#x2019;s allies from providing the support Ukraine truly needs to expel Russian forces. There is little reason to believe this dynamic would change in the future. Ukrainian soldiers walk in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Sudzha, Kursk Oblast, Russia, on Aug. 18, 2024. (Ed Ram/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)NATO membership for Ukraine is unlikely in any realistic short-term scenario, primarily because too many member states &#x2014; starting with the U.S. &#x2014; oppose it. Under a Trump administration, it is highly improbable that the U.S. would extend its nuclear umbrella to Ukraine as it does for South Korea and Japan. Discussions about any shared dimension of the U.K.&#x2019;s nuclear deterrent are nonexistent. France&#x2019;s nuclear deterrence is limited to its own vital interests, and debates &#x2014; dating back to French General Charles de Gaulle &#x2014; continue over whether those interests extend beyond France&#x2019;s borders. While Macron has revived these discussions, France&#x2019;s political turmoil makes any significant changes to its nuclear doctrine highly unlikely in the near term. If Ukraine were to pursue nuclear capabilities, it could only do so outside the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), fundamentally rewriting the world&#x2019;s nuclear rulebook. Such a move would likely make the world even more dangerous. At a recent conference at Chatham House in London, veteran Russia expert Keir Giles, author of &#x201C;Who Will Defend Europe?&#x201D;, offered a simple answer when asked what could secure Ukraine: the strategic defeat and deterrence of Russia. Which brings us back to negotiations. Any deal that fails to deter Russia from attacking its neighbors again will collapse, as previous agreements with Russia always have. Albert Einstein, often credited as the father of the nuclear bomb, is alleged to have said, &#x201C;The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.&#x201D; Let&#x2019;s hope that those entering the seemingly inevitable negotiations with the world&#x2019;s chief nuclear blackmailer keep those words in mind &#x2014; and that they stop setting red lines where the only red is the blood of those who have died because of them.

The collapse of Assad’s regime shows the limits of Russian airpower	After a decade-long civil war, Bashar al-Assad was firmly ensconced in Damascus &#x2014; a far cry from the summer of 2012 and again in 2015, when policymakers, analysts, and pundits alike believed his rule was on the brink of collapse. The intervention of the Russian Air Force in the fall of 2015 saved the al-Assad regime. Yet, its sudden collapse on Dec. 7 highlights a key lesson: airpower can achieve tactical victories but not long-term strategic ones. This offers a glimmer of hope for Ukraine. Al-Assad lost because he couldn&#x2019;t survive sanctions, and Russia&#x2019;s bombing didn&#x2019;t break the people&#x2019;s resistance &#x2014; two lessons with direct implications for Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine. Since the Arab uprisings of 2011, Syria has been the only case of a Soviet/Russian-provided military arsenal &#x2014; originally designed to achieve strategic parity with Israel &#x2014; being turned on its own population. Yet, by 2015, the Syrian government was at its weakest, unable to break a stalemate. The state had secured the north-south axis from the capital along its coastal spine, while the Kurds consolidated control over their territory. However, Aleppo was outside government control, and ISIS was on the offensive. In May 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry visited Russia to restart negotiations. The stalemate of 2015 had set in, and this would have been the most opportune moment for the Syrian state to feel pressure to pursue a negotiated political resolution. But instead, Russia&#x2019;s decision to intervene in fall 2015 ensured that al-Assad would not negotiate from a position of weakness. The Russian intervention was not about supporting al-Assad out of devotion to Syria&#x2019;s president per se, but about dictating the outcome of a negotiated endgame, including a politically expedient way for al-Assad to step down on Russia&#x2019;s terms. The Russian air deployment was relatively small, consisting of just 28 aircraft and 20 helicopters. Yet, as Russia scholar Mark Galeotti noted, &#x201C;Just by starting their Syrian operation, they essentially derailed large parts of U.S. foreign policy with about 30 aircraft.&#x201D; The Russian force mainly included 12 Su-24s, 12 Su-25s, and 4 Su-34s, as well as six Mi-24 Hind helicopters, all designed for air-to-ground combat. Some aircraft, like the Su-34, were newer models not in the Syrian inventory, illustrating another Russian goal: using Syria as a training ground for its revamped military. Russia also tested its first stealth fighter, the Su-57, in combat over Syria in February 2018. Additionally, from fall 2015 to summer 2016, Russia tested long-range Kalibr cruise missiles over Syria, ostensibly against ISIS targets. Deploying the previously mentioned Russian aircraft stationed in Syria would have been more effective and accurate in targeting ISIS, not to mention cheaper than using costly cruise missiles. However, for Russian President Vladimir Putin, an air raid would not deliver the same political message. The range of the cruise missiles demonstrated to the U.S. and NATO Russia&#x2019;s advances in military technology, which were more about Moscow&#x2019;s tensions with the U.S. and NATO&#x2019;s presence in the Baltics than about Syria. The strategy of the Syrian state up to 2015 &#x2014; and the Russian Air Force post-2015 &#x2014; was to saturate insurgents with firepower from a distance, even if it meant risking air assets to deploy indiscriminate bombing campaigns to terrorize civilian populations in insurgent-held areas (such as with barrel bombs). However, the state lacked enough forces to garrison troops in every insurgent area to hold those regions, hence the need for the creation of the National Defense Forces and the importation of fighters from Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. While Russia deployed technical crews to maintain its aircraft, most of its ground forces came from mercenaries employed by Evro Polis, a company often associated with the Wagner Group.

(Izettin Kasim/Anadolu via Getty Images)It was at this juncture &#x2014; when Damascus was mired in a hurting stalemate &#x2014; that the intervention of Russia&#x2019;s Air Force and renewed Iranian commitment allowed the state to eventually recapture lost territory, including Aleppo in December 2016 and many, though not all, remaining insurgent enclaves by 2022. This was enough to determine victory for al-Assad. It also explains the Russian hubris in believing its 2022 assault on Kyiv would be swift and decisive. Russia&#x2019;s air force intervention was a decisive factor in turning the momentum back to the Syrian state, culminating in al-Assad&#x2019;s victory in Aleppo. By 2022, after a decade of civil war, the Syrian state &#x2014; thanks to its allies &#x2014; had essentially achieved a military victory, though its hold on certain territories remains tenuous. As of early 2022, the state controlled 75% of the country&#x2019;s territory, including most urban centers along the north-south spine, while the eastern oil fields remained under the control of the U.S. and Kurdish allies. This is the first lesson: with no access to oil and sanctions imposed on Syria, al-Assad didn&#x2019;t realize how much the people were hurting economically and how indifferent they were to his regime&#x2019;s survival. The second lesson comes from the Blitz of London during World War II. Malcolm Gladwell, in &#x201C;The Bomber Mafia,&#x201D; writes, &#x201C;It turns out that people were a lot tougher and more resilient than anyone expected. And it also turns out that maybe if you bomb another country day in and day out it doesn&#x2019;t make the people you&#x2019;re bombing give up and lose faith.&#x201D; Gladwell concludes, &#x201C;More than a million buildings were damaged or destroyed. And it didn&#x2019;t work!&#x201D; The Blitz did not break the morale of the British people, nor did it break the morale of the Syrians, and it won&#x2019;t break the morale of Ukrainians.

Belarus Weekly: Putin, Lukashenko sign security treaty, promise Oreshnik deployment in Belarus	Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko sign a security pact, announcing the potential deployment of Russian Oreshnik missiles in Belarus. Lukashenko frees 29 more political prisoners amid an ongoing pre-election civil society clampdown. Exiled Belarusian activists to face a record 17 in absentia charges for aiding opponents of Lukashenko&apos;s regime. The chief editor of the dissolved Belarusian news agency BelaPAN was released after serving full term in prison. UNESCO adds Belarusian Vytsinanka paper-cutting art to its Intangible Cultural Heritage List. Russian President Vladimir Putin and longtime Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko signed a new security treaty on Dec. 6, announcing the potential deployment of Russian Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBM) in Belarus. The signing of the treaty comes shortly after Russia introduced updates to its nuclear doctrine, expanding Moscow&#x2019;s nuclear umbrella over Belarus and lowering the threshold for Russian nuclear retaliation against non-nuclear threats. Putin went to Minsk on Dec. 6 for a meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Union State, a Moscow-dominated supra-national grouping of Russia and Belarus that Lukashenko has used to obtain economic support for his regime in exchange for political loyalty. While the text of the signed treaty was not released, Putin said it outlined mutual obligations to ensure the defense and territorial integrity of Russia and Belarus &#x201C;with the use of all available forces and means,&#x201D; including nuclear capabilities, Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported. &#xA0; &#x201C;This treaty will reliably protect the security of Russia and Belarus,&#x201D; RIA Novosti quoted Putin as saying. During the signing ceremony for the new agreements, Lukashenko asked Putin to deploy Oreshnik ballistic missiles, a new weapon recently used against Ukraine, in Belarus. &#x201C;Do not take this as some kind of audacity, but I want to publicly ask you to deploy new weapons systems, especially the Oreshnik, on Belarusian territory,&#x201D; Lukashenko said. Putin in turn said the deployment of Oreshnik missiles would be &#x201C;possible&#x201D; by the second half of 2025. Oreshnik, Russia&#x2019;s new intermediate-range ballistic missile, was first used against the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Nov. 21, after Kyiv&#x2019;s first successful use of U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles on a military target in Russia. Lukashenko said that Belarus would build its own launchers for Oreshnik missiles, and also reiterated his claims that Belarus already hosts Russian tactical nuclear weapons. &#x201C;I have brought nuclear warheads here, and not just a single dozen of them,&#x201D; Lukashenko said during the meeting with Belarusian workers on Dec. 10. Since Moscow and Minsk signed an agreement on transferring Russian nuclear warheads to Belarus in May 2023, both sides have repeatedly claimed the transfer was made, but have never substantiated their claims. U.S. think tank the Institute for the Study of War considers the treaty and potential deployment of Oreshnik missiles to be part of Russia&#x2019;s &#x201C;strategic effort to de facto annex Belarus.&#x201D; It would &#x201C;further increase Russia&#x2019;s military footprint in Belarus,&#x201D; the ISW report reads. Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya condemned the new pact: &#x201C;Putin&#x2019;s visit to Minsk is not about security &#x2014; it&#x2019;s about tightening Russia&#x2019;s grip on our country,&#x201D; Tsikhanouskaya wrote on X, formerly Twitter. The opposition group BelPol claimed the treaty might allow Moscow to place new military bases and deploy troops in Belarus. It would also provide the possibility of sending Belarusian citizens to war with Ukraine &#x201C;to protect the territorial integrity of Russia,&#x201D; the group&#x2019;s representative Matsvey Kupreichyk alleged during a U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe hearing on Dec. 5. Among other documents, Putin and Lukashenko signed a decree on uniform rules on consumer rights protection, a resolution on the cancellation of cell phone roaming charges, and an agreement on a common electrical energy market. The Union State agreement, signed 25 years ago, envisaged the integration of Russia and Belarus to the point of a shared currency, parliament, and border agreement. But as Lukashenko lost hope of eventually becoming the leader of the Union State, he managed for decades to wander off the integration roadmaps &#x2014; until he needed the Kremlin&#x2019;s backing against a popular uprising in Belarus prompted by his regime&#x2019;s rigging of the 2020 presidential elections. In 2021, a number of Union State integration roadmaps were finally signed, sparking concerns over Belarus&#x2019;s sovereignty. Furthermore, Lukashenko welcomed Russian tactical nuclear weapons and turned Belarusian territory into a jumping off point for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Lukashenko has &#x201C;pardoned&#x201D; 29 more prisoners convicted of &#x201C;extremist crimes,&#x201D; his press office reported on Dec. 9. This seventh wave of pardons brings the total number of political prisoners released since July 2024 to 207 individuals, while another 220 individuals were newly recognized as such, according to the Viasna Human Rights Center. &#xA0; An official statement from Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime says that 11 women and 18 men were among the released, without specifying their names. Reportedly, 15 of them have chronic diseases, two are with disabilities, and three are elderly. All of the pardoned prisoners &#x201C;repented&#x201D; and pleaded for pardons, the press office said, noting that pardoned Belarusians are still monitored by the Internal Affairs Ministry. Human rights groups currently recognize 1,283 individuals in Belarus as political prisoners. Most were jailed after the contested 2020 presidential elections in Belarus sparked nationwide public protests, and the authorities launched an unprecedented crackdown on civil society. Despite the number of political prisoners remaining roughly the same, the Belarusian authorities have not eased their repression of the country&#x2019;s civil society. At least 1,302 political prisoners have served their term in full and were removed from the count. The total number of former political prisoners, some of whom escaped prosecution, reached 2,392 in November 2024. The Belarusian service of U.S. government-backed broadcaster RFE/RL reported that at least one &#x201C;pardoned&#x201D; prisoner had been arrested again. Other cases of repeated arrests have been observed among those who had served their sentences and been released, the outlet reports. Arbitrary repression of political opponents has intensified in Belarus in the run-up to the 2025 presidential elections, the Viasna says. In late October, the Lukashenko regime unleashed a series of countrywide raids targeting former political prisoners and relatives of those arrested as part of an intimidation campaign. The Belarusian Investigative Committee has launched an in absentia probe into the exiled founders of two biggest Belarusian solidarity initiatives, BySol and By help, which provide aid to victims of Belarus&#x2019;s repressive authorities. The committee&#x2019;s press office reported on Dec. 5 that investigations had been opened into Andrey Stryzhak and Aliaksei Lyavonchyk, who co-founded the Belarus Solidarity Foundation BySol and By help in response to the ruling regime&#x2019;s brutal crackdown on civil society in Belarus. The two organizations have raised and distributed millions of dollars to those who have suffered torture, been subjected to politically motivated persecution, or who had to flee the country in fear of persecution. In 2021, the Belarusian Internal Affairs Ministry designated the two initiatives as &#x201C;extremist&#x201D; and prohibited their work within the country. The human rights activists are being probed under 17 charges each, which is the largest number of charges pressed on defendants in absentia so far. The investigation brought up charges of creating and financing extremist formations, insulting Belarusian dictator Lukashenko, inciting racial, national, or religious hatred, and propagandizing terrorism. Citing calculations by Viasna attorney Pavel Sapelka, Stryzhak claimed that the total sentence handed down to him by the Belarusian courts might reach 128 years of imprisonment. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s nice when even your enemies acknowledge the importance of what you do,&#x201D; Stryzhak commented ironically. Lukashenko introduced in absentia prosecution in 2022 as a repressive tool to target his exiled opponents. By November 2024, some 112 opposition figures had been given prison sentences after absentia trials, Viasna reports. Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya was sentenced in absentia to 15 years in prison; her advisors Aliaksandr Dabravolski and Franak Viachorka received 11.5 and 20-year prison terms respectively. Aside from virtual prison terms, an absentia sentence typically comes with a fine, providing for the arrest of the convict&#x2019;s property &#x2014; which is later auctioned to pay the penalty. Iryna Leushyna, the director and chief editor of BelaPAN &#x2014; formerly the largest independent news agency in Belarus, which the country&#x2019;s authorities had declared &#x201C;extremist&#x201D; and dissolved in 2021, was released from prison on Dec. 7 after serving her sentence in full. &#xA0; Leushyna was arrested on Aug. 18, 2021, along with her colleague, former director Dzmitry Navazhylau, amid the crackdown on independent journalism in Belarus that wiped the media field over the past four years. Leushyna was sentenced to four years of imprisonment over the alleged &#x201C;creation of an extremist formation.&#x201D; The charge was applied retroactively, as the agency had been slapped with an &#x201C;extremist&#x201D; label in November, almost three months after the arrest of its leadership. Navazhylau received six years of imprisonment with additional charges of tax evasion. Media management consultant Andrei Aliaksandrau and his wife, entrepreneur Iryna Zlobina, accused in the same case and also with additional charges, received 14 and nine years of imprisonment respectively. In her final statement at her trial, Leushyna described the sentence as &#x201C;utter delirium.&#x201D; &#x201C;(Somebody) clearly confused the cause-and-effect relationship by deciding to make journalists responsible for events in our country in 2020,&#x201D; Leushyna said. Human rights watchdog Viasna has changed Leushyna&#x2019;s status to &#x201C;former political prisoner,&#x201D; marking her release. Leushyna confirmed her release in a post on Facebook but refused to comment further. &#x201C;I plan to stay in Belarus, so, naturally, no comments are possible,&#x201D; she wrote. As the majority of the independent Belarusian media are designated extremist by the Lukashenko regime, giving interviews to them can make one liable for criminal prosecution. Earlier, activist Darya Losik was sentenced to two years in prison for giving an interview to the Belarusian service of U.S. broadcaster RFE/RL. Leushyna is now one of 1,302 political prisoners who have been released after serving their arbitrary punishment in full since the 2020 presidential election. The rigged poll prompted massive public unrest in Belarus. With 38 media workers in prison, Belarus remains ranked 167th out of 180 countries in the Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index. The independent Belarusian Association of Journalists reports that 450-500 media professionals have been forced to flee the country. &#xA0; The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has added Belarusian Vytsinanka, the traditional art of cutting out paper decorations, to its list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, the organization announced on Dec. 4. The UNESCO&#x2019;s Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage opened its 19th session in Paraguay on Dec. 2, adding Vytsinanka to the previous three entries accredited to Belarus on the list. The art of Vytsinanka has been recorded in Belarus since the 16th century, with the advent of paper production. Initially used to decorate church interiors and seal noble families&#x2019; correspondence, it gained prominence in the late 19th century as an affordable home decoration for the biggest holidays &#x2014; Christmas and Easter. The works are typically symmetrical or radial compositions featuring mythological motifs, traditional ornaments, and scenes from daily life. The 19th UNESCO Committee session also added Pysanky, the art of Easter egg decoration, an internationally recognized symbol of Ukrainian culture, to its list.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-putin-lukashenko-sign-security-treaty-promise-oreshnik-deployment-in-belarus/	2024-12-13T08:52:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187908499.jpg
Russia advances toward Pokrovsk, Kurakhove, Ukraine makes progress near Kupiansk, Estonian intelligence says	Russian troops continue to advance toward Pokrovsk and Kurakhove in Donetsk Oblast, while Ukrainian forces have made gains near Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast, the Estonian public broadcaster ERR reported on Dec. 13, citing the Estonian Defense Forces Intelligence Center. Russian troops control the village of Shevchenko, four kilometers (two miles) west of Pokrovsk, Estonian intelligence reported, citing open-source intelligence. Ukrainian troops have been repelling Russian attacks along the Sukhi Yaly River to the south of Kurakhove for a week, the report read. In the meantime, Russia sought to encircle the area from the north and south. According to Estonian intelligence, Russia is incurring significant losses in this area. Over the past two weeks, about 3,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. These numbers are likely to continue to rise as Russian forces approach Pokrovsk. The unfavorable weather conditions are playing into the hands of the Ukrainian forces. At the same time, Russian aviation and heavy equipment are hampered, which is why Russia cannot use its full combat potential, according to the report. Russia has failed to achieve an operational breakthrough and is therefore increasing pressure on the Ukrainian army in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, according to Estonian intelligence. The Ukrainian defense is under much less pressure in other areas of the front. Ukrainian forces are enjoying success in the Kupiansk sector, where two Russian bridgeheads that emerged during the crossing of the Oskil River were destroyed, Estonian intelligence said. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi announced on Nov. 29 that Ukrainian forces stationed near the embattled towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove would be supplied with additional reserves, ammunition, weapons, and military equipment. Ukraine also faces the prospect of decreased U.S. military aid under incoming President Donald Trump. Outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden has pledged to speed up materiel deliveries before Trump takes office. The Pentagon on Dec. 7 announced a new weapons package for Ukraine worth nearly $1 billion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-advances-toward-pokrovsk-kurakhove-ukraine-makes-progress-on-kupiansk-direction-estonian-intelligence-says/	2024-12-13T08:36:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2174987136-1.jpg
Breakaway churches, spiritual awakenings, prayers in captivity. How war is changing Ukraine’s faith	For a decade, the world has seen how Russia has scarred Ukraine&#x2019;s landscape with tens of thousands of bombs and missiles. The spiritual wounds &#x2014; and awakenings &#x2014; experienced by millions of Ukrainians are less visible. Almost a third of Ukrainians say their religious faith has grown since the war broke out, according to a survey conducted last year by the Razumkov Center, a public policy think tank based in Kyiv. Others say their belief has never been more tested. To better understand how the Russian invasion has changed Ukrainians&#x2019; relationship with their faith, the Kyiv Independent spoke with dozens of Ukrainians from various regions and creeds. Among them are a Greek-Catholic Chaplain performs who confessions at the frontlines; an Orthodox woman who was branded a &#x201C;traitor&#x201D; by her pro-Russian priest for renouncing the Moscow church; and a Muslim Mufti who put on a uniform to &#x201C;practice what he preaches.&#x201D; Here are six stories of faith, questioning, and transformation. Editor&#x2019;s Note: These first-person narratives have been adapted from transcripts of interviews by the Kyiv Independent. They have been edited for length and clarity and translated into English from Ukrainian, but all of the words are from those we interviewed. Yaroslav Buno grew up in a Greek Catholic household in western Ukraine, where Christianity has traditionally been stronger than in the east. Inspired by his local priest&#x2019;s work with youth, he entered seminary school at age 17. When the full-scale invasion began, his village&#x2019;s church welcomed refugees from the east and started collecting military aid. Though priests have been embedded with units since 2014, Ukraine created the chaplaincy service as an official division of the military in 2023. After volunteer visits to the frontline, Buno joined a military unit as a chaplain in April of this year. It was the funerals. The funerals of our boys. I still see their mothers. Everything changed for me, my system of values changed. The more I saw the consequences of the war, the more I wanted to do more. I realized I had to be in the east, at the front. I couldn&#x2019;t just sit home and watch. I called my wife and said, I want to become a military chaplain. God was calling. I had to get the commander&#x2019;s consent, take an oath, and then it was official. When I went to the front for the first time, I was afraid. It&#x2019;s war, after all. Yaroslav Buno, 39, in Lviv Oblast, Ukraine on Sep. 27, 2024. (Chris Jones / The Kyiv Independent)But I was also afraid because it was a new ministry for me. They weren&#x2019;t my parishioners back in the village. They&#x2019;re soldiers who have lived and seen a lot, who have wounds of war, their own ethical codes. I&#x2019;d never been in such an environment. I asked my commanders what I should do. They didn&#x2019;t know either. Another priest told me, Don&apos;t be afraid, be yourself. Talk about God&apos;s word. Do what you have always done. I&#x2019;m not a robot. Every day I experience disappointment, fear, doubt. This is inherent in every person. And a priest is not immune either. What matters is how you handle it. I remind myself of what Christ lived through. How Christ suffered. How he got up when he couldn&#x2019;t go on. His example gives me solace. I remember the first time I was with the soldiers. Spring of this year. They laughed a little bit when I ducked from the explosions. For them it was so normal, familiar. But, as they say, everyone gets used to it. I celebrated the liturgy. Later some of the guys thanked me. I said I hadn&apos;t done anything. They said, For being here. Even my presence could be some kind of support. I became even more convinced that a priest should be with soldiers at the front. The Greek Catholic church has been closely intertwined with liberation in the history of the Ukrainian people. When families gather for holidays, there are songs dedicated to those events. In every village and parish, there are symbolic graves dedicated to the liberation movement. National memory, patriotic education, and religious education go hand in hand. In the chaplaincy ministry, there are priests and monks who were imprisoned, exiled to Siberia (during Soviet times), and so on for their pro-Ukrainian views. I try to hold services for all major Christian holidays. It&apos;s not easy, because the unit is often scattered over different territories. And we try not to make a crowd. All is done secretly. The chaplain&#x2019;s task isn&#x2019;t just religious rites. Every chaplain is a psychologist. He listens, tries to be a friend, shows compassion. Not everyone is ready to talk about God. Guys just want to relieve stress with a simple conversation. To joke, talk about the weather, everyday life, delicious food. Of course, part of what falls to the priest is confessions. The most intimate conversation the guys have. To kill a person, even in war, is not good. But the enemy who comes to our land has made a choice.

(Chris Jones / The Kyiv Independent)People participate in the religious walk in Zarvanytsia, Lviv Oblast, Ukraine on Sep. 27, 2024. (Chris Jones / The Kyiv Independent)What our guys are doing is not a sin or immoral. They realize that if they don&#x2019;t stop the enemy in the east, he&#x2019;ll be in the west, in the center, in the north, and in the south the day after tomorrow. They know they can die. Each of them has lost comrades. They know they could be next. Everyone has a family, has children. Everyone wants to live. But there is no other way out. The cross that every warrior bears is self-sacrifice. But the chaplain sometimes carries the soldier&#x2019;s cross, his feelings, depression, emotions. It becomes easier for the warrior after a conversation with his chaplain. Even when he hears no answers to his questions. Orthodox Christians are the largest religious group in Ukraine &#x2014; more than 70% of Ukrainians identified as Orthodox Christian according to one 2022 survey. When the full-scale invasion broke out in 2022, Nadia Kaminska stopped attending the only church in her village in central Ukraine because of its ties to Moscow. Her congregation has since voted to transfer their parish from the Russian-linked Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU), which was granted self-governance from the Moscow Patriarchate in 2019 by the spiritual leadership that oversees both branches. More than a thousand other congregations have made the same transition since 2022, while over 8,000 were still under Moscow&#x2019;s influence as of May. At some Moscow-affiliated churches, the Ukrainian government has uncovered ties to the Russian state and security services. But for the past year, Nadia and her fellow parishioners have been praying in a room in a community center. UOC leadership has barred them from holding OCU services in their village&#x2019;s church. The community is waiting for the local government authorities to recognize their vote and let them gather there. I have been a parishioner of this church since 2018. I live next door. When I came to my first Sunday sermon, I was surprised. Father Serhei Frolov was a Ukrainophobe. For him, Russia is Russia, a great power. And Ukraine? No such country. There is only Russia. Nadia Kaminska, 48, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Ukraine on Dec. 3, 2024. (Chris Jones / The Kyiv Independent)I realized I would not have a connection with him. I was born in Russia but have lived here since I was three. To me, Russia was an aggressor that attacked my country and took away Crimea. But I was going through a difficult time. I needed a church, I needed the sacraments. Before 2014, the church was full. People poured their hearts into it. By the time I started coming, it was empty. There were about fifteen of us. People with different views than Father Serhei had left. They built this church. And they had to leave it. It was difficult for people whose loved ones are fighting for us, to hear during a sermon that Russia isn&#x2019;t at war with us. That the enemy is the West. When the full-scale invasion began in February, I went to church in the morning with my husband and my hope. Hope that this priest would see the light, realize none of what he said was true, and say, Forgive me, we are at war, yes, Russia is an enemy. But we didn&#x2019;t hear that. We heard, Don&#x2019;t watch, don&#x2019;t listen to anything, just pray and wait. Wait for the Russians? I couldn&#x2019;t stay. I left and couldn&#x2019;t return. People were scared, disoriented. At such moments, people need the presence of God. And the people in this village, who built that church and wanted to go to that church? They were deprived. I talked to internally displaced people who needed a church. They asked, What kind of church do you have here? Is it under Moscow? I would say, I&#x2019;m sorry, it&#x2019;s a Moscow church. Two weeks later, I got a call from our priest, Serhei. He said that, even if they put a machine gun to his temple, he would never renounce Kirill, the Patriarch of the Moscow Church. He hoped I&#x2019;d take his side. I told him Kirill is not my patriarch. Nadia and her fellow parishioners in a community center in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Ukraine on Dec. 3, 2024.

(Chris Jones / The Kyiv Independent)Six months after the invasion, Father Serhei left. I was at the last service. He talked about traitors. He looked me in the eye, saying I&#x2019;d renounced the church. I didn&#x2019;t feel like a traitor. I didn&#x2019;t renounce Christ. Then a new priest came. I came to vespers and when we &#x2014; five people and the priest &#x2014; gathered, I said Let&#x2019;s transfer to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. The priest said &#x201C;We will do what the church leadership tells us to.&#x201D; The church is not governed by parishioners, but by pro-Russian leaders. We asked people, How would you feel about a Ukrainian church in our village, a church that has never cooperated with Russia? People said, We&#x2019;re for it. We have a law that allows parishioners to vote on transferring. On May 14 last year, we invited everyone to a meeting in the center of the village. I got a phone call from another priest who, let&#x2019;s say, threatened me. It didn&#x2019;t stop us. Ninety people voted in favor of transferring. Unanimous vote. But the Russian church doesn&#x2019;t accept the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. They say we&#x2019;re schismatics and won&#x2019;t let us hold services in the church. The local authorities won&#x2019;t force them to leave. So we organized a little space here in the cultural building. We started services again. We didn&#x2019;t have icons, anything. My husband came to the first service. It was held in Ukrainian. In my village, liturgies in our beautiful language! I cried. My former friends cut us off. For me, they aren&#x2019;t enemies. They just got a little confused. They don&#x2019;t study history. But what does God teach? People change. I would like our village church to become Ukrainian. I want to return. But only when it has a different atmosphere. Editor&#x2019;s note: After this interview, Natalia&#x2019;s church was told the community room was no longer available and they would need to hold services in the corridor. Muslims make up around 1% of Ukraine&#x2019;s population. Exact figures are hard to come by as the largest group is in Crimea, where around 13% of residents were estimated to be Muslim prior to its annexation by Russia in 2014. Under Stalin&#x2019;s rule in the 1940s, ethnic Crimean Tatars &#x2014; around half of Ukraine&#x2019;s Muslims &#x2014; were deported en masse from their home in Crimea to remote areas of Central Asia and Siberia, in what Ukraine and Tatars deem a genocide. Many returned decades later, only to flee religious persecution and Russia&#x2019;s rule after the country annexed the peninsula. Said Ismahilov was one of the top Muslim spiritual leaders in Ukraine before the war began. He moved from his home in occupied Donetsk to Bucha after the 2014 invasion. When Russian troops invaded Bucha in 2022, he moved again, this time to Kyiv. He left his position as Mufti to serve as a volunteer on the front, then joined the Ukrainian military and continues to serve today. When the war ends, he dreams of building a memorial engraved with the names of all the Muslim men and women who died defending Ukraine. I came to the mosque (in Kyiv) on the second day of the full-scale war. There was no one there. Only an elderly guard, a non-Muslim. They had all fled. &#xA0;It was such a disappointment. When I was elected Mufti on Jan. 25, 2009, I set the goal of creating a Muslim community in Ukraine. The majority of Muslims here moved from elsewhere. Even Crimean Tatars, about half of Ukraine&#x2019;s Muslims, returned from deportation. My goal was to educate the Muslim immigrants, so they feel Ukrainian. To fight together with other Ukrainians. Said Ismagilov, 46, in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine on Nov. 27, 2024. (Ivan Samoilov / The Kyiv Independent)&#xA0;But the people I worked with ran to Europe, the United States, Canada, anywhere. This shocked me in the first months of the war &#x2014; damn it, I taught you to love Ukraine! And when it got bad for this country where you lived, got married, had children, ran your business &#x2014; it turns out you don&#x2019;t need the country. Okay, if you&#x2019;re not ready to fight, it&#x2019;s on your conscience. But I cannot sit and pray in an empty mosque. I had to put on a uniform and practice what I preach. If I have taught that to people for 20 years, I have to go, even if I am alone. Either I lied when I called people to do something I didn&#x2019;t believe in, or I have to defend my homeland. I volunteered and became a paramedic. We evacuated the wounded under fire. I stopped being a Mufti, I&#x2019;m now just an ordinary Muslim like anyone else. But if there was no one to pray for the dead, I had to do it. Most of the Muslims who went to defend Ukraine were Crimean Tatars and Ukrainian-born. I met them at the front often. Religious and military service are different &#x2014; like earth and sky. It&#x2019;s good to teach people in a warm, safe mosque. But when you&#x2019;re being shot at, carrying the wounded, when it&#x2019;s cold, muddy, or too hot &#x2014; then it&#x2019;s harder to live up to your ideals. I discovered I&#x2019;m not afraid. They can shoot at me, kill someone nearby. I am not afraid. In Islam, a man&#x2019;s duty is to be a soldier. It&#x2019;s a sin if he doesn&#x2019;t protect his family. We believe we die on the day and time chosen by God. No earlier, no later. Even if a hundred people shoot at me, if I&#x2019;m not destined to die today, I won&#x2019;t. I didn&#x2019;t hear such questions at the front, but I heard it in the rear: How did God allow this? I have a simple answer. Do not blame your sins on God, you allowed the war to begin. God will not take up a Kalashnikov and fight in your place. It isn&#x2019;t his task. God created you, gave you land to live here, freedom of choice, commanded you to be honest, righteous, and to protect yourself from the enemy. When someone shifts responsibility to God, I say we are adults, responsible for ourselves. What does God have to do with it? Said Ismagilov, 46, in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine on Nov. 27, 2024. (Ivan Samoilov / The Kyiv Independent)&#xA0;When I was a Mufti, everyone pestered me. Journalists, visitors, students. Why in the world does the Koran always talk about war? Because they didn&#x2019;t know what war was. And when people found themselves in war, they understood why the Koran had verses about taking up weapons. When you find yourself at war, you understand the scriptures. In Islam, there are special prayers against the enemy. For the enemy to weaken, to perish. Prayers that are read when someone is afraid they will die or be taken prisoner. Before, I didn&#x2019;t read them. I had no reason. Now there&#x2019;s a need for those prayers. Now, my prayers are less about civilian life, which I don&#x2019;t remember at all. Natalia Dubchak returned to her family in Ukraine from Russia after the Soviet Union collapsed. She raised her children as a single mother, serving in the military until 2012. Her son was killed in 2015 fighting to defend against Russia&#x2019;s 2014 invasion of Crimea and Donbas. She has organized and led church-backed support groups for other women whose sons have died in the fighting. She continues her work from her home in Bucha, which she fled for three months to escape the massacres under Russian occupation. Around 4,400 Ukrainian fighters died during the eight years of war in eastern Ukraine before Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. As of December 2024, at least 43,000 more Ukrainian soldiers have been killed, according to President Volodymyr Zelenksy, though many estimate the true total to be much higher. &#x201C;I went to confession for the first time right after my son died. I was already an adult, about 52, and I realized that we all have sins. We don&#x2019;t always consider them sins. I have a lot of them &#x2014; abortion, adultery in the eyes of the church &#x2014; but I was very surprised by the church&#x2019;s tolerant attitude. No one shamed me. No one said, Oh, how could you do that? It was shocking, in a good way. When I left the confessional, I cried for a half hour. I felt as if I&#x2019;d been cleansed from the inside. When a son or daughter dies, parents &#x2014; and mothers especially &#x2014; often think, God punished me. We look for the reason for our child&#x2019;s death. Others are back to living their lives, surviving the war, but my child died. Maybe it was something I said, or something I thought... But confession made me understand, in simple, ordinary words, that it wasn&#x2019;t my fault. My son Sasha was an ardent atheist. He didn&#x2019;t want to read about God. He didn&#x2019;t believe &#x2014; that was it. Natalia holds a photo of her deceased son in the church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary of the UGCC in Irpin, Ukraine, on Nov. 30, 2024. (Anna Donets / The Kyiv Independent)But when he came back on his first military leave, I asked him how he felt about God now. He said, Mom, when you&#x2019;re in a trench under fire, you pray with any words you can think of. There are no non-believers in the trenches, he said. He went to serve when the war started in 2014. I was planning to return to the service because I was only 50 and a career soldier. But he said, It&#x2019;s enough for one of us to serve. Sashko died in 2015. In 2014, many families began losing loved ones, and the question of how to care for them became an issue. There weren&apos;t many NGOs to help us back then, and the state didn&apos;t know what to do with us. No one needed us. The church was the first institution to lend a shoulder. And so, when church leaders said, We would like you to help us take care of the families, to gather them so we could support them, I agreed. Now we have 28 support groups in Ukraine. When we started seven years ago, we were the first. We have monthly meetings, first for liturgy, then for informal communication with a psychologist, with a confessor, one another. Tea, coffee. We celebrate birthdays and the anniversary of the death of loved ones. I can&apos;t say that I&apos;m a 100% religious person. I don&apos;t follow all the rules in the faith but I try to live as a decent person. The commandments, you know: thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not kill. I follow them. But I&apos;m not 100% a believer. The word &quot;spirituality&quot; is what keeps me near the church. I feel this support from within. When everything is good, when nothing happens in your life, you don&apos;t think about the fact that faith exists. When something happens and we need support, we remember the Lord, ask him for advice, make promises.

(Anna Donets / The Kyiv Independent)The families of the fallen are in this situation. We are their role models. Families now come to our group and wonder, Is this how I will be in 10 years? It turns out that life goes on. It&#x2019;s possible not just to exist, but also to live. We aren&#x2019;t eternal. We die. That&apos;s why you have to live, be happy about small things, which is what I try to do. I have the opportunity to work a little more, I have enough money for bread and butter. What more can I ask for? When I thought about death, I used to get shivers down my spine and immediately drove the thoughts away. They scared me. Now I understand how long the average life in Ukraine really is. I&#x2019;ll be 62 in a week. I hope I have 10 more years. I can&apos;t say whether I believe in an afterlife. No one has been. No one knows. I hope it&#x2019;s true that only the body dies, but the soul doesn&#x2019;t. My son died, my father died. For me, death is a meeting with my family. The history of Ukraine&#x2019;s Jewish community stretches back more than a thousand years. Ukraine is the birthplace of the Hasidic Jewish movement, played a key role in the development of Yiddish modern literature, and is home to more than a thousand Jewish heritage sites. Ukrainian Jews both flourished and experienced persecution during different periods up until the Holocaust, before which Ukraine was one of the largest Jewish centers in Europe. Many researchers estimate the death toll of Ukrainian Jews during the Holocaust to be over a million, with some estimates as high as 1.6 million. Jews continued to emigrate in the decades that followed. Today, Ukraine still only has a fraction of the Jewish population it had at its peak, but since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine&#x2019;s Jewish community has been rebuilding and rejuvenating. Estimates vary, but experts believe the number of Jews who still call Ukraine their home is now in the tens of thousands. Valentyn Postrelko, like many in Ukraine&#x2019;s Jewish community, is returning to a faith that has deep familial roots but was diminished in recent times. I was born in Kyiv, I will be 75 years old in December. I was brought up in Soviet times, when religion was disregarded. Now it&#x2019;s important. When there is such a big war and your family has two sons at the front, you turn to God. And God is the same for Jews, Muslims, and for Christians. Professor Valentyn Postrelko at the Institute of Surface Chemistry, Kyiv, Ukraine on Dec. 12, 2024. (Anna Donets / The Kyiv Independent)Everyone has their own Golgotha, when they come to God. My time has come. How did I get to be religious? Three or four years ago, I set myself a goal of making a memorial sign for the victims of the Holocaust. The Association of Jewish Communities helped me finance it. We reconstructed an old Jewish cemetery. My grandmother and uncle were shot there. And then I slowly began to visit the rabbi. I came to the synagogue. I like it there. People treat me well, and I treat them well. In any religion, a person should treat another humanely. Every Saturday when we gather, we pray for my boys to come back alive and healthy. I talk to them almost every evening. One is 34 and the other 45. They volunteered to defend Ukraine in the first days of the war. Earlier, many Jews left the country because there were negative attitudes towards them. They left for countries with better treatment. I&#x2019;ve seen these attitudes improve in Ukraine. Many Jews are coming back. The Ukrainian people elected a Jewish president, so what issues can there be? To be a Jew in Ukraine today, I believe you are a citizen of this country, so this is your country. There is a Russian translation of the Torah, but there has never been a Ukrainian translation. The Jewish community in Dnipro initiated a translation. This is very important for our country, especially now. There is a group of translators and reviewers. I was tasked to help with editing because I speak exclusively Ukrainian. We are in Ukraine. We should have the Torah in Ukrainian. Now in the synagogue, our rabbi reads the Torah in Hebrew, and I read (draft translations in) Ukrainian. Professor Valentyn Postrelko&apos;s office at the Institute of Surface Chemistry, Kyiv, Ukraine on Dec. 12, 2024. (Anna Donets / The Kyiv Independent)I have been working in psychiatry for 40 years. I studied in Russia. And I still ask the question, Why did this happen? How? For people to be turned into such beasts, that they did what they did in Bucha and Irpin. I had a client practice in Bucha before the war, I treated soldiers after 2014. So I went there in the first days after its liberation. I saw it. The hospital was ruined. By April 2022, I was treating soldiers there again. The air raid alarm sounded all night last night. You understand that this is a war. I could go abroad. But my boys are at war, and I will not go anywhere. Baptists are one of the oldest and largest Evangelical Christian groups in Ukraine, and have been in the country since the 1800s. They once formed the largest Baptist community outside of the United States, though their numbers have since declined. Ukraine&#x2019;s Head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak wrote in an op-ed for the Hill that there are an estimated 800,000 to 1 million evangelical Christians in Ukraine. Vladyslav Makhovskyi grew up non-religious, like many who were born during the Soviet Union when religion was suppressed and discouraged by Soviet authorities. He converted to evangelicalism at age 25. Six years ago, he became a pastor. Since 2014, I&#x2019;ve been volunteering, evacuating, helping people in the war zone. I&apos;ve been going once or twice a week. Sometimes I&#x2019;m scared, but I have to go. The main goal was to support churches and help people form new churches. We started forming churches near Avdiivka, but the Russians destroyed them. The first time I entered the territory controlled by the occupiers, I evacuated people and got out. The second time, I was detained by one of the Russian militant groups fighting Ukraine. This was 2014. They interrogated me for six days. Took my car, documents, everything. But they let me go. Vladyslav Makhovskyi, 50, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine on Dec. 1, 2024. (Kate Klochko / The Kyiv Independent)I prayed hardest when I was in captivity. Every day, every night, because they were torturing me. Relying on God gave me strength. And when I got out, I thanked God for guiding me through this. At the beginning of the full-scale war, I was in Zaporizhzhia. I chose to stay. Those were difficult days; the Russians were close. So we started to take our church members and families with children to western Ukraine. And also to help people who were even nearer to the approaching Russians. We drove three or four buses to Vasylivka, to bring aid and evacuate children. We were asked to. When we were getting closer, we saw military equipment. When we got even closer, we saw the letter &#x2018;Z.&apos; They stopped us, searched us, held us, but then turned us around and let us go. They had other tasks. I went to occupied territories several times to evacuate children until they closed everything. This February in Avdiivka, I came under fire. A first-person-view drone hit me. It was 800 meters from the Russians. I got shrapnel wounds on my right leg. My car wouldn&#x2019;t start. I walked about a kilometer in a state of shock and was evacuated to the city. Vladyslav Makhovskyi, 50, with his congregation in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine on Dec. 1, 2024. (Kate Klochko / The Kyiv Independent)I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d be doing this if I were not a believer. Faith changed me. Gave me a vocation to help people. Now we&#x2019;re helping displaced people. Many of them come to our church. This year, several were baptized. When things get difficult, people turn to God and the church grows. Many of the ministers I know weren&#x2019;t believers as children. I was raised a non-believer. I was involved in drugs, have a criminal record. The first time I came to the Baptist church, in 1999, the service was already going on. I stood in the doorway and watched. And then one lady invited me in, offered me a seat, so I listened to the sermons. I felt such love, such acceptance. When I was captured for the first time in 2014, they had such a negative attitude toward the Baptists. There was a soldier who came wearing a cross. I started saying I was a believer, a Christian. He came at me with a knife. He showed me the cross and said, This is the true God. Your faith is an enemy faith, the faith of American spies.

Georgian parliament bans masks, fireworks during protests	The Georgian parliament on Dec. 13 passed the final reading of a bill to ban the wearing of masks, as well as the use of fireworks and lasers during protests, News Georgia reported. The move is part of the authorities&apos; reaction to the Georgian opposition&apos;s protests against vote rigging in the Oct. 26 parliamentary election and the Georgian government&apos;s decision to halt the country&apos;s EU accession process until 2028. According to the bill, the fine for wearing a mask or using lasers or fireworks is 2,000 Georgian lari ($712). Meanwhile, the Georgian Interior Ministry will determine the list of individuals allowed to cover their faces at protests due to their occupation, according to the media outlet. Masks are often worn not only by protesters but also by police officers and pro-government thugs who attack demonstrators. Under the new legislation, the rules for exporting, importing, and selling fireworks in Georgia are getting stricter &#x2014; a license will now be required. Similar laws, nicknamed &quot;dictatorial&quot;, were passed under pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in Ukraine in 2014 during the EuroMaidan Revolution. They triggered an escalation of clashes between protesters and the police and were repealed even before Yanukovych&apos;s overthrow. The laws included a ban on wearing protective masks or helmets during protests and moving in convoys of more than five cars. Similarly to another recent Georgian law, Ukraine&apos;s dictatorial laws introduced the concept of a &quot;foreign agent&quot; for Western-funded NGOs.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-parliament-bans-wearing-masks-using-lasers-pyrotechnics-at-protests/	2024-12-13T07:36:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2186926312.jpg
Ukraine resisting Russian encirclement attempts at 4 Donetsk Oblast villages, military says	Ukrainian forces are repelling Russian assaults near Uspenivka, Hannivka, Trudove, and Romanivka in Donetsk Oblast and &quot;are taking necessary measures&quot; to prevent encirclement, the Khortytsia group of forces reported on Dec. 13. The statement comes as analysts raise concerns about a growing risk of Ukrainian units being encircled in the area. The DeepState monitoring group reported on Dec. 12 that Russian forces are intensifying their assault on Uspenivka, 43 kilometers (26 miles) from occupied Donetsk. Russia has reportedly gained control of key routes between Uspenivka and Hannivka, threatening to cut off Ukrainian units in what has been dubbed the Uspenivka pocket. The sector lies roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the front-line town of Pokrovsk and 15 kilometers (9 miles) north of occupied Vuhledar. The DeepState monitoring group map, as of December 13. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)The Khortytsia group cautioned against &quot;emotional interpretations&quot; of the battlefield situation, saying that such reactions could complicate the situation and benefit Russian forces. According to the official statement, the Ukrainian military repelled Russian assaults on the outskirts of settlements. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi has previously described the ongoing Russian offensive as &#x201C;one of the most powerful&#x201D; since the full-scale invasion began. Throughout the autumn, Russian forces have made operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, particularly near Toretsk, Chasiv Yar, and Kupiansk, while advancing on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-troops-resist-encirclement-in-donetsk-oblast/	2024-12-13T05:53:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2184445535-1.jpg
How will Russia's war in Ukraine end? The good, the bad, and the ugly scenarios	Editor&apos;s note: This article is a compliment to an upcoming analytical report on scenarios for the end of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine by KI Insights, the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s research unit. After nearly three years of heavy battles and mass strikes, Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine is showing signs of accelerating toward what could be its final act, for now at least. Over the summer and autumn of 2024, the battlefield situation markedly turned for the worse for Kyiv, as Russia has begun capturing territory at a greater pace since the first months of the full-scale invasion. The resounding victory in the U.S. presidential elections of former President Donald Trump, who has been openly scathing of U.S. military and financial aid to Ukraine and the inner circle of whom have spread anti-Ukrainian narratives on the war, has put the future of Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to hold Russia back in grave doubt. Meanwhile though, the incoming U.S. president has nonetheless claimed repeatedly to be able to end the war quickly upon his inauguration in January. Given the slow-burn failure of the West&#x2019;s current policy to support Ukraine enough to simply survive rather than win in the face of Russia&#x2019;s war of attrition, many Ukrainians, from officials to soldiers and civilians, have expressed quiet hope that Trump could get tough with Russian President Vladimir Putin in an effort to stop Russia&#x2019;s advance. But Washington is not a direct belligerent in the full-scale war, which began with Russia&apos;s attempt to decapitate independent Ukraine through an attack on Kyiv, and which has since continued with all evidence that Putin&#x2019;s maximalist goals remain in place. Stirred already by the full-scale invasion, European nations have meanwhile realized the urgent need to scale up defense production in light of an incoming president Trump, who has openly questioned if he would honor Article 5 of the NATO Treaty. But behind loud public statements from European leaders on taking more responsibility for the continent&#x2019;s own security, the question of whether these plans also include brave steps to secure Ukraine&#x2019;s future is usually left unanswered. With just over a month until Trump&#x2019;s inauguration, both Kyiv and Moscow are jostling to best improve their negotiating positions ahead of what is likely to be a dynamic winter, both on the battlefield and in the geopolitical arena. Excluding developments that are grounded more in wishful thinking than in reality, such as Ukraine&#x2019;s overstretched military conducting major counteroffensives, or Russia&#x2019;s economy suffering a sudden collapse, realistic endpoints to Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine can begin to take shape. Through this prism, possible war termination scenarios quickly split into four broad options. The most positive scenario for ending the war for Kyiv: achieving a peace built upon rock-solid safeguards against a repeat invasion, even if without all of its territory, for now. In his Victory Plan presented to world leaders in October, Zelensky spoke of an invitation to NATO and the stationing of long-range missiles in Ukraine as a deterrence. Almost certainly, European nations will have to lead the way, likely by bringing non-combat boots on the ground on their own initiative and generally integrating free Ukraine into Europe&apos;s security architecture. The main question is why Russia would agree to stop on the battlefield on such terms.

(Roman Pilipey / AFP via Getty Images)SCENARIO 2: Ceasefire with frozen lines, no secure UkraineScenario 2 encompasses an end to active hostilities with no serious provisions that provide a hard deterrent for a repeat Russian invasion of Ukraine. The result of a distracted, divided West simply wanting the fighting to stop without losing too much face, and a Kremlin leadership that could be ready to oblige. Variants of this peace plan could bear similarities to the Minsk Agreements, with non-armed international observers and rules on heavy weapons, and could also include the abandoning of Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations to save face for the Kremlin short-term. Conversely, with positions hardened and both Zelensky and Putin worried that signing any peace deal would project weakness, Scenario 2 could also go no further than a shaky ceasefire. Ultimately, a repeat invasion will be expected; Kyiv and Europe will have to race to prepare.

(Nikoletta Stoyanova/Getty Images)SCENARIO 3:Desperate, compromised peaceUkraine finds itself in a quickly deteriorating position on the battlefield, with not enough hard support from the U.S. or Europe to even secure a freezing of the front lines. In a desperate effort to stave off total defeat, Kyiv sues for peace. Holding all the power, Moscow can set almost any and all terms that it sees fit as the price for stopping its advance on the battlefield. These could include limits on military size and weaponry, giving the Russian language co-official status, or other constitutional changes designed to permanently undermine Ukrainian sovereignty and democracy. If Moscow decides to go further, it could demand a harder capitulation in the form of recognizing and handing over the remaining Ukrainian-controlled territory in the four regions newly-annexed by Russia, including Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Such territorial concessions are completely unthinkable for Ukraine but may loom if there is literally no other hard barrier or leverage to stop Russia from taking as much of Ukraine as it pleases.

The Trump administration puts forward different peace plans to Putin, using both carrot and stick, but Moscow simply decides to keep going, feeling no hard resistance. Europe fails to muster a brave response outside the limits of a Trump-Putin-Zelensky deal. Kyiv either refuses to sue for a peace that could lead to Scenario 3 or tries to do so but is rejected by Moscow. Potential for new fronts to open along the northern border. A new wave of millions of refugees heads toward Europe. Kyiv becomes weak and unstable on the brink of military defeat. The end result of the war depends on Russia&apos;s maximal territorial goals in Ukraine.

(Libkos/Getty Images)The Russia problemBoth in the lead-up to and after the election, most media reporting has struggled to get to the core of what the task of ending the war really entails. Often, discussions of various hypothetical peace plans use vague language along the lines of &quot;freezing the conflict&quot; in the context of whether or not President Volodymyr Zelensky is ready to take the difficult step of &quot;ceding territory.&quot; These ideas are often on display among the actors themselves, with Trump&#x2019;s running mate JD Vance, speaking on a podcast in September, suggesting a freeze followed by the creation of a fortified, demilitarized zone and a declaration of Ukraine&#x2019;s neutrality. A similar proposal was reportedly presented by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as recently as Nov. 18. Kyiv has objected to a simple freeze of the conflict; on top of the injustice of leaving millions of Ukrainians under occupation, peace without hard security guarantees means, in the words of Zelensky, that &#x201C;our children, or our grandchildren, will have to fight.&#x201D; Rarely is thought given to how difficult even &quot;freezing&quot; a front line is likely to be when it is currently at a rolling boil.

(Olga Maltseva / AFP via Getty Images)The most important question &#x2014; under what circumstances Moscow would feel either convinced or compelled to stop advancing and taking more territory it considers its own &#x2014; is often overlooked. When asked about peace negotiations, Putin has repeatedly said that any deal must be based on the &#x201C;realities on the battlefield,&#x201D; while on Nov. 20, a Kremlin spokesperson ruled out &#x201C;freezing the conflict&#x201D; entirely, adding that it was important for Moscow to &#x201C;achieve its goals.&#x201D; For now, Kyiv and Moscow&#x2019;s positions look irreconcilable, and the task facing Trump to change that is a daunting one. Visions of a realistic end to the war must navigate these high-stakes clashes not only of national interests but of each actor&#x2019;s highly personal calculus. As leader of an independent Ukraine, President Zelensky always reserves the right to keep fighting. For Kyiv, the answer to &#x201C;Why should Russia stop?&#x201D; has always been a simple one. Moscow should be stopped by force and then shown that any new attempt to subjugate Ukraine will only end in bloody disaster for the Kremlin. With the failure of the 2023 counteroffensive and a worsening battlefield outlook over 2024, Zelensky has &#x2014; though slowly letting go of the rhetoric of a return to Ukraine&#x2019;s 1991 borders through military means &#x2014; nonetheless stuck to the idea that Ukraine cannot accept a peace without hard security guarantees. An invitation to join NATO was at the top of the president&#x2019;s Victory Plan presented to Western partners in October, and in a Nov. 29 interview, Zelensky said that he would be ready to end the &#x201C;hot phase&#x201D; of the war along current lines in exchange for Ukraine entering the alliance. The problem, as Zelensky pointed out in the same interview, is that Kyiv has not received any offer resembling such a deal from its partners. Some stronger supporters have backed NATO membership for Ukraine, but others, including Ukraine&#x2019;s largest military aid suppliers Washington and Berlin, have rejected the idea of an invitation. For Ukraine and Zelensky, even if it doesn&#x2019;t come with Article 5 protection itself, achieving some form of Scenario 1 peace remains the only acceptable option. Soon after hostilities end, Ukraine is set to face a slew of internal pressure tests, including what could shape up to be a fiercely-contested round of presidential and parliamentary elections. But to hold elections in the first place, Kyiv will first have to end martial law, which, unless special provisions are brought in, means disbanding the majority of the country&#x2019;s mobilized fighters and finally allowing men to leave the country. The immediate shortfall in manpower would bring a heightened risk of a repeat invasion, not a risk Kyiv will want to shoulder in a Scenario 2 peace. To avoid this, Zelensky will not only have to convince Trump that a secure post-war Ukraine is important but do so strongly enough to make the president-elect fight for it.

(Oleg Nikishin/Getty Images)&#x201C;My big worry is that Trump would want to rush toward a cessation of hostilities before this kind of peace enforcement framework is sketched out,&#x201D; said Eric Ciaramella, senior fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, to the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Then you have a very unstable peace, something in the middle of war and peace, not like in Donbas before 2022, but probably hotter and more unstable.&#x201D; As the aggressor in the war and the leader holding the undisputed initiative on the battlefield, the question of &#x201C;Why does Russia stop?&#x201D; starts and finishes with Putin himself. After failing to take Kyiv in early 2022, Russia changed its approach to one of attrition: grinding down both the Ukrainian military&#x2019;s ability to hold hundreds of kilometers of front line and the West&#x2019;s resolve to keep Kyiv in the fight. Despite countless moments of humiliation, Moscow has stuck to its plan, and after years of fighting and soaring losses, the strategy is starting to pay off. In June, as Russian forces expanded on its breakthrough near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, Putin named his demands: not only abandoning NATO membership aspirations, but the full Ukrainian withdrawal from the four illegally annexed oblasts, i.e. a Scenario 3-style capitulation. For Putin, a ceasefire now would amount to giving up not only his hard-earned momentum but also stopping well short of these publicly aired goals. Ultimately, given Russia&#x2019;s highly personalized leadership, the most important factor remains the mindset of the president, said U.K.-based Russia expert Mark Galeotti to the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;The very fact of Putin&apos;s invasion in February 2022 was not a common sense decision, who knows quite what Putin thinks now,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;but beyond that, I think everyone&#x2019;s playing it by ear.&#x201D; &#x201C;The Russians are clearly feeling a certain degree of a strange mix of anticipation and unease, in that they absolutely would be delighted if Trump started to scale down support for Ukraine, but on the other hand, they know full well that they can&apos;t really trust him.&#x201D; According to Galeotti, though the final say remains with Putin, there are some reasons to believe that Russia could be tempted by the idea of a ceasefire. &#x201C;I think the Russians are clearly working on the assumption that there may be a ceasefire,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;which is why they&apos;re putting so much effort and blood into their campaign in the Donbas, and they&apos;re preparing for a stepped-up operation against the Kursk salient.&#x201D; &#x201C;They want to make sure that by the time Trump is inaugurated, they&apos;re in the most favorable position.&#x201D; Unsustainable battlefield losses and a gradually overheating economy mean that Russia could look for an easy way out, more like Scenario 2, with the added bonuses of placating Trump while still being able to invade again later.

The incoming president has given little detail on how he plans to achieve his promised quick ceasefire, usually choosing to instead reiterate the accusations that his predecessor Joe Biden was primarily at fault for allowing the full-scale invasion to happen in the first place. In the absence of a publicly stated approach, observers have instead looked for signs from those closest to Trump, which show a mixed bag of hostile positions and hopeful proposals. Among Trump&#x2019;s inner circle, multi-billionaire Elon Musk and the president-elect&#x2019;s own son Donald Trump Jr. have been a consistent source of anti-Ukraine diatribes, with both frequently mocking Zelensky on social media. Others, like VP-elect Vance, have at least paid lip service to the need for peace that came with a deterrence against a future Russian invasion, with Trump himself allegedly pushing Warsaw and Paris for European boots on the ground in post-war Ukraine, as reported by the Wall Street Journal on Dec. 12. On Nov. 27, Trump appointed retired U.S. Army General Keith Kellogg as his Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia. In an April paper for the pro-Trump America First Policy Institute think tank, Kellogg and co-author Fred Fleitz proposed taking NATO membership off the table and offering &#x201C;limited sanctions relief&#x201D; to Russia in exchange for coming to a peace deal that would be acceptable to Ukraine.

(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)A central working group on solving the problem has yet to be convened inside the Trump team, with advisors still formulating different versions of a possible plan, Reuters reported on Dec. 4. &#x201C;None of those people really speaks for him,&#x201D; said Ciaramella, &#x201C;they&apos;re all trying to kind of court influence and try to get him on board with their ideas.&#x201D; &#x201C;It&apos;s not entirely clear to me, as you read between the lines, where exactly their position is landing.&#x201D; Beyond the question of whether or not Trump sees the importance of a secure post-war Ukraine rather than simply a shaky ceasefire, the ultimate test is likely to come in his direct contact with Putin. The greatest unknown remains how willing &#x2014; and then how able &#x2014; the president-elect is to compel or convince Moscow to stop on the battlefield, and what he will do when faced with stiff resistance from his Russian counterpart. &#x201C;I don&apos;t see things moving until Trump is willing to actually take some concrete steps,&#x201D; said Ciaramella, &#x201D;the question is whether he&apos;s going to go in the direction of turning the screws on Ukraine or Russia or both.&#x201D; &#x201C;I understand the Ukrainian desire to have a little bit of optimism just because Trump is new. He is unpredictable, but judging from the way he acted in his first term, he is also really averse to military conflict and confrontation.&#x201D; In terms of real leverage that could be brought down on Putin, Trump&#x2019;s options include both the ramping up of military aid to Ukraine and perhaps more promisingly, an expanded economic war against Russia centered around the lowering of oil prices and tightening of secondary sanctions. But with Ukraine&#x2019;s main battlefield woe being its own manpower, even these levers are unlikely to be able to quickly turn the tide on the ground. If no quick solution materializes, the threat for Ukraine is that Trump sees putting pressure on Kyiv as much easier than on Moscow, or that he could, if frustrated, disengage from the process entirely. &#x201C;Trump&#x2019;s ability to deflect and shift blame to other people is pretty well established,&#x201D; said Ciaramella. &#x201C;I do worry, especially with the growing narrative in Ukraine that the setbacks on the battlefield are because of Biden&apos;s weakness. You can really overplay that and get the response from Trump that, yes, it was Biden&apos;s fault.&#x201D; Though lagging far behind the U.S. in hard military power, there is a fourth party for whom the final result of the Russia-Ukraine war matters far more: Europe. With fresh memory of Russian occupation, Poland and the Baltic States have been some of Ukraine&#x2019;s biggest per capita supporters, while further north, Finland and Sweden responded to the full-scale invasion by breaking with official neutrality policy and joining NATO. Across the continent, the full-scale war has jolted Europe into upping defense spending, a topic brought into focus in February when Trump said he would &#x201C;urge Russia to take whatever the hell they want&#x201D; if Moscow attacked a European nation that wasn&#x2019;t meeting NATO defense spending targets. But while taking responsibility for Europe&#x2019;s own security is one thing, being able to bring Ukraine under that umbrella in conditions of war or shaky ceasefire is another entirely. Europe&#x2019;s heavyweights have been slow to budge: French President Emmanuel Macron, who first made headlines in May by signaling readiness to deploy French troops to Ukraine in case of a Russian breakthrough, didn&#x2019;t elaborate on the idea for a long time after. &#xA0; In the aftermath of Trump&#x2019;s visit to Paris, Macron allegedly discussed the deployment of troops to Ukraine after a ceasefire with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, with Warsaw signalling that such a move could only happen under a NATO framework. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz made his first phone call to Putin since the early days of the full-scale in late November in a move slammed by Ukraine supporters. &#x201C;Scholz&#x2019;s call to Putin showed that he has learned nothing from his past failed engagements with the Kremlin,&#x201D; said political analyst and Senior Fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis Jessica Berlin to the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Thankfully, the response from European allies was clear: This isn&#x2019;t helping. Scholz&#x2019;s outreach also wasn&#x2019;t coordinated or agreed to in advance with our allies.&#x201D; In this handout image provided by the German Government Press Office (BPA), Chancellor Olaf Scholz (R) is seen in his office at the Federal Chancellery during a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin with Jens Pl&#xF6;tner, foreign and security policy advisor to the Federal Chancellor (L) and Steffen Hebestreit, government spokesperson (C) in Berlin, Germany on Nov. 15, 2024. (Steffen Kugler/Bundesregierung via Getty Images)As the big players hesitate, a strong European move to prevent disaster in Ukraine might have to be led by a bloc of braver states operating together, said Berlin. &#x201C;Biden and Scholz&#x2018;s hesitancy, lack of strategy, and lack of deterrent action to counter and contain Russia are pushing our Central Eastern European, Baltic, and Nordic allies to self-organize and explore ways to do more,&#x201D; she said. How doing more might look in practice remains to be seen, and a lot will depend on whether or not action is endorsed by a U.S.-brokered peace deal, or whether a disengaged Trump could force them to go out on a limb. Either way, the expectation is that it would require active military involvement inside Ukrainian territory, whether in the form of troops protecting a demilitarized zone, long-range assets placed inside Ukraine, or other incremental options. If the war does continue, one way of supporting Ukraine while projecting strength to Russia could be an air defense coalition, according to Berlin. &#x201C;Once the precedent of NATO member states actively supporting Ukrainian air defense has been set, that buffer zone can be incrementally expanded,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;This would be a clear way for Ukrainian allies to defend Ukraine and deter Russia without firing a single shot at a single Russian soldier or pilot.&#x201D; With the clock ticking down to Trump&#x2019;s return to the White House, no big breakthrough has come yet, with all parties doing their best to improve their positions. Looking forward to January and beyond, whether Ukraine can avoid spiraling toward suing for a desperate Scenario 3 peace or worse looks to depend on four key inflection points. The first is on the battlefield: whether or not Ukraine can stabilize its defense of the front line in the next months and bring Russia&apos;s offensive surge to culmination. If so, Putin&apos;s calculus could lean toward ending Russia&#x2019;s war, at least for now. But if the rate of Russian territorial gains continues its upward trend, and more parts of the front line begin to experience the kind of slow operational collapse currently on display in southern Donetsk Oblast, Moscow could choose to resist external pressure and double down on its maximalist goals. The second lies with Trump. Both Scenarios 1 and 2 require compelling Russia to stop quickly, but with a team full of Russia-sympathizing officials and advisors and Kyiv a lot easier to strongarm directly, the idea that Trump will be as tough as required on Putin for the sake of a quick peace is a dangerous assumption. The third concerns whether Putin is at all interested in stopping on the battlefield, and how he responds to Trump&#x2019;s demands. This will be a calculation of overall, big-picture interests, and depends not only on the leverage brought by Trump but on Putin&apos;s vision for the next stage of his broader confrontation with the West. Polish and Romanian military personnel stand next to military vehicles and a NATO flag on the sidelines of a press conference near the Suwalki Gap in Poland on July 7, 2022. (Wojtek Radwanski/AFP via Getty Images)Finally, much depends on Europe. Seeing the Russian threat to their own security, a brave Europe will step up to do whatever is required not only to avoid Scenario 3 but also to make a decisive long-term commitment to turn a Scenario 2 ceasefire into a robust peace that deters a repeat invasion. To end the war with a strong, independent Ukraine intact, these inflection points will have to lean in Kyiv&#x2019;s favor. NATO membership should still be the final goal, argues Ciaramella, and in the meantime, the West must do everything to project peace through strength. &#x201C;The real way to fundamentally change Putin&apos;s calculus is to essentially take Ukraine off the table,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;and say there&apos;s really no outcome of this war where Ukraine doesn&apos;t end up under the protection of Article 5.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/how-will-russia-war-in-ukraine-end/	2024-12-13T05:26:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188573525.jpg
Ukraine not ready for negotiations without strong Western support, Yermak says	Ukraine is not prepared to enter negotiations with Russia as it lacks sufficient Western support to engage from a position of strength, Andriy Yermak, head of the Presidential Office, said in an interview with Suspilne on Dec. 12. The comments come amid growing expectations of possible ceasefire talks in Ukraine as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said he aims to push Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table. Yermak emphasized that Ukraine must approach any potential talks &quot;on equal footing&quot; and dismissed ultimatums from the Kremlin as unacceptable. &quot;There will be no new Minsk or Normandy formats under President (Volodymyr) Zelensky&apos;s leadership,&quot; he said. When asked if Ukraine is currently strong enough to negotiate, Yermak responded, &quot;Not today.&quot; He highlighted the need for more weapons, a clear invitation to NATO, and security guarantees to prevent future Russian aggression. &quot;Strengthening Ukraine is essential to ensure this will never happen again,&quot; he said, referencing ongoing discussions with Western partners. Regarding Trump&#x2019;s repeated promises to quickly end the war, Yermak said, &quot;There is no plan yet, and we have not seen it for sure. We know that several opinions and positions are being discussed.&quot; The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump wants to see European troops involved in monitoring a potential ceasefire and may seek to delay Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership by 20 years in exchange for continued arms supplies. Trump has hinted at reducing U.S. aid while pushing for negotiations, using American support as leverage to pressure Moscow. Speaking to Time magazine, Trump criticized the Biden administration for enabling long-range strikes inside Russia but said he would not &quot;abandon&quot; Ukraine. Taking office on Jan. 20, 2025, Trump&apos;s presidency leaves the U.S. future support for Ukraine uncertain.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-not-ready-for-negotiations-without-stronger-western-support-yermak-says/	2024-12-13T05:23:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168960421.jpg
Dutch Supreme Court dismisses Russia's appeal in Naftogaz's $5 billion arbitration case	The Supreme Court of the Netherlands has rejected Russia&apos;s appeal against the Hague Arbitration Court&apos;s ruling requiring Moscow to pay $5 billion in damages to Naftogaz, the Ukrainian state-owned energy company said on Dec. 13. Russia was ordered to pay the sum as compensation for misappropriated assets in occupied Crimea. The tribunal ruled in February 2019 that Russia had expropriated Naftogaz&apos;s assets in Crimea in violation of the bilateral investment agreement between Ukraine and Russia. This marks the second definitive ruling by Dutch courts confirming the validity of the Hague arbitration tribunal&apos;s partial award. Following the 2019 ruling, the tribunal determined the damages in April 2023, ordering Russia to pay $5 billion. Despite the ruling, Russia continued to dispute the decision. The assets in question were seized following Russia&apos;s illegal occupation of Crimea in March 2014, which was carried out after a sham referendum held under military occupation and without international oversight.	https://kyivindependent.com/dutch-court-upholds-5-billion-arbitration-ruling-naftogaz/	2024-12-13T05:06:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1231980097.jpg
Italy willing to join potential peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, defense minister says	Italy is willing to participate in a possible peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said on Dec. 12, according to the Ansa news agency. The comments come amid growing expectations of possible ceasefire talks in Ukraine as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said he aims to push Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table. &quot;I hope to talk about peace, about peacekeeping, as soon as possible in Ukraine, but also in Gaza and Lebanon,&quot; Crosetto told journalists in Madrid when asked about the possibility of Rome deploying peacekeepers in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron has floated the idea of sending an international contingent to Ukraine to monitor a future truce. Though the French president has reportedly discussed the idea with the U.K. and Poland, Italy is the first country to signal openness to the proposal publicly. &quot;We are willing to play this role, a role in which we have always distinguished ourselves as a nation,&quot; Crosetto said. The position within Italy does not appear to be uniform. Italy&apos;s Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Antonio Tajani called such discussions premature, as Russia&apos;s war is ongoing. The U.K. and Poland have publicly said they are not currently considering deploying their soldiers in Ukraine. Only German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said such a possibility should not be ruled out, though Chancellor Olaf Scholz did not echo this position. European nations are nevertheless expected to take up a greater role in helping Ukraine defend itself and deter any future Russian aggression, as Trump is likely to decrease Washington&apos;s involvement. Talking to Macron and President Volodymyr Zelensky in Paris on Dec. 7, Trump reportedly told the two leaders he wants European peacekeepers monitoring a ceasefire deal on the ground in Ukraine. Zelensky noted that Ukraine &quot;may consider&quot; such a step, but only after receiving a clear timeline for NATO membership, which Trump and several member states oppose. Russia&apos;s position remains the main obstacle, as Moscow has shown no willingness to open peace talks that would not entail Ukraine&apos;s effective surrender and vocally opposed the presence of foreign troops on Ukrainian territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/italy-open-to-peacekeeping-in-ukraine-minister/	2024-12-13T04:49:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2186147388.jpg

Moldova announces state of emergency over expected halt of Russian gas	Moldova&apos;s parliament on Dec. 13 voted to introduce a 60-day-long state of emergency starting Dec. 16 over the expected halt of Russian gas transit via Ukraine. The country&apos;s Russian-occupied region of Transnistria is dependent on Russia&apos;s Gazprom supplies it receives through Ukraine. The gas flow is expected to cease after Dec. 31, as Kyiv said it does not aim to extend the transit deal past 2024. Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean&apos;s government proposed a state of emergency to respond more quickly and curb energy exports to avert shortages and a &quot;humanitarian crisis&quot; in Transnistria. Recean said the problem is &quot;artificial&quot; as Russian gas could instead flow through the TurkStream pipeline to Turkey and then through Bulgaria and Romania to Moldova. The state-run Gazprom has thus far rejected this option, citing an alleged debt Chisinau owes to Russia for past gas purchases. Since 2022, the roughly 2 billion cubic meters of Gazprom gas flowing to Moldova per year have been used only by the Transnistria region, while the rest of the country has switched to European supplies. Gas shortages in Transnistria threaten the whole of Moldova, as the Cuciurgan power plant, located in the Russian-occupied region, supplies electricity to consumers in the rest of the country, the News.ro news outlet reported. Transnistria, a narrow territory at Moldova&apos;s eastern border with Ukraine, has been occupied by Russia since the early 1990s. Local authorities declared a state of emergency over the expected gas transit halt this week. The state of emergency, supported by 56 of the 101 Moldovan lawmakers, will give Chisinau a chance to make this &quot;the last winter when the country can be subject to energy blackmail,&quot; Recean said. Before 2022, Moldova bought all of its gas from Russia, making it vulnerable to Russian extortion. Under recently re-elected President Maia Sandu, the country took a pro-Western turn, launching EU accession talks in June and expelling dozens of suspected Russian spies. Chisinau has repeatedly accused Russia of hybrid campaigns against the country, including election interference, espionage, and a coup plot. Sandu&apos;s administration has also fostered close ties with Ukraine amid the full-scale invasion, providing diplomatic and humanitarian support.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldova-announces-state-of-emergency-over-expected-halt-of-russian-gas/	2024-12-13T04:05:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2178578557.jpg
Putin orders 'emergency support' for struggling Russian coal industry	Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for urgent measures to support the country&#x2019;s coal companies, which face multibillion-dollar losses and risk mass bankruptcies, The Moscow Times reported on Dec. 12. Russia&#x2019;s coal industry has been severely impacted by the loss of Western markets and declining demand in &quot;friendly&quot; nations. Coal companies reported a combined loss of 91 billion rubles ($873 million) in the first nine months of 2024. Russia&apos;s Energy Minister Sergey Tsivilev announced that a package of assistance for coal miners would be developed &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; Tsivilev also highlighted the need for a socio-economic development program for Kuzbass, Russia&apos;s key coal-producing region, which accounts for 60% of the country&apos;s hard coal and 80% of its coking coal output. Russia&#x2019;s coal exports fell by 11.4% to 112.6 million metric tons from January to July, while shipments to China &#x2014; its main coal customer after Western sanctions &#x2014; dropped by 8% in the first half of 2024. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is considering new, harsher oil sanctions against Russia ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration. Oil revenues remain a critical funding source for Russia&apos;s war effort in Ukraine. Russia&#x2019;s economic challenges extend beyond coal and oil. Sanctions have also disrupted operations at the Ozernoye zinc mine, leaving the company unable to replace key equipment. This is expected to impact global zinc supply forecasts for 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-orders-support-for-coal-industry/	2024-12-13T03:13:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1257512425.jpg
Ukraine downs 161 of 287 Russian missiles, drones in mass aerial attack	Ukrainian defenses shot down 81 out of 94 missiles and 80 out of the 193 drones launched by Russia early on Dec. 13, the Air Force said. Russian forces carried out one of the largest aerial strikes against Ukraine, damaging energy facilities across multiple regions. Moscow deployed four Kinzhal air-launched missiles, two Iskander-M ballistic missiles, one Kh-23 North Korean ballistic missile, 55 Kh-101 and Kh-55SM cruise missiles launched from Tu-95MS bomber planes, 24 sea-launched Kalibr missiles, seven Iskander-K cruise missiles, and one Kh-59/69 missile, the Air Force said. The 193 deployed drones included Shahed-type kamikaze drones and unmanned aerial vehicles of an unknown type. Apart from the 80 drones that were shot down, 105 reportedly failed to reach their targets thanks to electronic warfare measures. Ukraine&apos;s F-16 fighter jets were involved in intercepting Russian projectiles, reportedly downing 11 missiles. Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast suffered the &quot;most massive attack during the full-scale war,&quot; Governor Svitlana Onyshchuk announced. Cruise missiles and drones struck critical infrastructure facilities in the region, with no casualties reported at the moment. Regional authorities reported impacts, although specific damage details remain undisclosed. As Russian missiles and drones entered western Ukraine, the Polish Air Force scrambled fighter jets in precautionary measures, continuing its standard protocol during Russian mass strikes near the border. The attack underscores the ongoing threat to Ukraine&#x2019;s critical infrastructure as winter intensifies, with the Defense Forces maintaining robust air defenses against escalating aerial assaults.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-intercepts-majority-of-russian-missiles-and-drones-in-mass-attack/	2024-12-13T02:55:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/shahed.jpg
Ukraine's new Ground Forces chief announces reforms focused on personnel, tech	The newly appointed commander of Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces, General Mykhailo Drapatyi, unveiled plans for fundamental reforms in the branch on Dec. 12, aiming to enhance its effectiveness on the battlefield. The proposed changes include a revamped recruitment system with &quot;zero tolerance for corruption,&quot; improved military training tailored to front-line needs, and integration of advanced technology into training and operational processes. The announcement comes amid reports of personnel shortages in Ukraine&apos;s military. Mobilization efforts have slowed in recent months, leaving front-line units undermanned. Drapatyi emphasized that the Ground Forces should become an &quot;elite&quot; military unit, focusing on personnel, technology, and transparent management. The commander highlighted the importance of reforming training curricula and centers to better prepare soldiers for modern warfare. Social support for service members will also be prioritized under Drapatyi&#x2019;s leadership. The Associated Press reported on Nov. 27 that the U.S. has urged Ukraine to lower its draft age to address these shortages. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller reiterated on Dec. 9 that Washington is prepared to provide additional training and weapons if Kyiv implements this measure. Drapatyi has a distinguished record, including commanding the 58th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade and playing a critical role in the liberation of Mariupol in 2014. President Volodymyr Zelensky, who appointed Drapatyi on Nov. 29, stressed that internal changes in the military are vital to achieving Ukraine&#x2019;s strategic objectives.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-new-ground-forces-commander-announces-major-reforms/	2024-12-13T02:33:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1669365788-1.jpg
Massive fire engulfs warehouse in Russia's Novosibirsk	A massive fire engulfed a warehouse in the Russian city of Novosibirsk in Siberia overnight on Dec. 13, covering 5,000 square meters, Russian media reported. Footage showed flames consuming the multi-story building, with every window alight and parts of the roof collapsing. The warehouse reportedly stored various goods, including plastic products. Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s counter-disinformation center, alleged that the warehouse was a military-linked facility supporting key industries such as energy infrastructure and explosion-proof equipment production. &quot;Not just an ordinary warehouse, but a military facility burned down in Novosibirsk,&quot; Kovalenko said. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. 0:00/1&#xD7;Purported footage of a fire in Novosibirsk, Russia, overnight on Dec. 13, 2024. (Andrii Kovalenko/Telegram)The cause of the fire is currently unclear. Novosibirsk lies around 2,800 kilometers (1,700 miles) east of Moscow and roughly 3,000 kilometers (1,860 miles) from the Ukrainian border. In a separate incident, drones reportedly attacked barracks housing a police regiment in Grozny, Chechnya, overnight on Dec. 12. Ukraine has intensified drone strikes deep into Russian territory, targeting military bases and industrial facilities to disrupt Moscow&#x2019;s war effort in Ukraine. These attacks highlight Kyiv&#x2019;s strategy of undermining Russian infrastructure as the war continues.	https://kyivindependent.com/fire-engulfs-warehouse-in-novosibirsk/	2024-12-13T02:13:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-12_20-58-49--2-.jpg
Russia deals 'massive blow' to Ukraine's thermal power plants, energy company says	Russia targeted DTEK&apos;s thermal power plants during a mass aerial attack on Dec. 13, damaging their equipment, the company said in a statement. Moscow&apos;s forces launched around 90 missiles and 200 drones in one of its largest mass attacks on Ukraine&apos;s power grid as the winter is setting in. &quot;DTEK thermal power plants were attacked. According to preliminary data, there were no casualties,&quot; the company said. The plants&apos; equipment was &quot;seriously damaged,&quot; with energy sector employees already working on repairs. The company does not usually reveal the location of the targeted plants or the full extent of damage due to security reasons. Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast suffered its &quot;most massive attack during the full-scale war,&quot; Governor Svitlana Onyshchuk announced. Cruise missiles and drones struck critical infrastructure facilities in the region, but no casualties were reported at the moment. Energy facilities were targeted in Lviv Oblast, according to regional authorities. Neighboring Ternopil Oblast was also impacted, the regional military administration said without revealing details. &quot;There are no casualties. Critical infrastructure facilities are operating normally,&quot; the Ternopil Oblast authorities said on Telegram. Earlier in the morning, officials said that half of the region&apos;s residents were without power due to emergency shutdowns. This is the 12th mass attack on Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure this year and the ninth that targeted DTEK&apos;s facilities. Russia previously launched a large-scale strike on critical infrastructure on Nov. 28, following a prolonged bombing campaign over the summer and the spring.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-deals-massive-blow-to-ukraines-thermal-power-plants/	2024-12-13T01:46:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2162544943.jpg
Google to suspend payments for Russian app developers, Russian IT portal claims	Google Play will indefinitely halt processing payments to app developers with bank accounts in Russia starting Dec. 26, Habr, a Russian IT portal, reported on Dec. 12, sharing what it says is a message from Google. Such a move would mark a continuation of restrictions imposed by Google in response to Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. In the supposed letter to Russian app developers, Google Play announced it would block all user attempts to purchase paid apps and disable in-app purchases and subscription renewals in Russian apps. Google plans to settle outstanding payments to Russian developers for user purchases before the suspension, with final settlements expected to be completed by Jan. 15, according to the letter. This development comes amid escalating tensions between Google and Russian authorities. On Oct. 29, a Russian court fined the tech giant $2.5 decillion for allegedly blocking pro-Kremlin propaganda on YouTube. A 100,000-ruble fine (now $960) was originally imposed in 2020, and under Russian law, the penalty has been multiplied weekly.	https://kyivindependent.com/google-play-allegedly-to-suspend-payments-for-russian-app-developers/	2024-12-13T01:15:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2150745043.jpg
Trump tells Macron, Zelensky he wants European troops monitoring Ukraine ceasefire, WSJ reports	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump wants European troops to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal reported on Dec. 12, citing undisclosed official sources. Trump reportedly made the comments during his Dec. 7 meeting with Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, making it clear he wants to see Europe take up the leadership in deterring Russian aggression. Trump, who has pledged to end the war within &quot;24 hours&quot; and reduce U.S. involvement in Ukraine, is reportedly drafting proposals with his transition team, though key decisions will be finalized after his national security team is in place. The idea of deploying European peacekeepers was reportedly discussed by British and French officials, and Macron was said to have presented the idea to Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in Warsaw on Dec. 12. Tusk later dismissed the notion during a press conference, saying that no such proposal is on the table for Poland. During the Paris meeting, Trump reportedly reiterated his opposition to Ukraine joining NATO but emphasized his desire for Ukraine to remain strong and well-armed after the war. Kyiv continues to insist on an invitation to the alliance. Trump also urged European leaders to pressure China into influencing Russia to end the conflict, suggesting tariffs on Chinese goods as a potential lever. Earlier reports from the Wall Street Journal on Nov. 6 indicated that Trump&#x2019;s team is considering a plan to delay Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for continued Western arms supplies. Speaking to Time magazine, Trump indicated he does not plan to &quot;abandon&quot; Ukraine but instead use U.S. support as leverage to pressure Moscow to the negotiating table. At the same time, he criticized the Biden administration for allowing long-range strikes inside Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-proposes-european-troop-deployment-to-monitor-ukraine-ceasefire-wsj/	2024-12-13T00:23:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-688109050.jpg
Russia jails 2 Ukrainian soldiers deployed in Kursk Oblast for 14, 15 years	A military court in Moscow sentenced captured Ukrainian soldiers who fought in Kursk Oblast, Vitalii Panchenko and Ivan Dmytrakov, to 14 and 15 years in prison, respectively, Russia&#x2019;s state-owned TASS news agency reported on Dec. 12. The court convicted the soldiers of &quot;terrorism,&quot; accusing them of &quot;opening fire to kill both Russian servicemen and civilians.&quot; Russia often uses trumped-up charges to jail captured Ukrainian soldiers, activists, journalists, and regular civilians for lengthy terms. According to the court, Panchenko and Dmytrakov, who served in Ukraine&#x2019;s 61st Separate Mechanized Brigade, crossed the Russian border into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 7. Ukrainian forces continue to hold on to a part of the embattled Russian region as Moscow&apos;s forces are attempting to push Kyiv&apos;s troops out. Russia&apos;s Investigative Committee also accused the two servicemen of &quot;illegally crossing the state border,&quot; even though Russian forces wage an all-out war on Ukrainian territory. The committee further claimed that they abducted three Russian citizens to Ukraine and that Panchenko and other Ukrainian soldiers looted a grocery store in the Ukraine-held town of Sudzha. Both Panchenko and Dmytrakov will serve the first three years of their sentences in prison, followed by strict regime penal colonies. The statement does not specify whether the two soldiers pleaded guilty. Ukrainian officials said that the vast majority of Ukrainian soldiers captured by Russia are subjected to physical and psychological torture. The Russian media report that this is the first sentence issued by a Russian court against Ukrainian service members over alleged acts in Kursk Oblast. In a separate case, Russian occupation authorities in Donetsk jailed nine Ukrainian soldiers captured after defending Mariupol to between 24 years and a life sentence, the city&apos;s exiled authorities reported on Dec. 11. While Ukraine has successfully facilitated the release of some captives through prisoner exchanges, many Ukrainians remain in Russian captivity, often under severe conditions.	https://kyivindependent.com/moscow-military-court-imprisons-ukrainian-soldiers-for-alleged-terrorism/	2024-12-12T23:24:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-971082016.jpg
UNESCO grants enhanced protection to 2 Ukrainian cultural sites	UNESCO has added Ukraine&apos;s Babyn Yar Memorial and the Odesa Literary Museum to its international list of Cultural Property under Enhanced Protection, the Culture Ministry announced on Dec. 12. Deputy Culture Minister Anastasiia Bondar highlighted the significance of the additions, describing Babyn Yar as a &quot;reminder of one of the darkest pages of human history&quot; and the Odesa Literary Museum as a &quot;steadfast symbol of Ukrainian culture&quot; amid daily Russian attacks The Babyn Yar site commemorates the mass murder of nearly 34,000 Jews by Nazi forces near Kyiv in September 1941, as well as over 100,000 other victims, including Soviet prisoners of war and Romani people. The historic center of Odesa has faced significant damage due to Russian missile strikes, including an attack on July 2023 that damaged over 20 architectural monuments and heavily damaged the Transfiguration Cathedral. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, the Culture Ministry has documented 1,222 cases of destruction of cultural heritage sites, including those under UNESCO protection. Russia&#x2019;s bombardment of Ukraine&#x2019;s cultural heritage sites has drawn condemnation from UNESCO, which confirmed damage to 457 sites as of Oct. 21. These include religious buildings, museums, monuments, libraries, and other structures of historical or artistic significance.	https://kyivindependent.com/unesco-grants-protection-to-two-ukrainian-cultural-sites/	2024-12-12T23:03:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1697750399.jpeg
US announces visa bans for individuals over undermining Georgian democracy	The U.S. State Department announced visa bans on approximately 20 Georgian individuals for undermining democracy in the country, according to the department&#x2019;s statement on Dec. 12. The ban will extend to Georgian ministers, parliament members, security officials, and private individuals. The move comes amid daily protests in Georgia that began after Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said the EU accession talks would be suspended until 2028. Hundreds of protestors have been detained, with dozens reported injured as the Georgian police deployed tear gas and water cannons. The U.S. condemned the ruling Georgian Dream party, saying, &quot;The Georgian Dream party has turned its back on the Euro-Atlantic future for Georgia, which is desired by the vast majority of the Georgian people and enshrined in the Georgian constitution.&quot; The State Department also noted that additional measures are being prepared, including sanctions. Georgian Dream, which declared victory in the October elections broadly disputed by domestic opposition and international observers, has been accused of democratic backsliding and dragging Georgia into the Kremlin&apos;s orbit. &quot;The United States strongly condemns the Georgian Dream party&#x2019;s ongoing, brutal, and unjustified violence against Georgian citizens, including protesters, members of the media, human rights activists, and opposition figures,&quot; the U.S. State Department&#x2019;s statement said. In response to the crackdown, the Baltic countries and Ukraine have imposed sanctions on Bidzina Ivanishvili, founder of Georgian Dream, and other officials for their role in suppressing the protests.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-announces-visa-bans-on-individuals-for-undermining-georgian-democracy/	2024-12-12T22:33:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1985748928.jpg

IAEA Board condemns attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure without mention of Russia	The 35-nation IAEA Board of Governors passed a resolution condemning attacks on Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure but did not explicitly name Russia as responsible, Reuters reported on Dec. 12. The emergency meeting, called by Ukraine, addressed the large-scale drone and missile attack on Nov. 28 that caused severe power outages and disrupted off-site power to three nuclear plants, posing a significant nuclear safety risk. The attack targeted energy infrastructure across the country, including the far-western regions. Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said that Russia struck a &quot;massive blow&quot; at the nation&apos;s power grid, with attacks on energy infrastructure occurring throughout the country. Ukrenergo, the state grid operator, announced emergency blackouts in multiple regions in an effort to safeguard the energy system from Russia&apos;s assault. Of the 35-member IAEA board, 22 countries supported the resolution, 10 abstained, and Russia and China voted against it. &#x201C;The Board of Governors emphasizes that attacks targeting Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure critical for the off-site power supply of nuclear power plants represent a direct threat to nuclear safety and security,&#x201D; the resolution stated. No mention of Russia was included, which is unlike previous resolutions where Russia was named as the perpetrator.	https://kyivindependent.com/iaea-board-condemns-attacks-on-ukraines-energy-infrastructure-without-mention-of-russia/	2024-12-12T19:57:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1258719231.jpg
Ukrainian military instructors to undergo NATO-standard training in Lithuania	Ukrainian military instructors will receive training in Lithuania in 2025 as part of NATO&apos;s Defense Education Enhancement Program (DEEP), the Ministry of Defense reported on Dec. 12. The agreement was reached during a meeting between Ukraine&apos;s Deputy Minister of Defense, Serhiy Melnyk, and Lithuania&#x2019;s military education advisor, Stasis Paldunas. The program will initially train 30 Ukrainian instructors, focusing on non-commissioned officers with combat experience. Additionally, a pilot project for combat shooting instructor training will be launched in two Ukrainian military institutions, introducing modern NATO teaching methods. &quot;Improving military education and combat training is one of the key tasks for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We are grateful to our partners for the support that allows us to integrate modern NATO standards into our training system,&quot; Melnyk said. Kyiv has consistently argued that NATO membership is the only path to lasting peace. While acknowledging that full membership is unfeasible during the ongoing war, Ukrainian officials are pressing for a formal invitation to signal solidarity and commitment from NATO allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-military-instructors-to-undergo-nato-standard-training-in-lithuania/	2024-12-12T18:21:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2161623541.jpg
US announces over $440 million in economic aid for Ukraine	The United States will provide Ukraine with over $440 million in aid for key sectors of its economy, Richard Verma, U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine&apos;s Economic Recovery, announced on Dec. 12. The announcement comes as outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden aims to ramp up support for Ukraine before President-elect Donald Trump takes power in January. The economic aid package is comprised of four key parts, including $223 million to rebuild transportation, infrastructure, and logistics, Verma announced in a social media post. Another $105 million will be used to train Ukrainians for &quot;tomorrow&apos;s jobs&quot; in reconstruction and industry, while $74.7 million will support Ukraine&apos;s agriculture sector. A further $35 million is allocated for the &quot;Project Preparation Facility,&quot; which aims to increase and accelerate upcoming construction projects. The White House on Dec. 12 also announced a new weapons package of an unspecified amount for Ukraine. The assistance will include air defense, armored vehicles, and artillery. Verma took the role of U.S Special Representative for Ukraine&apos;s Economic Recovery in August after the previous representative, Penny Pritzker, stepped down. Ukraine relies heavily on economic aid from Western partners to keep the country running amid Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted in April 2024 that Ukraine would need over $40 billion in external financing this year. The U.S., EU and other Western partners agreed in 2024 to furnish Ukraine with a loan totaling $50 billion, to be repaid with revenue from frozen Russian assets. Details of the loan agreements are currently being finalized.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-announces-over-440-million-in-economic-aid-for-ukraine/	2024-12-12T15:34:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1678974518-1.jpg
Russian guided bomb attacks fall sharply after ATACMS, Storm Shadow strikes, analysts say	Russian attacks against Ukraine with guided aerial bombs have fallen over 50% since Western partners allowed Kyiv to target Russia with long-range missiles, the independent Russian outlet Agentstvo reported on Dec. 12, citing reports from the General Staff. U.S. President Joe Biden gave Ukraine the green light to attack Russian territory with ATACMS missiles in mid-November. Within days, Kyiv reportedly also launched British Storm Shadows into Russia for the first time. Russia carried out heavy guided bomb attacks against Ukraine from Nov. 1-20, Agentstvo reported, citing daily updates from the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. Russia dropped at least 100 guided aerial bombs per day during that period, with the exception of only one day. Those numbers fell significantly after Nov. 20, according to General Staff reports. Russia dropped 138 guided bombs on Nov. 20, marking the last time that the Russian Aerospace Forces targeted Ukraine with over 100 bombs in a single day. Russian aircraft have launched fewer guided bombs on Ukraine in the first 12 days of December. The number of bombs topped 50 on only five days, according to the General Staff. The average number of bombs per day is now 40 or fewer. &#xA0; Oliver Alexander, an open-source intelligence (OSINT) analyst, said the decrease was likely due to the threat long-range missile attacks posed to Russian airfields. The Russian military may have been forced to move their Su-34 aircraft farther than 600 kilometers from the front line to avoid ATACMS strikes, affecting &quot;maintenance, sorties rate, and flight hours,&quot; he said in a post on X. Guided aerial bombs are precision-guided munitions that have a shorter range than missiles, but are far cheaper to produce. President Volodymyr Zelensky lobbied aggressively for long-range strike permissions, in order to target Russian military airfields amid intensifying aerial attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-guided-bomb-attacks-fall-sharply-after-atacms-storm-shadow-strikes-analysts-say/	2024-12-12T14:39:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2150659058.jpg
Ukraine's largest steelmaker suspends operations at Pokrovsk coal mine	Metinvest, Ukraine&apos;s largest steel producer, has suspended operations at its Pischane coal plant near the front-line town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, the company announced in a statement on Dec. 12. The closure comes amid an increasingly dangerous Russian advance towards Pokrovsk, a key Ukrainian logistics hub. Ukraine lost key positions near the town to advancing Russian troops over the past day. Metinvest said it was closing the Pokrovsk site, which includes a mine and an administrative building, due to intensified shelling in the area. The company also said the front line was expanding and moving closer to the mine. Core personnel have been evacuated along with their families, the statement said. &#xA0; Metinvest will continue to monitor the security situation alongside local authorities, the company said. Decisions regarding the plant will be made as the situation on the frontline evolves. Pischane is the largest coking coal producer in Ukraine, and one of the largest in Eastern Europe. The site provided half of Metinvest&apos;s coal volume, used to produce steel at the company&apos;s many plants. Loss of the mine would be a major blow to Ukraine&apos;s steel production industry. The closure of the plant could diminish Ukrainian steel production to only 2-3 million metric tons, down from a projected 7.5 million by the end of 2024, Oleksandr Kalenkov, the head of Ukraine&apos;s steelmakers&apos; association, said on Oct. 16. The Metinvest steel company has already faced significant losses amid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. The company lost the infamous Azovstal plant in the early days of the full-scale invasion. The plant was the last line of defense for Ukrainian troops against the Russian occupation of Mariupol. Steel production is one of Ukraine&apos;s leading industries, and the second-largest source of foreign currency after agriculture.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-largest-steelmaker-suspends-operations-at-donetsk-oblast-site/	2024-12-12T13:52:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1405672995.jpg
White House announces new weapons package for Kyiv	The United States has approved a new weapons package for Ukraine, U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said during a White House press briefing Dec. 12. The announcement comes as outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden attempts to hasten shipments of military aid to Ukraine ahead of President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s inauguration in January. &quot;Today, the president approved a new security assistance package for Ukraine that will provide them with additional air defense, artillery, drones, and armored vehicles,&quot; Kirby said. The latest package marks the 72nd shipment of U.S. military aid under the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA), which allows the U.S. to transfer weapons from existing stockpiles to allies in urgent situations. Kirby did not specify the dollar amount attached to the new round of assistance, but said Biden was committed to ongoing aid deliveries. &quot;We&apos;re going to provide additional packages right up to the end of this administration,&quot; he said. Two days prior, the U.S. on Dec. 10 announced a $20 billion loan to Ukraine backed by frozen Russian assets. The loan is the culmination of a Group of Seven (G7) deal to lend Kyiv a total $50 billion, all supported by proceeds from frozen Russian funds. The Pentagon on Dec. 7 also announced an arms package for Ukraine worth nearly $1 billion. The White House aims to send a large-scale influx of weapons to Kyiv before Jan. 20, when Trump officially begins his term. The stated aim is to improve Ukraine&apos;s negotiating leverage before Trump withdraws U.S. aid and pressures Kyiv to strike a deal with Moscow. Trump told Time magazine on Dec. 12 that his administration will not &quot;abandon&quot; Ukraine, but will use U.S. aid to urge a negotiated resolution.	https://kyivindependent.com/white-house-announces-new-weapons-package-for-kyiv/	2024-12-12T12:58:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2013302423.jpg

Ukraine war latest: Trump hints he won't 'abandon' Kyiv but opposes Ukraine launching US missiles inside Russia	Key developments on Dec. 12: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said he &quot;very vehemently&quot; disagrees with Ukraine using U.S.-made missiles to strike targets &quot;hundreds of miles&quot; inside Russia, the Time magazine reported on Dec. 12. Members of Trump&apos;s inner circle previously criticized the outgoing Biden administration&apos;s decision to ease restrictions on long-range strikes, though this is the first time the president-elect has spoken against it publicly himself. &quot;I disagree very vehemently with sending missiles hundreds of miles into Russia. Why are we doing that?&quot; Trump told Time as the magazine named him Person of the Year. &quot;We&#x2019;re just escalating this war and making it worse.&quot; The U.S. president-elect has criticized the level of support the Biden administration provided to Ukraine and signaled Kyiv should brace for reduced assistance once he takes office in January. While he boasted many times during his campaign that he would end the war within 24 hours, Trump admitted to Time that Russia&apos;s invasion is even more complex than the situation in the Middle East. &quot;The numbers of dead young soldiers lying on fields all over the place are staggering. It&#x2019;s crazy what&#x2019;s taking place.&quot; When asked whether he would cut support for Ukraine, Trump said he instead seeks to leverage the U.S. aid to push the Kremlin to the negotiating table. &quot;I want to reach an agreement, and the only way you&#x2019;re going to reach an agreement is not to abandon.&quot; Trump met President Volodymyr Zelensky in Paris on Dec. 7 to discuss the ongoing war and possible ways to end it. Reuters wrote that while the two did not discuss specifics of any concrete peace plan, Trump called for an immediate ceasefire while Zelensky stressed the need for security guarantees. Following his meeting with Zelensky, Trump said the Ukrainian leader is ready &quot;to make a deal and stop the madness&quot; and that Putin should do the same after incurring staggering losses in Ukraine. &quot;Too many lives are being so needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed, and if it keeps going, it can turn into something much bigger, and far worse,&quot; Trump wrote on Social Truth on Dec. 8. Zelensky addressed Trump&apos;s post on his Telegram channel on Dec. 8, saying the war &quot;cannot be ended simply with a piece of paper and a few signatures,&quot; warning that &quot;a ceasefire without guarantees can be reignited at any moment, as Putin has already done in the past.&quot; The Ukrainian president has signaled openness to a diplomatic end to the war as the Russian advance picked up pace in the east while Ukraine&apos;s resources grow thin. Drones attacked the barracks of a police regiment in Grozny, Chechnya, overnight on Dec. 12, according to local media and Chechen strong man Ramzan Kadyrov. The attack damaged the roof of the building, shattered windows, and lightly injured four men on guard duty, Kadyrov claimed. This marks the third reported drone strike against Chechnya during Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. The previous attack occurred just one week prior, on Dec. 4, while the first was reported in late October of this year. According to Kadyrov, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was shot down over police barracks near 1 a.m. on Dec. 12. &quot;No one was seriously injured. Four guards received minor injuries,&quot; he alleged. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The targeted police regiment building was named after Akhmat Kadyrov, the first Russian-backed head of Chechnya. The same building was reportedly struck a week earlier during a drone attack on Dec. 4. Prior to that, the first reported drone attack struck Chechnya on Oct. 29. After initially reporting no casualties, Kadyrov later alleged that Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) had been killed, boasting that they had been used as human shields. Kadyrov blamed the drone attack on Ukraine, though Kyiv did not claim responsibility for the attack. A Ukrainian intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent the Oct. 29 strike likely came from the neighboring republics of Dagestan or Ingushetia. During a press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron on Dec. 12, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk addressed speculation about a possible peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, emphasizing that no such actions are currently planned. &#x201C;Decisions on Polish actions will be made in Warsaw and only in Warsaw. We are not currently planning such actions,&#x201D; Tusk stated, aiming to &quot;end speculation&quot; on the topic. Macron, in turn, stressed that Ukraine should determine its course of action, saying, &#x201C;Strong security in Ukraine means strong security in Europe,&#x201D; while highlighting the importance of providing Kyiv with security guarantees. Tusk, whose country takes over the EU Council&apos;s presidency in January, said peace talks could begin as early as this winter. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responded on Dec. 9 to Macron&apos;s suggestion of deploying foreign peacekeepers, saying Ukraine &quot;may consider&quot; the proposal but only after securing a clear timeline for NATO membership. Recent reports suggest that the U.K. and France are considering deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has also not ruled out the possibility. The concept of European troops overseeing a peaceful post-war Ukraine has reportedly been included in a peace plan developed by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s team. Ukraine&apos;s leadership continues to prioritize NATO integration as its primary security objective. The $895 billion U.S. defense bill passed by the House of Representatives did not include a provision to extend the lend-lease act for Ukraine despite the efforts of Ukrainian diplomats, Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, said on Dec. 12. The U.S. passed the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act in May 2022, but it expired in September 2023 without ever being used. Ukrainian diplomats have been lobbying for its reintroduction as it allows the U.S. president to loan or lease arms to Ukraine while cutting through congressional red tape. &quot;The Embassy continues to actively work to preserve this mechanism,&quot; Markarova said. In April, a bipartisan group of senators proposed to reintroduce the lend-lease act through the fiscal year 2026. The future of U.S. support for Ukraine hangs in the air as President-elect Donald Trump has already hinted that Kyiv should expect reduced assistance after he takes office in January. These concerns prompted the outgoing Biden administration to speed up the arms delivery and use up the remaining $4-5 billion left in the presidential drawdown authority. The House&apos;s defense bill, which the Senate will vote on next week, also did not include funds for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) in 2025, as those were already provided in the previous spending bill in the amount of $300 million, Markarova said. The USAI is a Pentagon-led program for supplying arms to Ukraine through contracts with U.S. defense companies. The bill did include a ban on the use of funds for any actions that could lead to recognition of Russian occupation in Ukraine and a request for an inter-departmental report on Moscow&apos;s financing of international terrorism. It also contained a proposal to establish the Center of Excellence for developing AI-based weapons in cooperation with foreign partners, including Ukraine. The support for Ukraine may face an increasingly uphill battle as the Republican Party has not only maintained control over the House but also won the Senate majority in the November elections. It was the opposition from parts of the Republican Party that delayed a $61 billion aid bill earlier this year, contributing to battlefield setbacks for Ukraine. House Speaker Mike Johnson also rejected a vote on the last-minute proposal by President Joe Biden for a $24 billion package to assist Ukraine and replenish arms. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban did not approach Ukraine regarding his ceasefire and prisoner exchange proposal, a Ukrainian presidential adviser told Suspilne on Dec. 11. The Hungarian side &quot;did not discuss anything&quot; with Ukraine and &quot;did not warn about its contacts with Moscow,&quot; said Dmytro Lytvyn, the presidential communications adviser, referring to Orban&#x2019;s recent phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Orban criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier on X for allegedly rejecting his Christmas truce proposal, reacting to an earlier post by Zelensky. Zelensky&#x2019;s original post did not mention any ceasefire or prisoner exchange; instead, the Ukrainian president criticized Orban for calling Putin. Ukraine and Russia held numerous prisoner exchanges throughout the full-scale war with the mediation of a third-party country. The most recent swap occurred in mid-October, with each side bringing back 95 prisoners. The Kremlin was quick to issue a statement following Orban&apos;s comment, shifting the blame on Ukraine. &quot;Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, during yesterday&apos;s telephone conversation with President Putin, proposed on the eve of Christmas to carry out a major prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine, as well as to announce a Christmas ceasefire,&quot; Peskov said, adding that Kyiv had &quot;rejected all of Orban&apos;s proposals.&quot; Lytvyn said that Ukraine is &quot;working daily for the release of prisoners&quot; and that a major prisoner swap by the end of the year is being discussed, though denying any contact between Kyiv and Budapest on the matter. &quot;As always, we don&apos;t need PR, but a just peace, and not words, but reliable security guarantees,&quot; the advisor said. Hungary has retained warm economic and diplomatic ties with Moscow even after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, criticizing EU sanctions against Russia and obstructing military aid for Kyiv. A scandal involving Hungary and Ukrainian POWs arose in June 2023. Without consultations with Ukraine, Hungary transferred 11 Ukrainian soldiers of Hungarian ethnic origin from Russian captivity. Even after the successful exchange, Budapest refused to provide any information to Kyiv about the Ukrainian citizens for weeks, further undermining Ukraine&apos;s trust.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-trump-hints-he-wont-abandon-kyiv-but-opposes-ukraine-launching-us-missiles-inside-russia/	2024-12-12T12:08:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183887240.jpg
Russian occupation court sentences Ukrainian to 11 years for alleged espionage	A Russian-controlled court in occupied Donetsk Oblast sentenced 20-year-old Mikhail Karimov, a resident of Mariupol, to 11 years in a strict regime penal colony, Mariupol City Council reported on Dec. 12. Karimov was accused of allegedly providing Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR) with information about Russian troop locations and movements between December 2022 and June 2023. Mariupol City Council noted that Russian-set authorities have intensified efforts to identify and prosecute so-called &quot;spies&quot; and &quot;saboteurs&quot; in occupied territories, with numerous court hearings being held for those accused of opposing the Russian occupation. In a similar case, a Russian-controlled court in occupied Crimea sentenced a 33-year-old man to 15 years in a strict regime penal colony on Dec. 9. He was accused of state treason for allegedly passing information about Russian military equipment movements and a military facility under construction to Ukraine&#x2019;s Ministry of Defense between December 2022 and March 2023. These actions reflect an ongoing crackdown by Russian occupation authorities against individuals they claim to be working against their forces in occupied Ukrainian territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-controlled-court-sentence-ukrainian-for-alleged-espionage-in-occupied-donetsk-oblast/	2024-12-12T11:29:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1249615636.jpg
301 Ukrainian women held in Russian captivity, rights group reports	As of December 2024, 301 Ukrainian civilian women are in Russian captivity, with 25 detained before Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and 276 taken since, according to Olha Skrypnyk, head of the Crimean Human Rights Group (CHRG), speaking on Dec. 11. &#x201C;These are not the final figures; there are many more women in Russian captivity. It is very difficult to confirm this because Russia refuses to provide information about civilians,&#x201D; Skrypnyk said, highlighting that the number of women detained after Feb. 24, 2022, is 11 times higher than before. Skrypnyk stressed that the primary government priority is to secure the release of all prisoners of war and civilians, noting the importance of post-release assistance. She called for clear measures to support former hostages and their families, urging the continuation of the Commission for establishing the fact of deprivation of personal freedom to facilitate state assistance. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, at least 177 Ukrainian prisoners have died in captivity, according to Victoria Tsymbaliuk of the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of Prisoners of War. Additionally, at least 19,500 Ukrainian children have been abducted by Russia, with fewer than 400 returned home, according to the Children of War database. Ukraine continues to advocate for an all-for-all prisoner exchange, which was a key topic during the peace summit held in Switzerland in June.	https://kyivindependent.com/301-ukrainian-women-held-in-russian-captivity-rights-group-reports/	2024-12-12T11:24:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/skripnik.jpg
Xi Jinping reaffirms China's stance on Ukraine war settlement	Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated China&apos;s position on resolving the war in Ukraine during a meeting with Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of Russia&apos;s Security Council, on Dec. 12, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry. Xi emphasized three principles: &quot;preventing the conflict from expanding beyond the combat zone, preventing the escalation of hostilities, and preventing any party from fomenting the conflict.&quot; He called for international efforts to create &quot;favorable conditions&quot; for a political settlement and reaffirmed &quot;Beijing&apos;s neutrality.&quot; Despite claims of neutrality, Beijing has faced scrutiny for its role in supporting Russia&apos;s war effort. Reports suggest China has supplied dual-use goods that bolster Russia&#x2019;s defense industry. In November, media sources revealed that the EU had obtained evidence of Chinese lethal support to Moscow, including attack drones. Ukraine invited China to the peace summit back in January, but Beijing declined the invitation as the terms they required to attend were not met. China&apos;s leadership has denied providing military aid to either side in the conflict, maintaining its official stance of advocating for diplomatic resolution while facing international criticism for its ties with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/xi-jinping-reaffirms-chinas-stance-on-ukraine-war-settlement/	2024-12-12T10:30:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/Xiii.jpg
NATO chief warns alliance 'unprepared' for Russian threats, calls for increased defense spending	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned on Dec. 12 that the alliance is not ready for the threats it will face from Russia in the coming years, urging a shift to a wartime mindset with significantly higher defense spending. Rutte highlighted that NATO members spent more than 3% of GDP on defense during the Cold War and argued that future spending should exceed the current 2% target. &#x201C;Russia is preparing for a long-term confrontation with Ukraine and with us,&#x201D; he said, adding that its hostile actions against allied states are escalating. While NATO&#x2019;s current deterrence is effective, Rutte expressed concern about the alliance&#x2019;s future readiness. &#x201C;We are not prepared for what awaits us in four or five years. The danger is heading our way at full speed. What is happening in Ukraine could happen here,&#x201D; he cautioned. Rutte also pointed out that Russia has already shifted its economy to a wartime footing, with defense spending projected to reach 7-8% of GDP by 2025, the highest since the Cold War. Though there is no immediate threat to NATO&#x2019;s 32 member states, Rutte insisted that preparedness is essential regardless of the war&#x2019;s outcome in Ukraine. European NATO foreign ministers are reportedly considering gradually raising the alliance&#x2019;s defense spending target to 3% of GDP by 2030, according to Financial Times. Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine has exposed significant manufacturing and procurement gaps in Western defense industries, prompting urgent calls to bolster production capabilities. The urgency of these efforts could increase under U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has previously criticized NATO allies for not meeting defense spending criteria. Trump has suggested reducing U.S. support for NATO countries that fail to meet their commitments and has hinted at scaling back aid for Ukraine. His presidency, beginning in January 2025, may push European countries to take on greater responsibility for their defense.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-chief-warns-alliance-unprepared-for-russian-threats-calls-for-increased-defense-spending/	2024-12-12T09:31:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2184023227.jpg
Ukraine sentences Russian Duma chairman Volodin to 15 years in absentia	Vyacheslav Volodin, chairman of Russia&#x2019;s State Duma, has been sentenced in absentia to 15 years by a Ukrainian court, Ukraine&#x2019;s State Security Service (SBU) reported on Dec. 12. The investigation identified Volodin as a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and a key figure in the lead-up to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. On Feb. 15, 2022, Volodin presided over a Duma session that approved a resolution urging Putin to recognize the &quot;independence&quot; of the occupied Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. Volodin publicly backed this resolution and ensured it received the necessary votes from Russian deputies. He later organized the ratification of the so-called &quot;Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance&quot; between the Kremlin and the occupied territories. These legislative actions were instrumental in Moscow&apos;s justification for launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Since the invasion, Volodin has continued to publicly support Russia&apos;s war effort, frequently using Duma sessions and state media appearances to propagate Kremlin narratives. As of November 2024, Ukraine&#x2019;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office reported charging 730 individuals and convicting 137 for committing war crimes in Ukraine. Volodin&#x2019;s sentencing underscores Kyiv&apos;s ongoing efforts to hold Russian officials accountable for their roles in the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-sentences-russian-duma-chairman-volodin-to-15-years-in-absentia/	2024-12-12T08:40:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1855401938.jpg
French ambassador to Ukraine assures continued support for Kyiv under new government	French Ambassador to Ukraine Gael Veyssiere expressed confidence that France&apos;s policy of assistance to Ukraine would remain unchanged following the appointment of a new prime minister, Interfax-Ukraine reported on Dec. 12. &#x201C;The President clearly said that France will continue to support Ukraine in the military sphere. And we will do everything possible and necessary to help the Ukrainians. So we can even increase our support,&#x201D; Veyssiere said, emphasizing the broad political consensus in the National Assembly for backing Ukraine, despite some dissenting voices. Veyssiere dismissed concerns that France&apos;s challenging political situation might reduce military support, stating, &#x201C;Definitely not.&#x201D; He reaffirmed that successive French governments have consistently supported Ukraine and that the new administration would maintain this policy. Macron is set to appoint a new prime minister following the resignation of French Prime Minister Michel Barnier. Macron did not provide a firm deadline for the appointment. France has supplied Ukraine with SCALP/T missiles, which have been used against Russian targets in occupied territories. Earlier this year, President Emmanuel Macron supported Ukraine&#x2019;s right to strike military targets in Russia, arguing that Moscow was exploiting Western missile restrictions. Macron has also revisited the idea of deploying Western troops to Ukraine if Russia breaches the frontlines and Kyiv requests assistance, a suggestion first raised in February and revisited in May. The discussion underscores broader debates among European leaders over the extent of military support for Ukraine as it continues to face Russian aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/french-ambassador-assures-continued-support-for-ukraine-under-new-government/	2024-12-12T07:36:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/0x0--2-.jpeg
EBRD co-launches $116 million guarantee for Ukraine war-risk insurance	The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Aon risk management firm launched a 110-million-euro ($116 million) guarantee program to help insurers cover some war-related risks in Ukraine, the EBRD announced on Dec. 12. Ukraine&apos;s insurance companies have struggled to offer war insurance services as international reinsurers have largely withdrawn from the market after the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale war in 2022. The EBRD&apos;s new Ukraine Recovery and Reconstruction Guarantee Facility will help reinsurance companies cover risks connected to land-based transport, focusing on small and medium businesses. It currently does not extend to fixed assets or maritime transport, though the bank said in a press release that the program may evolve based on market demand. In August, the Marsh McLennan risk management company launched a $50 million insurance facility for grain shipped via the Black Sea. The EBRD&apos;s facility was launched with the support of European donors and in partnership with the Ukraine-based insurance companies INGO, Colonnade, and Uniqua, as well as the international reinsurer MS Amlin, enabling the companies to ensure higher amounts. The program does not include a pre-determined list of companies that will be involved, meaning that it will respond to market demand. The EBRD said the facility should enable insurance coverage for over 1 billion euros ($1.05 billion) in vehicles and goods in transit annually. Active in Ukraine throughout the full-scale war, the EBRD is an international investment institution that has invested more than $5.6 billion in Ukraine since February 2022. Aon is a British-American professional services company founded by American billionaire Pat Ryan. &quot;The EBRD&#x2019;s guarantee will enable private-sector reinsurers to re-engage on Ukrainian war risk and build a resilient insurance market in Ukraine,&quot; EBRD President Odile Renaud-Basso said in a statement. &quot;This is crucial to giving businesses confidence that their assets are protected, which, in turn, will unlock and accelerate investment in Ukraine.&quot; The program was coordinated with Ukraine&apos;s Economy Ministry and the National Bank. &quot;We are sincerely grateful to the EBRD and all parties involved in launching this insurance mechanism. The market has been eagerly anticipating it,&quot; Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said. &quot;I am confident that this mechanism will provide much-needed support for small andmedium-sized businesses, which have been severely affected by the war.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ebrd-co-launches-116-million-ukraine-war-insurance-capacity/	2024-12-12T07:13:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1236358012.jpg
Russia, India sign record oil supply deal, Reuters reports	Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft and Indian refining giant Reliance Industries have finalized a landmark agreement to supply 500,000 barrels of oil daily for the next 10 years, Reuters reported on Dec. 12. The deal marks the largest energy partnership between the two nations, valued at approximately $13 billion annually at current market prices. India, now the biggest importer of Russian oil, benefits from discounted grades like Urals, enabling significant cost savings for its refiners. This agreement also intensifies competition with Middle Eastern oil producers, particularly Saudi Arabia, as they vie for a share of India&#x2019;s rapidly growing energy market. While India has maintained its call for a diplomatic resolution to Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, it continues to deepen economic ties with Moscow. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in July. The two countries identified nine areas for enhanced cooperation, ranging from nuclear energy to medicine. India and Russia also aim to boost bilateral trade by over 50%, targeting $100 billion annually by 2030.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-india-sign-record-oil-supply-deal-reuters-says/	2024-12-12T07:03:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-657337832.jpg

Hungary did not discuss any Christmas truce, prisoner swap with Ukraine, Presidential Office says	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban did not approach Ukraine regarding his ceasefire and prisoner exchange proposal, a Ukrainian presidential adviser told Suspilne on Dec. 11.

Spend With Ukraine wants to ‘build a better brand’ for the country	Editor&#x2019;s note: This article is part of a series of profiles highlighting successful Ukrainian startups and businesses. The series is funded by the regional investment fund Ukraine-Moldova American Enterprise Fund (UMAEF) and created in partnership with Spend With Ukraine, a non-profit organization that launched a platform to showcase businesses with Ukrainian roots and provide one more meaningful way to support Ukraine &#x2013; by choosing to spend with Ukraine. The series&#x2019; sponsors are not involved in the editorial process of the writing of these profiles. Ukraine has long suffered from what could be called a &#x201C;brand problem.&#x201D; For decades, the country remained little-known and seldom explored by outsiders. When the message did get out, it was too often one of a turbulent transition to democracy, struggles with rooting out corruption, and war. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion, many of Ukraine&#x2019;s creators sought to harness the global attention on the war by adding to the conversation with a different message. Since 2022, they have created various online platforms promoting and highlighting successful Ukrainian brands and companies. &#x201C;There are all these creative businesses and nobody has the slightest idea they&#x2019;re rooted in Ukraine,&#x201D; said Andrey Klen, co-founder of pet tech company Petcube and co-creator of Spend With Ukraine, a website that promotes over 200 successful and reputable Ukrainian brands and services from tech companies to fashion brands. The Spend With Ukraine platform is &#x201C;just one way to get the message across&#x201D; to show the world what Ukraine has to offer and ultimately, &#x201C;build a better brand,&#x201D; Klen told the Kyiv Independent. Every country has its &#x201C;brand,&#x201D; its external reputation that governs how the world perceives and judges it. Take France, renowned for its fashion, or Japan, for its advanced technology, or the Scandinavian countries for their minimalist furniture. Having a good &#x201C;brand&#x201D; can go a long way for a country. It often dictates how much attention a country receives, whether that&#x2019;s in tourists per year, or, in the case of Ukraine, how much support it receives in fighting a war. Spend with Ukraine tote. (Spend with Ukraine)Others in Ukraine have also understood the importance of elevating Ukraine&#x2019;s reputation. Similar projects include Angel for Fashion, a site with Ukrainian fashion brands co-created by Ukrainian fashion designer Alina Kachorovska, and online Ukrainian marketplaces, Shop Ukrainian, Visit Ukraine Shop, and Buy for Ukraine. Showing the world a different side of Ukraine is also a means of combating centuries of Russian attempts to obscure Ukrainian culture through propaganda, or destroy it outright with aggression. &#x201C;Russia has been doing this work for centuries. During the Soviet Union, how much money was spent on propaganda, cultural expansion, and planting people in different societies to basically run certain narratives? It&apos;s a great infrastructure,&#x201D; Klen said. &#x201C;It&apos;s nice to see it crumbling, but it&#x2019;s still strong.&#x201D; Unraveling Russia&#x2019;s propaganda narratives about Ukraine won&#x2019;t happen overnight and is likely to be a decades-long process. &#x201C;We haven&apos;t been part of the global community for a long time. We were pushed away from it by a greater power so it is still very hard to get a voice over all of that. It takes time and effort,&#x201D; Klen said. &#x201C;Soft power is a slow game, but we&apos;re slowly advancing.&#x201D; Spend With Ukraine employs a number of search-engine optimization tools and social media campaigns to get eyes on its website to promote brands, and ultimately, a different narrative about Ukraine. One such campaign on Instagram highlighted celebrities from Beyonce to Paris Hilton wearing Ukrainian fashion brands. If a person abroad learns that their favorite celebrity &#x2014; and one of such high profile like Beyonce &#x2014; is wearing Ukrainian fashion designer Ruslan Baginsky for example, &#x201C;surprises them, and that hooks them in,&#x201D; Klen said. For the companies and services on Spend With Ukraine and other similar platforms, the benefit is clear &#x2014; more exposure leads to more sales. Some brands on Spend With Ukraine had their first international orders after being added to the platform. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Spend With Ukraine (@spend_with_ukraine) The brands featured on Spend With Ukraine also tell their own story: of how much Ukraine has changed since it gained independence, and especially in the last 10 years since the EuroMaidan Revolution and the start of Russia&#x2019;s war in 2014. Nearly every single company on the Spend With Ukraine platform was created in the last 10 years. Due to its Soviet legacy, Ukraine has always been a country of engineers. This formed the foundation for what would become a thriving tech scene that for years was almost entirely based on serving foreign clients that were outsourcing to a more affordable Ukrainian workforce. It has since grown to include Ukrainian-founded companies that sell their products around the world, like Grammarly or Preply. Petcube, Klen&#x2019;s company, was founded by people who worked for outsourcing companies before going on to create their own global, product-based company. After 2014, when Ukraine started to shift westward in the wake of the revolution and Russian aggression and the country began a process of discovering and uncovering its own tradition and roots separate from Russia, people&#x2019;s tastes and visions for consumer products began to change. New brands, many of which derive their inspiration from Ukrainian heritage, began to emerge and flourish. With the onset of the full-scale invasion and the increased exposure among the outside world has only added momentum to the shift. There is a common refrain that Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion has done more to solidify the Ukrainian identity than anyone else ever did &#x2014; it may have done more for its brand as well. &#x201C;Getting back to the brand &#x2014; you gotta keep at it and see more success stories. It&apos;s very natural how the tide shifts,&#x201D; Klen said.	https://kyivindependent.com/spend-with-ukraine-wants-to-build-a-better-brand-for-ukraine/	2024-12-12T05:59:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/upd_GettyImages-1796953252.jpg
Trump opposes Ukraine launching US missiles inside Russia but hints he won't 'abandon' Kyiv	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said he &quot;very vehemently&quot; disagrees with Ukraine using U.S.-made missiles to strike targets &quot;hundreds of miles&quot; inside Russia, the Time magazine reported on Dec. 12. Members of Trump&apos;s inner circle previously criticized the outgoing Biden administration&apos;s decision to ease restrictions on long-range strikes, though this is the first time the president-elect has spoken against it publicly himself. &quot;I disagree very vehemently with sending missiles hundreds of miles into Russia. Why are we doing that?&quot; Trump told Time as the magazine named him Person of the Year. &quot;We&#x2019;re just escalating this war and making it worse.&quot; The U.S. president-elect has criticized the level of support the Biden administration provided to Ukraine and signaled Kyiv should brace for reduced assistance once he takes office in January. While he boasted many times during his campaign that he would end the war within 24 hours, Trump admitted to Time that Russia&apos;s invasion is even more complex than the situation in the Middle East. &quot;The numbers of dead young soldiers lying on fields all over the place are staggering. It&#x2019;s crazy what&#x2019;s taking place.&quot; When asked whether he would cut aid to Ukraine, Trump said instead he would use the U.S. aid as leverage to push the Kremlin to the negotiating table. &quot;I want to reach an agreement, and the only way you&#x2019;re going to reach an agreement is not to abandon.&quot; Trump met President Volodymyr Zelensky in Paris on Dec. 7 to discuss the ongoing war. Reuters wrote that while the two did not discuss specifics of any concrete peace plan, Trump called for an immediate ceasefire while Zelensky stressed the need for security guarantees. Following his meeting with Zelensky, Trump said the Ukrainian leader is ready &quot;to make a deal and stop the madness&quot; and that Putin should do the same after incurring staggering losses in Ukraine. &quot;Too many lives are being so needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed, and if it keeps going, it can turn into something much bigger, and far worse,&quot; Trump wrote on Social Truth on Dec. 8. Zelensky addressed Trump&apos;s post on his Telegram channel on Dec. 8, saying the war &quot;cannot be ended simply with a piece of paper and a few signatures,&quot; warning that &quot;a ceasefire without guarantees can be reignited at any moment, as Putin has already done in the past.&quot; The Ukrainian president has signaled openness to a diplomatic end to the war as the Russian advance picked up pace in the east while Ukraine&apos;s resources grow thin.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-opposes-ukraine-launching-us-missiles-in-russia/	2024-12-12T05:23:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2177668198.jpg
Ukraine's intelligence kills Russian engineer who was modernizing missiles, source claims	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Mikhail Shatsky, a Russian expert involved in modernizing missiles launched against Ukraine, was shot dead near Moscow, a Defense Forces source told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 12. His death was likely orchestrated by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), the source claimed. Shatsky was deputy general designer and head of the software department at the Moscow-based Mars Design Bureau and reportedly oversaw the modernization of Kh-59 and Kh-69 missiles. The first to report on Shatsky&apos;s death was Ukrainian-Russian anti-Kremlin journalist Alexander Nevzorov, who wrote on his Telegram channel that HUR &quot;eliminated a particularly dangerous criminal.&quot; Nevzorov shared photos of a person resembling Shatsky lying dead in the snow. The man was reportedly killed in the Kuzminsky forest park near Kotelniki in Moscow Oblast. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims.	https://kyivindependent.com/shatsky/	2024-12-12T03:53:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/1734001823-526.jpg
Scholz ready to talk to Putin again despite 'frustrating' phone call	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he is ready to talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin again after his previous phone call with him in mid-November, the German newspaper Die Zeit reported on Dec. 12. &quot;I will do it again. But we must not have any illusions about it,&quot; Scholz was quoted as saying, despite expressing frustration earlier over Putin &quot;repeating all his formulas&quot; during their phone call on Nov. 15. During that conversation, Scholz condemned Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, calling on Putin to end the invasion and withdraw Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. He also urged Russia to negotiate with Ukraine to achieve a &quot;just and lasting peace.&quot; This drew criticism from Western allies and President Volodymyr Zelensky, who called the chancellor&apos;s conversation with the Russian leader the opening of a &quot;Pandora&#x2019;s box.&quot; &quot;In Europe, it may happen that after one call, there may be a second, third, fourth, fifth... Because sometimes leaders want to (wrestle for) leadership. After that, there may be a wave of actual recognition of Putin,&quot; Zelensky said at the time. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, widely regarded as the most Kremlin-friendly European leader, also called Putin on Dec. 11 to discuss the war with Ukraine, a step similarly lambasted by Zelensky. Orban previously met Putin in person after visiting Moscow in July. Scholz&apos;s statement comes shortly after his first visit to Kyiv in two and a half years, where he pledged $680 million in military support. The chancellor faces snap elections in February 2025, with his rival, the conservative CDU/CSU leader Friedrich Merz, leading in the polls. Merz voiced support for providing Ukraine with the Taurus missiles, a step that Scholz refused to take, but only after consulting with the new U.S. administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/scholz-putin/	2024-12-12T03:30:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183500625.jpg
Russian snipers use Western rifles, ammunition despite sanctions, media investigation says	Russia uses Western sniper rifles and ammunition despite sanctions, obtaining the arms via third-party countries, according to a joint media investigation published by The Insider on Dec. 11. Loopholes in sanctions imposed on Russia following the occupation of Crimea in 2014 allowed Western-branded sniper rifles to end up in Russian hands, says the investigation co-authored by the Russian independent outlet The Insider, the Czech Investigace.cz, the Italian IrpiMedia, and the Kazakh Vlast.kz. The report comes as another evidence of Russia successfully dodging sanctions to obtain arms and other goods needed to supply its Armed Forces as it wages an all-out war against Ukraine. The EU&#x2019;s sanctions on weapons exports to Russia did not apply to agreements concluded before Aug. 1, 2014, and they did not extend to countries that are part of Russia&#x2019;s tariff union, the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). The EAEU is a customs union akin to the European Union, consisting of Belarus, Russia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. Companies in EAEU countries that are not under sanctions could thus reexport arms to Russia. One example of evidence of reexporting Western sniper rifles from the EAEU to Russia is Kyrgyz arms distributor Edelweiss, whose business boomed between 2020 and 2023, the investigation says, citing the company&apos;s two-fold increase in paid taxes. Citing U.N. data, the journalists also wrote that shotgun exports from Italy to Armenia increased from 68 barrels in 2019 to 1,862 in 2023. Italian weapon exports to Kyrgyzstan were non-existent in 2020 and 2021 but grew to 882 in 2022 and 4,434 in 2023, the investigation showed, suggesting another example of sanctions evasion. Western rifles&#x2019; superiority over their Russian peers shows on their price tag, too. Russian arms dealers are said to resell the imported guns with a hefty profit three to four times the original price in the U.S. The Luxembourg holding Beretta is reportedly one of the major beneficiaries of Russia&apos;s orders. The arms company runs a joint venture with Russian businessman Mikhail Khubutia, who owns the Russian Eagle company. Russian Eagle received thousands of weapons and over a million rounds of ammunition produced by the Beretta holding in Europe, The Insider writes.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-snipers-sanctions-insider/	2024-12-12T03:13:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2151579216.jpg
NATO members mull raising defense spending benchmark to 3% GDP, FT reports	European NATO foreign ministers began discussing a plan to gradually increase the alliance&#x2019;s defense spending target from 2% of their GDP to 3% by 2030, the Financial Times reported on Dec. 12, citing undisclosed sources. Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine shed light on long-neglected manufacturing and procurement bottlenecks in Western countries as they grappled to gear up their defense industries to match the needs of the largest land war in Europe since World War II. According to the Financial Times&apos; sources, the alliance&#x2019;s members would first increase their spending to 2.5% of GDP before reaching 3% by 2030. The number of members who meet the current 2% spending level has risen to 23 this year, but some countries like Spain or Italy are still failing to reach this benchmark. Officials plan to agree on the new target during next summer&#x2019;s summit in The Hague but fear fiscal pressure on some of the biggest European Union economies might hinder their plans. Italy, which is already under the EU&#x2019;s Excessive Deficit Procedure for consecutively accumulating a higher annual budget deficit than the bloc&apos;s 3% threshold, has little room for maneuvering to reduce its deficit and increase its military spending simultaneously. &quot;Politics is making choices in scarcity, and there&#x2019;s always a lack of money and always too many priorities,&quot; newly appointed NATO chief Mark Rutte was quoted as saying by the Financial Times. One such impetus to counter fiscal austerity in defense might be the upcoming U.S. presidency of Donald Trump, who has long advocated for NATO allies to pull their part and increase their spending on defense. During his campaign in February, Trump said that if reelected, he would endorse Russia to do &quot;whatever the hell they want&quot; to NATO member countries failing to meet defense spending criteria. Taking office in January 2025, Trump had hinted at plans to reduce aid for Ukraine and incentivize European countries to pay more for their protection.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-members-3-percent-spending/	2024-12-12T02:40:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1406574909.jpg
Russia has built only 7 out of 108 planned airliners since 2022, BBC reports	Russia&apos;s United Aircraft Corporation managed to build only seven of the 108 passenger planes it planned to produce since 2022, the BBC reported on Dec. 12, underscoring the dire state of Russia&apos;s plane manufacturing sector. The Russian aviation and aircraft manufacturing industries were heavily hit by the Western sanctions &#x2014; imposed in response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine &#x2014; due to reliance on foreign components to build and maintain planes. Russia sought to pivot toward domestic production. Its Comprehensive Program for the Development of the Air Transport Industry until 2030 envisioned producing 1,032 passenger aircraft between 2022 and the end of the decade. This included 14 planes in 2022, 25 in 2023, and 69 this year. This plan was revised and postponed almost immediately due to lack of supplies, the BBC writes. The United Aircraft Corporation, part of the state-owned conglomerate Rostec, built only seven SuperJet 100 airliners using pre-2022 stocks, the outlet reported, citing cross-checked data from unofficial statistics, aggregators, and the media. Russian producers also built two experimental planes for testing: the Il-96-400M and Il-114. An undisclosed industry source told the BBC that the plan was not taken seriously within the aviation sector and served only to &quot;calm the government&apos;s nerves.&quot; The mounting crisis affects not only aircraft producers but also airline companies. The Izvestia newspaper reported on Nov. 13 that about 30 Russian airlines, accounting for 26% of domestic passenger traffic, may go bankrupt in 2025. Only major airlines, including Aeroflot, Ural Airlines, and S7 Airlines, were able to buy back leased aircraft with funds from the National Welfare Fund.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-airliners-bbc/	2024-12-12T02:16:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-537791492.jpg
Macron, Tusk to discuss deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine after ceasefire, Bloomberg reports	Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and French President Emmanuel Macron are expected to discuss the possibility of sending soldiers to Ukraine after a potential ceasefire deal, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 11, citing undisclosed sources. Macron is visiting Warsaw on Dec. 12 to brief the Polish prime minister on his meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump last week and to discuss Europe&apos;s support for Ukraine and ways to end Russia&apos;s war. European powers, like France and Poland, are expected to take center stage in helping Kyiv resist and deter Russian aggression as Trump signaled intent to reduce support and get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war. According to Bloomberg, the talks between Macron and Tusk are to focus on how to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s security in the short- and long-term, including the option of deploying European soldiers once a ceasefire is reached. The French president has spearheaded the idea of sending troops to Ukraine in some capacity since February. More recently, Macron reportedly discussed the proposal of sending peacekeepers on the ground with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in November. Szymon Holownia, the speaker of the lower chamber of the Polish parliament, told the media that Poland would be involved in such a mission only within a NATO framework. President Volodymyr Zelensky, who also met Trump and Macron on Dec. 7, recently said that Ukraine &quot;may consider&quot; the deployment of foreign peacekeepers, but only after receiving a clear timeline for NATO membership. Both Paris and Warsaw have been favorable toward Ukraine&apos;s entry into the alliance, but the step continues to meet opposition in the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and elsewhere. The possibility of a diplomatic end to the war is increasingly discussed in Ukraine and the West. Tusk, whose country takes over the EU Council&apos;s presidency in January, said peace talks could begin as early as this winter. Russia showed no interest in a ceasefire as its forces currently hold the upper hand on the battlefield, closing in on key Ukrainian strongholds in Donetsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-tusk-to-discuss-deploying-peacekeepers-to-ukraine-bloomberg/	2024-12-12T01:18:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1180973414.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 1, injure 11 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least one civilian and injured at least 11 over the past day, regional authorities reported early on Dec. 12. In Donetsk Oblast, three people were injured in the town of Pokrovsk and one in the village of Novotroitske, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. A 44-year-old man was injured during Russian artillery and drone attacks against the Nikopol district in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. In Kherson Oblast, six people were injured in Russian strikes over the past day, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. A 67-year-old man was killed in a drone attack against Kherson early on the morning of Dec. 12, he said. A Russian attack with a multiple-launch rocket system against the village of Kutkivka in Kharkiv Oblast damaged an educational institution, said the regional governor, Oleh Syniehubov. No casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-112/	2024-12-12T00:46:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Nikopol-Dec-12.jpg
US lawmakers ask for intelligence report on impact of cutting Ukraine aid	U.S. lawmakers requested a trio of intelligence agencies to assess the risks of ending support for Ukraine and Russia winning the war, The Hill reported on Dec. 11. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump hinted at reducing aid to Ukraine once he enters office in January 2025. This puts further pressure on Ukraine, which is increasingly on the back foot on the battleground, facing the full-scale Russian invasion for almost three years. Lawmakers from both chambers of the U.S. legislature requested the director of national intelligence, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to compile a report on different policy impacts on Ukraine and U.S. security, according to the report. The scrutinized scenarios would include ending or continuing military and economic aid to Ukraine, a Russian victory on the battlefield, &#x200B;&#x200B;and keeping or revoking permission to fire long-range missiles into Russia&#x2019;s territory. Lawmakers also want to know how would Ukraine&#x2019;s defeat on the battlefield embolden other actors like China, Iran, or North Korea. Their request comes on the back of the House of Representatives, the legislation&#x2019;s lower chamber, passing the next year&apos;s defense budget. The Senate is to vote on the bill next week. The report will be compiled during a transition period between outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden and incoming Donald Trump&#x2019;s administration. Trump has nominated John Ratcliffe, who served as the director of national intelligence during Trump&apos;s first presidency, to lead the CIA. The president-elect&apos;s pick for the new director of national intelligence &#x2014; former Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard &#x2014; caused concern due to Gabbard&apos;s favorable views toward authoritarian regimes and U.S. rivals, such as Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-lawmakers-ask-for-intelligence-report-on-impact-of-cutting-ukraine-aid/	2024-12-11T23:41:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2149305400.jpg
US House passes 2025 defense budget without Ukraine lend-lease extension	The $895 billion U.S. defense budget passed by the House of Representatives did not include a provision to extend the lend-lease act for Ukraine despite the efforts of Ukrainian diplomats, Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, said on Dec. 12. The U.S. passed the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act in May 2022, but it expired in September 2023 without ever being used. Ukrainian diplomats have been lobbying for its reintroduction as it allows the U.S. president to loan or lease arms to Ukraine while cutting through congressional red tape. &quot;The Embassy continues to actively work to preserve this mechanism,&quot; Markarova said. In April, a bipartisan group of senators proposed to reintroduce the lend-lease act through the fiscal year 2026. The future of U.S. support for Ukraine hangs in the air as President-elect Donald Trump has already hinted that Kyiv should expect reduced assistance after he takes office in January. These concerns prompted the outgoing Biden administration to speed up the arms delivery and use up the remaining $4-5 billion left in the presidential drawdown authority. The House&apos;s defense bill, which the Senate will vote on next week, also did not include funds for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) in 2025, as those were already provided in the previous budget in the amount of $300 million, Markarova said. The USAI is a Pentagon-led program for supplying arms to Ukraine through contracts with U.S. defense companies. The bill did include a ban on the use of funds for any actions that could lead to recognition of Russian occupation in Ukraine and a request for an inter-departmental report on Moscow&apos;s financing of international terrorism. It also contained a proposal to establish the Center of Excellence for developing AI-based weapons in cooperation with foreign partners, including Ukraine. The support for Ukraine may face an increasingly uphill battle as the Republican Party has not only maintained control over the House but also won the Senate majority in the November elections. It was the opposition from parts of the Republican Party that delayed a $61 billion aid bill earlier this year, contributing to battlefield setbacks for Ukraine. House Speaker Mike Johnson also rejected a vote on the last-minute proposal by President Joe Biden for a $24 billion package to assist Ukraine and replenish arms.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-house-passes-2025-defense-budget-without-ukraine-lend-lease-extension/	2024-12-11T23:24:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1754907256.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 758,730 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 758,730 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 12. This number includes 1,390 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,532 tanks, 19,644 armored fighting vehicles, 31,127 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,072 artillery systems, 1,253 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,023 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 20,111 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-758-730-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-12-11T22:25:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1870879319.jpg
Russia advises its citizens to avoid travel to US, Western nations	Russia warned its citizens on Dec. 11 to avoid travel to the U.S, Canada, and most European Union nations, due to &quot;increasing confrontation&quot; with the U.S., Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said at a news briefing. The announcement reflects further deterioration of relations between Russia and the West, which have broken down drastically since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Zakharova urged Russians to avoid trips to the U.S., Canada, and most E.U. nations, saying that trips to the U.S. in particular were &quot;fraught with serious risks.&quot; The advisory is due to &quot;the increasing confrontation in Russian-American relations, which are teetering on the verge of rupture due to the fault of Washington,&quot; she claimed. Zakharova also alleged that Russian citizens are at risk of being &quot;hunted&quot; by Western authorities when traveling. Russian rhetoric against the U.S. escalated further in November, after Washington gave Kyiv approval to attack targets in Russia with long-range U.S. weapons. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov responded on Nov. 19 by threatening the U.S. with allusions to updates in Russia&apos;s nuclear doctrine. Russia has also arrested and imprisoned dozens of U.S. citizens, with many now serving lengthy sentences or awaiting trial. Washington has accused Moscow of orchestrating the arrests as leverage for future prisoner swaps. Though the U.S. and Russia executed a notable prisoner exchange in August that included Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, &#xA0;several U.S. and dual-national detainees remain in Russian custody. The U.S. State Department also warns U.S. citizens against traveling to Russia due to the ongoing war against Ukraine. Americans in Russia &quot;may face harassment or detention by Russian security officials, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, limited flights into and out of Russia, and the possibility of terrorism,&quot; the department warns.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-advises-its-citizens-to-avoid-travel-to-us-western-nations/	2024-12-11T21:13:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1237721878.jpg
Trump invites Xi to inauguration, CBS News reports	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to his inauguration ceremony in January, CBS News reported on Dec. 11, citing multiple unnamed sources. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Jan. 20, 2025. If Xi accepts the invitation, it will mark the first time a foreign leader has attended a U.S. presidential inauguration. It is not clear yet whether Xi will actually attend the ceremony, CBS News reported. Trump&apos;s team is also considering inviting other world leaders, including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Orban is &quot;still considering&quot; whether or not to attend, a source told CBS News. Both China and Hungary have remained Kremlin allies throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It is not typical to invite foreign heads of state to U.S. presidential inaugurations. According to U.S. State Department records dating back to 1874, a foreign leader has never attended such a ceremony. &quot;World leaders are lining up to meet with President Trump because they know he will soon return to power and restore peace through American strength around the globe,&quot; Trump transition spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said. Trump has often expressed admiration for authoritarian leaders, including those with traditionally adversarial relationships to the U.S. He praised both Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin as &quot;smart, tough&quot; leaders during a campaign rally in July. Trump also hosted Orban on Dec. 10 at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. Orban has been a vocal supporter of Trump, repeatedly claiming that the Trump administration will cut support to Ukraine and force its leadership into peace talks with Moscow. China, officially a neutral party in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, has strengthened its ties with the Kremlin since the full-scale invasion. Beijing has also positioned itself as a mediator in the conflict, trying to enlist developing nations in its six-point peace plan, which China and Brazil laid out in May. Trump&apos;s imminent return to the White House raises concerns about the U.S. withdrawing military aid and pressuring Kyiv toward painful concessions.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-invites-xi-to-inauguration-cbs-news-reports/	2024-12-11T20:04:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1193819611.jpg
Drones attack Chechnya, hitting police building, Kadyrov claims	Drones attacked the barracks of a police regiment in Grozny, Chechnya, overnight on Dec. 12, according to local media and Chechen strong man Ramzan Kadyrov. The attack damaged the roof of the building, shattered windows, and lightly injured four men on guard duty, Kadyrov claimed. This marks the third reported drone strike against Chechnya during Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. The previous attack occurred just one week prior on Dec. 4, while the first was reported in late October of this year. According to Kadyrov, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was shot down over police barracks near 1 a.m. on Dec. 12. &quot;No one was seriously injured. Four guards received minor injuries,&quot; he alleged. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The targeted police regiment building was named after Akhmat Kadyrov, the first Russian-backed head of Chechnya. The same building was reportedly struck a week earlier during a drone attack on Dec. 4. Prior to that, the first reported drone attack struck Chechnya on Oct. 29. After initially reporting no casualties, Kadyrov later alleged that Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) had been killed, boasting that they had been used as human shields. Kadyrov blamed the drone attack on Ukraine, though Kyiv did not claim responsibility for the attack. A Ukrainian intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent the Oct. 29 strike likely came from the neighboring republics of Dagestan or Ingushetia.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-attack-chechnya-local-media-reports/	2024-12-11T19:04:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/chechnya.png
Tough battles, lost positions in Pokrovsk demand 'non-standard decisions,' Syrskyi says	Battles in the front-line city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast is &quot;exceptionally tough,&quot; requiring Ukraine&apos;s military leadership to make &quot;non-standard decisions,&quot; Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 11. Previously on Dec. 11, military spokesperson Nazar Voloshyn confirmed that Russian forces had destroyed two Ukrainian positions near Pokrovsk. Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub for Ukrainian forces in the east, has seen heavy fighting in recent months as Russian forces continue their relentless advance in Donetsk Oblast. Syrskyi&apos;s latest report follows a visit to the 38th Separate Marine Brigade, operating on the front lines in the Pokrovsk sector. &quot;We have to make non-standard decisions to increase the resilience of the defense and more effectively destroy the occupiers,&quot; he said in a Facebook post Dec. 11. &quot;The battles are of an exceptionally tough nature.&quot; Speaking in a televised broadcast, Nazar Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Khortytsia group of forces, said that Russia had destroyed two Ukrainian positions in the area. &quot;As a result of prolonged clashes, two of our positions were destroyed, one was lost,&quot; Voloshyn said. &quot;Currently, measures are being taken to restore positions.&quot; According to Syrskyi, the Ukrainian military is at a disadvantage, especially in terms of manpower. Russian troops outnumber Ukrainian units and &quot;are throwing all available forces forward.&quot; Syrskyi did not provide examples of &quot;non-standard decisions,&quot; but said a priority was to deliver sufficient quantities of ammunition to front-line units. He also said he responded to &quot;existing problems&quot; by issuing &quot;appropriate orders.&quot; Russian forces are now only 3 kilometers (1.5 miles) from Pokrovsk, according to the crowd-sourced monitoring website Deep State. Observers and the Ukrainian military have previously warned of an increasingly difficult situation in Pokrovsk as Russian forces push forward. Syrskyi ordered additional reserves and weapons to Pokrovsk on Nov. 29 in an effort to stall Russia&apos;s assault. Russia&apos;s grinding advance in eastern Ukraine continues to gain momentum at the cost of heavy personnel losses.	https://kyivindependent.com/tough-battles-in-pokrovsk-demand-non-standard-decisions-syrskyi-says/	2024-12-11T17:48:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188638921.jpg
Tsikhanouskaya says Ukraine maintains relations with Belarusian opposition leaders	Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the most prominent Belarusian opposition leader, discussed efforts to maintain relations with Ukrainian authorities in a European Pravda interview published on Dec. 10. Tsikhanouskaya told European Pravda that the United Democratic Forces parliamentary group has been able to establish good contact and relations with Ukrainian leaders, and while the result has not been as ambitious as she hoped, it is sufficient. Tsikhanouskaya noted that the group has been meeting with representatives of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry and advisors to President Volodymyr Zelensky. &quot;Since the beginning of the war, I have had this principle: do nothing to harm Ukraine. And if I understand that there are some obstacles to establishing more official relations between the Ukrainian authorities and the Democratic Forces of Belarus, then that&apos;s how it should be. There&apos;s no need to force it,&quot; she told Serhiy Sidorenko during the interview. She also said that it was very important to expose Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko&#x2019;s unreliability. &quot;What we want is to explain that Lukashenko cannot be relied on, that he will always deceive. And if people think that maybe one day Lukashenko will side with Ukraine, then this will never happen,&quot; she said. Tsikhanouskaya emphasized the importance of a Ukrainian victory, and noted that a free Belarus is dependent on a Ukraine free from Russian aggression. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s victory is the priority. Belarus should not be forgotten, but Ukraine must get all the necessary weapons to win,&quot; she said. Despite receiving popular support during the 2020 elections, the Belarusian opposition leader was kicked out of her country, and her supporters were jailed en masse. What&#x2019;s more, Tsikhanouskaya&apos;s husband, Siarhei, arrested months before the elections in which he wanted to challenge Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, remains behind bars to this day.	https://kyivindependent.com/tsikhanouskaya-says-ukraine-maintains-relations-with-belarusian-opposition-leaders/	2024-12-11T15:42:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175735360.jpg
Austrian OMV company terminates contract with Gazprom Export	Austrian oil and gas company OMV has terminated its long-term gas supply contract with Russia&apos;s Gazprom Export, the OMV website reported on Dec. 11. The contract was originally set to last until 2040. The company cited &quot;numerous material violations of contractual obligations&quot; by Gazprom. According to OMV, gas deliveries stopped on November 16, 2024 &quot;Thanks to the successful efforts of our gas team over the past three years, OMV is well positioned to leverage our diversified supply of alternative gas sources, ensuring the security of supply for our customers,&quot; said OMV CEO Alfred Stern, highlighting current gas reserves from Norway, Austria, and LNG sources. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer also commented on the situation, stating on X that Russia&apos;s attempt to weaponize energy &quot;didn&apos;t work.&quot; &quot;Austria will not allow itself to be blackmailed by Russia,&quot; he said. OMV noted that its gas storage facilities are currently about 85% full, ensuring stability for customers amid the transition. OMV supplies about 30% of the Austrian gas market, and its biggest shareholder is the Austrian government.	https://kyivindependent.com/austrian-omv-company-terminates-contract-with-gazprom-export/	2024-12-11T14:57:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
EU to allocate 170 million euros to six countries bordering Russia and Belarus	European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced 170 million euros ($178 million) in financial support for six European countries bordering Russia and Belarus to bolster their border protection efforts. This announcement followed her discussion with Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo. &#x201C;Finland, alongside the Baltic countries, Poland, and Norway, is courageously protecting our borders from threats of all forms coming from Russia and Belarus,&#x201D; von der Leyen wrote on X. Finland closed its border with Russia in late November 2023, and the Finnish government decided to keep the border with Russia closed &quot;until further notice,&quot; in April 2024. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania agreed in January 2024 to build a Baltic defense line in the coming years, to strengthen the eastern border with Belarus and Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-to-allocate-170-million-euros-to-six-countries-bordering-russia-and-belarus/	2024-12-11T13:21:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1249149049.jpg
Russian colonialism is not reformable,' says historian Botakoz Kassymbekova	Most Russians seem unwilling to give up the privileges the government gives them at the expense of the country&apos;s ethnic minorities, says Botakoz Kassymbekova, a historian focusing on Eastern Europe at the University of Zurich. &quot;Russian colonialism is not reformable,&quot; she says. &quot;Russian dissidents want to retain the empire, which means they want to maintain the status quo,&#x201D; Kassymbekova alleges. &#x201C;This status quo will never bring democracy, simply because an empire is an authoritarian system,&quot; she adds. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a number of activists have ramped up their calls to decolonize Russia, a country of over 140 million people spreading across 11 time zones. Some believe Russia is among the last empires still standing, being a vast and highly centralized state that rules over a variety of different peoples. Russian &#x201C;national republics,&#x201D; regions that were created to give a form of autonomy to national minorities living in them, are, in fact, governed from Moscow, with governors directly appointed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. People living in such republics have little to no say in who governs them and how. Out of Russia&#x2019;s 10 poorest regions, nine are national republics. The national republics in Russia have also been hit the hardest by the war, with the highest numbers per capita mobilized and killed on the battlefield. The push for decolonization and de-Russification has gained some traction in those regions. Meanwhile, countries neighboring Russia that were part of the Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union and gained independence in the 1990s have actively fought to preserve their national identity, language and culture that Moscow had spent centuries attempting to erase. Those countries include Kazakhstan, Kassymbekova&apos;s homeland. Kassymbekova&apos;s book &apos;Despite Cultures: Early Soviet Rule in Tajikistan&apos; explores Soviet imperial strategies in Central Asia and examines how dictatorships maintain control across vast distances. Kassymbekova specializes in Stalinism (named after Soviet tyrant Joseph Stalin), post-Stalinism, and Russian and Soviet imperial history. Botakoz Kassymbekova in an undated photo. (X)Kassymbekova is currently working on another book, &apos;Imperial Innocence,&apos; which delves into how Russia uses a victim narrative to justify its imperial policies and how the cult of martyrdom is embedded in Russian colonial identity. The Kyiv Independent spoke with Kassymbekova about the romanticization of the Soviet Union in the West, the fundamental aspects of Russian colonialism, and the prospects for decolonization, as well as about parallels between the histories of Ukraine and Kazakhstan under Russian rule. This interview was edited and shortened for clarity. The Kyiv Independent: Lately, there has been a trend among some young people in the West, mainly left-wing, to romanticize the Soviet Union. They see it as an anti-imperial state where different nations were liberated and coexisted peacefully with equal rights. Where do you think this romanticization comes from, especially among those who didn&apos;t experience life in the Soviet Union? Botakoz Kassymbekova: The idea that the Soviet Union was a modernizing, equalizing, and progressive state has a long history in Western thought. I think it comes from the situation when scholars privilege theory over people. The Marxist theory says that capitalism is the source of injustice, exploitation, and inequalities. This idea has a very imperial or colonial thinking because it implies that if we just fix the system &#x2014; some economic procedures, or property rights &#x2014; everything will be fine. However, it doesn&apos;t take into account the people. They know what is good for them and can decide how they should live and manage themselves. Saying that &apos;we capitalist societies are really bad, look what we did to our colonies. What people in Moscow did is much better&apos; is a comparison of privileged white men to other privileged white men and their intrusion into foreign societies. It implies that a small group of white men are the ones who can fix the world &#x2014; they just need to figure out how. But the whole idea of fixing the world centrally and from a single perspective led to millions of deaths, suffering, and unfreedom. I&apos;m afraid of these ideas because they treat people as subjects rather than equal participants in discussions about justice and equality. The whole Soviet history, then, becomes simply an intellectual exercise. The Kyiv Independent: We know that in the 1930s, during the reign of Joseph Stalin, over a million people in Kazakhstan died as a result of a famine caused by the Soviet government&apos;s forced collectivization. In Ukraine, the Soviets starved people in what became known as Holodomor. What parallels can you draw between Kazakhstan and Ukraine in relation to Russian imperial policies? Botakoz Kassymbekova: The starvation of the 1930s is probably the key historical event that united us (Ukraine and Kazakhstan) in this colonial dimension, along with the traumas that followed. Then, in the early 1990s, both Ukraine and Kazakhstan were pressured by Western countries to give up their nuclear arsenals. Another aspect is that almost all of the Soviet nuclear arsenal was tested in Kazakhstan. Over 400 nuclear bombs and missiles were detonated in Kazakhstan, which is equivalent to enduring several nuclear wars. Russification is another crucial part of the colonial experience. In this regard, we ((Ukrainians and Kazakhs) understand each other very well. Other Central Asian countries were somewhat luckier, as they didn&apos;t experience Russification as intensely as the Kazakhs. The elimination of our cultural elites, economic and political dependence (on Russia), and the joy of (gaining) independence were very similar (for both Ukraine and Kazakhstan.) However, there are also differences. Many Ukrainians were deported to Kazakhstan, but they could still enjoy greater social mobility compared to Kazakhs because the Soviet Union was an extremely racist place. If you were &apos;more white,&apos; you had more chances for social mobility. The Kyiv Independent: Meanwhile, in Russia, the cult of Stalin is flourishing again, and Putin is trying to promote the idea that he will lead his country to victory in the war against Ukraine like Stalin did in World War II. Can you explain what&apos;s happening with Russia&apos;s national ideology right now? And what exactly is this &apos;Russian world&apos; we keep hearing about? Botakoz Kassymbekova: With the wars in (the Chechen Republic) of Ichkeria, Putin promoted the idea of being the &apos;master of the house&apos; who would restore order, much like Stalin. He sold this vision to Russians, saying, &apos;You don&apos;t need to do anything; I&apos;ll take care of you. I&apos;ll make the streets safe, bring prosperity, and we&apos;ll keep robbing the colonies &#x2014; taking their gas and oil &#x2014; and they won&apos;t want independence.&apos; There was this idea (in Russia) that people just need to enjoy life &#x2014; &apos;you don&apos;t need to do politics; you just need to have a good life.&apos; People took this chance, traveled around the world, and enjoyed their privileges, mostly, of course, people from the metropoles, Moscow and St. Petersburg. Putin also allowed people to do some critical thinking so that he could say that Russia wasn&apos;t a totalitarian regime. We often focus on Russia&apos;s dictatorship and authoritarianism, but the colonial aspect of this system is often overlooked. It&apos;s about making every single Russian feel superior to non-Russians. That&apos;s why Putin became popular. The annexation of Crimea strengthened this further, as it allowed Russians to feel even more privileged, showing them that they could not only steal money and resources from non-Russians and from other republics but actually gain new territories.

(Kirill Kudryavtsev / AFP via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: You&apos;re working on a book called &apos;Imperial Innocence.&apos; Could you explain what you mean by that concept and how it relates to what&apos;s happening in modern Russia? Botakoz Kassymbekova: In the book, I explore how the Russian state crafted the idea that its empire brings good, that it is a liberating empire, and that the Russian people are martyrs sacrificing themselves for the good of other people. This archetype of Jesus Christ is crucial for Russian identity. When Ilya Yashin (Russian opposition activist freed in the recent East-West prisoner exchange) faced criticism for wanting to return to prison and not mentioning Ukrainian suffering, Russian journalist (Yulia) Latynina wrote on social media, &apos;those critics just envy you because you had a chance to hang on a cross.&apos; So she basically said they were envious because (Yashin got to be) Jesus Christ for a moment. (Alexei) Navalny, (Vladimir) Kara-Murza, and Yashin all play according to this textbook (which says) that your achievement as a Russian is when you suffer. Imperial innocence is a very effective tool because many Russians have internalized it. When I talk about Russian imperialism or colonialism, people take it personally, and a discussion about the crimes against humanity that were carried out for that empire becomes extremely difficult. The conversation becomes about personal guilt, with people asking, &apos;Do you think I&apos;m a bad person?&apos; But it&apos;s not about bad or good people; it&apos;s about the system that allows the structures and narratives that, in turn, allow these crimes to take place, and one really needs to part with them. This belief in being &apos;good people&apos; with a &apos;special soul&apos; prevents (many in Russia) from acknowledging the other side of the story. The Kyiv Independent: Why do you think many Russian opposition politicians are resistant to discussions about the decolonization of Russia? Botakoz Kassymbekova: One of the main arguments put forward by Russian dissidents is that they are &apos;bringing good&apos; to other peoples, justifying the need to maintain the empire. I don&apos;t call them opposition because we don&apos;t know if they would even be elected as an opposition if they had the chance. When we talk about the &apos;Russian opposition,&apos; we often overlook the opposition of national republics like the Bashkirs, Tatars, Ichkerians (Chechens), and others. They are the majority of the opposition, and they support decolonization, while only a small Russian minority opposes it because they want to keep their privileges. They live on the backs of the national opposition. They live very well, travel around the world, and represent a big empire. You just need to criticize Putin on YouTube, and you will be welcomed in Washington, London, or Berlin. It&apos;s a comfortable position to be in.

(Cindy Ord/VF23/Getty Images for Vanity Fair)The level of racism and xenophobia is so high that (Russian dissidents) refuse to engage with or even mention people from national republics, essentially trying to erase them with this attitude. This is a conscious strategy. Because (Russian dissidents) are accepted as legitimate opposition leaders in the West, they feel entitled to speak on behalf of Chechens, Tatars, Kalmyks, and Sakha &#x2014; groups that don&apos;t want (the Russian dissidents) speaking for them. Recently, three Russian scholars from the metropolitan region, now living in the West, proposed a new Russian constitution. They proposed to eliminate the national republics and create new kinds of constituents in Russia without even asking representatives of these republics whether they still wanted (these institutions) to exist. The Kyiv Independent: Based on what you know about Russian history, do you think there will be any significant changes once Putin is no longer in power? Could there be a shift where Russians acknowledge their country&apos;s imperial nature and take responsibility for it? Botakoz Kassymbekova: I believe that Russian colonialism and Russian colonial identity are not reformable, just as Communism wasn&apos;t. Nearly three years have passed (since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine), and we still haven&apos;t seen any roadmap from Russian intellectuals on how to rethink Russian colonialism. Nobody really wants to talk about it. If the horrific images from Mariupol and Bucha did not spark any awakening, nothing will. But again, when we think about Russia, we must not overlook the national republics because their situation is very different. National awakening is happening rapidly (within these republics) because their populations die in much higher numbers than metropolitan Russians who have not been affected by the war so much. Many people in the national republics feel the pain of Ukrainians because their forefathers had experienced exactly what Ukrainians are going through today.

(Ronaldo Schemidt / AFP via Getty Images)A huge political change is occurring (in Russia), but it&apos;s not coming from the colonizers but rather from the national republics. Whether they will succeed in their quest for independence, we don&apos;t know. But (the national awakening) is there, and it is very significant. I think they are the only hope. The Kyiv Independent: So, do you think the representatives of national republics could actually be the ones who will bring change to Russia and help get rid of this authoritarian regime? Botakoz Kassymbekova: Russia doesn&apos;t need help to get rid of the authoritarian regime; it thrives on this very regime, which is foundational to Russian colonialism and imperialism. Russian dissidents want to retain the empire, which means they want to maintain the status quo. (However), this status quo will never bring democracy simply because an empire is an authoritarian system. When the Russian government can no longer offer imperial privileges, perhaps the authoritarian regime will become less attractive, and people will take to the streets. But it&apos;s naive to believe that someone &#x2014; be it Kara-Murza, Yashin, or anyone else &#x2014; can come up with a single idea or word and fix Russia. This is a structural and systemic problem. It seems a point of no return has been reached. In the national republics, a critical mass (of people) is emerging who refuse to turn back and no longer believe in any promises. We are at a historical moment; the myth of the Russian Empire and its greatness has died and won&apos;t be revived anytime soon.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-colonialism-is-not-reformable-says-historian-botakoz-kassymbekova/	2024-12-11T12:03:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1245763975.jpg
What Russia’s army in Syria stands to lose after fall of Assad	The Kremlin confirmed on Dec. 11 that longtime Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad had fled to Moscow after rebels took the capital city of Damascus in a lightning offensive that shocked the world. Assad&#x2019;s exile in Russia comes as little surprise. The Kremlin had invested heavily in propping up the regime in Syria with military support since 2015, when Russian air raids on rebel forces helped the Assad regime to solidify its grip on power. In exchange, Russia got a staging ground for military operations, including two permanent bases. With its military tied up in Ukraine for its now three-year invasion, Russia proved incapable of protecting Assad this time around. Russia&#x2019;s assets in Syria, key to its projection of military force internationally, now hang in the balance. Ukrainian intelligence reported on Dec. 10 that Russia had begun pulling out some military equipment from Syria, particularly its only air base outside the former Soviet Union and its only warm-water port in the world. Beyond damaging Russia&#x2019;s international prestige, any pullout also has observers speculating on a collapse in Russia&#x2019;s ability to continue operations across Africa. But for now, Russian soldiers remain at the bases, ostensibly as the Kremlin waits out the formation of a new Syrian regime. &#x201C;I think everyone&apos;s watching that very, very closely,&#x201D; Chatham House, London associate fellow Neil Quilliam told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;I can see this morning that there are two frigates and a submarine just about six or seven kilometers off base. So they&apos;re in the area. I think they&apos;re in a holding position at the moment, seeing how the situation will play out in Damascus.&#x201D; The BBC estimated that there were around 7,500 Russian soldiers in Syria as of the beginning of 2024. &#x201C;Russia always had a very limited, surgical presence in Syria, and it is easier to sustain a small presence than a large presence,&#x201D; Anna Borshchevskaya, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. She put the likely upper limit for total Russian fighters in Syria closer to 4,500. Speaking to the Kyiv Independent, Marat Gabidullin, Kremlin-backed Wagner mercenary from 2015 to 2019, described Hmeimim Air Base as the &#x201C;hub&#x201D; of Russia&#x2019;s operations across Africa and the Middle East. &#x201C;All the main logistics went through Hmeimim,&#x201D; he said, describing it as enviably comfortable compared to temporary operations bases where he stayed while a Wagner member, particularly recalling the &#x201C;spartan conditions&#x201D; at the Hayan gas processing facility in the desert near Palmyra. &#x201C;Now they&#x2019;re going to have to re-build their logistics and make a bet on Libya, and Libya is a very unsettled region,&#x201D; said Gabidullin, noting, in particular, the difficulties of dealing with the warlord/strongman of eastern Libya. &#x201C;Then they&#x2019;ll have to budget for (Libyan strongman Khalifa) Haftar&#x2019;s whims, and Haftar is an unpredictable man.&#x201D; While he denied knowing figures for overall Russian forces, Gabidullin said he recalls roughly 3,000 Wagner fighters in-country while he was there. Russian soldiers are seen near armored vehicles as they enter the base at the Tishrin Dam on the Euphrates, located 90 kilometers east of Aleppo in Aleppo Governorate, Syria, on Nov. 18, 2019. (Bekir Kasim/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)The port at Tartus held six Russian ships &#x2014; three frigates, two oil tankers, and a submarine &#x2014; which Business Insider showed as having been pulled out as of Monday. The air base in Hmeimim has retained an indeterminate amount of aircraft but was conducting aerial operations against the rebel advance in December. Borshchevskaya noted that Hmeimim served as a launch point for various Sukhoy jets &#x2014; 24s, 25s, and 30s &#x2014; over the years in quantities unknown. More importantly, Russia kept S-400 anti-air batteries in town, despite pulling many of the S-300s into Ukraine, which &#x201C;made sure that Israel was dependent on Russia&#x2019;s goodwill to carry out its air strikes in Syria,&#x201D; she said, as S-400s could have shot those air strikes down. &#x201C;We&apos;ve seen the Russian troops withdraw primarily to the air base at Hmeimim, and then also the troops withdraw into Tartus,&#x201D; Neil Quilliam, an associate fellow with the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House, London, told the Kyiv Independent. There is a catch. &#x201C;At the moment, you know, they&apos;re still there, they&apos;re still present. There hasn&apos;t been an evacuation,&#x201D; said Quilliam. While the Russian Embassy in Syria did urge its citizens to leave the country on Dec. 6, the Russian military has yet to pull out in the chaotic fashion that some were anticipating just days ago. Dara Massicot, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace argued that any mass evacuation of Russian equipment will be obvious. For the time being, it&#x2019;s a political tightrope. While Russia is clearly hedging, it seems to be managing the handover of power successfully for the time being. That is despite the fact that up until days ago, Russia referred to groups like Hayat Tahrir ash-Shams (HTS), the driving force of the advance on Damascus, in terms of terrorism. The Russian Air Force group based at Hmeimim Airbase in Latakia district on Dec. 7 touted it had destroyed &#x201C;over 300 terrorists, 55 vehicles and one warehouse&#x201D; in its defense of Assad&#x2019;s regime. HTS is an Islamist group that split from al-Qaeda more than a decade ago and remains on Western terror designation lists. Russia&#x2019;s work to defend Assad may not doom it in the eyes of the new rulers of Syria, however. A portrait of overthrown Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is pictured with its frame broken, in a Syrian regime&apos;s Political Security Branch facility on the outskirts of the central city of Hama, following the capture of the area by anti-government forces, on Dec. 7, 2024. (Omar Haj Kandour / AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;There was no great love for Russia in Syria. But Russia doesn&apos;t care about love. They care about securing influence with a ruling regime, whatever that regime might be,&#x201D; said Borshchevskaya. What the fall of Assad means for Ukraine remains uncertain, but &#xA0;Ukrainian intelligence is delighting in Russia&#x2019;s failure. Russia and Iran have meanwhile accused Ukraine of training and equipping the rebel groups. Regardless of any evacuation, a collapse in Russia&#x2019;s power in Syria undermines Putin&#x2019;s authority in the global south. &#x201C;The Middle East, by and large, didn&apos;t really buy into the Western and Ukrainian narrative on the war. They tended to be at best neutral on Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. The situation has the potential of changing that narrative that Russia is not the great power that so many in the so-called Global South perceive it to be,&#x201D; said Borshchevskaya. &#x201C;The Syrian and Ukrainian theaters were always deeply connected,&#x201D; she said, but cautions that the Syrian bases were a logistical hub for African operations rather than anything in Ukraine. Ramifications could play against Ukrainian interests. &#x201C;If they were to pull these people out of Syria they could just end up in the Donbas or elsewhere. It&#x2019;s a very uncertain picture.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/the-russian-weapons-in-the-balance-of-syrias-regime-shift/	2024-12-11T11:49:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188252219.jpg
Zelensky slams Orban for phone call with Putin to discuss Ukraine	President Volodymyr Zelensky slammed Hungary&apos;s Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Dec. 11 following his hour-long call to Russian President Vladimir Putin during which the two discussed the war in Ukraine. The call occurred earlier in the day after Orban&apos;s visit to Mar-a-Lago and meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Orban said on X that the call with Putin lasted an hour. The prime minister also mentioned that these weeks are the war&apos;s &quot;most dangerous,&quot; adding that the parties are taking &quot;all possible diplomatic steps&quot; to promote a ceasefire and peace talks. In response, Zelensky called for &quot;not playing on one&apos;s own image at the expense of unity&quot; but &quot;for the common success.&quot; He added that discussions about the war in Ukraine cannot occur without its representatives. &quot;It is absolutely clear that achieving real peace and guaranteed security requires American determination, European unity, and the commitment of all partners to uphold the goals and principles of the U.N. Charter,&quot; the president added. &quot;We all hope that Orban at least won&apos;t call Assad in Moscow to listen to his hour-long lectures as well,&quot; Zelensky wrote on Telegram, referring to ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad who fled to Moscow after rebels took over the Syrian capital Damascus on Dec. 9. Zelensky also thanked Trump and European leaders with whom Ukraine &quot;is already working together to find the right and strong solutions for real peace.&quot; Orban responded to Zelensky&apos;s criticisms, claiming on X that Hungary had allegedly proposed &quot;a Christmas ceasefire and a large-scale prisoner exchange&quot; to Zelensky, but that the Ukrainian president had ruled it out. Hungary has retained warm diplomatic and economic ties with Moscow even after the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, refusing to send military aid to Kyiv and vocally opposing EU sanctions on Russia, albeit eventually voting for every one of the packages. Hungary&apos;s prime minister was the first EU leader to visit Putin in Moscow in July after taking the helm of the EU presidency despite Western attempts at isolating the Russian leader.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-hope-orban-wont-at-least-call-al-assad-zelensky-on-orban-calling-putin-to-discuss-ukraine/	2024-12-11T11:25:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188503703.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia continues to suffer record losses in December, Zelensky says	Key developments on Dec. 11: Russian forces have incurred record-high casualties in manpower during hostilities in both November and December, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 11 after hearing a report from Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi. Moscow&apos;s troops are advancing at a rapid pace in Ukraine&apos;s east, pushing back outgunned and outnumbered Ukrainian defenders at the cost of staggering losses. &quot;As in November, the Russian military is using a record number of its men in December in battles and assaults,&quot; Zelensky said on Telegram. &quot;These months &#x2014; November and December &#x2014; saw record Russian losses,&quot; the president noted, adding that the Pokrovsk and Kurakhove sectors in Donetsk Oblast remain the active parts of the front. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry said on Dec. 1 that Russian losses throughout November amounted to 45,720 soldiers wounded, killed, or captured, as well as over $3 billion worth of equipment. November also saw the record broken for the enemy personnel losses in one day with 2,030, the highest figure since Feb. 24, 2022. Ukrainian and Western estimates put Russian losses at between 600,000-750,000 killed, injured, or captured, while Moscow has not disclosed the exact figures. Despite the losses, Russia holds the upper hand on the battlefield, advancing toward key Donetsk Oblast towns like Pokrovsk and chipping away at the Ukrainian position in the Russian border region of Kursk. In his post, Zelensky also thanked Ukrainian forces for &quot;tangible hits on Russian targets last night,&quot; namely &quot;military facilities on Russian territory&quot; and &quot;energy and fuel facilities.&quot; Earlier today, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported a successful strike against a Druzhba oil pipeline loading station near the Russian city of Bryansk, resulting in a large-scale fire. Ukraine has enough funds and ammunition to continue resisting Russia at least throughout the first half of 2025, even if U.S. assistance dries up, Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko said in an interview with the El Pais newspaper published on Dec. 11. Marchenko&apos;s comments come amid growing concern that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump might withdraw Washington&apos;s crucial support for Kyiv after he takes office in January. &quot;I believe that we have enough funds, enough weapons, missiles, and artillery shells to resist at least during the first half of 2025,&quot; Marchenko said. Ukraine is allocating necessary funds from its budget to purchase equipment and continues to receive U.S. arms, the minister explained. &quot;This means that at least during the first half of the year and beyond, we will be well-equipped to resist this aggression,&quot; he added. The outgoing Biden administration has accelerated its weapons deliveries ahead of Trump&apos;s inauguration, announcing an arms package worth nearly $1 billion on Dec. 7. Washington has provided Ukraine with over $60 billion in arms and equipment since the outbreak of the full-scale war, making it by far the most important military donor. The flow of supplies may soon dry up, as Trump recently said that Kyiv could expect a reduction of U.S. assistance after he takes office. Marchenko noted that the possibility of Trump cutting aid is a &quot;challenge.&quot; It is, therefore, in Kyiv&apos;s interest to &quot;create the necessary conditions&quot; for cooperation with the new administration, he added. &quot;We want to build a good relationship,&quot; Marchenko said. President Volodymyr Zelensky met Trump in Paris on Dec. 7 for the first time since the latter&apos;s reelection. Reuters wrote that the two did not discuss the specifics of any concrete peace plan, but the Ukrainian president stressed the need for security guarantees. Marchenko expressed his belief that full NATO membership remains the best possible guarantee to deter Russian aggression, with a &quot;modern and strong Ukrainian military&quot; as the only alternative. Russian occupation authorities in Donetsk jailed nine Ukrainian soldiers captured after defending Mariupol to between 24 years and a life sentence, the city&apos;s exiled authorities reported on Dec. 11. Russia often uses trumped-up charges to jail captured Ukrainian soldiers, activists, journalists, and regular civilians for lengthy terms. Moscow&apos;s proxies in Donetsk now sentenced soldiers of the 36th Marine Brigade who fell into Russian hands after a gruesome siege of Mariupol and its Azovstal steel plant in the spring of 2022, the exiled Mariupol City Council said on Telegram. Andrii Shestak, Nazarii Moroz, Vladyslav Yavorskyi, Vadym Shulha, Serhii Yampolskyi, Maksym Kolbasin, Dmytro Shalara, Volodymyr Penzin, and Kostiantyn Romaniuk will serve their sentences in a high-security prison, according to the statement. The occupation authorities accused the soldiers of shelling the village of Staryi Krym near Mariupol in March 2022. Ukraine&apos;s former Prosecutor General said that nine out of 10 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POW) are subjected to physical and moral torture. While Ukraine has managed to bring back home some of the captives, including Azovstal defenders, through prisoner exchanges, many more remain in Russian captivity. Russia may launch its new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) against Ukraine for the second time &quot;in the coming days,&quot; the Associated Press (AP) reported on Dec. 11, citing an unnamed U.S. official. Russia launched its new intermediate-range ballistic missile at Dnipro in Ukraine on Nov. 21. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed the strike was in response to Ukraine&apos;s use of American and British weapons to target deeper within Russia. Washington still sees the experimental Oreshnik missile more as &quot;an attempt at intimidation than a game-changer on the battlefield in Ukraine,&quot; a U.S. official told reporters on condition of anonymity, referring to a U.S. intelligence assessment. Russia has only &quot;a handful&quot; of the Oreshnik missiles, and they carry a smaller warhead than other missiles that Russia has regularly launched at Ukraine, AP reported, citing an official. In early December, the Moscow Times reported, citing four Russian official sources, that the media blitz following the strike on Dnipro was a carefully staged stunt designed to scare off the West. The Oreshnik is likely not a new Russian development but a modification of the RS-26 missile, also known as the Rubezh, Fabian Hoffmann, a defense expert and doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;I think basically they (Russians) just took apart the RS-26 or just cannibalized it, and then put together this new missile with a couple of upgrades, and a new paint job.&quot; First produced in 2011, and successfully tested in 2012, the Rubezh is a 36,000 kilogram, nuclear capable, intermediate-range ballistic missile with a known range of 5,800 kilometers.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-continues-to-suffer-record-losses-in-december-zelensky-says/	2024-12-11T11:10:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/bc6f183ae4821383bf047af1aa25e4f7_1733842351.jpeg
Russia may launch new Oreshnik missile against Ukraine in 'coming days,' US intelligence says	Russia may launch its new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) against Ukraine for the second time &quot;in the coming days,&quot; the Associated Press (AP) reported on Dec. 11, citing an unnamed U.S. official.

Ukrainian airline SkyUp launches flights from Moldova in April 2025	Ukrainian airline SkyUp Airlines announced on Dec. 11 the launch of a program of direct scheduled flights from Chisinau, Moldova to several European destinations, according to the company&apos;s statement. Ukraine&apos;s airspace has been entirely closed since the start of the full-scale invasion began. Ukrainians traveling abroad must use road or rail to reach neighboring countries to catch flights. The country has explored options to reopen some airports, but lacks the air defenses needed to protect the airspace amid continued Russian drone and missile attacks. SkyUp chose the Chisinau Airport in Moldova as it is the closest international hub to Ukraine. Chisinau is located nearly 70 kilometers (44 miles) from the Ukrainian border and roughly 180 kilometers (111 miles) from the nearest major Ukrainian city, Odesa, in southern Ukraine. Flights from Chisinau are scheduled to start in April 2025, and tickets are already available for booking from Dec. 11, 2024. The list of routes includes cities in Spain, Portugal, France, Greece, and Cyprus, as the statement read. On April 11, 2023, the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) published a seven-year forecast that included the likelihood of restrictions over Ukrainian airspace remaining in place until 2029. The State Enterprise for Air Traffic Services said in 2023 that Ukrainian airspace &quot;will reopen after the war ends.&quot; Crispin Ellison, a senior partner at the Marsh McLennan insurance and risk management firm, said on Nov. 7 that at least one of Ukraine&apos;s airports, either in Lviv or Boryspil near Kyiv, could resume operations by the end of January 2025. Communities and Territories Development Minister Oleksii Kuleba said on Nov. 21 that Ukraine is &quot;95%&quot; ready to resume commercial flights, but the key remaining factor is ensuring the safety of passengers.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-airline-launches-flights-from-moldova-in-april-2025/	2024-12-11T09:55:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/386247416_294930769960358_5492924620030070883_n.jpg
The Kyiv Independent’s picks for best Ukraine-related books of 2024	The year 2024 proved to be another landmark for books about Ukraine and Ukrainian literature in translation, with a continued trend in publishing in fiction, non-fiction, and poetry. Unsurprisingly, Russia&#x2019;s ongoing full-scale war against Ukraine was the most common topic among these works. Whether through incisive on-the-ground reportage that captures the suffering and fortitude of the Ukrainian people or through reflections on the historical forces that shaped the present moment, Ukraine-related publications in 2024 offered a rich and multifaceted portrait of the country. Read together, these works of prose and poetry invite English-language readers to engage with the story of the Ukrainian people in all its depth, complexity, and urgency. The Kyiv Independent has curated a selection of the 10 most compelling books on Ukraine from 2024. This list serves as a guide rather than a definitive ranking, offering readers a foundation to engage with the year&apos;s literary highlights while anticipating the Ukraine-related publications slated for 2025. A mix of fiction and creative nonfiction, the collective stories in Ukrainian author Artem Chapeye&apos;s &quot;The Ukraine&quot; deliver a colorful mosaic of contemporary Ukrainian life leading to the full-scale war. The title itself is a provocative rebuke of the common foreign misstep of referring to the country as &#x201C;the Ukraine,&#x201D; a phrasing that implies it is a borderland of Russia. Instead, Chapeye invites readers to discover the real Ukraine &#x2014; his Ukraine. A perfect blend of humor and heartbreak, the collection portrays the everyday struggles of ordinary Ukrainians while also laying bare the historical and political divides that shape their world. Whether it&#x2019;s the story of an elderly pensioner trying to sell vegetables on the street getting harassed by corrupt police or a western Ukrainian traveling to the east only to realize the country is not as divided as one would have them believe, each story unfolds as a microcosm of the Ukrainian people&#x2019;s broader societal tensions and aspirations. The characters in Chapeye&#x2019;s stories are fully realized individuals that command a sense of dignity amid political uncertainty and systemic neglect. It offers a rare glimpse into the lives and dreams of those striving to reconcile a fractured past with an uncertain future, making it as timely as it is timeless. The unnamed narrator of Ukrainian author Tanja Maljartschuk&#x2019;s novel &#x201C;Forgottenness,&#x201D; grappling with an agoraphobic episode, becomes consumed by the past, reading old newspapers in search of understanding time&apos;s relentless passage. Her journey leads her to Viacheslav Lypynskyi, a forgotten figure in Ukrainian history whose life she believes intersects with her own in unexpected ways. As she uncovers his role in Ukraine&#x2019;s centuries-long fight for independence, the narrator begins to confront the intergenerational trauma that weighs upon her family&apos;s history, particularly the horrors of the Holodomor and Soviet repression. The novel explores themes of national identity, memory, and the struggle to preserve one&#x2019;s voice against the overwhelming forces of time. Through vivid storytelling and historical depth, &#x201C;Forgottenness&#x201D; asks: Can one truly escape the past, or is it destined to consume us all? Drawing on firsthand accounts from Ukrainian officials, soldiers, and civilians, Ukraine-born journalist Yaroslav Trofimov of the Wall Street Journal delivers a gripping chronicle of the full-scale war in &#x201C;Our Enemies Will Vanish.&#x201D; From Russia&#x2019;s unyielding refusal to negotiate to the world&#x2019;s hesitation over Moscow&#x2019;s so-called &quot;red lines,&quot; the latter of which has consistently delayed critical military aid, Trofimov captures the extraordinary resolve of the Ukrainian people facing the threat of annihilation. With journalistic precision and deep empathy, Trofimov also documents some of the war&#x2019;s darkest chapters, including the horrific mass executions uncovered in Bucha following Kyiv Oblast&#x2019;s liberation and the bloody clashes in Bakhmut, Donetsk Oblast. Beyond the enduring scars of documented Russian crimes, Trofimov highlights pivotal victories for Ukrainian forces, such as the liberation of southern Kherson and eastern Kharkiv oblasts. Trofimov&#x2019;s masterful reporting is a testament to the power and importance of fearless, on-the-ground journalism. In &#x201C;The Language of War,&#x201D; Ukrainian author and soldier Oleksandr Mykhed delivers a searing account of the first year of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, blending personal reflections with reportages. With raw intensity and poetic precision, Mykhed examines how the war has not only upended Ukrainian lives but also reshaped the very fabric of language, compelling Ukrainians to forge new expressions for navigating unimaginable grief, loss, and anger. From recounting his parents&apos; ordeal in Russian-occupied Bucha to reflecting on the generational trauma that conflict imprints, Mykhed crafts a profound and sobering narrative of war&#x2019;s emotional toll. Deeply rooted in the centuries-long history of Russian aggression against Ukraine, &#x201C;The Language of War&#x201D; also captures the enduring weight of the past, along with Mykhed&#x2019;s stark awareness that this terror may resurface within his lifetime. Harvard&#x2019;s Ukrainian Research Institute also published Ukrainian author Olena Stiazhkina&#x2019;s novel &#x201C;Cecil the Lion Had to Die&#x201D; in 2024, but her diary chronicling the fall of Donetsk stands out as a deeply personal and vital testimony, shedding light on the roots of the current war from a local perspective. Stiazhkina masterfully dismantles the Russian propaganda myth of a &quot;people&#x2019;s uprising against Kyiv,&quot; offering striking examples of how infiltrating Russians failed to convincingly pose as locals. Their unfamiliarity with the regional variations of spoken Russian in Donetsk compared to Russia exposed them as outsiders, as did their lack of knowledge about the city&#x2019;s layout. The fall of Donetsk, Stiazhkina reveals, was not a sudden event but a creeping catastrophe, something many realized only when it was too late. Adding to this heartbreak was the betrayal of seeing former friends and neighbors align themselves with the enemy, deepening the wounds of occupation. Simultaneously, Stiazhkina&apos;s testimony is laced with dark humor &#x2014; a hallmark of her writing and a shared sensibility among many Ukrainians who have endured over a decade of Russian aggression. Scottish journalist Jen Stout delivers a timely and necessary account of her experience covering the war in Ukraine. Her journey begins in Moscow before the full-scale invasion and takes readers from her reporting on Ukrainian refugees in Romania to the front lines in Donetsk. At its core, the book is a powerful tribute to the resilience of the Ukrainian people, who, despite relentless Russian bombardments, continue to find ways to survive &#x2014; and even to thrive. Stout also delves into the cultural shifts in cities like Odesa and Kharkiv, the emotional toll of journalists reporting from war zones, and the extraordinary contributions of Ukraine&apos;s cultural community in the face of crisis. With remarkable empathy and insight, she paints a portrait of Ukrainian society where unlikely alliances emerge &#x2014; such as between the LGBTQ+ community and football ultras &#x2014; driven by a shared fight for survival against Russian aggression. &#x201C;Night Train to Odesa&#x201D; is an eye-opening, deeply human exploration of the unbreakable spirit of the Ukrainian people. Poetry is one of the cornerstones of Ukrainian literature, with works about war holding particular weight and significance. In her collection &#x201C;The God of Freedom,&#x201D; Ukrainian author Yuliya Musakova delivers a powerful, haunting portrayal of life during wartime, where personal and collective struggles are inextricably linked. With vivid imagery and emotional depth, the poems navigate love, survival, and resilience against the relentless backdrop of war&#x2019;s destruction. Musakova&#x2019;s verses do not shy away from the harsh reality that spurred them; they boldly confront the wounds inflicted by war while capturing the quiet heroism of healing. This collection is both a mournful reflection and a resilient testament &#x2014; its voice rises from the chaos, grounded in the unwavering belief that hope can endure. The site of one of the most catastrophic disasters of the 20th century, Chornobyl (Ukrainian historian Serhiy Plokhy distinguishes in the book between &#x201C;Chornobyl&#x201D; for the abandoned city and &#x201C;Chernobyl&#x201D; for the site of the nuclear disaster of 1986) once again made international headlines when the iconic nuclear power plant fell under Russian occupation at the onset of the full-scale war in Ukraine. Plokhy, widely regarded as the leading Ukrainian historian of our time, chronicles the harrowing events that unfolded as Russian forces advanced into Ukraine from Belarus. The nearly 300 personnel stationed at the plant &#x2014; comprising firefighters, operators, and members of the National Guard &#x2014; were taken hostage, forced to navigate a perilous new reality under the control of occupying forces. Compounding the danger, Russian troops dug trenches within the radioactive exclusion zone, seemingly oblivious to the grave health and environmental risks. Plokhy describes the temporary occupation of Chornobyl as an act of nuclear blackmail, serving as &quot;a warning for the future&#x201D; in a conflict-ridden world. Ukraine-born historian Eugene Finkel&apos;s &quot;Intent to Destroy&quot; offers a compelling and nuanced examination of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, tracing its origins beyond the full-scale invasion of 2022. The title itself is a reference to the definition of genocide, a topic which Finkel specializes in as a historian. The historian paints a chilling picture of the ongoing atrocities committed by Russian forces &#x2014; murders of Ukrainian civilians and soldiers, forced relocations of thousands of children, destruction of cultural heritage, and torture under occupation &#x2014; all of which are part of a centuries-long campaign by Russia to subjugate Ukraine. The turning point in Ukraine&#x2019;s history, marked by its push for a democratic future during the 2014 Euromaidan Revolution, posed an existential threat to Russia. Yet, despite the dire threats of annihilation it imposed upon Ukraine thereafter, Ukrainians have stood firm in their fight for independence. Finkel&#x2019;s work underscores the profound stakes of this ongoing struggle, reminding readers of the human cost and the broader geopolitical implications of the war. A series of poetic vignettes narrated by Ukrainian women who have endured the ravages of Russia&#x2019;s war, Iliukha&#x2019;s &#x201C;My Women&#x201D; is a testament to the scars inflicted upon Ukrainian society. One woman, a lifelong speaker of Russian and lover of Russian culture, finds herself buried under rubble from a Russian attack &#x2014; it is presented as a cruelly ironic fate that silences her without regard for her love of Russian authors like Alexander Pushkin or Mikhail Lermontov. Another woman scours a mass grave for her husband&#x2019;s distinguishing features, finding him at last when she recognizes the haunting smile of his wolf tattoo. A third woman, concealing the abyss of grief within herself, dons red lipstick as a fragile armor of beauty, only to face the whispers of neighbors who brand her shameless while her husband remains missing. Simple yet brutal, these vignettes capture the fragility of wartime day-to-day existence. Iliukha masterfully conveys through spare yet evocative prose an unflinching glimpse into lives forever altered by the war. Hi, this is Kate Tsurkan, thanks for reading this article. There is an ever-increasing amount of books about Ukraine available to English-language readers, and I hope my recommendations prove useful when it comes to your next trip to the bookstore. Ukrainian culture has taken on an even more important meaning during wartime, so if you like reading about this sort of thing, please consider supporting The Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/the-kyiv-independents-picks-for-best-ukraine-related-books-of-2024/	2024-12-11T09:43:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/upd.jpg
How the downfall of Russia-backed Assad in Syria may affect Ukraine war	Russia has helped Bashar al-Assad to keep his rule in Syria for many years until Syrian rebels took over the country in just a few days. The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Natalia Yermak sat down with Neil Quilliam, a Middle East expert at Chatham House, to talk about what it means for Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine and how it might put Kyiv and the West in a more favorable position in the potential peace negotiations with Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/how-the-downfall-of-russia-backed-assad-in-syria-may-affect-ukraine-war/	2024-12-11T09:05:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/IMG_8490.jpg
EU approves 15th sanction package against Russia, targeting 'shadow fleet'	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. European Union&apos;s ambassadors agreed on a 15th package of sanctions against Russia, the Hungarian Presidency of the Council of the EU reported on Dec. 11 on X. The new package targets Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; a group of older, often uninsured tankers used to transport Russian oil and circumvent international sanctions. These sanctions will include restrictions on the fleet&apos;s operations. Sanctions were also imposed on people and organizations from Russia and third countries that contribute to Russia&apos;s military and technological development by helping it circumvent export restrictions, according to the statement. &quot;The EU and its G7 partners are committed to keeping pressure on the Kremlin. I welcome the agreement on our 15th package of sanctions, targeting in particular Russia&apos;s shadow fleet,&quot; European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote on X. Over the past few months, the EU has found it progressively more difficult to adopt sanctions packages, as Hungary has used its veto power to block such decisions. According to Reuters, at the beginning of December, the EU failed to approve the sanctions, which included an extension for Czechia to import Russian oil products through Slovakia, over disagreements about extending deadlines for European companies to withdraw investments from Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-approves-15th-sanction-package-against-russia-targeting-shadow-fleet/	2024-12-11T07:57:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1775102025.jpeg
Biden approves new memorandum on national security ahead of Trump taking office	U.S. President Joe Biden approved a new national security memorandum before Donald Trump begins his second term in the White House, the Associated Press reported on Dec. 11, citing its undisclosed sources in Biden&apos;s administration. Trump&apos;s imminent return to the White House in January raises concerns about future relations between Washington and its prominent partners and adversaries, including Russia. The memorandum could become &quot;a roadmap&quot; for the next administration, as it appears to be seeking to counter the growing cooperation between China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. The Biden administration began drafting the recommendations in the summer, according to AP. The document will not be published due to the &quot;sensitivity of some of its findings,&quot; the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity under White House ground rules, told AP. The memorandum contains four broad recommendations, such as improving U.S. government interagency cooperation, accelerating information sharing with allies on four key adversaries, adjusting the use of sanctions and other economic tools for maximum effectiveness, and enhancing preparations for resolving simultaneous crises involving adversaries, AP reported. Biden and Trump have &quot;sharply different&quot; world views, but officials from both administrations said they would try to coordinate on national security issues during the transition. Biden&apos;s memorandum &quot;isn&apos;t trying to box (the Trump administration) in or tilt them toward one policy option or another,&quot; one official told AP, adding that the document is intended to help the incoming administration build &quot;capacity&quot; as it shapes its policies on some of &quot;the most difficult foreign policy issues&quot; it will face. As the full-scale is ongoing, Russia has been strengthening its economic and military ties with China, Iran, and North Korea. Moscow established regular supplies of drones from Tehran and borrowed its technology to launch its own domestic production. North Korea has been supplying Russia with artillery shells and and missiles since the first months of the war, and this fall, it sent soldiers to Russia. North Korea was the first country to enter the war with its forces. China, in turn, has become one of Russia&apos;s largest suppliers of dual-use goods since the start of the full-scale invasion. The two nations also conduct joint patrols in the Arctic region.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-approves-new-memorandum-on-national-security-ahead-of-trump-taking-office/	2024-12-11T07:27:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184603402.jpg
Ukraine's tax hike, G7 loan enough for planned defense expenses in 2025, Finance Ministry says	A recently signed tax hike and parts of the G7&apos;s $50 billion loan will be sufficient to cover Ukraine&#x2019;s defense expenses included in the 2025 budget, the Finance Ministry said on Dec. 11. For the next year, Ukraine allocated 26.3% of its gross domestic product (GDP) to defense and security expenditures, including Hr 740 billion ($17.7 billion) for arms purchases and Hr 50 billion ($1.2 billion) on the production and purchase of drones. Ukraine began actively developing its defense production after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. To cover the growing defense expenses, Ukraine&#x2019;s government raised the war tax on personal income from 1.5% to 5% and introduced a war tax on small businesses and individual entrepreneurs. Separately, the G7&apos;s Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) initiative is expected to bring an additional $50 billion to Kyiv&apos;s coffers. The loan will be covered by proceeds from the roughly $300 billion of frozen Russian assets, which amount to roughly $3 billion annually over 30 years. The U.S. announced on Dec. 10 the disbursement of $20 billion for Ukraine as part of the loan. The EU is expected to contribute $20 billion, Canada $3.7 billion, and Japan and the U.K. $3 billion each. Only a part of these funds, namely those provided by the EU and the U.K., can be used directly to cover defense needs. These funds &quot;will allow to fully finance all planned expenditures of the Defense Forces in 2025,&#x201D; the ministry said, adding that &quot;meeting the needs of the security and defense sector is an undisputed priority for the Finance Ministry.&quot; Speaking to El Pais, Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko said that Ukraine has enough arms and funds to continue resisting Russia at least until mid-2025 and possibly longer if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump cuts support after taking office.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-tax-hike-g7-loan-enough-for-planned-defense-expenses/	2024-12-11T06:25:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/financeministry.jpg
YouTuber Johnny Harris’ lens on Eastern Europe is distorted and irresponsible	Something is wrong with YouTuber Johnny Harris&#x2019; lens &#x2014; not the one he uses to film himself, but his view of Eastern European history. Known for his unquenchable thirst for maps and archival documents, Harris has become a prominent voice on geopolitics and history. If you&apos;re unfamiliar with him, Harris developed his personal brand at Vox Media before leaving during the COVID-19 pandemic after his web series &#x201C;Borders&#x201D; was canceled. On Dec. 5, he published a video titled &#x201C;Why People Blame America for the War in Ukraine.&#x201D; In it, he echoes Kremlin talking points about NATO expansionism being the cause of Russia&#x2019;s so-called &#x201C;special military operation&#x201D; in Ukraine. As Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Creative Video Director, I often see this argument in our YouTube comments &#x2014; usually from bots. To hear it from Harris, however, is unexpected. To summarize his argument: NATO provoked Russia, and the Kremlin was left with no choice but to invade Ukraine. Of course, buried in the final moments, he acknowledges how inexcusable and tragic this war has been. Harris&#x2019; video claims that the United States treated Russia as a defeated belligerent at the end of the Cold War, taking advantage of its weakness to expand NATO to Russia&#x2019;s borders. Despite all the maps in Harris&#x2019; possession, he shockingly overlooks how little of Russia NATO actually borders. Before Russia&#x2019;s 2022 invasion prompted Finland to join the alliance, NATO only bordered about 378 kilometers (235 miles) of Russia&#x2019;s 57,792-kilometer (35,910 miles) border. This point is neglected by Harris. In his narrative, the Soviet collapse of 1991 is treated similarly to Germany&#x2019;s 1918 surrender in World War I &#x2014; shamed, indebted, and politically isolated. Yet, in the decades that followed, the new Russia was awarded a permanent Security Council seat, invited to the G7, given lucrative energy deals, and hosted the Olympics and World Cup. While some in Washington remained skeptical and suspicious of Russia, Moscow received far more generosity and prominence than any other former Soviet republic. In contrast, the U.S. pressured Ukraine to weaken its defense deterrence at Russia&#x2019;s insistence, prioritizing friendlier relations with Moscow over Kyiv&#x2019;s security concerns. We explore this in our recent video on the Budapest Memorandum. Yes, the reality is more complex than I&#x2019;ve outlined, but that&#x2019;s precisely my point: Harris&#x2019; perspective is too narrow to the point of irresponsibility. Harris issued an apology early Dec. 6 after a &#x201C;wave of feedback&#x201D; and removed the video &#x2014; likely prompted by his sponsor &#x201C;not wanting to be associated&#x201D; with it. He admitted he &#x201C;omitted the valuable perspective of these Eastern European countries.&#x201D; With sleek design, he mapped NATO&#x2019;s expansion into Central and Eastern Europe. Somehow, it didn&#x2019;t occur to him to question why these countries voluntarily joined a defensive military alliance. As one colleague put it, &#x201C;When you join a gym, we don&#x2019;t call it gym enlargement.&#x201D; Why would these countries want to join NATO? In Harris&#x2019; telling, Russia wanted peace and to partner with the West after the fall of the Soviet Union. Yet, Russia had a curious way of showing this. Harris neglects even a cursory glance at Russian history. Moscow spent much of the 1990s at war, occupying parts of Moldova and Georgia, and crushing the uprising in Chechnya. He praises Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev&#x2019;s efforts to end the Cold War, yet ignores how Gorbachev sent tanks to Lithuania to crush its independence movement. Central and Eastern Europeans remember these events &#x2014; and the comments on Harris&#x2019; video made him very aware of this. Johnny Harris is not stupid. He was aware of what he was doing in this video. In fact, he joked that his viewers would be Googling &#x201C;Is Johnny Harris funded by the Russian government?&#x201D; after watching it. With a broad grin, he dismisses this as if it were not a serious concern. It&#x2019;s not like the U.S. Justice Department exposed a Russian operation in September that covertly paid several prominent right-wing influencers to promote its agenda. Or the questionable finances of former RT journalist Max Blumenthal&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Grayzone.&#x201D; Similar operations have been exposed in the media, academia, and NGOs &#x2014; including an arrest of a think tank employee this week. With Harris&#x2019; massive following and his scrutiny of official narratives, he would make for an attractive target &#x2014; whether wittingly or not.

(Anatolii Stepanov/AFP via Getty Images)Harris appears genuinely surprised by the backlash. But should he be? More importantly, should any of us really be surprised by this video from him? Harris has long been guilty of a white-savior complex, broadcasting the plight of the colonized and Global South to the world &#x2014; from Venezuela&#x2019;s hyperinflation to Sudan&#x2019;s civil war. Yet, you rarely hear their voices in his videos &#x2014; especially after he left Vox. He&#x2019;s hesitant to turn the camera away from himself. He understands it&#x2019;s his face that gets views, so it&#x2019;s understandable to put himself front and center. But when dealing with sensitive subjects, it&#x2019;s past time for him to include the voices of those who have spent more time experiencing and studying the topics he explores. Harris is not a nobody. He has over 6 million global subscribers, corporate sponsors, and a Patreon that earns up to an estimated $21,000 per month. This is not the first time he has been called out for prioritizing sensationalism over facts and disregarding history. This was evident in his video &#x201C;Why Is Russia So DAMN BIG?,&#x201D; which whitewashes Russia&#x2019;s violent history of expansionism. This is especially important in the visual medium we operate in on YouTube. Video is a powerful tool of persuasion. The experience of watching a Harris video is hypnotic due to his masterful use of storytelling, music, graphics, and editing. It can move viewers emotionally as well as intellectually. Take one moment in Harris&#x2019; now-deleted video on NATO and Russia (still available on a Twitch stream), where he says: &#x201C;Here in the political West, we mostly blame Russia and China for greedily trying to disrupt the U.S.-led rules-based order, but what if that&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201D; As he says this, he cuts to House Speaker Mike Johnson. Why him? Johnson is not representative of American foreign policy, but to Harris&#x2019; target audience, he represents American hypocrisy. Johnson has constantly defended convicted felon and incoming president, Donald Trump. He is certainly not the face of a &#x201C;rules-based order.&#x201D; Furthermore, Johnson only joined Congress in 2017, meaning he was not involved in NATO expansion, which Harris explores in the video. That subconscious influence through editing makes video an effective tool for propaganda. The question for Harris is whether he wants to be a journalist or a propagandist.

Russian proxies sentence 9 Azovstal defenders to 24 years, life in prison	Russian occupation authorities in Donetsk jailed nine Ukrainian soldiers captured after defending Mariupol to between 24 years and a life sentence, the city&apos;s exiled authorities reported on Dec. 11. Russia often uses trumped-up charges to jail captured Ukrainian soldiers, activists, journalists, and regular civilians for lengthy terms. Moscow&apos;s proxies in Donetsk now sentenced soldiers of the 36th Marine Brigade who fell into Russian hands after a gruesome siege of Mariupol and its Azovstal steel plant in the spring of 2022, the exiled Mariupol City Council said on Telegram. Andrii Shestak, Nazarii Moroz, Vladyslav Yavorskyi, Vadym Shulha, Serhii Yampolskyi, Maksym Kolbasin, Dmytro Shalara, Volodymyr Penzin, and Kostiantyn Romaniuk are to serve their sentence in a high-security prison, according to the statement. The occupation authorities accused the soldiers of shelling the village of Staryi Krym near Mariupol in March 2022. Ukraine&apos;s former Prosecutor General said that nine out of 10 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POW) are subjected to physical and moral torture. While Ukraine has managed to bring back home some of the captives, including Azovstal defenders, through prisoner exchanges, many more remain in Russian captivity.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-proxies-sentence-9-azovstal-defenders/	2024-12-11T05:54:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1644189321.jpg
Russia convinced Assad to flee Syria amid rebel offensive, Bloomberg reports	Moscow persuaded Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad to flee to Russia with his family after realizing his regime was bound to lose to the opposition&apos;s rapid advance, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 11, citing its sources. Syrian rebels announced on Dec. 8 that they successfully ousted Assad from power following a lightning offensive across the country, which culminated with the capture of the capital city of Damascus. Assad was swiftly flown out of the country via a Russian airbase by Moscow&apos;s intelligence agents to avoid his capture by the rebels, Bloomberg wrote. The airplane&#x2019;s transponder was likely turned off to avoid being tracked, the outlet&apos;s source said. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov confirmed on Dec. 10 that Russia is sheltering the ousted Syrian dictator. According to Bloomberg, Russian President Vladimir Putin was questioning his security services over their failure to spot the growing threat to Assad&#x2019;s regime until it was too late. Moscow deployed its troops to Syria in 2015, providing support to the Assad regime against multiple anti-government forces. Damascus has been supportive of the Kremlin during the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Russian forces operating in Syria have been accused by the U.N. and other organizations of committing war crimes in the country, including the intentional bombing of hospitals and the usage of &quot;double-tap&quot; attacks, a tactic Russia has repeated in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-pushed-assad-to-flee-syria-bloomberg/	2024-12-11T05:18:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188637812.jpg
Russian-occupied Abkhazia left without electricity due to hydroelectric station shutdown	Georgia&apos;s Russian-occupied region of Abkhazia lost all electricity supply due to the shutdown of the only power station supplying energy to the region, Russian state news agency TASS reported on Dec. 11, citing an Abkhaz energy company. The Enguri hydroelectric power station, partially located in Abkhazia, stopped working on Dec. 11 due to critically low water levels in a nearby reservoir. The region has recently faced energy shortages aggravated by a growing spat with its Russian patrons. Moscow has cut almost all funding, including money crucial for the energy sector, after Abkhazia&apos;s local council voted against a controversial investment agreement with Russia. The full-blown energy crisis came even though the Abkhaz authorities appealed to Russia for assistance on Dec. 6. Russia has occupied Abkhazia and South Ossetia after a war with Tbilisi in 2008, backing local breakaway leadership. Both regions are internationally recognized as Georgia&apos;s sovereign soil. Tensions arose between Moscow and Abkhazia in November following protests against a law that would permit Russians to purchase property in Abkhazia. The demonstrations culminated in the resignation of the region&apos;s head, Aslan Bzhania, and the local council voting down the law on Dec. 3. Three days later, the Abkhaz authorities announced that nearly all Russian funding had ceased, save for pension payments.	https://kyivindependent.com/abkhazia-energy/	2024-12-11T04:49:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2157386935.jpg
Russia continues to suffer record losses in December, Zelensky says	Russian forces have incurred record-high casualties in manpower during hostilities in both November and December, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 11 after hearing a report from Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi. Moscow&apos;s troops are advancing at a rapid pace in Ukraine&apos;s east, pushing back outgunned and outnumbered Ukrainian defenders at the cost of staggering losses. &quot;As in November, the Russian military is using a record number of its men in December in battles and assaults,&quot; Zelensky said on Telegram. &quot;These months &#x2014; November and December &#x2014; saw record Russian losses,&quot; the president noted, adding that the Pokrovsk and Kurakhove sectors in Donetsk Oblast remain the active parts of the front. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry said on Dec. 1 that Russian losses throughout November amounted to 45,720 soldiers wounded, killed, or captured, as well as over $3 billion worth of equipment. November also saw the record broken for the enemy personnel losses in one day with 2,030, the highest figure since Feb. 24, 2022. Ukrainian and Western estimates put Russian losses at between 600,000-750,000 killed, injured, or captured, while Moscow has not disclosed the exact figures. Despite the losses, Russia holds the upper hand on the battlefield, advancing toward key Donetsk Oblast towns like Pokrovsk and chipping away at the Ukrainian position in the Russian border region of Kursk. In his post, Zelensky also thanked Ukrainian forces for &quot;tangible hits on Russian targets last night,&quot; namely &quot;military facilities on Russian territory&quot; and &quot;energy and fuel facilities.&quot; Earlier today, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported a successful strike against a Druzhba oil pipeline loading station near the Russian city of Bryansk, resulting in a large-scale fire.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-losses-december/	2024-12-11T03:52:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-25_14-22-21.jpg
Updated: Hungary's Orban calls Putin to discuss Ukraine	Editor&apos;s note: The article was updated with a statement by Viktor Orban. Hungary&#x2019;s Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the war in Ukraine and other topics in a phone call initiated by Budapest, the Kremlin said in a statement on Dec. 11. The call took place after Orban&apos;s visit to Mar-a-Lago and meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. It would also mark Putin&apos;s second call with a European leader in recent weeks after the Kremlin&apos;s chief held a phone call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. &quot;&#x200B;&#x200B;Viktor Orban expressed interest in promoting a joint search for ways to resolve the crisis politically and diplomatically, including taking into account his contacts with a number of Western leaders,&quot; the Kremlin said, referring to Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine. Hungary has retained warm diplomatic and economic ties with Moscow even after the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, refusing to send military aid to Kyiv and vocally opposing EU sanctions on Russia, albeit eventually voting for every one of the packages. &quot;I had an hour-long phone conversation this morning with President Putin. These are the most dangerous weeks of the Russia-Ukraine war,&quot; Orban said on X. &quot;We are taking every possible diplomatic step to argue in favor of a ceasefire and peace talks.&quot; According to the Kremlin, &quot;Vladimir Putin outlined his fundamental assessment of the current development of the situation around Ukraine and the destructive line of the Kyiv regime, which continues to exclude the possibility of a peaceful settlement of the conflict.&quot; The parties also discussed energy and economic cooperation, the statement read. Hungary&#x2019;s prime minister was the first EU leader to visit Putin in Moscow in July after taking the helm of the EU presidency despite Western attempts at isolating the Russian leader.	https://kyivindependent.com/orban-putin/	2024-12-11T03:14:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2159992681.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Ukraine moves to replace Chinese drone parts	The following is the Dec. 10, 2024 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. It&#x2019;s a persistent problem with the drone supply to Ukrainian troops: Imported Chinese drones are often laden with defective parts, Kyiv Independent reporter Kollen Post writes in his latest. While they have typically been cheap enough to merit replacing, China is actively cutting off its exports of components and materials critical to drone building. China made headlines in Ukraine for restricting drone components at the outset of September. Recent reports show China has already begun curbing sales to American and European drone makers and is readying more sanctions. The measures are only expected to spell more trouble for Ukraine&#x2019;s war efforts. In the face of these threats, Ukraine&#x2019;s drone industry is increasingly onshoring the production of more ambitious components. And they&#x2019;re getting better than anyone expected at building even the trickier gadgets needed to keep Ukraine&#x2019;s army of drones in flight. &quot;We cannot rely on a Chinese supply chain,&quot; says Denys Nikolayenko, who makes high-end thermal cameras for drones, from an office in Kyiv. Read the full article here. (Romain Costaseca / Hans Lucas / Hans Lucas via AFP)Egg prices are spikingThe price of eggs just won&#x2019;t quit. In October, the price of eggs skyrocketed 60% from the previous month up to around Hr 50-75 ($1.20&#x2013;1.80) for a carton of eggs (10 eggs in Ukraine), Ukrainian media outlet NV reported, citing Ukraine&#x2019;s largest grocery chain ATB. Over the last three years, the price of eggs has increased 101%. As eggs are a staple of my diet, I have a personal stake in asking &#x2014; what&#x2019;s going on? Before we get too carried away, the price of eggs is typically higher in winter than in summer months when chickens produce more eggs. A higher supply and temperatures force farmers to get rid of their eggs quicker, driving down the price. Nonetheless &#x2014; a combination of drought and frost, a smaller harvest, a rise in feed prices and higher electricity prices brought on by Russia&#x2019;s attacks on the country&#x2019;s energy system is contributing to the price spike. Not everyone is convinced, however. According to Yuri Gaidai, senior economist at the Kyiv-based Center for Economic Strategy (CES), Ukraine&#x2019;s antimonopoly committee has an ongoing investigation into egg prices. &#x201C;Perhaps, in addition to objective economic reasons, someone was trying to earn more. This is being checked: requests are sent to feed and egg producers to compare their data,&#x201D; Gaidai said on Inter, a news channel. No relief can be expected soon, says CES on its Telegram channel &#x2014; holiday demand will only drive the prices further up. They should stabilize in 2025, but not return to previous lows, the center wrote.

(Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)Beyond diesel generatorsAs Ukraine begins yet another winter with rolling blackouts and freezing temperatures, businesses are increasingly looking beyond diesel generators to fuel their operations during power cuts, business leaders said at the Energy Security Dialogue 2024 on Dec. 4. CEO of Nova Energy Andrii Lytvynenko said the company is moving away from diesel generators and plans to equip around a thousand branches of the popular Nova Poshta postal chain with battery power supplies that allow for uninterrupted electricity during outages. Around 400 branches already use these systems, he said. &quot;The simplest, fastest solution is, of course, generators,&quot; Lytvynenko said. &quot;Today, we have around 4,000 generators in the company.&quot; However, the noise and carbon emissions &#x2014; as well as the work needed to refuel and maintain them &#x2014; led the company to look for alternative emergency power systems, Lytvynenko said.

The U.S. Treasury Department announced on Dec. 10 that it will provide $20 billion in loan assistance to Ukraine, marking its contribution to a broader $50 billion initiative supported by G7 countries. The loan will be repaid using proceeds from frozen Russian assets. The Defense Ministry has approved the new Droid TW 12.7 robotics complex, used on a tracked platform with a Browning 12.7 mm machine gun, for combat operations, the ministry announced on Dec. 9. Meanwhile, successful tests of a new Ukrainian missile, dubbed Ruta (Rue), are underway, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced, also on Dec. 10. The owners of the casino, Pin-Up, who are Russian citizens, allegedly collected personal data and information about the location of their users, including military personnel of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and other military formations, the State Bureau of Investigation (DBR) and the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office announced on Dec. 5. The European Commission unveiled the 35-billion-euro loan in September within the framework of the G7&apos;s broader $50 billion loan, which is covered by proceeds from frozen Russian assets. The final amount of the EU&apos;s contribution will be determined &quot;after all parties to the initiative approve the amount of loans, Ukraine&apos;s Finance Ministry said on Dec. 4. With a deal to transport Russian gas through Ukraine set to expire at the end of the year, Ukraine&#x2019;s gas transit network could soon come under Russian attacks, warned Dmytro Lyppa, CEO of the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine, though the probability that gas transport is halted is &#x201C;very low,&#x201D; he said at the Energy Security Dialogue 2024 in Kyiv organized by the DiXi Group think tank.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-business-roundup-ukraine-moves-to-replace-chinese-drone-parts/	2024-12-11T02:55:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1258705267.jpg
Ukraine has arms to resist at least until mid-2025 if US cuts aid, finance minister says	Ukraine has enough funds and ammunition to continue resisting Russia at least throughout the first half of 2025, even if U.S. assistance dries up, Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko said in an interview with the El Pais newspaper published on Dec. 11. Marchenko&apos;s comments come amid growing concern that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump might withdraw Washington&apos;s crucial support for Kyiv after he takes office in January. &quot;I believe that we have enough funds, enough weapons, missiles, and artillery shells to resist at least during the first half of 2025,&quot; Marchenko said. Ukraine is allocating necessary funds from its budget to purchase equipment and continues to receive U.S. arms, the minister explained. &quot;This means that at least during the first half of the year and beyond, we will be well-equipped to resist this aggression,&quot; he added. The outgoing Biden administration has accelerated its weapons deliveries ahead of Trump&apos;s inauguration, announcing an arms package worth nearly $1 billion on Dec. 7. Washington has provided Ukraine with over $60 billion in arms and equipment since the outbreak of the full-scale war, making it by far the most important military donor. The flow of supplies may soon dry up, as Trump recently said that Kyiv could expect a reduction of U.S. assistance after he takes office. Marchenko noted that the possibility of Trump cutting aid is a &quot;challenge.&quot; It is, therefore, in Kyiv&apos;s interest to &quot;create the necessary conditions&quot; for cooperation with the new administration, he added. &quot;We want to build a good relationship,&quot; Marchenko said. President Volodymyr Zelensky met Trump in Paris on Dec. 7 for the first time since the latter&apos;s reelection. Reuters wrote that the two did not discuss the specifics of any concrete peace plan, but the Ukrainian president stressed the need for security guarantees. Marchenko expressed his belief that full NATO membership remains the best possible guarantee to deter Russian aggression, with the &quot;modern and strong Ukrainian military&quot; as the only alternative.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-has-enough-arms-to-resist-at-least-until-mid-2025-marchenko/	2024-12-11T02:34:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/Marchenko.jpg
Zelensky emphasized security guarantees in talks with Trump, Reuters reports	President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump did not discuss specifics of any concrete peace plan during their talks with Paris, with Trump calling for an immediate ceasefire, Reuters reported on Dec. 11, citing undisclosed sources. Trump was &quot;friendly, respectful&quot; and in a &quot;listening mode&quot; during their 35-minute meeting on Dec. 7, the news agency wrote after talking with five people familiar with the matter. Trump and Zelensky met in Paris as world leaders gathered to celebrate the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral. French President Emmanuel Macron hosted the two for their first in-person meeting since Trump won the reelection in November. &quot;Some key points were mentioned during the meeting &#x2013; for example, it was said that peace needs guarantees because a ceasefire alone isn&apos;t enough, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin could break it again, as he has done before, without proper guarantees,&quot; Reuters&#x2019; source in Zelensky&apos;s office was quoted as saying. U.S. military support for Ukraine hangs in the air as Trump prepares to take office on Jan. 20, 2025. The Republican politician vowed to bring a quick end to Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine. Frugal with details, he hinted at reducing U.S. aid and bringing both sides to the negotiating table as quickly as possible. Sometimes using tough rhetoric toward Zelensky during the presidential campaign, the Paris talks painted a slightly different picture of Trump. The U.S. president-elect behaved in a &quot;friendly, respectful, and open manner and appeared to be in listening mode,&quot; Reuters&#x2019; source described. Following his meeting with Zelensky, Trump said the Ukrainian leader is ready &quot;to make a deal and stop the madness&quot; and that Putin should do the same after incurring staggering losses in Ukraine. &quot;Too many lives are being so needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed, and if it keeps going, it can turn into something much bigger, and far worse,&quot; Trump wrote on Social Truth on Dec. 8. Zelensky addressed Trump&apos;s post on his Telegram channel on Dec. 8, saying the war &quot;cannot be ended simply with a piece of paper and a few signatures,&quot; warning that &quot;a ceasefire without guarantees can be reignited at any moment, as Putin has already done in the past.&quot; The Ukrainian president has signaled openness to a diplomatic end to the war as the Russian advance picked up pace in the east while Ukraine&apos;s resources grow thin.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-zelensky-reuters/	2024-12-11T02:12:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188739851.jpg
Police raid Ukrainian Railways over suspected criminal scheme	The police carried out searches at Ukrainian Railway&apos;s premises in Kyiv and Kyiv Oblast over a suspected criminal scheme by a group of the company&apos;s officials, the police and Ukrainian Railways said on Dec. 11. The railway employees are suspected of earning illicit gains by manipulating tickets offered for international travel. &quot;The actions of the defendants led to significant losses and the creation of an artificial shortage of tickets for the most popular routes on the market,&quot; the police&#x2019;s statement read. &quot;Searches and seizures of material evidence, hearings, and detentions are being conducted,&quot; Ukrainian Railways said in a statement. The search was conducted in offices, employees&#x2019; homes, and trains. Since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, trains became one of the primary and perhaps the easiest means of travel both within Ukraine and abroad, as airports remained shut, ratcheting up demand for Ukrainian Railways&#x2019; services. Over 600 railway employees have been killed since Feb. 24, 2022. The state-owned Ukrainian Railways has also been embroiled in a number of corruption scandals over the years. In April, anti-corruption agencies began investigating a former presidential advisor, two company top officials, a Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) officer, and three other people over Ukrainian Railways&apos; purchase of transformers at inflated prices.	https://kyivindependent.com/police-raids-ukrainian-railways/	2024-12-11T01:28:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Railways.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 8, injure 57 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least eight civilians and injured at least 57 over the past day, regional authorities reported early on Dec. 11. Russia launched a missile attack against the city of Zaporizhzhia late on Dec. 10, destroying a clinic, killing seven people, and injuring 22, officials said. At least 20 residential buildings were damaged. Russian attacks against Kharkiv Oblast injured 19 people, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. The vast majority &#x2014; 17 &#x2014; were recorded in the town of Zlatopil after Russia struck the city with two Iskander-M missiles, according to officials. Sixteen residential buildings were damaged. A 63-year-old man was also injured in the village of Zapadne, and a 59-year-old woman in the village of Ivashky, Syniehubov said. In Kherson Oblast, one person was killed and 15 injured in Russian attacks, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. One civilian was injured during a Russian attack against Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-111/	2024-12-11T01:10:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-11_10-02-04.jpg
As military options dwindle, US support is key to Ukraine's peace talks	Ukraine is exhausted. Low on manpower, ammunition, and, most importantly, morale, the country is slowly reckoning with the fact that the ongoing war may be unwinnable on the battlefield &#x2014; at least for now. According to a Gallup survey published on Nov. 19, 52% of Ukrainians now say they want their country to negotiate an end to the war &#x201C;as soon as possible.&#x201D; However, the terms of such a settlement would depend on Washington as much, if not more, than on Kyiv. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has been vocal about Russia&#x2019;s all-out war against Ukraine, often making remarks in support of Moscow rather than Kyiv. He has promised to end the war within &#x201C;24 hours,&#x201D; without providing details, and called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky &#x201C;the greatest salesman.&#x201D; Trump and his allies have blocked a $61 billion aid package critical to Kyiv&#x2019;s war effort for over six months. Trump&#x2019;s son, Donald Trump Jr., has vocally opposed outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s decision to allow Ukraine to strike targets deep inside Russia with Western-provided long-range missiles. These developments have unsettled Kyiv. Another concerning development is Trump&#x2019;s nominations for key positions, including individuals with controversial views on Ukraine. Among the most contentious are Tulsi Gabbard, his pick for director of national intelligence, and Pete Hegseth, a candidate for defense secretary. The stance of Keith Kellogg, nominated as a potential special envoy for Ukrainian peace, remains to be seen. In March 2022, Gabbard echoed Russian propaganda by promoting false claims that Ukraine was hosting &#x201C;U.S.-funded biolabs.&#x201D; She also warned that U.S. sanctions against Russia could trigger nuclear war. Meanwhile, Kellogg co-authored a peace plan proposing to freeze the front line in Ukraine, delay NATO accession indefinitely, and partially lift sanctions on Russia. These statements and nominations have fueled concerns in Kyiv and Moscow that the new administration will push to freeze the war along current front lines. But both sides are likely to reject such a proposal. A Ukrainian soldier looks out from a trench at an artillery position near Kharkiv, Ukraine, on Dec. 6, 2024. (Photo by Nikoletta Stoyanova/Getty Images)&#x201C;The (Russian) president has repeatedly said that any option of freezing the conflict won&#x2019;t work for us,&#x201D; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Nov. 20. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s important for us to achieve our goals.&#x201D; Russia&#x2019;s goals include occupying more territory in Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk Oblast and pushing Ukrainian forces out of Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. Moscow may also aim to retake northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, with Russian forces currently threatening Kupiansk, a city liberated by Ukraine in September 2022. Russia&#x2019;s steady advances in eastern Ukraine, combined with its attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure, give Moscow leverage in potential peace talks. Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksandr Merezhko has warned that Russia&#x2019;s demands far exceed what Ukraine can offer. Moscow has already declared the annexation of four Ukrainian oblasts &#x2014; Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson &#x2014; despite not fully controlling them. &#x201C;(Russian President Vladimir) Putin cannot backtrack on annexations,&#x201D; Merezhko told the Kyiv Independent. Russia is also expected to demand that Ukraine abandon its NATO aspirations. Caught in this dire situation, Ukraine faces a difficult balancing act. A source in Zelensky&#x2019;s office, speaking anonymously, said Kyiv will not agree to freeze the war along the current front lines. Such an arrangement would leave Ukraine vulnerable, allowing Russia to regroup and rearm. &#x201C;Many of our fellow citizens will be hurt by these words, but the defense of Kursk Oblast is a higher priority than the Kurakhiv bridgehead, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts,&#x201D; said Dmytro Zhmailo, a military expert and executive director of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center. Holding Russian territory could prevent peace talks on Moscow&#x2019;s terms, as the Kremlin has stated it will not negotiate while Ukraine controls any part of Russia. Meanwhile, Ukraine must maintain morale while engaging with Trump&#x2019;s incoming administration to promote the idea that supporting Kyiv serves U.S. interests. In September, Zelensky presented Biden with a &#x201C;victory plan,&#x201D; outlining steps needed for Ukraine to continue its fight. While the plan received little enthusiasm, two proposals reportedly caught Trump&#x2019;s attention: Ukrainian troops replacing U.S. forces in Europe and sharing Ukraine&#x2019;s critical natural resources with the U.S. and its allies.

(Chesnot/Getty Images)Over the past few months, Ukrainian leadership has shown greater openness to peace talks, even with limited leverage. Kyiv hopes to push the U.S. toward stricter sanctions on Russia and a stronger negotiating position for peace talks expected next year. However, whether these talks will yield results remains uncertain. Ukrainian officials insist that any agreement must provide security guarantees, ensure Ukraine&#x2019;s independence, and restore at least some territories occupied by Russia. The potential shift in U.S. policy under Trump has alarmed not just Kyiv but also its allies in Europe. Countries like Poland, which share a direct stake in Ukraine&#x2019;s survival and regional stability, are already bracing for the impact of a reduced American commitment. Poland, in particular, has emerged as a key player in rallying European support for Ukraine. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, drawing from his experience in the European Council, has expressed concerns about Trump&#x2019;s unpredictability and its implications for Ukraine. He warned that we must expect the worst, and that a forced ceasefire on Putin&#x2019;s terms could lead to renewed conflict and greater instability in Eastern Europe. Poland is leveraging its defense spending &#x2014; nearly 5% of GDP &#x2014; and its strategic purchases of American weapons to assert its commitment to NATO and transatlantic security. Warsaw hopes to use this position to persuade Trump to maintain U.S. support for Ukraine. At the same time, Poland and its regional partners are preparing contingency plans, including potentially forming a coalition of willing nations to continue military aid if U.S. support falters. Yet, even with such efforts, Europe faces significant challenges in maintaining the flow of military supplies to Ukraine. Production levels have not yet scaled up to meet demand, and some Western European leaders remain hesitant about deeper involvement. Ukrainians are exhausted, and for now, a military solution seems out of reach. The trajectory of peace talks, however, will largely depend on Washington. There is a golden opportunity to persuade the new administration to take decisive action. Ending the war for good is within reach, but it will require granting Ukraine NATO membership and reclaiming territories currently occupied by Russia. The U.S. has the leverage to compel the Kremlin to negotiate and to force meaningful concessions. Key economic tools include lowering global oil prices, tightening sanctions enforcement, and cutting off Moscow&#x2019;s ability to sustain its war effort financially. To support Ukraine, the U.S. could also tap into frozen Russian assets to fund the military hardware Ukraine still needs. A critical window of opportunity is on the horizon, and the U.S. has the tools to seize it. Now, it&#x2019;s up to Kyiv to convince Trump that this is the path forward.

Syria's ousted dictator Assad in Russia, Russian official confirms	Overthrown Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad is in Russia, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov confirmed on Dec. 10 in an interview with NBC News. This comes as the first official confirmation of speculations that Assad and his family fled to Moscow following the collapse of the dictator&apos;s regime in Syria. &quot;He is secured, and it shows that Russia acts as required in such an extraordinary situation,&quot; Ryabkov said in the interview with NBC News. Syrian rebels announced on Dec. 8 that they successfully ousted Assad from power following a rapid offensive across the country. The opposition established control over the major cities of Aleppo and Hama before reaching the nation&apos;s capital, Damascus. A key ally of Assad&apos;s regime, Moscow was unable to support him because of the &quot;massive damage&quot; the Russian army incurred in Ukraine, U.S President Joe Biden said on Dec. 8. Russia maintains military bases in Syria, at the moment it is unclear what Assad&apos;s ousting means for Russian military activity in the country. Moscow deployed its troops to Syria in 2015, providing support to the Assad regime against multiple anti-government forces. Damascus has been supportive of the Kremlin during the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Russian forces operating in Syria have been accused by the U.N. and other organizations of committing war crimes in the country, including the intentional bombing of hospitals and the usage of &quot;double-tap&quot; attacks, a tactic Russia has repeated in Ukraine. The ousting of the Assad regime is seen as a strategic blow to Russia after years of backing.	https://kyivindependent.com/assad-in-russia/	2024-12-11T00:14:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2162733009.jpg
Russia killed at least 109 Ukrainian POWs in 2024, ombudsman says	The Russian military summarily executed at least 109 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POW) in 2024, Ukraine&#x2019;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on national television on Dec. 10. &quot;In 2024 alone, we can confirm that Russian troops shot 109 Ukrainian prisoners of war,&quot; Lubinets said. Reports of murders, torture, and ill-treatment of POWs are received regularly by Ukrainian authorities. The ombudsman added that 177 cases of POW executions were confirmed &quot;during the previous years of the full-scale war.&quot; It is not immediately clear whether he was referring to the overall figure of 177 captives who died in Russian captivity throughout the all-out war, as revealed by Victoria Tsymbaliuk, a representative of the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of POWs, in October. Nevertheless, the number of POWs killed in 2024 alone underscores an increased frequency of summary executions by the Russian military. This trend coincides with an accelerated pace of the Russian advance in Ukraine. The figures refer only to officially confirmed cases, meaning the overall numbers may be higher. &quot;There are Russian representatives who are now cynically and publicly showing the whole world that they do not comply with international humanitarian law, the Geneva Conventions, they abduct children, they commit torture against the civilian population of Ukraine, they kill Ukrainian prisoners of war,&quot; Lubinets said. The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2023 for the forced deportation of Ukrainian children. The Hague court also issued arrest warrants for ex-Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the General Staff of the Russian army. Shoigu and Gerasimov are charged with &quot;directing attacks at civilian objects,&quot; &quot;causing excessive incidental harm to civilians or damage to civilian objects,&quot; and the &quot;crime against humanity of inhumane acts.&quot; &quot;Unfortunately, we do not see an effective reaction from the international community. We are very grateful for the deep concern, but as the war in Ukraine, which has been going on for more than 10 years, three years of full-scale war, shows, words do not stop Russia,&quot; Lubinets said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-killed-at-least-109-ukrainian-pows-in-2024-ombudsman-says/	2024-12-10T23:46:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1752126648.jpg
Media identifies over 82,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine	Journalists and volunteers have identified the names of 82,050 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine as of Dec. 6, according to a joint investigation by BBC Russia and Mediazona, a Russian independent media outlet, published on Dec. 11. Russia has made territorial gains in eastern Ukraine, using brutal mass wave tactics to advance at the cost of high casualties among its soldiers. Findings by Mediazona and BBC Russia show the losses disproportionally impact lower-income and racially marginalized regions of Russia. Bashkortostan is home to the highest number of identified soldiers killed in Ukraine. The Ukrainian military reported that Russia has surpassed 750,000 casualties in its war against Ukraine as of early December. The figure includes both dead and injured soldiers. Ukrainian and Western authorities have reported daily highs of up to 1,500 Russian casualties. Ukrainian authorities reported 700,000 Russian losses on Nov. 4, less than three months after they announced 600,000 Russian casualties. Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures, though a Defense Ministry official recently let slip that the department received 48,000 requests to identify missing soldiers. Russia has sought to avoid instituting a full-scale mobilization, a position politician analysts connect with fear of public disapproval. Instead, the country hiked sign-on bonuses to attract volunteers. In an attempt to mitigate casualties among Russian citizens, Moscow has also made an effort to recruit foreigners into their army. Russia has cooperated with North Korea, with Pyongyang reportedly dispatching 10,000-12,000 soldiers to assist Russia with its war against Ukraine. The independent Russian outlet Meduza reported last week that, according to its calculations, Moscow&apos;s losses began outpacing its recruitment capacity for the first time.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-identifies-over-82-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine-2/	2024-12-10T22:36:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2003914665.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 757,340 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 757,340 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 11. This number includes 1,400 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,526 tanks, 19,616 armored fighting vehicles, 31,073 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,067 artillery systems, 1,253 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,023 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 20,111 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-757-340-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-12-10T22:13:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1759371571.jpg
Ukrainian missile attack damages critical infrastructure in Russia's Rostov Oblast, Russian officials claim	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Ukrainian missile struck a boiler plant in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast overnight on Dec. 11, damaging critical infrastructure in the city of Taganrog, local Russian officials claimed. Yuri Slyusary, the acting governor of Rostov Oblast, claimed that an overnight Ukrainian missile attack struck an &quot;industrial facility&quot; in Taganrog, damaging the facility as well as 14 cars in the parking lot. Taganrog Mayor Svetlana Kambulova later reported that heating supply had been disrupted in 27 apartment buildings in the city following an attack on a boiler plant within the city. Videos posted on social media capture a series of loud explosions in Taganrog around 3:30 a.m. local time. The Kyiv Independent cannot independently verify any of the Russian claims, and Ukraine&apos;s military has not yet commented on the alleged attack. The full extent of the damage was not immediately clear, although Slyusary claimed that there were no casualties as a result of the alleged attack. No additional details were provided by Russian officials. The alleged attack on Russian critical infrastructure comes as Russia continues to increase its onslaught of attacks against Ukrainian energy facilities, as it seeks to plunge the country into another harsh winter aimed at testing Ukrainians&apos; resolve. In the most recent mass aerial attack on the country on Nov. 28, Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said that Russia struck a &quot;massive blow&quot; to the nation&apos;s power grid. Situated on the Russia-Ukraine border, Rostov Oblast has become a regular target of Ukrainian attack since the start of the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-missile-attack-damaged-critical-infrastructure-in-russias-rostov-oblast-russian-officials-claim/	2024-12-10T21:52:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/1024px-Novocherkassk_Power_Station.jpg
Russia 'prepared to consider' prisoner exchange with US, Russian official says	Russia is open to participating in another prisoner exchange with the U.S., Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said in an interview with NBC News on Dec. 10. The call for a prisoner exchange comes as U.S President-elect Donald Trump is set to be inaugurated in January, and following the most extensive prisoner exchange between the U.S and Russia in August Russia will &quot;definitely be prepared to consider&quot; a prisoner exchange, Ryabkov told NBC News, adding that a potential exchange could mark &quot;a healthy step forward, especially at the beginning of the next (U.S.) administration.&quot; Russia has long been accused of incarcerating individual in rulings that are widely seen as being politically motivated. In August, the U.S and its allies exchanged prisoners with Russia in a transfer mediated by Turkey. 26 people from seven countries &#x2014; U.S., Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway, Russia, and Belarus were freed. Those released to Russia include spies, assassins, and cyber-criminals, included convicted Russian hitman Vadim Krasikov. In exchange, the U.S received three prisoners in the swap, including Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. Gershkovich was arrested in Yekaterinburg in late March 2023 while working on a story about the Wagner mercenary group&apos;s recruiting methods, as well as Russian citizens&apos; views on the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Following more than a year of pretrial detention, Gershkovich&apos;s trial finally began in June, and he was convicted of espionage and sentenced to 16 years in prison. No timeline was provided as to when the next prisoner exchange may be expected, with Ryabkov adding that facilitated exchanges require &quot;a multiphased or multistep approach on both sides.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-open-to-prisoner-exchange-with-us-ryabkov-says/	2024-12-10T20:54:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1576124699.jpg
US considering implementing harsher sanctions on Russian oil ahead of Trump's inauguration, Bloomberg reports	The Biden administration is considering implementing new, harsher Russian oil sanctions ahead of the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 10, citing its sources. Oil revenues are a crucial source of funding for Russia&apos;s war machine, and have been repeatedly targeted by Western sanctions since the start of full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Although no concrete decisions have been made on the potential sanctions, sources familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg that a number of avenues are being explored, including sanctions on Russia&apos;s so-called &apos;shadow fleet.&apos; The additional sanctions, targeting Russian oil tankers that carry billions of dollars worth of oil and oil products, may be unveiled in the coming weeks, the sources said. The new sanctions are expected to be announced ahead of the January presidential inauguration, amid uncertainty over a future Trump administration&apos;s handling of peace negotiations. While Trump has pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Russia&apos;s war and negotiate a quick peace deal, Ukrainian officials have urged the president-elect to maintain support and adopt a &quot;peace through strength&quot; approach in dealings with Russia. As the White House prepares for a transition and President Joe Biden&apos;s influence diminishes in the lead-up to the inauguration, the new sanctions are under consideration amid declining oil prices, according to sources cited by Bloomberg. Following the U.S. presidential election, Biden has continued to implement hardline foreign policy decisions much to the detriment of Russia, including authorizing Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles for strikes inside Russia On Nov. 21, the Biden administration imposed harsher sanctions on dozens of Russian banks, including Gazprombank, Russia&apos;s main conduit for energy-related payments &#x2014; sinking the Russian ruble to levels it has not seen since March 2022, following the full-scale invasion. The decisions to sanction Gazprombank stirred blowback from some Western allies, namely Hungary and Turkey &#x2014; with officials fearing that similar strict future sanctions may drive up oil prices. The latest discussions on additional sanctions comes the Biden administration rushes to deliver the remaining approximately $5 billion in military aid to Ukraine ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, amid concerns that a future Trump administration would halt weapons shipments before they reach Kyiv. Two administration officials told Politico on Nov. 6 that the White House plans to expedite the weapons delivery ahead of the January inauguration, as Trump has previously said he would cease military aid to Ukraine unless it agrees to hold peace negotiations with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-considering-implementing-harsher-russian-oil-sanctions-ahead-of-trump-inauguration-bloomberg-reports/	2024-12-10T20:17:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167101990.jpg
US announces $266 million in sales to bolster Ukraine’s F-16 fighter jets	The State Department approved a $266 million foreign military sales package for Ukraine on Dec. 10, enabling the sustainment of services as well as repairs necessary for the upkeep of the country&apos;s F-16 fighter jets. The proposed sale, which has not yet been formally finalized, includes key support systems for Ukraine&apos;s F-16 fighter jets, including the Joint Mission Planning System, weapons software, training equipment, as well as spare and replacement parts for the jets, the State Department said. The announcement of the sale package comes as President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Dec. 7 that Denmark has transferred a second batch of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, further bolstering the country&apos;s air defense capabilities. The sales package &quot;will improve Ukraine&#x2019;s capability to meet current and future threats by further equipping it to conduct self-defense and regional security missions with a more robust air defense capability,&quot; the State Department said in its statement announcing the sale. Ukraine received its first F-16s at the beginning of August, a year after its allies formed the fighter jet coalition at the NATO summit in Vilnius to support Kyiv with training and aircraft. Ukraine&apos;s limited number of F-16 fighter jets have continued to shoot down Russian aerial targets, despite concerns over the pace of training provided for Ukrainian pilots. These concerns were amplified following the deadly crash of an F-16 jet during efforts to repel a massive Russian attack. Despite the incident, hundreds of Ukrainian pilots have received F-16 training from a number of Western allies, including the United States. In late August, the White House rejected a proposal from the U.S. military to send civilian contractors to Ukraine to maintain F-16s and other equipment, the Wall Street Journal reported. The sales package comes as the Biden administration rushes to deliver additional aid to Ukraine ahead of the January inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, amid concerns that a future Trump administration would halt military aid to Kyiv. On Dec. 7, the U.S. announced its latest $988 million military package to Ukraine, including ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), as well as new drone deliveries. The latest aid package will be supplied through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative &#x2014; a Pentagon-led program for supplying arms to Ukraine through contracts with U.S. defense companies.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-announces-266-million-in-sales-to-bolster-ukraines-f-16-fighter-jets/	2024-12-10T18:25:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2165218520.jpg
Hungary vows to block potential EU sanctions on Georgia over protest crackdowns	Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has pledged to veto a proposal to impose EU sanctions on Georgian officials, for their crackdown on anti-government protests, the First Channel of Georgia reported on Dec. 10. Speaking alongside Georgian Foreign Minister Maka Bochorishvili, Szijjarto criticized the EU and the &#x201C;international liberal elite&#x201D; and claimed that he is &#x201C;categorically against&#x201D; any sanctions towards Georgia. &quot;If the opposition had won the elections, Brussels would have been shouting loudly about democracy in Georgia. They would have said that democracy in Georgia has never been so strong, but the conservative party won the elections, and they are doing everything to deny and ignore the will of the citizens,&quot; Szijjarto said. The EU Foreign Affairs Council is set to discuss the situation on December 16, with a possibility of potential sanction introductions. Tbilisi&apos;s ties with multiple European countries have steadily deteriorated since the pro-Russian Georgian Dream adopted a controversial &quot;foreign agents&quot; law in May. Tensions only mounted after Georgian Dream declared victory in the Oct. 26 parliamentary elections despite widespread accusations of a rigged vote. The latest wave of protests against the ruling Georgian Dream party broke out two weeks ago, after Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced the suspension of the South Caucasus&apos; EU accession process until at least 2028. Over 220 people have been arrested during the ensuing crackdown, with dozens reported injured as the Georgian police deployed tear gas and water cannons. Budapest is broadly seen as the most Moscow-friendly country within the EU and NATO, repeatedly obstructing aid to Kyiv and sanctions against Russia. Szijjarto has also repeatedly visited Russia throughout the full-scale war, a step that his European colleagues avoided.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-vows-to-block-potential-eu-sanctions-on-georgia-over-protest-crackdowns/	2024-12-10T15:28:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2155704049.jpg
Russian drone hits IAEA service vehicle near Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant	On Dec. 10, a Russian drone struck and severely damaged an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) service vehicle on its way to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), President Volodymyr Zelensky reported. The service vehicle was going to the ZNPP for a personnel rotation. &quot;This attack clearly demonstrated how Russia views everything related to international law, international institutions, and security,&#x201D; Zelensky said on Telegram. He also called for a firm response from the IAEA and international partners. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi condemned the attack as &quot;unacceptable,&quot; stressing the agency&apos;s critical role in preventing nuclear accidents during the conflict. The incident follows recent Russian shelling attacks that have disrupted the ZNPP&apos;s power lines multiple times since November, placing the plant at risk of a blackout. At the moment, the plant is connected to the Ukrainian power grid by only one transmission line. Russia has occupied the Zaporizhzhia plant, the largest nuclear station in Europe, since March 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-hits-iaea-service-vehicle-near-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant/	2024-12-10T13:43:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1249892066.jpg
Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Issue 157	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 157 of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly, covering events from Dec. 2-8, 2024. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. Parliament appoints Naftogaz&#x2019;s CEO Chernyshov as national unity minister; CFO Chumak takes over as acting CEO. On Dec. 3, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, appointed Oleksii Chernyshov as a deputy prime minister and national unity minister. Chernyshov served as the governor of Kyiv Oblast from October 2019&#x2013;March 2020 and as the communities and territorial development minister from March 2020&#x2013;November 2022. Since Nov. 4, 2022, Chernyshov was the CEO of Naftogaz, Ukraine&apos;s state-owned oil and gas giant. Later on Dec. 3, the Cabinet of Ministers renamed the Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories Ministry as the National Unity Ministry. According to the Kyiv Independent, the new minister&#x2019;s powers remain unclear. President Volodymyr Zelensky presented the ministry as part of Ukraine&#x2019;s resilience plan, stating that it would focus on strengthening relations with Ukrainians living abroad, the media outlet reported. According to Forbes Ukraine&#x2019;s sources in parliament, the President&#x2019;s Office, and Naftogaz, Chernyshov himself sought to join the government, but only if promoted to deputy prime minister. Two of the sources added that this could be linked to Chernyshov&#x2019;s long-standing aspiration of becoming prime minister. On Dec. 4, Naftogaz announced that its supervisory board had elected Roman Chumak, the company&#x2019;s CFO, as Naftogaz&#x2019;s acting CEO. This decision was supported by all seven members of the board, the company added. According to Naftogaz, Chumak had been with the company for more than 19 years, holding roles ranging from chief specialist to department head. On 28 September 2021, he was appointed as a member of Naftogaz&#x2019;s executive board. &#x2013; SOE Weekly.] The supervisory board has also decided to begin the selection process for a new CEO, aiming to complete the selection by the end of Q1 2025. HACC extends pre-trial restrictions for Kobolyev again. On Dec. 4, the Specialized Prosecutor&#x2019;s Office (SAPO) said that the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) had granted the SAPO&#x2019;s motion and imposed pre-trial restrictions for former Naftogaz CEO Andriy Kobolyev. According to SAPO, Kobolyev is obliged to appear at every request of the prosecutor and the court; report any change of place of residence; refrain from communicating with the persons specified in the court ruling; and hand over all passports to the State Migration Service. SAPO recalled that on Nov. 1, it had filed a motion with HACC to reinstate the restrictions. However, the subsequent court hearings on Nov. 5 and 8, at which HACC was to consider the motion, were not held at the court&#x2019;s initiative, and the procedural obligations expired on Nov. 12. On Nov. 8 and 11, SAPO sent letters to HACC urging them to consider the request to reinstate the restrictions, but an additional meeting was never scheduled, SAPO added. As we reported in Issue 71, on Jan. 19, 2023, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and SAPO charged Kobolyev with illegally awarding himself Hr 229 million, part of a bonus given to the Naftogaz team for their victory against Russia&#x2019;s Gazprom in Stockholm&#x2019;s court of arbitration in 2018. Hr 229 million was $8.8 million or &#x20AC;7.6 million at the time when bonuses were awarded. On Aug. 8, 2023, HACC decided to extend the Hr 229 million bail ($6.1 million or &#x20AC;5.6 million at that time) for another two months and left Kobolyev&#x2019;s procedural obligations, including pre-trial restrictions, unchanged. See SOE Weekly&#x2019;s Issue 99 for details. On Sept. 25, 2023, HACC removed the electronic ankle monitoring device from Kobolyev and halved his bail to the amount already paid, Hr 107 million ($2.9 million or &#x20AC;2.8 million). See Issue 104 for more detail. As we reported in Issue 113, on Nov. 29, 2023, SAPO said that it filed abuse of office charges against Kobolyev. On Nov. 30, at the first preparatory hearing on Kobolyev&#x2019;s charges, HACC granted the SAPO prosecutor&#x2019;s motion and extended his procedural duties until Jan. 30, 2024. On Dec. 14, 2023, following the results of the preparatory meeting, the panel of judges at HACC denied the defense&#x2019;s request to return the indictment, scheduled a hearing on the merits, and commenced a hearing in the Kobolyev case. Since then, HACC has constantly extended the pre-trial restrictions for Kobolyev. See Case No. 991/10459/23. As we wrote in Issue 154, HACC declined to extend pre-trial restrictions for Kobolyev. For an extended background on the Kobolyev case, see SOE Weekly&#x2019;s Issues 71, 72, 73, 77, 78, 79, 83, 84, 88, 91, 99, 104, 113, 136, and 154. For a detailed analysis of this case from a corporate governance perspective, see series of columns by SOE Weekly team members Andriy Boytsun, Oleksandr Lysenko, and Dmytro Yablonovskyi: Are Kobolyev&#x2019;s bonuses a threat to corporate governance reform? Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4, and Part 5. Ukrposhta&#x2019;s CEO Smelyansky to coordinate customs reform. On Dec. 3, the Cabinet of Ministers instituted the position of government commissioner for customs reform, to be held by Ukrposhta&#x2019;s CEO Ihor Smelyansky on a pro bono basis. The Cabinet has also set up a coordination working group. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that the group, headed by the commissioner, would be tasked with synchronizing with the EU (apparently, aligning Ukrainian customs rules with EU rules), modernizing infrastructure, implementing a risk-based system, digitalization, and more. Ekonomichna Pravda (EP) noted that some of the above commissioner&#x2019;s responsibilities essentially overlap with the powers of the Finance Ministry, as set out in the 2014 regulation. Commenting on his appointment as government commissioner, Smelyansky wrote on his Facebook page that he had no plans to resign as Ukrposhta&#x2019;s CEO. The main goal of the project is to develop and propose, together with the Digital Transformation Ministry, Economy Ministry, Finance Ministry, and other stakeholders, a completely new customs model within the next three to four months. In that model, the vast majority of processes would be based on digitalization, data analysis, and risk models, with minimal or no human factor, he explained. State Land Bank gets a supervisory board, the SPFU&#x2019;s press office reported on Dec. 5. The main task of the board is to oversee the activities of State Land Bank LLC and ensure compliance of its operations with the law and the company&#x2019;s charter, the SPFU explained. According to the SPFU, the powers of the supervisory board include: The board members are: As we wrote in Issue 106, the SPFU wants to sell the state&#x2019;s 66.65% stake in Ocean Plaza, previously owned by sanctioned Russian oligarchs Arkady and Igor Rotenberg. As we wrote in April 2024 (Issue 127), the starting price was set at Hr 1.65 billion (39.2 million euros at the exchange rate at that time). See Issues 106, 109, 113, and 127 for more detail on Ocean Plaza&#x2019;s privatization process. The status of the members of Land Bank&#x2019;s board, such as independent members or shareholder representatives, if any, was not reported. According to the SPFU, the board held its first meeting at the end of November 2024, where Danylyshyn was elected as the chair. In addition, the Audit Committee was established. As we reported in June 2023, the SPFU was working out plans to centralize state property management, which included setting up a land bank (see Issue 93). We then wrote that the Cabinet transferred 25 SOEs, previously managed by the National Academy of Agrarian Sciences, to the SPFU on Aug. 11, 2023 (see Issue 100). In June 2024, the Cabinet took away 2,764 agricultural land plots with a total area of more than 104,000 hectares from SOEs. The SPFU-managed Agrarian Investment Fund was given control. The SPFU then announced that preparations for the Land Bank were complete. The next step was to corporatize the Agrarian Investment Fund, so it could act as a land auction operator (see Issue 136). In August, the SPFU completed the corporatization of the Agrarian Investment Fund, creating State Land Bank LLC on its basis (see Issue 144). Shortly after that, the SPFU-managed Land Bank announced the first 16 auctions on Prozorro.Sale for the lease of state agricultural land (see Issue 145). Later, we reported on the results of these 16 auctions (see Issue 150). Starting from July 1, 2021, Ukrainian citizens can legally buy and sell agricultural land. However, the sale and purchase of state-owned and communal agricultural land remain banned. SPFU to put Ukrbud up for privatization for Hr 262.6 million ($6.2 million). On Dec. 6 2024, the Auction Commission of the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) set the starting price for the sale of Ukrbud Construction Company at Hr 262.6 million ($6.2 million). The SPFU also defined the terms of privatization. The potential buyer must: Ukrbud Construction Company designs industrial and civil facilities, carries out construction and installation works, and trains and retrains workers for the needs of the construction industry. The company comprises 10 subsidiaries, including design institutes and training centers, the SPFU added. According to Forbes Ukraine, the Cabinet of Ministers launched the state-owned construction company Ukrbud in 2004. As of September 2024, Ukrbud consisted of 10 separate structural divisions and 11 subsidiaries with a book value of over Hr 265 million ($6.3 million). Of these, five companies are engaged in training and retraining of personnel in the construction industry, and six are engaged in design, the media said. Ukrbud owns 25 real estate properties in 15 cities, including Kyiv, Dnipro, Zhytomyr, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Cherkasy. In addition, the company owns 16 office premises in Kyiv and Dnipro, Forbes Ukraine noted. According to YouControl, In 2023, Ukrbud&#x2019;s revenue was Hr 105.2 million (2.6 million euros at the average exchange rate at the time). The loss for 2023 was Hr 3 million (75,000 euros). For the first half of 2024, it was Hr 5.7 million (132,500 euros). Former Party of Regions MP Prodyvus turns out to be the buyer of Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi port, the SPFU checks the origin of funds. On Dec. 5, Top Offer LLC, the only bidder and, accordingly, the winner of the Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi privatization auction, fully paid Hr 90 million ($2.1 million) for the port itself and Hr 18 million ($431,000) in VAT. According to Forbes Ukraine and liga.net, at the time of the auction, the owner of Top Offer LLC was Yevhen Boguslavskyi, but on Nov. 28, the company&#x2019;s beneficial owner changed to a businessman, former MP from the pro-Kremlin Party of Regions (2012-2014) and former President of the Ukrainian Boxing Federation, Volodymyr Prodyvus. According to Chesno, Prodyvus started his political career in 2012, running for the Verkhovna Rada as a self-nominated candidate, and joined the Party of Regions in December 2012. He was an MP until February 2014, voting for the dictatorial laws of Jan. 16, 2014. He is also one of the owners of Mostobud, a bridge construction company. &#x201C;Currently, the SPFU is conducting an audit to ensure compliance with the privatization law: checking the entity and the origin of the funds,&#x201D; the SPFU&#x2019;s spokesman Maksym Ravchak explained. It is possible that the deal could eventually be cancelled, Forbes Ukraine added. As we wrote in November 2024 (Issue 154), Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi was sold from the thirteenth attempt. The starting price was halved to Hr 89 million ($2.1 million), and only one bidder, Top Offer LLC, took part in the auction. The company offered Hr 90 million ($2.16 million) for the asset. According to YouControl, Top Offer LLC was registered in late 2023 in Kyiv. Its primary registered line of business is the lease and operation of owned or leased real estate. The company was then owned by Yevhen Boguslavskyi. Back then, Boguslavskyi said that he could not disclose the details of the privatization due to his NDA with the investor. He said that the name of the seaport&#x2019;s new owner may become known within a month. Boguslavsky had also refused to discuss the origin of the money for the purchase. For more on the history of Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi&#x2019;s privatization, see SOE Weekly Issues 74, 78, 79, 84, 85, 87, 93, 99, 100, 144, 147, 148, 152, and 154.

Ukraine war latest: US announces $20 billion loan for Ukraine as part of G7 initiative	Key developments on Dec. 10: The U.S. Treasury Department announced on Dec. 10 that it will provide $20 billion in loan assistance to Ukraine, marking its contribution to a broader $50 billion initiative supported by G7 countries. The loan will be repaid using proceeds from frozen Russian assets. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen emphasized the significance of the funding, stating, &#x201C;The $50 billion collectively being provided by the G7 through this initiative will help ensure Ukraine has the resources it needs to sustain emergency services, hospitals, and other foundations of its brave resistance.&#x201D; The funds will be channeled to Ukraine through the World Bank&#x2019;s Facilitation of Resources to Invest in Strengthening Ukraine Financial Intermediary Fund (F.O.R.T.I.S. Ukraine FIF), ensuring immediate availability for critical needs. The U.S. contributed $20 billion of the total loan, matched by European Union countries, including France, Germany, and Italy, which will provide $19.4 billion together. Additional contributions include $3.7 billion from Canada, $3.07 billion from Japan, and $2.9 billion from the United Kingdom. While Western countries have frozen $300 billion in Russian assets, only the annual income generated &#x2014; approximately $3.2 billion &#x2014; is accessible. These proceeds will back the $50-billion loan, with the majority of the frozen assets located in Europe. Speaking at the G7 summit in June, President Volodymyr Zelensky called for a mechanism to fully confiscate the frozen Russian funds, highlighting their potential to bolster Ukraine&#x2019;s long-term recovery. According to October reports, the G7 plans to keep these Russian assets immobilized even after the war ends. Successful tests of a new Ukrainian missile, dubbed Ruta (Rue), are underway, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Dec. 10. Speaking at the Borys Paton National Prize presentation, Zelensky provided no additional details about the missile&#x2019;s characteristics. The president highlighted Ukraine&#x2019;s progress in missile and drone development, noting that the Palianytsia, a lightweight missile-drone hybrid, has entered mass production, while the Peklo (Hell) hybrid has already been successfully deployed in combat. Zelensky confirmed on Dec. 6 that the first batch of Peklo had been delivered to Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. In August, Zelensky announced that Ukraine had also tested its first home-grown ballistic missile. These advancements reflect the rapid growth of Ukraine&apos;s missile program since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion began in February 2022. While Ukraine continues to develop indigenous missile capabilities, Western partners have only recently approved the use of foreign-made missiles for strikes on Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. Some 70.3% of Ukrainians are in favor of their country&apos;s gradual accession into NATO in a model resembling the entry of West Germany, according to a survey by the Kyiv-based New Europe Center published on Dec. 10. A key difference is that the invitation would encompass the entire Ukraine, but the alliance&apos;s defensive &quot;umbrella&quot; would extend to the occupied territories only after their future liberation. Talks about a possible post-war security structure grew increasingly relevant as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump showed reluctance to maintain long-term support for Ukraine and pledged to push both sides to the negotiating table. As Russia holds the upper hand on the battlefield and the prospects of liberating occupied territories militarily appear slim in the near future, NATO accession pathways resembling that of West Germany begin to gain traction both in the West and Kyiv. West Germany entered the alliance in 1955, with the territories of East Germany joining only after the country&apos;s reunification in 1990. The growing difficulties are also reflected in the New Europe Center&apos;s survey. While the majority of Ukrainians remain distrustful of Russia and are averse to making concessions, the latter indicator has decreased in comparison to last year. At the same time, the Ukrainians are reluctant to enter talks with Russia without security guarantees, believing that a ceasefire would simply give Moscow a chance to recover and launch another war. According to the poll, 64.1% of Ukrainians do not believe that talks with Russia are worthwhile without appropriate security guarantees by the West. In comparison, 30% favor negotiations without preconditions, believing Ukraine does not have the resources to sustain a war of attrition. Some 31.3% of respondents consider the development of nuclear weapons &#x2014; a step rejected by Kyiv &#x2014; to be the most effective security guarantee. Only a slightly smaller number &#x2014; 29.3% &#x2014;see the accession to NATO as the most optimal course. Only 6.4% of Ukrainians have trust in the possible deployment of European peacekeepers in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 1 that if Ukraine were to join NATO, the alliance&apos;s Article 5 collective defense principle may not apply to Ukrainian territories facing active combat. This marked a notable shift in Ukraine&apos;s rhetoric, which previously insisted on fully restoring territorial integrity as a precondition for a successful peace settlement. More recent statements show a willingness to temporarily forego military liberation in the occupied territories for security guarantees, namely NATO membership. Zelensky said certain regions, like Crimea, might have to be liberated through diplomacy. Russian occupation authorities in the Donetsk Oblast city of Yenakiieve announced evacuations from some areas on Dec. 10 amid reports of explosions. Local Telegram channels shared footage that purports to show explosions in the town, with authors speculating about a possible missile attack. A blurred video published by the Tipichny Donetsk Telegram channel captures what seems to be multiple secondary explosions. Ukraine has not officially commented on the incident. Russian occupation authorities in the city did not clarify the reasons for the announced evacuation, claiming that the situation was &quot;under control.&quot; No further details on possible consequences have been provided at the time of the publication. Yenakiieve, a mining and metallurgy center and the birthplace of Ukraine&apos;s former pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, has been occupied by Russia since the start of its aggression in 2014. Ukrainian forces have repeatedly targeted Russian military facilities across the occupied territories after Russia unleashed its full-scale invasion in 2022. Analysts from the crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState Map reported on Dec. 10 that Russian forces had advanced in Sumy Oblast near the border village of Oleksandriya. DeepState is a mapping project, independent but with close ties to the Defense Ministry, widely trusted as one of the most reliable sources of accurate information on territorial changes along the front line. The map changes showed Russian forces occupying 2 square kilometers (0,8 square miles) in Sumy and advancing in the Kursk Oblast. These developments are reflected as of December 10. Sumy Oblast authorities, including head of the Military Administration Volodymyr Artyukh, rejected the notion that Russian forces had breached the border, calling the reports &quot;fake&quot; and describing them as disinformation. &quot;Now, there is no data from the military on the change of the situation on the border; the situation is controlled,&quot; Artyukh said. Sumy Oblast borders Russia&apos;s Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod oblasts. Residents of the vulnerable border communities experience multiple attacks per day. Peace negotiations to end the war in Ukraine could begin as early as this winter, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Dec. 10, Reuters reported. Speaking during a government meeting, Tusk announced that Poland, set to assume the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union on Jan. 1, intends to play an active role in the talks. &quot;As you can imagine, our delegation will share responsibility for shaping the political calendar and possibly the conditions surrounding the negotiations, which, while still uncertain, could begin this winter,&quot; Tusk said. French President Emmanuel Macron is set to visit Warsaw later this week to brief Tusk on his recent discussions with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Paris. The move towards negotiations comes as Donald Trump&apos;s inauguration approaches, after which he has claimed he will be able to quickly bring the fighting to a close. Tusk also confirmed that British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will visit Warsaw in early January, coinciding with Poland&#x2019;s EU Council presidency. &#x201C;I want Poland to set the tone for decisions that will secure peace and protect Polish interests,&#x201D; the president said. Meanwhile, Ukraine is preparing a coalition of its key allies, including the U.S. and European nations, to coordinate positions for both battlefield and diplomatic strategies. A meeting of these partners is planned for December, according to Ukrainian presidential spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-zelensky-announces-successful-tests-of-new-ukrainian-missile/	2024-12-10T12:11:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/yellen.jpeg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 4	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 4 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Dec. 2-Dec. 8, 2024. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Parliament rejects draft laws on establishing a new administrative court The Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, did not support and returned all three draft laws aimed at establishing a new court, the High Public Disputes Court (HPDC), which would handle administrative cases involving national state agencies. This decision stemmed from MPs and the Committee endorsing a model that completely eliminates the role of international experts in the selection process for HPDC judges. Discussions with the IMF regarding the requirements for this law are ongoing. However, only one week remains to meet the end-of-December deadline outlined in the Memorandum. Commission for selecting the Bureau of Economic Security director elects its chair According to our information, on Dec. 5, the commission tasked with selecting a new Director for the Economic Security Bureau of Ukraine held its first meeting. Laura Stefan, an international expert on the rule of law with the European Commission and the Council of Europe, was elected as the chair of the commission. Oleh Hylyaka, a commission member nominated by the Ukrainian government, was elected as the secretary. During its next meeting, the commission is expected to approve its working regulations. It is crucial that these regulations ensure a fully transparent and public process at every stage of the bureau&apos;s directors selection &#x2014; from the submission of applications to candidate discussions. The competition for the position will be announced once the commission&#x2019;s regulation is finalized. Verkhovna Rada reinstates property confiscation in plea agreements The Verkhovna Rada passed draft law #12243-1, amending the Criminal Code to reinstate the provision for property confiscation within plea agreements for individuals accused of major corruption offenses. This provision was inadvertently removed in a prior bill addressing the withdrawal of state rewards from traitors. The draft law has now been sent to the president for signing. Parliament supports increase in excise tax on tobacco goods The Verkhovna Rada has passed draft law #11090 in its final reading, supporting the gradual increase of excise taxes on tobacco products. The legislation proposes a 35.4% increase in the excise tax on cigarettes in 2025. The excise tax on tobacco products will continue to rise gradually to align with the minimum levels set by the European Union. Two bills required for Ukraine&#x2019;s OECD membership adopted on time Last week, the Verkhovna Rada approved, in its final reading, draft law #10319, which introduces tax measures to combat the bribery of foreign officials in international business transactions. Additionally, parliament passed bill #11443, imposing sanctions on businesses attempting to bribe foreign officials. Both laws were required to be adopted by the end of December to continue Ukraine&#x2019;s negotiations for OECD membership. Ukraine is set to submit its final report by Dec. 13 before applying. Parliament approves Naftogaz chief Chernyshov as deputy prime minister Last week, the Verkhovna Rada supported Naftogaz CEO Oleksii Chernyshov for the position of vice prime minister and minister for national unity. This new ministry appears to build on the former Ministry for the Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories, which the Cabinet of Ministers renamed the Ministry of National Unity of Ukraine following parliament&apos;s personnel decision.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-4/	2024-12-10T11:47:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2178721572.jpg
Russia reduces barge barriers protecting Crimean Bridge by half in a month	The number of barges Russia has deployed in the Kerch Strait to protect the illegal Crimean Bridge against Ukrainian maritime drones has halved in a month, the Center of Journalistic Investigations reported on Dec. 10. The barriers form part of a network of measures, both on land and sea, set up by Moscow to protect the bridge after multiple successful Ukrainian attacks. Satellite images from Nov. 8 showed 34 barges arranged in two rows near the shipping channel in the Kerch Strait, installed between July 27 and Aug. 8. Recent Sentinel-2 satellite images from Dec. 8 reveal only 18 barges remaining between Tuzla Island and the Kerch Peninsula. The fate of the other 16 vessels is unclear. On Sept. 30, it was reported that barriers intended to protect the bridge from attacks were washed ashore after a storm, with plastic and metal barrels connected by frames scattered on Kerch beaches. The 19-kilometer-long Crimean Bridge, constructed following Russia&#x2019;s illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014 and completed in 2018, serves as a vital supply route for Russian forces. The bridge has been targeted by Ukraine multiple times, suffering heavy damage in strikes in October 2022 and July 2023. The Crimean bridge remains a focal point of the conflict and is also the subject of a legal dispute between Ukraine and Russia at the Permanent Court of Arbitration.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-reduces-barge-barriers-protecting-crimean-bridge-by-half-in-a-month/	2024-12-10T11:33:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1243954958.jpg
US announces $20 billion loan for Ukraine as part of G7 initiative	The U.S. Treasury Department announced on Dec. 10 that it will provide $20 billion in loan assistance to Ukraine, marking its contribution to a broader $50 billion initiative supported by G7 countries.

Russia could swap North Korean soldiers for Su-27s and MiG-29s, US officer says	Russia may have transferred MiG-29 and Su-27 fighter jets to North Korea in exchange for North Korean soldiers, Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, said on Dec. 8, according to Aviation Week Network. Paparo also noted that North Korea likely seeks additional military capabilities from Russia, including ballistic missile technology, reentry vehicles, submarine technology, and air defense systems. Aviation Week highlighted that the transfer of MiG-29s and Su-27s would significantly upgrade North Korea&#x2019;s air force, which currently relies on aging Soviet-era aircraft. Defense Express says North Korea possesses 18 MiG-29s, 34 Su-25s, and a variety of older MiG models, many of which may be non-operational. According to the publication, the extent of Russia&#x2019;s aircraft transfers will depend on its current inventory, which reportedly included 185 MiG-29 and Su-27 as of early 2024. North Korea&#x2019;s strengthening military ties with Russia have drawn international scrutiny. During a Nov. 30 meeting with a Russian defense delegation, Kim Jong Un reaffirmed North Korea&#x2019;s &quot;invariable support&quot; for Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine. This cooperation has also included the deployment of North Korean soldiers. The Ukrainian National Resistance Center reported that North Korean troops, numbering between 10,000 and 12,000, have been stationed at observation posts and checkpoints in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-could-swap-north-korean-soldiers-for-su-27s-and-mig-29s-us-admiral-says/	2024-12-10T08:45:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157652819.jpg
As China weaponizes the drone supply chain, Ukraine builds more parts at home	Some 25 miles south of the Russian border, explosions rumble off in the distance more or less continuously. &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t even hear them anymore,&#x201D; Zhenya chuckles from under first-person-view (FPV) goggles branded with the U.S. company &#x201C;Fat Shark.&#x201D; Zhenya and his co-developer for DragoDrones, or DCU, Maksym, are testing a stack of small FPV drones in a field in Kharkiv Oblast. They asked not to be identified by last name, due to the proximity of their workshops to Russian air power. Most of the drones they made themselves. One is of ambiguous Chinese provenance &#x2014; unmarked, maker unknown, and most importantly, not working. Zhenya launches the drone into a couple of neat somersaults before sending it off into the distance. Around three kilometers away, Maksym gestures to a screen. The video is clipping out.

(Kollen Post / The Kyiv Independent).It&#x2019;s the bug that a brigade holding thousands of these drones has asked them to fix, explains Maksym: A faulty video transmitter, a cheap under-tested gadget that they&apos;re now replacing. It&#x2019;s a persistent problem with the drone supply to Ukrainian troops: Imported Chinese drones are often laden with defective parts. And while they have typically been cheap enough to merit replacing, China is actively cutting off its exports of components and materials critical to drone building. In the face of these threats, Ukraine&#x2019;s drone industry is increasingly onshoring the production of more ambitious components. And they&#x2019;re getting better than anyone expected at building even the trickier gadgets needed to keep Ukraine&#x2019;s army of drones in flight. &quot;We cannot rely on a Chinese supply chain,&quot; says Denys Nikolayenko, who makes high-end thermal cameras for drones, from an office in Kyiv. The first drones to see mass use in Ukraine following Russia&#x2019;s invasion in February 2022 were cheap, off-the-shelf Chinese imports. As the country realized the importance of these new weapons, Ukraine began building out its local drone manufacturing in the early months of the war. Thanks to heavy investment in the industry, a major proportion of drones on the front today are Ukrainian-made. The components of those drones are a different matter. China&#x2019;s chokehold on the supply chain has been a source of persistent alarm. Nataliia Kushnerska, head of Ukrainian defense tech hub Brave1, identified the &#x201C;particular dependence on China&#x201D; as one of the three biggest problems in Ukraine&#x2019;s drone industry, speaking to Forbes Ukraine last November. China made headlines in Ukraine for restricting drone components at the outset of September. Recent reports show China has already begun curbing sales to American and European drone makers and is readying more sanctions. Zelensky addressed the nation referring to the Chinese controls announced in September, alluding to Ukraine&#x2019;s new self-reliance: &quot;Some of the largest state exporters of drone components are instituting export controls. We know what to do so that these controls don&apos;t become a critical threat to us.&quot; China sanctioned U.S. drone company Skydio in late October, barring Chinese manufacturers from selling to the firm. Skydio&#x2019;s dependence on Chinese components, particularly motors, has led to backups at the firm. It has also exposed China&#x2019;s readiness to weaponize its dominance in unmanned weapons. &#x201C;This is a clarifying moment for the drone industry,&#x201D; Skydio CEO Adam Bry wrote to customers. &#x201C;If there was ever any doubt, this action makes clear that the Chinese government will use supply chains as a weapon to advance their interests over ours.&#x201D; Ukraine&#x2019;s manufacturers have gotten remarkably adept at replicating Chinese drone functionality at home, both out of concern for cost and concerns about China&#x2019;s loyalties to Russia. Herman Smetanin, minister of Strategic Industries, announced early in November that Ukraine had developed a &#x201C;Shmavic,&#x201D; a local copy of the DJI Mavics that were the first drones to see wide use following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. But the focus on the more minute elements within the supply chain for drone production is a newer phenomenon.

(Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu via Getty Images)Soldiers of the Armed Forces inspect FPV drones during the handover from the volunteer organization in Lviv, Ukraine, on Sep. 13, 2024. (Stanislav Ivanov/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Producers like Zhenya and Maksym are increasingly equipping their own drones with parts made at home. Beyond their own frames routed out of Kharkiv-sourced foam plastic and 3D-printed fasteners, they recently got a Ukrainian computer numerical control machine &#x2014; essential for precise tooling &#x2014; and have begun buying motors from a new Ukrainian supplier. The pair&apos;s drones run between $300 and $600, making them cheaper than off-the-shelf FPVs or Mavics with which they compete on function. Maksym and Zhenya have a lot more at stake in keeping those explosions from coming any closer than DJI or Autel do. Beyond drone-specific components, China is also tightening controls on key raw materials, especially rare-earth metals key to certain higher-end gadgets on a drone. &quot;Before 2023 you could just buy germanium from China without any export controls or whatever procedures on Alibaba, two weeks later you got your germanium bricks here in Kyiv,&quot; reminisces Nikolayenko. &quot;But in 2023 they started to control it.&quot; NIkolayenko&#x2019;s company, Oko Camera, needs germanium to make thermal lenses for drones. Despite being the Ukrainian word for &#x201C;eye,&#x201D; Oko is cautious about being overly visible as a company. Russian airstrikes remain a threat to local manufacturers, even those based in the Kyiv region. Oko lenses are maybe most famous for being the visual guidance of Ukraine&apos;s famous &quot;Baba Yaga&quot; drones, so dubbed by Russian soldiers after a mythical witch due to their ability to strike on the gloomiest of nights. Displaying a trio of their lenses on a desk. Nikolayenko and his business manager, Nazariy Nikolaychuk, note that they&#x2019;ve built many of their own machining tools, and specifically worked out an independent calibration process. &#x201C;The benefit is that actually you ensure the quality of the image of each camera that you produce, and this is not the case for some Chinese cameras. This makes us different,&#x201D; says Nikolayenko. The images are undoubtedly crisp, showing the twigs on trees and soldiers behind them, and even the thermal differential between hair and skin. Long-term, Ukrainian drone makers are keen to sell to Western buyers, particularly after a ceasefire allows them to export. With increasing volleys of sanctions, many are betting that NATO will increasingly see Chinese parts, particularly the higher-tech ones, as a disqualifying feature for would-be suppliers. Nonetheless, there remain enduring concerns that many &#x201C;Ukrainian-made&#x201D; drones are Chinese imports barely modified and sent out to the front. &#x201C;They say the government bought a bunch of drones. The fact is, they bought them from China and stuck on some stickers of their own. And then they don&#x2019;t work,&#x201D; says Maksym. And while local producers are trying their hands at new links in the supply chain, the most and least complicated elements still depend heavily on imports. For Oko, the sensors remain strictly European. Though Nikolayenko says they&#x2019;ve built some of their own machining tools, most manufacturers of everything within Ukraine remain dependent on imported machining tools &#x2014; traditionally Chinese, but increasingly Indian and, for those who can afford it, European. But for the cheapest components, simple base-line products like transistors, circuit boards, wiring, or solar cells, nobody can yet step up to the scale of China&#x2019;s mass production. While DragoDrones 3D-prints some of the components, and are prototyping more, the problem is not cost so much as speed. They lament that despite their clever workarounds, localized mass production within Ukraine was a pre-war casualty of bad policy. &#x201C;Production capacity is much bigger in Russia, plus China. In Ukraine, over the last fifteen years, they closed down the production of all the little electronics &#x2014; at the hands of both our government and the Russians doing the financing,&#x201D; says Zhenya. &#x201C;(The Russians) copy what we make, for the most part,&#x201D; says Maksym. &#x201C;We were the ones who started using drones because we had nothing else.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/as-china-weaponizes-the-drone-supply-chain-ukraine-is-building-more-parts-at-home/	2024-12-10T08:29:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1258705267.jpg
Ukraine peace talks could start this winter, Tusk says	Peace negotiations to end the war in Ukraine could begin as early as this winter, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Dec. 10, Reuters reported. Speaking during a government meeting, Tusk announced that Poland, set to assume the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union on Jan. 1, intends to play an active role in the talks. &quot;As you can imagine, our delegation will share responsibility for shaping the political calendar and possibly the conditions surrounding the negotiations, which, while still uncertain, could begin this winter,&quot; Tusk said. French President Emmanuel Macron is set to visit Warsaw later this week to brief Tusk on his recent discussions with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Paris. The move towards negotiations comes as Donald Trump&apos;s inauguration approaches, after which he has claimed he will be able to quickly bring the fighting to a close. Tusk also confirmed that British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will visit Warsaw in early January, coinciding with Poland&#x2019;s EU Council presidency. &#x201C;I want Poland to set the tone for decisions that will secure peace and protect Polish interests,&#x201D; the president said. Meanwhile, Ukraine is preparing a coalition of its key allies, including the U.S. and European nations, to coordinate positions for both battlefield and diplomatic strategies. A meeting of these partners is planned for December, according to Ukrainian presidential spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-pm-signals-potential-ukraine-peace-talks-this-winter/	2024-12-10T08:20:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2167276071.jpg
Russian troops evacuate from Syria amid base siege, military intelligence says	Russia is evacuating its forces from Syria as one of its military bases comes under siege, Kyiv&#x2019;s military intelligence agency (HUR) reported on Dec. 10. According to HUR, Russian troops in Syria are expressing frustration with their commanders over the disorganized withdrawal. Military transport aircraft, including An-124 and Il-76 planes, continue to transport personnel and equipment to Russian airfields in Ulyanovsk, Chkalovsky, and Privolzhsky. Russian Navy vessels also participated in the evacuation. The bulk carrier Sparta II and the amphibious assault ship Alexander Shabalin are en route to the port of Tartus, according to HUR. Additional ships, including the frigates Admiral Gorshkov and Admiral Golovko, are supporting the operation from the Mediterranean Sea. Emergency dismantling of military equipment is ongoing in Tartus, where hundreds of Russian special forces have been deployed to secure the retreat. The collapse of the Assad regime follows a rapid rebel offensive in late November, dismantling Russian-backed forces and isolating Russian troops stationed in Syria. Russia had maintained significant military infrastructure in the country, including the Khmeimim airbase and the Tartus naval base. The rebellion marks a major shift in the region, undermining Russia&apos;s influence and complicating its foreign policy amid its ongoing war in Ukraine. Moscow began withdrawing its forces from Syria on Dec. 8, according to Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-evacuate-syria-amid-base-siege-hur-says/	2024-12-10T07:45:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/syria.jpg
Taurus delivery to Ukraine should be coordinated with US, European partners, German opposition leader says	German Chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz would closely coordinate the delivery of Taurus missiles to Ukraine with the U.S. and European partners, he said in an interview with Bild on Dec. 9. According to Merz, training the Ukrainian personnel for these missiles would take at least four months and would not be completed before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office. &quot;And that is why I advocate answering these questions together with the Americans. Not alone, not in Germany, but together with Europe and America,&quot; Merz told Bild during his visit to Kyiv. Trump&apos;s return to the White House is causing concern among Kyiv&apos;s partners in Europe as the president-elect signaled a decrease in military support for Ukraine. Merz, whose conservative CDU/CSU alliance is leading in the polls ahead of the February elections, arrived in Ukraine&apos;s capital for talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky, promising a more decisive strategy on long-range strikes against Russia. &quot;We want your army to be capable of hitting military bases in Russia. Not the civilian population, not infrastructure, but the military targets from which your country is being attacked,&quot; Merz said. Merz previously voiced support for providing Ukraine with the Taurus missiles, a step Chancellor Olaf Scholz refused to take, fearing it would draw Germany into war. Talking to Bild, Merz nevertheless said that the Swedish-German cruise missiles with a range of 500 kilometers (310 miles) would not be a &quot;miraculous&quot; game-changer in the war. The politician also stressed he agrees with Scholz that Germany must not become a party at war, but he pointed out that neither the U.K. nor the U.S. became belligerents when lifting restrictions on the weapons they provided. Ukraine fields U.S. ATACMS and the SCALP/Storm Shadow missiles from France and the U.K., with Washington and London only recently permitting strikes within Russian territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-opposition-leader-merz/	2024-12-10T06:50:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/e99dfedf4f71ca1b5c178d4d5f33105c_1733742724_extra_large.jpeg
Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia kills 3, injures 11, destroys clinic	Russian forces struck the city of Zaporizhzhia on Dec. 10, killing three people and injuring 11, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. An air raid alert was declared in the region at 2:00 p.m., with explosions reported minutes later. Fedorov had warned earlier of the threat of ballistic missile attacks on Zaporizhzhia Oblast and other regions under air alert. The strike destroyed a private clinic and damaged nearby buildings. &quot;Rescuers are searching for people trapped under the rubble,&quot; Fedorov wrote. Zaporizhzhia, home to around 710,000 residents before Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, remains a frequent target of Russian attacks. In a separate attack, a Russian missile strike hit the town of Zlatopil in Kharkiv Oblast on Dec. 10, injuring at least 11 people, regional officials reported. The strike damaged non-residential buildings and vehicles near a bank at around 10:20 a.m. local time. A second attack followed shortly after, according to oblast governor Oleh Syniehubov.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-zaporizhzhia-kills-3-injures-5-destroying-hospital/	2024-12-10T06:37:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-10_15-10-40.jpg
Politico lists Yermak, Putin among Europe's most influential people	Politico presented on Dec. 10 its end-of-the-year list of the most influential people in Europe, with President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s chief of staff Andriy Yermak and Russian President Vladimir Putin among the finalists for the &quot;dreamers&quot; and &quot;doers&quot; categories, respectively. Politico partially unveiled its list of 28 people expected to be the most influential in the year ahead. The individuals were divided into three categories: the doers are &quot;those most adept at imposing their will,&quot; the dreamers, &quot;whose bold ideas are driving the conversation,&quot; and disruptors,&quot; or &quot;those shaking up the status quo.&quot; &quot;Nearly three years into Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, Andriy Yermak&#x2019;s focus has moved from trying to win the war to trying to win the peace,&quot; Politico introduced Yermak. The former television producer became Zelensky&#x2019;s chief of staff in 2020, becoming an indispensable gatekeeper for the Ukrainian president, dubbed &quot;The Fixer&quot; by Politico. Yermak has been described as the most powerful chief of staff in Ukraine&apos;s history, attracting criticism for accumulating unprecedented power and influence within the Presidential Office. Another candidate on the list was Russian President Vladimir Putin, dubbed &quot;The Imperialist.&quot; &quot;By patiently playing the long game, Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to be achieving his goal of fracturing the West and conquering parts of Ukraine,&quot; Politico introduced the Russian leader. Despite high inflation, a tumbling ruble, and hundreds of thousands of &quot;compatriots sent to their deaths,&quot; Putin&#x2019;s grip on power seems secure, Politico wrote. A notable change, highlighted by Politico, is the representation of Eastern Europe on the list. Four Poles are on the list, &quot;underscoring Warsaw&#x2019;s growing relevance,&quot; as well as ultranationalist and right-wing figures such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban or France&#x2019;s Marine Le Pen.	https://kyivindependent.com/politico-lists-yermak-putin-among-europes-most-influential-people/	2024-12-10T06:06:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168960421.jpg
Russia detains Russian-German citizen over alleged sabotage plot	Russia&#x2019;s security services detained a Russian-German citizen for preparing to sabotage railways, the Russian news agency Interfax reported on Dec. 10. The detainee was born in 2003 and was found to possess a ready-to-use homemade explosive device, as well as &quot;communication equipment&quot; containing correspondence with a representative of the Ukrainian intelligence services, Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB) alleged. The FSB accused the man of preparing the sabotage in November &quot;for a monetary reward&quot; promised by his handler. He now faces sabotage charges. According to Russian authorities, the detainee was part of a group that followed &quot;radical neo-Nazi ideology&quot; and resided in Nizhny Novgorod. Russian authorities often falsely accuse their domestic and external rivals of &quot;neo-Nazi&quot; tendencies, including the Ukrainian government and military. The Kyiv Independent could not verify Russian security services claims. Germany&apos;s Foreign Ministry told Deutsche Welle that it is aware of the situation and seeks to obtain consular access to the detainee. Russian authorities view individuals with dual citizenship exclusively as Russian citizens, refusing to grant consular access to foreign missions. The arrest comes weeks after the detainment of German citizen Nikolai Gaiduk, who was accused of planning terrorist attacks on energy infrastructure in the Kaliningrad region by the Russian services. The Kaliningrad region is Russia&apos;s heavily-armed exclave at the Baltic Sea coast, lodged between NATO members Poland and Lithuania. The FSB claims Gaiduk was detained after entering the Kaliningrad region from Poland, allegedly to conduct further sabotage. A search of his vehicle reportedly uncovered 0.5 liters of liquid explosive material.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-detains-russian-german-citizen-over-alleged-sabotage-plot/	2024-12-10T05:07:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1249615636.jpg
Explosions heard in occupied Donetsk Oblast city, Russian proxies announce evacuation	Russian occupation authorities in the Donetsk Oblast city of Yenakiieve announced evacuations from some areas on Dec. 10 amid reports of explosions. Local Telegram channels shared footage that purports to show explosions in the town, with authors speculating about a possible missile attack. A blurred video published by the Tipichny Donetsk Telegram channel captures what seems to be multiple secondary explosions. Ukraine has not officially commented on the incident. Russian occupation authorities in the city did not clarify the reasons for the announced evacuation, claiming that the situation was &quot;under control.&quot; No further details on possible consequences have been provided at the time of the publication. Yenakiieve, a mining and metallurgy center and the birthplace of Ukraine&apos;s former pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, has been occupied by Russia since the start of its aggression in 2014. Ukrainian forces have repeatedly targeted Russian military facilities across the occupied territories after Russia unleashed its full-scale invasion in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/explosions-heard-in-occupied-donetsk-oblast-city/	2024-12-10T04:43:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/-----_-_-----_--_-------_--------.jpg
44% of Ukrainians trust Trump, more than elsewhere in Europe, survey suggests	Some 44.6% of Ukrainians trust U.S. &#xA0;President-elect Donald Trump, around 10 points less than incumbent President Joe Biden, a survey by New Europe Center published on Dec. 10 showed. In comparison, researchers cite a separate summer poll from the Pew Research Center that showed that among the surveyed countries, Trump enjoyed the highest trust in Hungary: 37%. In France, Trump was trusted by 16% of the population, and in the U.K., 30%. According to the researchers, the relatively high trust in Trump can be explained by hopes for a &quot;clearer and more decisive policy towards Ukraine from the new U.S. administration &quot; and possibly a desire for peace in certain parts of the population. &quot;Trump&#x2019;s high level of trust could also be due to disappointment in the current U.S. president, who recorded a significant drop in the indicator,&quot; the authors said. This is despite Trump&apos;s past criticism of the military support that Biden provided to Ukraine and his intent to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war. The president-elect pledged to bring both sides to the negotiating table, which some fear may entail forcing Kyiv toward painful concessions. The Biden administration donated more than $60 billion worth of military equipment to Ukraine during the full-scale war. At the same time, the incumbent president&apos;s policy has been criticized as overly cautious and self-restricting. The survey showed that while Biden was the most trusted Western leader in 2023, at 82%, this figure dropped to 55.2% this year. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also went from 61.4% to 36.9% since 2023. The U.S. and Germany are Ukraine&apos;s leading military donors. As Trump&apos;s presidency approaches, the outgoing Biden administration seeks to ship as much aid to Ukraine as possible, announcing a military aid package worth almost $1 billion on Dec. 7. Trump is expected to reduce that aid as he takes office in January 2025 to force Ukraine to the negotiating table and cede territory for peace. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Polish President Andrzej Duda remain relatively trusted; both enjoy the confidence of 65% of Ukrainians. French President Emmanuel Macron, who has adopted more hawkish rhetoric toward Russia, saw a modest growth of trust as the only Western leader: from 54.5% to 58.4%.	https://kyivindependent.com/44-of-ukrainians-trust-trump-survey/	2024-12-10T03:59:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185636867.jpg
Chinese exports to Russia decrease for first time in 4 months, Reuters reports	China&apos;s yuan-denominated exports to Russia dropped sharply in November when compared to the 24% growth the previous month, Reuters reported on Dec. 10, citing Chinese customs data. The decrease of 10.5% compared to November 2023 marks the first drop since July, Reuters writes, underscoring the growing challenges in the China-Russia economic relations. Imports from Russia in yuan also fell by 7.4%, according to the news agency. The trade between the two countries is mired by payment difficulties as the West tightens the screws on sanctions against Russia, imposed in response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. unveiled sanctions against over 50 Russian financial institutions in late November, including Gazprombank, until then Russia&apos;s largest non-sanctioned bank. Chinese companies have also come under increasing scrutiny over their role in helping Russia avoid the imposed restrictions. Western officials have emphasized Beijing&apos;s vital role in sustaining Russia&apos;s economy and defense industry amid the war. While the trade between China and Russia surged after the outbreak of the full-scale war, the past year saw a mounting number of cases of Chinese institutions shutting down transactions with Russia over concerns of secondary sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/china-russia-exports/	2024-12-10T03:30:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2160158492.jpg
Russian losses in Syria — BBC identifies 543 soldiers, Wagner mercenaries who died since 2015	At least 543 Russian military personnel and mercenaries died during their deployment in Syria between 2015-2024, the BBC reported on Dec. 9, citing its open-source investigation. Of the total number, 346 were employees of the Wagner company, a private mercenary group that also saw deployment in Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine and elsewhere. The news comes shortly after the ousting of Moscow&apos;s ally, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, in a lightning rebel offensive that culminated in the capture of Damascus on Dec. 8. As not every service member&#x2019;s death can be confirmed by open-source intelligence, the real number of casualties may be higher, the BBC noted. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry only acknowledged 116 dead among its service members in Syria in a statement in 2019. The BBC established its list using publications in the media, social networks, and data from cemeteries and war memorials. According to the BBC&#x2019;s reporting, Russia has lost, among others, members of the Special Operations Forces, Federal Security Service (FSB) officers, military intelligence (GRU) officers, and military pilots. Andrii Kovalenko, an official at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, said that Syria hosted between 6,000-7,500 Russian soldiers and mercenaries as of the summer of 2024. Assad regime&apos;s began unraveling in late November, when a rapid rebel offensive dismantled the Russian-backed dictator&#x2019;s hold on power within two weeks, leaving Russian troops stranded in bases in Syria. Russia, a long-standing supporter of Assad, maintained substantial military infrastructure in the Middle Eastern country, including the Tartus naval base and the Khmeimim airbase. The rebellion&#x2019;s rapid advance marks a pivotal shift in Russia&#x2019;s regional influence. Moscow reportedly began withdrawing its military presence from Syria, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency said on Dec. 8. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump remarked earlier the same day that Assad&apos;s fall highlights Russia&#x2019;s strained foreign policy, as it struggles to manage its involvement in Syria while remaining committed to the ongoing war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-losses-in-syria-bbc/	2024-12-10T02:38:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1177954841.jpg
70% of Ukrainians support 'West German' model for NATO accession, survey shows	Some 70.3% of Ukrainians are in favor of their country&apos;s gradual accession into NATO in a model resembling the entry of West Germany, according to a survey by the Kyiv-based New Europe Center published on Dec. 10. A key difference is that the invitation would encompass the entire Ukraine, but the alliance&apos;s defensive &quot;umbrella&quot; would extend to the occupied territories only after their future liberation. Talks about a possible post-war security structure grew increasingly relevant as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump showed reluctance to maintain long-term support for Ukraine and pledged to push both sides to the negotiating table. As Russia holds the upper hand on the battlefield and the prospects of liberating occupied territories militarily appear slim in the near future, NATO accession pathways resembling that of West Germany begin to gain traction both in the West and Kyiv. West Germany entered the alliance in 1955, with the territories of East Germany joining only after the country&apos;s reunification in 1990. The growing difficulties are also reflected in the New Europe Center&apos;s survey. While the majority of Ukrainians remain distrustful of Russia and are averse to making concessions, the latter indicator has decreased in comparison to last year. At the same time, the Ukrainians are reluctant to enter talks with Russia without security guarantees, believing that a ceasefire would simply give Moscow a chance to recover and launch another war. According to the poll, 64.1% of Ukrainians do not believe that talks with Russia are worthwhile without appropriate security guarantees by the West. In comparison, 30% favor negotiations without preconditions, believing Ukraine does not have the resources to sustain a war of attrition. Some 31.3% of respondents consider the development of nuclear weapons &#x2014; a step rejected by Kyiv &#x2014; to be the most effective security guarantee. Only a slightly smaller number &#x2014; 29.3% &#x2014;see the accession to NATO as the most optimal course. Only 6.4% of Ukrainians have trust in the possible deployment of European peacekeepers in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 1 that if Ukraine were to join NATO, the alliance&apos;s Article 5 collective defense principle may not apply to Ukrainian territories facing active combat. This marked a notable shift in Ukraine&apos;s rhetoric, which previously insisted on fully restoring territorial integrity as a precondition for a successful peace settlement. More recent statements show a willingness to temporarily forego military liberation in the occupied territories for security guarantees, namely NATO membership. Zelensky said certain regions, like Crimea, might have to be liberated through diplomacy.	https://kyivindependent.com/west-germany-survey/	2024-12-10T02:12:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2161623541.jpg
Russian troops sabotage their boats to avoid Dnipro River crossing, Ukrainian partisans claim	Russian soldiers increasingly sabotage their own boats and equipment to avoid having to storm the Dnipro River islands on the southern front, Ukrainian resistance group Atesh claimed on Dec. 10. &quot;There are increasing cases of sabotage among Russian soldiers to avoid being sent to storm the islands in the Dnipro delta,&quot; Atesh said on their Telegram channel. Atesh did not provide evidence and the Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. The statement comes as Russian forces have reportedly amassed some 300 boats aiming to cross the Dnipro and take strategically important islands on the river. The Dnipro delta lies at the river&apos;s mouth in Kherson Oblast, with the water body diving the region between Ukraine-held territories in the northwest and the Russian-occupied areas in the southeast. From their positions on the east bank, Russian forces have been shelling the city of Kherson and the surrounding villages, killing civilians in attacks that continue to this day. &quot;Soldiers deliberately break engines, puncture rubber boats, and even transmit coordinates to the Ukrainian Defense Forces about the location of boat bases and fuel supplies,&quot; the group claimed. An expert told the Kyiv Independent earlier that Russia is sending small units to storm the Dnipro islands and force Ukrainian defenders to use more shells, straining Ukraine&apos;s resources.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-sabotage-their-boats-to-avoid-dnipro-crossing-ukrainian-partisans-claim/	2024-12-10T01:12:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1767735905.jpg
Russian attacks against Donetsk, Kherson oblasts kill 3, injure 14 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least three civilians and injured at least 14 over the past day, regional authorities reported on the morning of Dec. 10. Russian strikes against Donetsk Oblast killed two people and injured seven, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. One death and two injuries were reported after attacks against the town of Mykolaivka, and the same casualty figures were recorded in the village of Stara Mykolaivka. Two people were injured in the town of Kostiantynivka and one in Novoekonomichne, the governor said. In Kherson Oblast, one person was killed and seven injured in Russian attacks, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Sumy, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts were also attacked, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-110/	2024-12-10T00:53:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-10_09-31-51.jpg
Russian attack against Kharkiv Oblast town injures 8	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. A Russian missile attack against the town of Zlatopil in Kharkiv Oblast on Dec. 10 injured at least eight people, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. A hit was recorded near a bank, damaging non-residential buildings and cars, the governor said at around 10:20 a.m. local time. Less than 10 minutes later, Syniehubov reported further attacks. The full extent of damage and casualties is being determined. Zlatopil, with a pre-war population of 28,500, lies around 60 kilometers (roughly 35 miles) south of the regional center, Kharkiv. Lying near the Russian border and occupied territories in the northeast, Kharkiv Oblast is a regular target of Russian attacks, resulting in civilian casualties and damage.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-against-kharkiv-oblast-town/	2024-12-10T00:22:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1513217350.jpg
China curbs sale of drone parts to US, Europe, hindering Ukraine’s war effort, Bloomberg reports	Chinese manufacturers began limiting their sales of vital drone components to their U.S. and European customers, preluding a broader ban on exports by officials, Bloomberg wrote on Dec. 9, citing undisclosed sources. Drones play a pivotal role in the battlefield during Ukraine&#x2019;s defense against Russia&#x2019;s war, from providing reconnaissance to dropping explosives on their targets. Both sides ratcheted up their production, with Russia producing 140,000 drones in 2023 and aiming to craft 1.4 million by the end of 2024, mainly using Chinese parts. Ukraine plans to produce 30,000 long-range drones in 2025, reportedly boasting the capacity to build 3 million drones of various types in a year. Ukraine might have to China-proof its supply chain for drones as experts expect more widespread Chinese bans on certain drone parts in 2025. China&#x2019;s step came as a response to the U.S. ban on selling high-bandwidth memory chips and additional semiconductor gear to China. With U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s &quot;tough-on-China&quot; policy not likely to ease tensions, other manufacturers from Japan and Korea might take the place of the Chinese ones, Bloomberg wrote. While claiming neutrality, Beijing plays a pivotal role in Russia&apos;s war effort, supplying various dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry. A media report from November said that the EU had obtained evidence of China&apos;s lethal support for Moscow in the form of attack drones. The Chinese leadership claimed it had not provided military support to either side.	https://kyivindependent.com/china-curbs-sale-of-drone-parts-to-us-europe/	2024-12-09T23:37:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2152609074.jpg
Hungary's PM Orban meets with Trump, Musk, says 'future has begun'	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban met with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and his ally, businessman Elon Musk, in Florida on Dec. 9, according to a post on X. &quot;The future has begun &#x2014; an afternoon in Mar-a-Lago,&quot; the prime minister wrote alongside pictures showing him in discussion with Trump and Musk. Trump&apos;s incoming national security adviser, Mike Waltz, is also tagged in the X post but does not appear in photos. Hungary&apos;s prime minister was the first to endorse Trump&#x2019;s first presidential candidacy in 2016 and repeatedly expressed a desire for his return after the U.S. businessman-turned-politician lost the 2020 election, claiming to &quot;open a bottle of champagne&quot; if Trump wins this year&apos;s vote. Trump is expected to bring a different approach to the Russia-Ukraine war after he takes office in January 2025. He promised to end the war in 24 hours during his campaign and hinted at reducing U.S. aid to Ukraine to force it to the negotiating table. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban (L) meets businessman and Donald Trump&apos;s ally Elon Musk at Trump&apos;s residence in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, U.S., on Dec. 9, 2024. (Viktor Orban/X)Orban held several meetings with Trump earlier this year, claiming that the U.S. president-elect would cut support to Ukraine and force its leadership to peace talks. The role that Orban may play in Trump&apos;s strategy remains unclear. The Hungarian prime minister has maintained warm ties with Moscow throughout the full-scale war, refused to send military aid to Ukraine, and vocally criticized EU sanctions against Russia, approving joint sanctions packages only after long obstructions. Orban traveled to Moscow to visit Russian President Vladimir Putin after taking the helm of the EU&#x2019;s presidency in July on a so-called &quot;peace mission,&quot; breaking Putin&apos;s Western-imposed isolation. That mission also saw him visit Kyiv for the first time and Beijing, ending his global tour with a meeting with Trump in Florida. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported that, according to undisclosed sources, Trump held multiple phone conversations with Orban since the former&apos;s reelection on Nov. 5, discussing strategies to end the Russia-Ukraine war.	https://kyivindependent.com/orban-meets-with-trump-musk/	2024-12-09T23:15:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GeY6gQGXYAAIYF2.jpg
Zelensky tells Trump 'Putin fears only him and, perhaps, China'	President Volodymyr Zelensky told Donald Trump that Russian leader Vladimir Putin &quot;fears&quot; the U.S. president-elect, Zelensky revealed on Dec. 9. &quot;I told President Trump that Putin fears only him and, perhaps, China,&quot; Zelensky said on X. Ukraine&apos;s head of state held a trilateral meeting with Trump and French Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Dec. 7, discussing Russia&apos;s ongoing full-scale invasion. &quot;And that&#x2019;s the truth &#x2014; only decisiveness can bring this war to a just end and ensure lasting peace.&quot; Trump&apos;s imminent return to the White House in January raises concerns about the U.S. withdrawing its support under the new administration and pressuring Ukraine toward painful concessions. To prevent such a development, Kyiv seeks to engage Trump and convince him to adopt a &quot;peace through strength&quot; approach, forcing the Kremlin to accept &quot;a just and lasting&quot; peace. &quot;We know that America has the capacity to accomplish remarkable things&#x2014;things that others have not been able to achieve,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;To succeed in ending this war, we need unity &#x2014; the unity of America, Europe, and everyone in the world who values security &#x2014; as well as strong positions and guarantees for peace.&quot; Following his meeting with Zelensky, Trump said the Ukrainian leader is ready &quot;to make a deal and stop the madness.&quot; &quot;Too many lives are being so needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed, and if it keeps going, it can turn into something much bigger, and far worse,&quot; Trump wrote on Social Truth on Dec. 8. Separately, he said Ukraine could expect reduced assistance from the U.S. under his leadership. Zelensky addressed Trump&apos;s post on his Telegram channel on Dec. 8, saying the war &quot;cannot be ended simply with a piece of paper and a few signatures,&quot; warning that &quot;a ceasefire without guarantees can be reignited at any moment, as Putin has already done in the past.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-tells-trump-putin-fears-only-him-and-perhaps-china/	2024-12-09T22:41:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188753941.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 755,940 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 755,940 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 10. This number includes 1,350 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,524 tanks, 19,596 armored fighting vehicles, 31,037 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,064 artillery systems, 1,253 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,023 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 20,107 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-755-940-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-12-09T22:16:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1253226504.jpg
UK sanctions illicit gold trade, says it funds Russia's war	The United Kingdom on Dec. 9 announced new sanctions targeting the illicit gold trade, which it said helps finance Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;Russia uses the illicit gold trade to launder money and evade sanctions, in doing so bolstering (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&apos;s war efforts,&quot; the U.K. government said in a press release. The latest round of sanctions imposes asset freezes on five individuals involved in the illicit gold trade. One of the individuals, Anto Joseph, is the CEO and manager of Paloma Precious, which has purchased more than $300 million of Russian gold. These are indirectly supplying Russia with funds for its war against Ukraine, the press release said. The U.K. in November 2023 imposed sanctions against Paloma Precious and other entities involved in Russia&apos;s gold sector. Gold brought $15.5 billion to the Russian economy in 2021, making it one of the country&apos;s most valuable commodities after energy exports, the British government reported in 2023. Russia has also reportedly laundered billions of dollars in African gold since 2022, according to international analysts. Russia is one of the world&apos;s major gold producers. Russia&apos;s gold reserves have likely facilitated sanctions evasion, allowing Moscow to purchase goods it cannot obtain conventionally.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-sanctions-illicit-gold-trade-says-it-funds-russias-war/	2024-12-09T20:57:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1692422064.jpg
Ukraine approves Droid TW robotics system for combat operation	The Defense Ministry has approved the new Droid TW 12.7 robotics complex, used on a tracked platform with a Browning 12.7 mm machine gun, for combat operations, the ministry announced on Dec. 9. The system was approved after performing reliably in combat testing, the ministry said. &quot;In the conditions of modern warfare, technologies play a decisive role in ensuring superiority on the battlefield,&quot; Deputy Defense Minister Dmytro Klimenkov said. Klimenkov said the codification of the Droid TW system marked &quot;a significant step&quot; towards innovating the Armed Forces. According to the Defense Ministry, the Droid TW 12.7 is a ground combat drone operated via a remote-control tablet. The system is armed with a Browning 12.7 mm machine gun and mounted on a tracked platform that allows it to operate under difficult conditions. &quot;Our advantage is a high-tech army capable of confronting modern challenges,&quot; Klimenkov said. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Sept. 24 that Ukraine has developed a three-year plan for the production of drones, electronic warfare equipment, and ground robotic systems. Ukraine&apos;s budget for 2025 envisages Hr 55 billion ($1.3 billion) for weapons production, Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin said on Nov. 12.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-approves-droid-tw-robotics-system-for-combat-operation/	2024-12-09T18:53:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Droid.png
Ukraine won't trade young soldiers' lives for better weapons, Zelensky says	Ukraine will not use &quot;the youth of soldiers&quot; to make up for its gaps in military equipment and training, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a social media post on Dec. 9. Zelensky&apos;s comments came in response to pressure from U.S. officials and other Western allies for Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 in order to mobilize more troops. &quot;We must not compensate the lack of equipment and training with the youth of soldiers,&quot; Zelensky said on X. &quot;The priority should be providing missiles and lowering Russia&apos;s military potential, not Ukraine&apos;s draft age. The goal should be to preserve as many lives as possible, not to preserve weapons in storage.&quot; Zelensky said Ukraine&apos;s focus should be equipping and training &quot;existing brigades&quot; and that allies should work together to end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. He also thanked French President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump for their recent meeting in Paris, calling it a &quot;productive conversation.&quot; &quot;I told President Trump that Putin fears only him and, perhaps, China,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;And that&apos;s the truth&#x2014;only decisiveness can bring this war to a just end and ensure lasting peace.&quot; Earlier on Dec. 9, U.S. State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said that Washington will provide training and weapons to Ukrainian soldiers if Kyiv lowers its conscription age. Previously, the Associated Press (AP) reported on Nov. 27 that the U.S. was urging Ukraine to lower its draft age, according to a senior White House official. Personnel shortages have dogged Ukraine throughout its fight against Russia. Although Ukraine adopted a major bill reforming the draft in April, mobilization slowed down in autumn, leaving front-line units depleted. Russian forces significantly outnumber Ukrainian units and have been able to advance at record rates in eastern Ukraine while absorbing heavy losses. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-wont-trade-young-peoples-lives-for-better-weapons-zelensky-says/	2024-12-09T17:50:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185712185.jpg
5 Ukrainian children return home from Russia, Russian-occupied territories	Ukraine successfully returned five children from Russia and Russian-occupied territories as part of the &quot;Bring Kids Back UA&quot; initiative, Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak announced early on Dec. 10. Among those rescued were three young Ukrainians who had just turned 18. Yermak added that two of them suffered from psychological pressure while living in Russia, and the third, a young man without family support, finally managed to leave the occupied territory. The initiative also helped a family of four, including children aged 11 and 14, who faced persecution for their pro-Ukrainian position. They also assisted a 77-year-old woman who could not evacuate on her own. &quot;Their stories reveal the terror and fear people endure under occupation,&quot; Yermak said. Since February 2022, at least 20,000 Ukrainian children have been abducted from Russian-occupied territories and sent to other Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine or to Russia itself, according to a Ukrainian national database &quot;Children of War.&quot; The Ukrainian Parliament&#x2019;s Commissioner for Human Rights, Dmytro Lubinets, estimates that Russia has unlawfully deported up to 150,000 Ukrainian children, while the Children&#x2019;s Ombudswoman, Daria Herasymchuk, puts the figure at 200,000&#x2013;300,000. A Yale School of Public Health study published on Dec. 3 detailsed Russia&apos;s systematic program of deporting and forcibly assimilating Ukrainian children. Under orders from Russian President Vladimir Putin, children were transported via military aircraft in 2022, reclassified in Russian databases as native-born, and subjected to pro-Russian re-education before being adopted into Russian families. Ukrainian children had been transported to at least 21 regions throughout Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/5-ukrainian-children-return-home-from-russia-russian-occupied-territories/	2024-12-09T16:45:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178506540.jpg
German opposition leader vows Ukraine won't fight one-handed	Friedrich Merz, the leading contender to become Germany&apos;s next chancellor, criticized his country&apos;s arms policy during his visit to Kyiv on Dec. 9, likening it to forcing Ukraine to fight with one hand tied behind its back. During his meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky, Merz condemned the German government&apos;s hesitance to provide long-range weaponry like Taurus cruise missiles. Merz&apos;s CDU alliance, currently leading in polls by over 10% points, positions itself as a staunch supporter of Ukraine&apos;s military needs. &quot;We want your army to be capable of hitting military bases in Russia. Not the civilian population, not infrastructure, but the military targets from which your country is being attacked,&quot; Merz said. His comments reflect growing frustration in Kyiv over Germany&apos;s cautious stance, which Chancellor Olaf Scholz defends as necessary to avoid escalating tensions with Russia. Scholz, who recently visited Kyiv himself, portrays his approach as measured and aimed at avoiding actions that could be perceived as direct German involvement in the war. He has resisted calls to supply Taurus missiles, citing risks of escalation and nuclear retaliation. Germany remains a major financial and military supporter of Ukraine and hosts over a million Ukrainian refugees. However, its flagging economy and public fatigue over the war have emboldened populist parties from both the left and right to challenge the prevailing pro-Ukraine consensus, according to Reuters. Both Scholz and Merz are leveraging the Ukraine issue to solidify their voter bases, though with different narratives. President Zelensky thanked both German leaders for their visits and continued support but echoed Merz&apos;s sentiment on the need for enhanced military aid. &quot;Putin doesn&apos;t want to end this war. He must be forced to, and he can only be forced if Ukraine is strong,&quot; Zelenskiy said.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-opposition-leader-vows-ukraine-wont-fight-one-handed/	2024-12-09T15:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GeV7Pm3XgAARc7l.jpg
Assad's downfall shows Kremlin is not invincible, undermines trust in Russian-led alliances	As Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad&apos;s regime collapsed in a matter of days, Russia&apos;s influence in the Middle East appeared to wane. Preoccupied with its all-out war against Ukraine, Russia was unable to prevent the downfall of its main ally in the region. The stunning rapidity of the rebels&apos; offensive also made it hard for Russia to gather resources to boost Assad&apos;s defenses. As Assad has fled Syria and has been granted asylum in Russia, the fate of Russian military bases in Syria now hangs in the balance. The Kremlin&apos;s international prestige has also suffered a heavy blow. The implications of Assad&apos;s overthrow for Ukraine are less certain. Some analysts argue that the regime&apos;s collapse will strengthen Ukraine&apos;s position in potential peace talks with Russia. &quot;(Assad&apos;s downfall) will serve as a major motivator for those opposed to Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine and galvanize international support for Ukraine with a renewed belief that Russia can be defeated,&quot; Neil Quilliam, a Middle East expert at Chatham House, told the Kyiv Independent. The lightning speed of the regime&apos;s collapse surprised observers. &quot;The state institutions and the military had been hollowed out over the years, and the regime focused primarily on enriching itself rather than providing services to its population, reforming the military, and engendering loyalty to the state,&quot; Quilliam said. &quot;It collapsed because the state and the population suffered a decade of neglect, and Assad squandered the ceasefire years instead of building up support.&quot; David Butter, another Middle East expert at Chatham House, told the Kyiv Independent that Assad&apos;s government collapsed because &quot;it was brutal and corrupt&quot;, and he &quot;was happy exploiting the frozen war economy for the gain of his inner circle.&quot; &quot;The most important reasons (for the regime&apos;s collapse) include the astonishing weakness of its military forces, especially due to low morale and corruption, and the lack of meaningful social support behind the regime,&quot; M&#xE1;t&#xE9; Szalai, a research fellow focusing on the Middle East at the Netherlands&apos; Clingendael Institute, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It is also true that the largest opposition alliance in Idlib led by Tahrir al-Sham managed to strengthen its institutional and military capacities to a greater extent than most anticipated.&quot; Photo for illustrative purposes. Russian soldiers walk past a Russian military police armored vehicle at a position in the northeastern Syrian city of Kobane on Oct. 23, 2019. (AFP via Getty Images)Due to the inherent weakness of the regime and its armed forces, little was needed to topple it. &quot;Once (the Islamist group) Tahrir al-Sham breached the few better front-line units Assad had, the rest just unraveled,&quot; Sascha Bruchmann, a military analyst at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the Kyiv Independent. Quilliam said that Syria&apos;s main allies, Russia and Iran, &quot;provided very little support&quot; to Assad&apos;s regime as it was collapsing. &quot;Both Russia and Iran are overstretched at present through their respective wars with Ukraine and Israel, and both lost faith in Assad to be a reliable security partner and so lost hope in being able to deploy forces and reverse rebel advances,&quot; he said. &quot;Iran and Hezbollah have been vanquished by Israel, and so lacked the capacity to prevent the regime from falling, and the same goes for Russia.&quot; Syrians wave flag of Russia and a portrait of President Bashar al-Assad during a rally in support of Russia in the Syrian capital Damascus, on March 25, 2022.(Louai Beshara/AFP via Getty Images)Butter said that &quot;Hezbollah had been pulled out to fight in Lebanon&quot; and &quot;Iran&apos;s forces generally had been weakened by Israeli strikes.&quot; &quot;Russian air power was not useful &#x2014; ok for hitting a few hospitals but not in sustained support of ground forces, which anyway had run away,&quot; he added. Szalai argued that Russia and Iran &quot;could have provided a bit more than they did in the last days, so it was not only a question of capabilities but also of political will.&quot; &quot;Despite being allies, both Moscow and Tehran were frustrated with Assad,&quot; he continued. The speed of the rebels&apos; offensive was also crucial for their success. &quot;Iran mustered forces, and the Russians flew air strikes against Tahrir al-Sham,&quot; Bruchmann said. &quot;However, the collapse of Assad&apos;s forces was too fast. The Russians and Iranians could not stiffen up Assad&apos;s forces and took too long to organize a defense.&quot; He added that &quot;the fall of Deir ez-Zor and key roads in Eastern Syria meant that the vital land bridge from Iran through Iraq and into Syria was under threat while Israeli air superiority stopped Iranian military airlifts.&quot; &quot;The Russians knew they could not count on the Syrian army and pulled out their navy vessels from Tartus,&quot; Olli Ruohom&#xE4;ki, a Middle East expert at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;(Russian military intelligence) saw the writing on the wall that this was not going to end up well.&quot; Another problem was a lack of Syrian soldiers&apos; motivation. &quot;They tried to (prevent Assad&apos;s downfall) but they failed because Assad&apos;s soldiers were not willing to fight,&quot; Matteo Colombo, a Middle East expert at the Clingendael Institute, told the Kyiv Independent. The collapse of Assad&apos;s regime is seen as a major blow to Russia&apos;s influence in the Middle East and its global clout. &quot;Russia was once admired by Middle Eastern states for being a dependable ally and was often compared to the U.S., which is characterized as a fair-weather friend,&quot; Quilliam said. &quot;Russia has now lost that reputation, which has sent shock waves through the Middle East. As such, its influence will diminish.&quot; Szalai argued that &quot;the fall of Assad&apos;s regime is bad news for Russia but it is even worse news for Iran.&quot; &quot;From Moscow&apos;s perspective, Assad was the closest ally of the Kremlin in the region, and its bases enabled Russia to project power in the Middle East and Africa,&quot; he said. &quot;Since 2015, the survival of the Assad regime has been the symbol and &apos;proof&apos; that any government can survive with Russian military help. Now, this message is severely undermined.&quot; He also said that the collapse of Assad&apos;s regime &quot;undermined Iran&apos;s forward defense security strategy&quot; since Syria &quot;served as a bridge between its allies in Iraq and Lebanon.&quot; Michael Sahlin, a former Swedish ambassador to Turkey and a Middle East specialist at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, also said that it was a huge loss for Russia since the Syrian bases &quot;were important for its Africa policy&quot; and allowed the Kremlin to penetrate into former French colonies in Africa. Russian President Vladimir Putin meets with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization leaders&apos; summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, on Sept. 16, 2022. (Getty Images)Bruchmann agreed, saying that &quot;Iran and Russia lost relative power to Turkey.&quot; &quot;Russia has rebranded itself as a staunch supporter of allies in the global South after defending Assad from 2015 on,&quot; he said. &quot;That reputation must take a dent. Iran is losing its land corridor to an already embattled Hezbollah &#x2014; its premier proxy.&quot; The main risk for Russia is the potential loss of its military bases in Syria. These include the Tartus naval base, the Khmeimim air base, and smaller military facilities in other parts of the country. Russian state news agency TASS reported on Dec. 9 that the rebels had taken over the provinces of Tartus and Latakia, where the Tartus and Khmeimim bases are located. Meanwhile, Russia has begun withdrawing its naval and military assets from Syria amid the collapse of Assad&apos;s regime, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) said on Dec. 8. &quot;The current withdrawal is to avoid a disastrous last minute flight like the American withdrawal from Kabul,&quot; Erwin van Veen, a Middle East expert at the Clingendael Institute, told the Kyiv Independent. Sahlin also said that, &quot;Russia has started to abandon the bases, and there is a trend for (the Russians) to leave Syria.&quot; He added that they did not want their military equipment to be destroyed or captured by the rebels. TASS reported on Dec. 9, citing an official in Syria&apos;s Latakia province, that the rebels did not intend to storm the Russian bases. The news agency also cited Kremlin sources as saying that Russia was in talks with the rebels on ensuring the safety of Russian diplomats and bases in Syria. However, analysts say it will be hard for Russia to keep the bases. Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses troops during his visit at Khmeimim Air Base in Latakia, Syria on Dec. 11, 2017. (Kremlin Press Office / Handout/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)&quot;It is difficult to imagine that Russia will be able to hold on to the bases given Moscow&apos;s unerring support of Assad until recently,&quot; Quilliam said. &quot;Russia&apos;s targeting of schools and hospitals will never be forgotten by Syrians and international observers. It will be a major strategic loss for Russia.&quot; Ruohom&#xE4;ki and Colombo also said it would be difficult and politically costly for Russia to keep its bases in Syria because of Russia&apos;s association with Assad&apos;s regime. Russia&apos;s decreasing influence in the Middle East and potential loss of bases may indirectly help Ukraine, analysts say. Quilliam said that Assad&apos;s ouster could potentially boost Ukraine&apos;s leverage in future peace talks with Russia. &quot;Russia&apos;s exit from Syria shows that it is not invincible and that its capacity is compromised and morale amongst its force must now be even lower, and that provides negotiators with significant leverage,&quot; he added. Other analysts argued that it is not clear what impact Assad&apos;s debacle could have on peace talks in Ukraine. &quot;For this to impact future negotiations, the loss of prestige will first have to translate in changed perceptions around the globe,&quot; Bruchmann said. &quot;Unfortunately, that may take some time before capitals in the global South realize Russian support is not a real guarantee for any security problem they may face.&quot; &quot;However, if Russia loses access to the port of Tartus, it would weaken its position in the Mediterranean significantly and may decrease the latent threat vis-a-vis Europe,&quot; he added. Butter said that he doesn&apos;t &quot;see much material impact on the Ukraine war, but it is bad for Putin&apos;s image.&quot; &quot;(U.S. President-elect Donald) Trump has already hinted that the Syria debacle makes Putin a loser,&quot; he added. Trump said on Dec. 8 that Russia &quot;was not interested in protecting (Assad) any longer.&quot; &quot;There was no reason for Russia to be there in the first place,&quot; he wrote. &quot;They lost all interest in Syria because of Ukraine ... a war that should never have started and could go on forever.&quot; At the same time, Russia may redirect some or all of its troops and equipment from Syria to Ukraine. But the impact of this may be negligible. &quot;There aren&apos;t that many Russian troops in Syria to make a material impact on the battlefield in Ukraine,&quot; Bruchmann said. &quot;I don&apos;t have any good numbers, but it&apos;s probably one squadron at the air base and a few battalions of light infantry and military police. On the flip side, it will be harder to recruit Syrians from now on. It&apos;s probably another net loss for Russia, but not dramatic compared to what they lose in Ukraine every week now.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/assads-downfall-shows-kremlin-is-not-invincible-undermines-trust-in-russian-led-alliances/	2024-12-09T14:29:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/syria.jpg
US says it's ready to train, arm new soldiers if Ukraine changes conscription policy	The United States is ready to take over the training of new Ukrainian soldiers and provide them with the necessary weapons if Ukraine changes its mobilization policy, U.S. State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said during a meeting with journalists on Dec. 9. &quot;We have had conversations with the government of Ukraine about the security situation it faces in the East,&quot; Miller said. &quot;Ultimately, the decisions about the composition of its military force are those are decisions that the Ukrainians have to make for themselves. What we have made clear is that if they produce additional forces to join the fight, we and our allies will be ready to acquit those forces and train those forces to enter battle.&quot; His comments come as part of a broader wave of statements from senior U.S. officials, amid reports that Western allies are urging Ukraine to reduce its minimum mobilization age from 25 to 18 in order to replenish its military forces. Earlier on Dec. 4, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Ukraine faces &quot;hard decisions&quot; regarding further mobilization in its fight against Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. &quot;These are necessary decisions,&quot; Blinken noted during a press conference in Brussels. He emphasized that mobilization is critical for Ukraine, adding that while the country has the necessary funds and ammunition, it also requires more people to effectively repel Russian aggression. Blinken also reiterated that every soldier that Ukraine mobilizes would have &quot;the training and the equipment they need to effectively defend the country.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky has so far refuted Washington&apos;s appeals. According to the president, partners have only provided enough aid to fully equip 2.5 out of the 10 Ukrainian brigades that Ukraine had requested support for.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-says-its-ready-to-train-arm-new-soldiers-if-ukraine-changes-conscription-policy/	2024-12-09T13:30:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1246365005-m-1674723833vz7l2.jpeg

Ukraine war latest: Zelensky 'may consider' deployment of foreign peacekeepers to ensure ceasefire	Key developments on Dec. 9: Ukraine &quot;may consider&quot; French President Emmanuel Macron&apos;s proposal to deploy foreign peacekeepers on its territory but only after getting a clear understanding of the NATO membership timeline, President Volodymyr Zelensky said after meeting German opposition leader Friedrich Merz on Dec. 9. The president also said he plans to call U.S. President Joe Biden to discuss a NATO membership invitation for Ukraine. &quot;I&apos;m telling you frankly: We can work on Emmanuel&apos;s (Macron) proposal. He proposed that troops of this or that country could be present on Ukrainian territory to guarantee security while Ukraine is not in NATO,&quot; Zelensky said following talks with Merz in Kyiv. According to recent media reports, the U.K. and France are considering the deployment of peacekeepers to Ukraine following a possible ceasefire, with German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock also not ruling out the possibility. Merz called Baerbock&apos;s statement irresponsible, saying that ending the war is currently the most pressing matter. European troops overseeing a peaceful post-war situation in the country were reportedly included in a peace plan of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s team. &quot;But first, we must have a clear understanding of when Ukraine will be in the EU and NATO,&quot; Zelensky commented. Ukrainian officials have stressed that NATO membership is the only path toward a just and lasting peace. While acknowledging that the country cannot become a full member amid the full-scale war, Kyiv asked the allies to at least extend an invitation now as a clear signal of support. A car exploded in Russian-occupied Donetsk on Dec. 9, seriously injuring two people inside, Russian state media reported. The Russian Telegram channel Mash claimed that Serhii Yevsiukov, the former head of Russia&apos;s notorious Olenivka prisoner of war (POW) camp in the occupied part of Donetsk Oblast, was killed in the blast. The claims could not be independently verified as there has been no official confirmation that Yevsiukov was killed in the bombing. Ukraine did not comment on the incident. Yevsiukov was wanted by Ukraine on murder, torture, and war crime charges. The Olenivka camp, notorious for the torture and abuse of Ukrainian captives, was hit by an explosion in June 2022, killing over 50 Ukrainian POWs and injuring more than 150. Kyiv called this a deliberate Russian war crime. Russian state news agencies reported that a Toyota SUV exploded in central Donetsk, seriously injuring two people inside the vehicle who were also family members. The man&apos;s leg was torn off by the blast, RIA Novosti reported, without revealing his identity. The explosion occurred on the side of the driver, the state news agency TASS reported. Russian President Vladimir Putin should seek an end to the war as he lost 700,000 people to hostilities, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said in comments for the New York Post published on Dec. 8. &quot;I&#x2019;m formulating a concept of how to end that ridiculous war,&quot; Trump told the news outlet following his trip to Paris, where he met Zelensky for the first time since the former&apos;s reelection. &quot;He (Zelensky) wants to have a ceasefire... He wants to make peace. We didn&#x2019;t talk about the details,&quot; Trump said in a phone interview. Speaking about Putin, Trump said that &quot;when you lose 700,000 people, it&#x2019;s time. It&#x2019;s not going to end until there&#x2019;s peace.&quot; The U.S. president-elect previously said on Truth Social that Russia had lost 600,000 soldiers during the war in Ukraine. Trump, who will return to the White House on Jan. 20, pledged to end the war within 24 hours following his reelection and bring both sides to the negotiating table. In a media interview published on Dec. 8, the president-elect said Kyiv could expect a possible reduction of U.S. assistance. The contours of Trump&apos;s plan to end the war remain unclear, but suggestions circulating within his team entailed freezing the war along the current front lines and postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations. &quot;(W)hen we talk about effective peace with Russia, we must first and foremost talk about effective guarantees for peace,&quot; Zelensky said on X after his talks with Trump. Russia has transferred the bodies of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POW) allegedly killed in a plane crash over Russia&#x2019;s Belgorod Oblast in January, Russian Ombudsman Tatyana Moskalkova claimed in an interview with state-run RIA Novosti published on Dec. 9. A Russian Il-76 military cargo plane crashed in Russia&apos;s Belgorod Oblast on Jan. 24, with the cause of the incident unclear. Moscow alleged that 65 Ukrainian POWs were on board the plane during the fatal crash. Ukraine has not confirmed this claim and called for an international investigation, a proposal that Russia refused. A spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of POWs told the Kyiv Independent that Russia had handed over several bodies during the latest exchange, but the efforts to identify them are still underway. &quot;During the latest repatriation activities, the remains of the deceased were transferred to Ukraine from (Russia), but they require additional identification,&quot; spokesperson Petro Yatsenko said. Ukraine repatriated the bodies of 502 fallen soldiers in late November. &quot;As of now, specialized institutions are trying to establish whether the remains of these individuals really belong to Ukrainian service members within the framework of criminal proceedings,&quot; Yatsenko added. Russia&#x2019;s spending on &#x201C;national defense&#x201D; reached an unprecedented $43 billion in the third quarter of 2024, The Moscow Times reported on Dec. 9. From July to September, the Russian government spent an average of $3.29 billion per week, or $19.6 million per hour, on military maintenance and arms purchases, based on an exchange rate of 100 rubles per dollar. Both open and classified defense expenditures soared. Publicly disclosed spending totaled $13.81 billion, up 71% from the previous quarter, while classified spending surged 131% to $29.47 billion. This marks an 80% increase compared to the second quarter and a 53% year-on-year rise. This single-quarter defense expenditure is nearly triple Russia&#x2019;s annual higher education budget of $15.46 billion and about 15 times the yearly budgets of regions such as Irkutsk ($2.7 billion) or Novosibirsk ($3.33 billion). Spending on military salaries, including substantial bonuses for contract workers, rose by 26% year-over-year to $6.14 billion. Additionally, expenditures on &#x201C;military cooperation with foreign countries,&#x201D; potentially including Iranian drones and North Korean munitions, reached a record $1.73 billion in Q3. Russian President Vladimir Putin approved a federal budget on Dec. 1 with record defense spending over the next three years. In 2025, military expenditures will reach 13.5 trillion rubles ($126 billion), or over 6% of GDP, exceeding combined spending on education, healthcare, social policy, and the economy. While military spending is projected to decline slightly in 2026 and 2027, it will remain substantial at 12.8 trillion rubles ($114.9 billion) and 13.1 trillion rubles ($122.4 billion). Russian suppliers to the military-industrial complex exploited a loophole to order microchips from Texas Instruments (TI) despite international sanctions, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 9. Russian distributors allegedly integrated TI&#x2019;s online store into their trading platforms, enabling customers in Russia to access semiconductor inventories and prices, and place orders. These orders were reportedly fulfilled through intermediaries outside Russia. Websites like getchips and altchips, blocked in the U.S. and Europe but accessible in Russia, were primarily used to facilitate these transactions. The availability of TI products on these platforms mirrored data from TI&#x2019;s proprietary application programming interface (API), suggesting Russian distributors accessed the company&#x2019;s technical coordinates to process orders. Between August 2023 and August 2024, a large Russian distributor reportedly processed over 4,000 orders for thousands of TI products worth nearly $6 million. Around $4 million in orders were for Russian military firms. Goods were routed through Hong Kong and other intermediaries before reaching Russia, with distributors applying a 40% markup to cover shipping and payment costs.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-zelensky-may-consider-deployment-of-foreign-peacekeepers-to-ensure-ceasefire/	2024-12-09T12:35:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GeNnzDkXYAAspy4.jpg
Ukraine assembling coalition for united stance on ending war, President's Office reports	Ukraine is assembling a coalition of partners to create a working group aimed at bolstering its defense and forming a united diplomatic stance on ending the war, the president&apos;s spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov said on Dec. 9, as reported by Ukrainska Pravda. &quot;These are countries with long-range capabilities, significant investments in Ukrainian weapons production, and influence over Ukraine&#x2019;s future NATO membership,&quot; Nykyforov said. The group will include Ukraine&#x2019;s strongest European allies alongside the United States. A meeting of participating nations is planned for December to coordinate their positions and ensure Ukraine&#x2019;s strength &#x201C;both in negotiations and on the battlefield.&#x201D; The announcement coincided with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz&#x2019;s visit to Kyiv. At a joint press conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky, Merz proposed a contact group comprising Germany, France, the U.K., and Poland to coordinate Europe&#x2019;s strategy for ending the war and aligning it with U.S. policies. Zelensky endorsed the proposal, emphasizing the importance of unity among allies in crafting a clear vision for Ukraine&#x2019;s security and the diplomatic resolution of the conflict.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-assembling-coalition-for-united-stance-on-ending-war-presidential-office-says/	2024-12-09T12:20:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/e856e496e991afcbf2e24ad12d085f78_1635942788_extra_large.jpeg
Russian military suppliers exploit loophole to source US microchips	Russian suppliers to the military-industrial complex exploited a loophole to order microchips from Texas Instruments (TI) despite international sanctions, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 9.

Russian military companies rely on Western-made components for their operations, including domestically made Shahed-type drones used in attacks on Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed on Nov. 2 that Russia launched over 2,000 such drones in October, which required more than 170,000 imported components, including microchips, microcontrollers, and processors. Zelensky urged Western allies to tighten sanctions against suppliers of these components, emphasizing that Russia continues to evade restrictions using shell companies and networks involving countries such as China, Iran, and North Korea. &quot;These parts are supplied from abroad, unfortunately, by companies in China, Europe, and America &#x2014; a multitude of small but significant contributions to Russia&#x2019;s ongoing terror,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-military-suppliers-exploit-loophole-to-source-us-microchips/	2024-12-09T11:46:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1489472156.jpeg

Transnistria declares economic emergency over Russian gas supply threat	Leader of Moldova&apos;s Russian-occupied Transnistria region, Vadim Krasnoselsky, signed a decree on Dec. 9 introducing a 30-day economic state of emergency due to the risk of Russian gas supply disruptions, Newsmaker media reported. The emergency measures include conserving gas and energy resources, banning energy exports, and restricting specific financial and economic activities, such as moving goods, funds, and services. The decree must still be approved by the occupied region&apos;s legislative body. The threat of a gas cutoff arises from Ukraine&apos;s decision not to renew the transit contract for Russian gas to Europe beyond 2024. The current agreement, which expires on Dec. 31, 2024, has facilitated over five decades of gas flows from Siberia to Europe. While Ukrainian officials have indicated they will not extend the contract, Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed willingness to continue gas deliveries if Kyiv agrees. However, Putin has also suggested that transit through Ukraine might cease. Ending the transit could cost Russia billions in lost revenue, dealing a significant blow to Gazprom, the state-controlled gas monopoly. Gazprom is reportedly preparing for a scenario where no gas flows through Ukraine to Europe after 2024. Ukraine earns approximately $1 billion annually in transit fees, but Russia&apos;s gas exports through Ukraine have already diminished sharply. In 2023, only 15 billion cubic meters (bcm) of Russian gas were transported via Ukraine, representing just 8% of peak flows in 2018-2019. The Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhhorod pipeline carried 14.65 bcm through Russia&#x2019;s Sudzha entry point to Slovakia in 2023, accounting for roughly half of Russia&#x2019;s remaining gas exports to Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/transnistria-declares-economic-emergency-over-russian-gas-supply-threat/	2024-12-09T10:48:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
