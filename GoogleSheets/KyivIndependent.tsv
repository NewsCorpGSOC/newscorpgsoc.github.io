Ukraine war latest: Ukrainian military refutes claim that Russia captured Zaporizhzhia Oblast village	Key developments on March 17: The Russian Defense Ministry claimed Russian forces captured the Ukrainian village of Stepove in Zaporizhzhia Oblast on March 17. Ukraine&apos;s Southern Defense Forces spokesperson Vladyslav Voloshyn denied the statement. Stepove, with a pre-war population of 118 people, is located 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the villages of Pyatykhatky and Mali Shcherbaky in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. All three settlements were under Russian occupation in 2022 and 2023. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that its military had taken control of Stepove. However, Voloshyn told the Kyiv Independent that Ukrainian forces did not lose ground in the Zaporizhzhia sector of the front line. &quot;This is a method of information warfare &#x2014; the enemy claims that it is there before it has entered. I do not confirm the information that Russia entered the settlements of Stepove, Mali Shcherbaky, or Shcherbaky and took them under control,&quot; Voloshyn said. &quot;Fierce fighting continues in this area. The enemy is trying to change the configuration of the combat line in its favor. In total, six combat engagements were registered in the Orikhiv sector over the last day. The day before yesterday, there were 19,&quot; Voloshyn added. According to Voloshyn, since March, Russian forces have intensified their assaults in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Since the beginning of spring, there have been over 130 clashes in the Orikhiv sector alone. The Ukrainian military warned in fall 2024 that Russian forces were ammassing in Zaporizhzhia Oblastin preparation for a southern offensive. Heavy fortifications were constructed around the regional capital of Zaporizhzhia ahead of the possible invasion. The area near Stepove was the main axis of Ukraine&apos;s southern counteroffensive in 2023, which led to the liberation of the settlement of Robotyne but achieved no major breakthrough. Ukrainian drones attacked a fuel and energy facility in Russia&apos;s Astrakhan Oblast on March 17, causing a fire, regional governor Igor Babushkin claimed. &quot;Overnight, the Ukrainian Armed Forces again attempted a massive drone attack on facilities located in the region, including a fuel and energy complex,&quot; Babushkin claimed. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry said its forces had destroyed 13 drones over the oblast. Babushkin reported that fallen debris caused a fire at the facility, and one person was hospitalized. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Astrakhan Oblast is located in southwestern Russia and borders Kazakhstan. The city of Astrakhan is almost 800 kilometers (500 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. Ukraine has increasingly targeted Russia&apos;s energy and military infrastructure to disrupt Moscow&apos;s war effort. Overnight on March 14, Ukrainian drones struck the Tuapse oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai, igniting a gasoline storage tank. Kyiv has focused on hitting Russian refineries, oil depots, and defense industry sites, aiming to limit Moscow&apos;s ability to sustain its full-scale invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on March 17 in his evening address that a Ukrainian long-range drone has successfully completed testing, demonstrating its ability to fly 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles). &quot;There is good news about long-range drones. Our drone has passed a 3,000-kilometer test,&quot; Zelensky said following a meeting of the Headquarters of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, the top command and control body for Ukraine&#x2019;s defense and security forces. Kyiv uses long-range drones to strike deep into Russian territory, targeting military infrastructure such as airfields, oil refineries, and logistics hubs. During the meeting, participants also discussed a new long-range missile developed by Ukraine, the Long Neptune. &quot;We can say that we are satisfied with the results of the strikes. But we need to produce more missiles, more drones, and we will be talking about this with our partners this week,&quot; Zelensky said. Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk earlier said that the Ukrainian Navy is the only structure of the Ukrainian Armed Forces that uses the Long Neptun missiles. Ukraine has also developed long-range missile-drone hybrids, such as the Palianytsia and Peklo models, featuring turbojet engines as alternatives to cruise missiles. President Volodymyr Zelensky has set a target of producing at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha outlined three key conditions for future negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine in an interview with RBC-Ukraine published on March 17. &quot;I don&apos;t like this definition (red lines). There are fundamental things that are non-negotiable, that cannot be touched upon,&quot; Sybiha said when asked what Ukraine&apos;s red lines are in potential talks. Sybiha stressed that Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity and sovereignty are non-negotiable, reaffirming that Kyiv will never recognize Russian-occupied territories as part of Russia. President Volodymyr Zelenskyvoiced this stance back on March 12. Despite this, the Trump administration has suggested that Kyiv and Moscow must compromise on a peace deal, calling Ukraine&apos;s goal of restoring its pre-2014 borders &quot;unrealistic.&quot; Russian forces currently occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine, where reports of systematic repression, torture, and forced deportations continue to emerge. According to Sybiha, the second key condition is Ukraine&apos;s right to choose its alliances. He emphasized that no country should have a veto over Ukraine&apos;s NATO and EU aspirations. Kyiv officially applied to join NATO in September 2022, and in 2024, the alliance declared Ukraine&apos;s path to membership &quot;irreversible,&quot; though no formal invitation has been extended. Sybiha also underscored that Ukraine&apos;s ability to defend itself must remain unrestricted, meaning there can be no restrictions on the Ukrainian Armed Forces. &quot;Russia must be held accountable. These are all elements of a lasting peace,&quot; he said. On March 13, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was willing to accept a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire but demanded guarantees that Kyiv would halt mobilization, military training, and foreign aid deliveries &#x2014; conditions that could leave Ukraine vulnerable to renewed aggression. U.S. President Donald Trump is set to speak with Putin on March 18 to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. While Trump seeks to secure a deal, European allies and Ukraine warn that a rushed agreement without security guarantees may fail to ensure lasting peace. President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed a law allowing Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces to be sent abroad during martial law, according to an official decree published on March 17. The law aims to enhance defense cooperation with partner nations, particularly by enabling Ukrainian forces to participate in training and receive military equipment, lawmaker Oleksii Honcharenkoexplained. &quot;This will allow us to attract international support to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s defense faster and more effectively,&quot; Honcharenko posted on Telegram. The legislation permits Ukrainian military units to be deployed to other countries for national security purposes, including repelling armed aggression, protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity, and exercising the right to self-defense under international law. The law does not concern the deployment of Ukrainian troops for combat operations on Russian territory. The decision to send military personnel abroad will be made by the president but requires approval from the Verkhovna Rada, the country&apos;s parliament. Deployments will be subject to a formal request detailing the mission&apos;s objectives, troop numbers, weaponry, and the conditions of their stay abroad. Zelensky vetoed the bill in January and returned it to parliament with amendments clarifying the decision-making process and ensuring compliance with international law. Lawmakers approved the revised version in late February. Ukraine is negotiating with South Korea to hand over two North Korean soldiers taken prisoner by Kyiv, South Korea&apos;s Yonhap news agency reported on March 17. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and his Ukrainian counterpart Andrii Sybiha discussed the potential transfer of the North Korean prisoners of war (POWs) in a phone call. Cho noted that under South Korea&apos;s Constitution, North Koreans are considered South Korean citizens, but the prisoners must express a desire to relocate. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast last fall to counter Ukraine&apos;s cross-border incursion launched in August 2024. Ukrainian troops captured two North Korean soldiers as POWs on Jan. 11. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously reported that North Korean forces fighting for Russia had suffered 4,000 casualties, with two-thirds of the losses being soldiers killed. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, attributed the high losses to North Korea&apos;s lack of combat experience and its use of human wave attacks with limited equipment.

New Canadian prime minister invites Zelensky to attend G7 summit in June	Newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has invited President Volodymyr Zelensky to attend the Group of Seven (G7) summit in June, Le Journal de Quebec reported on March 17, citing a Canadian Foreign Ministry spokesperson. Canada, which holds the G7 presidency this year, will host the summit on June 15-17 in Kananaskis County, located in the western province of Alberta. Carney had a phone call with Zelensky on March 16 and invited him to the summit, according to the media outlet. Carney was sworn in as Canada&apos;s prime minister on March 14, replacing former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as head of the governing Liberal Party. Trudeau announced his resignation in January. Under Trudeau&apos;s leadership, Canada was a strong ally of Ukraine, providing 19.5 billion Canadian dollars ($13.5 billion) in assistance, including 4.5 billion Canadian dollars ($3.1 billion) in military aid.	https://kyivindependent.com/new-canadian-pm-invites-zelensky-to-attend-g7-summit-in-june/	2025-03-17T12:24:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2205017903.jpg
‘Talk about an invasion is everywhere’ — How Lithuania is preparing for war with Russia	Throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, repeated and escalating warnings of the potential for a wider war have only raised fears in the Baltic states that they could be next in the crosshairs of the Kremlin. Talk about a potential Russian invasion is &quot;very common at parties, gatherings, lunch breaks, water cooler talk,&quot; Gabija Stasiukyne, a 32-year-old fintech professional living in Vilnius, Lithuania, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It&#x2019;s everywhere. The conversation inevitably turns in the direction of &#x2014; what are you going to do?&quot; Lithuania&apos;s government is also taking the threat seriously &#x2014; the country reinstated conscription in 2015, and Vilnius in January committed to spending between 5% and 6% of its GDP on defense annually until at least 2030. &quot;Increasing our military capabilities and strengthening alliances is of utmost importance,&quot; Lithuania&apos;s Defense Minister Dovile &#x160;akaliene, told the Kyiv Independent in written response. &quot;War won&#x2019;t come tomorrow, but we are reinventing our defence in order to be ready to fight tonight. We know every step of our adversary, and are preparing accordingly.&quot; For Lithuania and the Baltic states collectively, Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 once again shone a spotlight on, and raised memories of, a long history of Moscow&apos;s imperialist ambitions. &quot;My great-grandfather was deported (by the Soviets during World War II) to Siberia because he was a teacher, an intelligent man,&quot; Emilija Sikorskyite, a 23-year-old English and French language teacher living in Vilnius,&quot; told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;He never came back. He died there.&quot; Lithuania was the first Soviet republic to proclaim independence in 1990, one year before Ukraine, and joined NATO in 2004, providing the country with the security of the military alliance&apos;s collective defense clause in the event of Russian aggression. But the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, and his increasingly hostile attitude to Europe and Ukraine have left many Lithuanians fearing that being a member of NATO is not the security guarantee it once was.

(Sergei Gapon/AFP via Getty Images)Ignas Zalieckas, a Lithuanian cultural journalist living in Germany, told the Kyiv Independent that the now infamous Oval Office showdown between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky caused &quot;total panic&quot; among his friends and family back home. &quot;Everybody was thinking that NATO is kind of gone,&quot; he said. Western leaders and intelligence agencies have warned of a potential large-scale war in Europe within the next five years, citing Russia&apos;s increasingly aggressive posture, and Lithuania&apos;s geography puts it directly in the firing line. The country shares an eastern border with Russia&apos;s closest ally, Belarus, from whose territory Moscow&apos;s failed attempt to take Kyiv was launched. And to the southwest of Lithuania lies the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, a small piece of land measuring 15,100 square kilometers that is home to the headquarters and main base of Russia&apos;s Baltic Fleet, not to mention thousands of Russian military personnel and a wide array of missiles and other weapons. At their closest point, a mere 40 kilometers separates Kaliningrad and Belarus along a narrow piece of land called the Suwalki Gap which closely tracks the Poland-Lithuania border on the Polish side. A map of the Baltic Sea Region. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)In the event of a war between NATO and Russia, Russian and Belarusian forces linking up across the Suwalki Gap would cut off the only land route to all three Baltic states. &quot;It&apos;s understandable that the Lithuanian government is worried about this,&quot; Dr Stephen Hall, lecturer in Russian and post-Soviet politics at the University of Bath, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The Baltics have a long history of being occupied by other foreign forces, particularly Russia, and a relatively short history of being independent.&quot; In the face of Russian aggression in Ukraine, and a White House washing its hands of European security, talk of an imminent Russian invasion in Lithuania has now gone into overdrive. Barbora Turauskaite, a master&apos;s student and the head of communication at the Institute of International Relations and Political Science at Vilnius University, told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;all the political science and international relations experts talk about the possibility of war every day.&quot; During one of her classes, a lecturer instructed them to &quot;buy plane tickets for September because war is inevitable.&quot; He went on to tell them that joint Russian and Belarusian military exercises scheduled for September 2025, could serve as a pretext for the build up of a Russian invasion force &#x2014; just as they did before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Like Zalieckas, Turauskaite says the unpredictable nature of Trump is adding to anxiety in the country. &quot;We are not sleeping very well. In Lithuanian time, Trump wakes up around 4 p.m. After that, we don&#x2019;t know what to expect,&quot; she said. Lithuania has been one of Kyiv&apos;s staunchest allies &#x2014; in Vilnius public buses display their routes along with the phrase &quot;Vilnius loves Ukraine,&quot; while the number of Ukrainian flags fluttering from government buildings and private balconies at times seems to compare to that of Lithuania&#x2019;s tricolor flag. This has been matched by consistent military aid, but while the weapons and aid have flowed to Ukraine, the war has had a significant impact on the attitudes and priorities of those back home. Eimantas Cesnys, volunteer soldier from Vilnius, conducts three-day survival courses for ninth-graders, which were implemented after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began. &quot;I joined the military in 2022 or 2023 because my whole life I knew that I would go to fight if necessary,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;And when I saw what happened in Ukraine, I thought that I should be prepared.&quot; Teodoras Grigali&#x16B;nas, a volunteer coordinator with the Lithuanian Red Cross&apos;s civil safety program in Vilnius, told the Kyiv independent he has seen an uptick in people signing up for the course which gives advice on matters such as where to find shelters, electricity, and water supplies in the event of an emergency, and how to pack an emergency &quot;grab bag.&quot; People attend a demonstration marking the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s war on Ukraine in Vilnius, Lithuania, on Feb. 23, 2025.

(Teodoras Grigali&#x16B;nas / Lithuanian Res Cross)&quot;At first, it wasn&#x2019;t a very popular topic and it was sort of hard to get people involved,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;But I do notice a change, a spike in people&apos;s interest, especially after the Zelensky and Trump clash,&quot; he added. Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has provided a blueprint of sorts for what Lithuanians could expect in the event of a worst-case scenario, as well as the motivation to prepare as best as is possible. A thyroid cancer diagnosis prevented Aivaras, a 32-year-old freelance film and TV location manager, from following his younger brother into the Lithuanian military, so instead he registered for a new civil role created last year that will enforce curfews and protect infrastructure if martial law is enacted in the event of war. &quot;I understood that if shit hits the fan, you need to be prepared and know what you are doing,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent, requesting not to print his surname due to fears that invading Russian forces would exact revenge on those known to have signed up to resist. Aivaras believes war in Lithuania is likely in the next two to five years &#x2014; potentially sooner, given Trump&#x2019;s actions. &quot;I think that we are a little bit too relaxed. We are not prepared,&quot; he said. &quot;We do not know what&#x2019;s coming for us, and we are very dependent, and we think that somebody else will come and save us.&quot; But for those with families, or those unable to sign up for the military or civil defense roles, more pressing questions with less clear answers are front and center. In Ukraine, Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion prompted a wave of refugees to head west away from the fighting but Lithuania &#x2014; only slightly larger than the U.S. state of West Virginia, this isn&apos;t a viable option, prompting many to plan where in the country would be the safest place to be. Zalieckas has already discussed evacuation plans with his family but his mother&apos;s job as a Supreme Court judge, and his grandparents&apos; health issues mean it&apos;s unlikely that they&apos;ll be able to leave the country. His grandparents live in Radviliskis, an &quot;insanely militarized&quot; area close to a NATO airbase &quot;There&apos;s a dual discussion,&quot; he says. &quot;Is it the least safe place to be or the most safe? Obviously if somebody bombs, they will bomb that place, but there are also air defense systems there.&quot; Stasiukyne, the 32-year-old fintech professional, and her husband, Arvydas, have packed a few emergency bags with basic necessities and supplies for their two young children in case they have to flee. They&apos;ve been informed by special guides on what to do in case of an emergency that were updated and reprinted after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

(Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images)But beyond packing grab bags and cutting back on expenditures so they have some emergency cash on hand, planning for a potential war with no definitive timeline or idea of what it could look like is tricky. &quot;You&#x2019;re never going to feel ready, because you don&#x2019;t know exactly what you&#x2019;re trying to be ready for,&quot; Stasiukyne said. Sikorskyit&#x117;, the 23-year-old English and French language teacher, studied in Kyiv just before the full-scale invasion and has visited friends in Ukraine several times during the war.&#x491; She said her experience of spending nights in bomb shelters and speaking to Ukrainians means she is better prepared for what might happen. &quot;A lot of Ukrainians are saying they weren&apos;t prepared at all. We are trying to learn from people&apos;s mistakes,&quot; she said. &#x201C;Let&apos;s hope for the best and be ready for the worst.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/talk-about-an-invasion-is-everywhere-how-lithuania-is-preparing-for-war-with-russia/	2025-03-17T12:14:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2155056954.jpg
Ukraine's Supreme Court rules illegal mobilization not grounds for dismissal from military	The conscription of a person liable for military service during mobilization is irreversible, Ukraine&apos;s Supreme Court ruled on March 17, following a lawsuit by a serviceman who claimed he had been drafted illegally. The man claimed that the enlistment office&apos;s actions were unlawful because he had not undergone a medical examination before going to the military unit. According to the man, he was allegedly unfit for service. According to Ukrainian law, a conscript must undergo a medical examination before joining the army to determine whether they are fit for military service. The court of first instance found the actions of the enlistment office workers during conscription unlawful and ordered the military unit to discharge the conscript from service. The Appeal Court upheld the decision. However, the Supreme Court ruled that the military unit could not discharge the person liable for military service, as this went beyond the scope of the claim regarding the actions of the enlistment office during the conscription. According to the Supreme Court, the procedure for calling a person liable for military service during mobilization is irreversible. Recognition of the procedure of conscription as unlawful does not entail the restoration of the person&apos;s previous position. According to the statement, the claimant also violated Article 26 of the Ukrainian Law &quot;On Military Duty and Military Service&quot; by failing to undergo a medical examination There have been multiple cases of suspected abuses committed by enlistment officials toward civilians and conscripts since Ukraine started a large-scale mobilization after the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022. Chernivtsi Oblast&apos;s police said on Feb. 7 that they are investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of a 32-year-old man at a regional military enlistment office. The incident follows reports on the deaths of conscripts allegedly caused by beatings at military enlistment offices. In June 2024, the Zhytomyr Oblast military enlistment office launched an investigation after Serhii Kovalchuk, 32, died following his stay at the Zviahel military enlistment office.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-supreme-court-rules-out-illegal-mobilization-isnt-ground-for-dismissal-from-ukrainian-armed-forces/	2025-03-17T11:50:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2163645053.jpg
Who is to gain more from a ceasefire — Russia or Ukraine?	U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 17 that he expects to hold a phone call with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to discuss a U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal that Moscow has yet to agree to. Russia has declined to immediately accept the 30-day ceasefire proposal, with the Kremlin pointing out that Ukraine stands to benefit more from the halt in military action. Putin demanded that Kyiv first halt mobilization, military training, and foreign aid deliveries before Russia would consider halting military action. According to experts, a month-long ceasefire would benefit both sides, allowing the warring parties to replenish and regroup their forces. The battlefield situation, however, is developing worse for Ukraine than for Russia. Following Ukrainian troops&apos; withdrawal from the town of Sudzha in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, experts who spoke with the Kyiv Independent said that Kyiv had a greater need for a pause in military action. &quot;Russia can regroup as well, but because Ukraine&apos;s problems are so much centered on questions of manpower and Russia has more blood to spare, I think it is more urgent for Ukraine to replenish some understaffed front-line brigades and therefore, the ceasefire could benefit them more,&quot; Sascha Bruchmann, a military analyst at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the Kyiv Independent. Kyiv could also get a respite from Moscow&apos;s missile and drone attacks, which have been more devastating than Ukrainian retaliatory strikes deep inside Russia. Following talks in Jeddah on March 11, Kyiv said it had agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington, provided that Russia did as well. On March 13, Putin said Russia was ready to agree to the U.S.-proposed ceasefire with Ukraine but then followed up with a list of demands that Kyiv and Washington must accommodate in order for Moscow to proceed with peace talks. The topic of a potential ceasefire is first on the list of the upcoming Trump-Putin phone call scheduled for March 18. Meanwhile, both Ukraine and Russia have experienced problems with manpower and equipment. Russia has been on the offensive in Donetsk Oblast since 2023, with its advance bogging down over the past month and Ukrainian troops even making gains near the towns of Toretsk and Pokrovsk. Ukraine, however, has faced setbacks in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, losing the key town of Sudzha and withdrawing closer to the border. Peter Layton, a military expert at the Royal United Services Institute, said that &quot;both sides would try to rearm during a ceasefire and rush supplies forward to the front line.&quot; Federico Borsari, a defense expert at the Center for European Policy Analysis, also argued that &quot;the ceasefire would be beneficial for both sides, given the issues and problems both Ukrainian and Russian forces face.&quot; However, Ukraine would still gain a bit more from a potential ceasefire. Borsari said that a ceasefire &quot;will allow much-needed (Ukrainian) unit rotations in key sectors of the front line (Sumy-Kursk, Lyman, etc), train new forces, strengthen defenses, and resupply units along the front lines.&quot; Ukrainian military vehicles driving past the border crossing point into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast from neighboring Sumy Oblast, Ukraine on Aug. 13, 2024. (Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)&quot;Ukraine was suffering from Russia&apos;s manpower advantages, especially in Kursk (Oblast), and as the two sides seem to be on a relative technological parity in the use of tactical drones, a ceasefire gives Ukraine time to carefully assess the situation on the front line, establish more anti-drone countermeasures, and train new forces,&quot; he added. &quot;Russia was advancing in Kursk (Oblast), so a ceasefire may be detrimental to any potential attempt to advance in (bordering) Sumy (Oblast) by exploiting Ukrainian vulnerabilities in that localized area.&quot; Meanwhile, Bruchmann said that &quot;there is an overriding political imperative, so the ceasefire approval in principle is good for Ukraine as it reinvigorates the U.S.-Ukraine weapons and intelligence partnership.&quot; &quot;Everything else pales in comparison,&quot; he added. But in some areas of the front a ceasefire could favor Russia more than Ukraine at the moment. &quot;In recent days, Ukrainian forces have managed to regain sizeable chunks of territory near Toretsk while also stopping Russian advances southwest of Pokrovsk,&quot; Borsari argued. &quot;Russian forces in these areas were becoming overstretched and lacked sufficient mechanized support to continue their assaults. A ceasefire, therefore, would be more beneficial for Russia in this specific sector.&quot; Meanwhile, Ukraine would clearly benefit from a halt in Russia&apos;s air assaults and bombardments, analysts say. Russia has been attacking Ukraine&apos;s entire territory with drones and missiles on a daily basis. As a result, a large part of Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed. Ukraine has retaliated, striking deep into Russia with drones of its own making and attacking border regions with foreign-provided missiles. Although Ukraine has caused damage to refineries, ammunition depots, and troops, the impact has been less devastating than that of Russian attacks on Ukraine. The foreign-provided missiles are also running out. &quot;While Ukraine&apos;s long-range strike campaign against Russian bases and infrastructure has had some significant effects, especially in forcing Russian forces to distribute their assets in less efficient ways, it is undeniable that the impact of Russia&apos;s long-range strike campaign on Ukrainian society, industry, and the military has been greater,&quot; Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute, told the Kyiv Independent.

(Vlada Liberova/Libkos/Getty Images)&quot;This is due to the far greater strike weight, especially in terms of heavier cruise and ballistic missiles, that Russian forces can generate. Therefore, any ceasefire agreement covering long-range strikes and aerial glide bomb attacks would almost certainly be more advantageous for Ukraine than for Russia &#x2014; assuming all other factors remain equal.&quot; Borsari argued that &quot;Ukraine would be able to significantly replenish its air-defense interceptors stocks and repair critical energy infrastructure, though Russia can also restock its missile arsenal for newer attacks.&quot; Erik Stijnman, a military expert at the Netherlands Institute of International Relations (Clingendael), said that &quot;both air forces do not have air superiority, let alone air supremacy over the contested battlespace.&quot; &quot;Removing the glide bomb out of the equation will probably benefit the Ukrainians a bit more,&quot; he added. &quot;Although enforcing a ceasefire for air assets should be achievable, restricting or enforcing the use of drones is very difficult, as it is to attribute the use of drones to one of the parties.&quot; However, Russia could also need a respite from Ukrainian drone attacks. &quot;What Ukraine&apos;s strike campaign has done is to significantly drive up the costs of aggression for Russia,&quot; Fabian Hoffman, a defense policy expert at the Oslo Nuclear Project, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The effectiveness of the strike campaigns has varied on both sides, so has their impact. At times, Ukraine&apos;s campaign was likely more effective, while at other times Russia&apos;s was.&quot; In the Black Sea, meanwhile, the ceasefire would give Russia some breathing room. Ukraine has successfully targeted Russian warships with drones and missiles, pushing them out of large parts of the Black Sea. One of Ukraine&apos;s most spectacular successes was the sinking of Russia&apos;s flagship cruiser Moskva in 2022. Ukraine&apos;s victories have allowed it to launch a corridor in the Black Sea in 2023 to ship its grain and other agricultural products. Bruchmann said that &quot;on the seas, (a ceasefire) might favor Russia slightly.&quot; &quot;I think the Russians failed to seize the initiative in the Black Sea for some time,&quot; he said. &quot;Their navy is boxed in and did not find a solution against Ukrainian unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), which seem to have become more lethal and versatile.&quot; Meanwhile, Borsari said that &quot;overall, the ceasefire would not bring any significant change in the Black Sea.&quot; &quot;In the Black Sea, we have seen a progressive decrease in Ukrainian attacks against Russian naval assets due to Russia&apos;s adaptation and decision to move most of its assets further away and outside the reach of Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missiles,&quot; he added. &quot;Ukraine has used USVs and motherships with first-person view drones (FPVs) to destroy a few valuable air-defense systems.&quot; Stijnman said that &quot;looking at operational advantages, a ceasefire on the sea will probably be the easiest to enforce, allowing the unhindered use of sealines of communications.&quot; A Ukrainian Maritime Guard inspection group prepares to board a cargo ship in the northwestern Black Sea on Dec. 18, 2023, amid the Russian invasion. (Anatolii Stepanov/AFP via Getty Images)&quot;This would benefit both parties, but probably Ukraine more, as it has access to one route,&quot; he added. The prospects for a ceasefire at sea, in the air, and on land remain unclear, but both Ukraine and Russia could see it as an opportunity. &quot;Both parties will need to prepare for the next phase, whatever it will be,&quot; Stijnman said. &quot;The advent of ceasefire negotiations, ceasefires, and peace negotiations will create a window of opportunity to (re)gain a more advantageous position over the other (side), either in a defensive, offensive, or stabilizing operation framework.&quot; &quot;The difficulty with any ceasefire, however, is that all parties are unsure to what extent the other party will commit to the agreements made,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/is-a-potential-ceasefire-more-beneficial-for-russia-or-ukraine/	2025-03-17T11:29:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202285720.jpg
EU plan to send over $40 billion in military aid has 'broad political support,' Kallas says	The initiative to provide Ukraine with 40 billion euros ($43.6 billion) in military aid has &quot;broad political support&quot; among EU member states, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said on March 17 before the Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in Brussels. EU diplomats reportedly suggested doubling military aid for Ukraine as the Trump administration&apos;s steps cast doubt on its commitment to Kyiv&apos;s security. Some member states have reacted cautiously to the initiative, according to Reuters. Kallas refuted these claims, saying there is &quot;a broad political support,&quot; but &quot;a lot of details need to be worked out.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s important that the &#x421;ouncil said that we need to move swiftly, and that is what we are doing,&quot; Kallas said. The EU foreign policy chief also added that the initiative will be discussed during a separate meeting involving EU defense ministers, which is scheduled on April 2-3 in Warsaw, Poland. Hungary&apos;s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto previously denounced EU plans to provide Ukraine with additional aid. &quot;We won&apos;t be dragged into this; we will not allow Hungarian taxpayers&apos; money to be used to finance arms shipments to Ukraine,&quot; Szijjarto said, insisting instead that Budapest supports peace negotiations. Hungary&apos;s leader, Viktor Orban, has consistently obstructed and delayed sanctions against Russia and military support for Kyiv. He has also lauded U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s reelection, expressing expectations of a quick end to the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/theres-broad-political-support-kallas-on-eu-plan-to-provide-over-40-billion-in-military-aid-to-ukraine/	2025-03-17T11:01:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/DSC07680.jpg
Russia claims capture of Stepove in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine denies	The Russian Defense Ministry claimed Russian forces captured the Ukrainian village of Stepove in Zaporizhzhia Oblast on March 17. Ukraine&apos;s Southern Defense Forces spokesperson Vladyslav Voloshyn denied the statement. Stepove, with a pre-war population of 118 people, is located 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the villages of Pyatykhatky and Mali Shcherbaky in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. All three settlements were under Russian occupation in 2022 and 2023. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that its military had taken control of Stepove. However, Voloshyn told the Kyiv Independent that Ukrainian forces did not lose ground in the Zaporizhzhia sector of the front line. The DeepState monitoring group map, as of March 17, 2025, in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)&quot;This is a method of information warfare &#x2014; the enemy claims that it is there before it has entered. I do not confirm the information that Russia entered the settlements of Stepove, Mali Shcherbaky, or Shcherbaky and took them under control,&quot; Voloshyn said. &quot;Fierce fighting continues in this area. The enemy is trying to change the configuration of the combat line in its favor. In total, six combat engagements were registered in the Orikhiv sector over the last day. The day before yesterday, there were 19,&quot; Voloshyn added. According to Voloshyn, since March, Russian forces have intensified their assaults in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Since the beginning of spring, there have been over 130 clashes in the Orikhiv sector alone. The Ukrainian military warned in fall 2024 that Russian forces were ammassing in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in preparation for a southern offensive. Heavy fortifications were constructed around the regional capital of Zaporizhzhia ahead of the possible invasion. The area near Stepove was the main axis of Ukraine&apos;s southern counteroffensive in 2023, which led to the liberation of the settlement of Robotyne but achieved no major breakthrough.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-to-capture-stepove-in-zaporizhzhia-oblast-ukraine-denies/	2025-03-17T09:31:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1706074000.jpg
EU foreign ministers to discuss US withdrawal of funding for RFE/RL	EU foreign ministers are set to discuss the termination of the U.S. grant that funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) during a meeting in Brussels on March 17, according to a Kyiv Independent reporter in Brussels. The news follows U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s executive order on March 14 to eliminate seven federal agencies, including the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees RFE/RL and Voice of America (VoA). As a result of Trump&#x2019;s decision, the congressionally authorized grant that funded RFE/RL has been terminated. Before the ministerial meeting in Brussels, Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky emphasized the importance of RFE/RL and VoA&apos;s work, calling them a &quot;beacon&quot; for people living in countries under authoritarianism. &quot;Do we see value in such an organization, broadcasting to countries like Russia, Belarus, Iran, and many others? And if we see such value, what are we willing to do to keep such a service in our favor?&quot; Lipavsky said, adding that the Czech Republic has hosted Radio Liberty&apos;s headquarters in Prague for almost three decades. Czech officials also circulated among their EU colleagues a draft statement seen by RFE/RL expressing grave concerns about the situation with RFE/RL&apos;s funding. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski confirmed that the EU is considering options to help the media after the U.S. funding cutoff, according to a Kyiv Independent reporter in Brussels. &quot;We are at the stage of brainstorming, but clearly, these are worthy institutions whose mission should continue,&quot; Sikorski said. Trump has long criticized U.S.-funded media organizations, criticizing them over their coverage of the U.S. president, and often referring to them as &quot;fake news.&quot; The Trump administration has previously cut thousands of federally-funded positions, with the cuts directly impacting support for Ukraine. In February, the Trump administration terminated the employment of top officials from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) after they attempted to prevent representatives from Elon Musk&apos;s DOGE from accessing restricted areas.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-to-discuss-us-governments-withdrawal-of-funding-for-rfe-rl/	2025-03-17T08:04:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/lipavsky.jpg
Germany's military rebirth is Europe’s best bet against Putin	When Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, he knew that he was upending Europe&#x2019;s security order. But this was more of a tactical gambit than a calculated strategy, and he could not have predicted what would follow. Though U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s return to the White House has caught Europe flat-footed, it can still keep Putin from walking away a winner. For now, Putin seems to hold all the cards. The transatlantic relationship is fracturing, as Trump&#x2019;s isolationist administration criticizes its European allies and casts doubt on his commitment to NATO. Worse, Trump appears to be aligning the United States with Russia in the Ukraine war. While he has threatened to impose new sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and peace deal are reached, he has blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for the fighting and suspended military aid and intelligence. But Europe still has a chance to turn things around. Already, it is abandoning its post-Cold War &#x201C;end of history&#x201D; mindset, according to which international law reigned supreme, European militaries were for keeping peace, not fighting wars, and the U.S. could be counted on to safeguard Europe&#x2019;s security. Finland and Sweden were perhaps the first to realize that &#x201C;history is back,&#x201D; and their accession to NATO &#x2014; in 2023 and 2024, respectively &#x2014; provided a major boost to the Alliance&#x2019;s northern flank. Now the European Union also appears to be coming to terms with its new security situation, having just announced an $840 billion rearmament plan. Even Germany, for which the return of history is particularly fraught, is preparing to rearm: incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz and his likely coalition partners have agreed to create a 500 billion euro ($544 billion) infrastructure fund and loosen fiscal rules to allow for greater investment in defense. The significance of this move should not be underestimated. Since the end of World War II, Germany has eschewed hard power in favor of the soft kind, serving as an engine of European integration and a bulwark of the rules-based world order. Beginning in the 1960s, this included the pursuit of &#x201C;constructive engagement&#x201D; &#x2014; a foreign-policy approach known as Ostpolitik &#x2014; with the Soviet Union and then Russia. This explains former Chancellor Angela Merkel&#x2019;s embrace of Russian energy supplies, despite the objections of other EU members and the U.S. Then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel (L) greets Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) at a summit on Libya at the German Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, on Jan. 19, 2020. (Adam Berry/Getty Images)Putin&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine drove a stake through the heart of Ostpolitik. Within days, Merkel&#x2019;s successor, Olaf Scholz, announced an &#x201C;epochal change&#x201D; (&quot;Zeitenwende&quot;) in Germany&#x2019;s defense and foreign policy. But it is Merz who is set to oversee a true break from Germany&#x2019;s postwar past &#x2014; a change that will require the country to confront the most daunting, destructive ghosts of its history. For starters, there is the fiscal revolution. Germany&#x2019;s frugality has been a source of considerable tension in the EU, particularly during the eurozone debt crisis of the early 2010s. But Germans &#x2014; not least Merkel &#x2014; recalled all too well how hyperinflation had paved the way for the rise of Adolf Hitler, and in 2009 Merkel&#x2019;s first government introduced a constitutional restriction on structural budget deficits to 0.35% of GDP annually, also known as the &#x201C;debt brake&#x201D; (&quot;Schuldenbremse&quot;). Against this backdrop, Merz&#x2019;s planned overhaul of borrowing rules &#x2014; including the modification and possible elimination of the debt brake &#x2014; represents a radical change in Germany&#x2019;s priorities. More broadly, Merz appears prepared to embrace European leadership. Despite being the EU&#x2019;s largest economy, Germany has long been reluctant to assume a genuine leadership role in Europe, particularly in the security domain. The combination of Russian revanchism and U.S. isolationism, however, has made this stance untenable. As Europe&#x2019;s most populous country, situated in the continent&#x2019;s &#x201C;geostrategic center,&#x201D; Merz says, Germany must &#x201C;take greater responsibility for leadership&#x201D; on defense. To avoid a repeat of the Munich Agreement of 1938 &#x2014; when France and Britain forced Czechoslovakia to cede territory to Hitler, setting the stage for World War II &#x2014; Europe must step up quickly to improve Ukraine&#x2019;s position on the battlefield and, thus, at the negotiating table. Fortunately, substituting lost U.S. financial aid will not be as difficult as Trump would have us believe: to date, Europe has provided far more support for Ukraine&#x2019;s war effort in dollar terms than the U.S. has. Fulfilling the weapons gap would, however, be far more challenging and probably impossible in the all-important short term. Once a peace agreement is reached, Europe will have to act as its guarantor &#x2014; and that means delivering effective deterrence against Russian aggression. A credible nuclear umbrella is essential. That is why Merz has suggested replacing U.S. nuclear warheads in Europe with French and British alternatives. There is even talk of Germany becoming a nuclear power itself. When NATO intervened in the Kosovo War in 1999, Germany&#x2019;s then-chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, ruled that sending ground troops to fight in a country that had once been occupied by Hitler&#x2019;s &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; was &#x201C;unthinkable.&#x201D; Today, as Merz seems to recognize, the unthinkable has become necessary. Only if Germany &#x2014; and Europe as a whole &#x2014; puts aside its moral and political inhibitions can it continue to perform its most important role: as a global force for peace and a defender of democratic principles.

Lithuania suspects Russia behind arson attacks in Vilnius and Warsaw last year	Lithuanian authorities suspect Russia&apos;s intelligence services of orchestrating arson attacks on an IKEA warehouse in Vilnius and a shopping center in Warsaw in 2024, the LRT broadcaster reported on March 17. A fire broke out at the IKEA warehouse in Vilnius on May 9, 2024, causing an estimated 500,000 euros ($545,000) in damages. Investigators consider the incident a terrorist act and claim two Ukrainian citizens, allegedly recruited by Russian security services, were responsible. One suspect is a minor. Saulius Briginas, deputy head of the Lithuanian Criminal Bureau, said the fire could have destroyed the entire shopping center if not for the quick response of staff and firefighters. On May 12, 2024, a massive fire destroyed a shopping center in Warsaw with 1,400 stores. The incident has also been linked to Russian intelligence services. Arson attacks have also targeted other EU countries, raising suspicions of a coordinated Russian effort to destabilize the countries that support Ukraine against Russian aggression. The Lithuanian prosecutor&apos;s office alleges that Russia&apos;s military intelligence (GRU) formed a special group to carry out arson attacks across Lithuania, Poland, and Latvia. Polish authorities are jointly investigating, with one suspect detained in Poland. &quot;Dear allies, the Lithuanian prosecutor&apos;s investigation confirmed our suspicions that Russian secret services were behind the fires in Vilnius and Warsaw,&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk posted on X. &quot;Good to know before negotiations. Such is the nature of this state,&quot; he added, alluding to expected peace talks that the Trump administration seeks to broker between Kyiv and Moscow. Tensions between NATO and Russia have risen following Moscow&apos;s all-out attack against Ukraine. Western leaders and intelligence agencies have warned of a potential large-scale war in Europe within the next five years, citing Russia&apos;s increasingly aggressive posture. Moscow has denied involvement or refrained from commenting on the sabotage incidents.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-suspects-russias-military-intelligence-behind-arson-attacks/	2025-03-17T07:25:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2152042801.jpg
Seoul, Kyiv discuss transfer of North Korean POWs to South Korea	Ukraine is negotiating with South Korea to hand over two North Korean soldiers taken prisoner by Kyiv, South Korea&apos;s Yonhap news agency reported on March 17. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and his Ukrainian counterpart Andrii Sybiha discussed the potential transfer of the North Korean prisoners of war (POWs) in a phone call. Cho noted that under South Korea&apos;s Constitution, North Koreans are considered South Korean citizens, but the prisoners must express a desire to relocate. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast last fall to counter Ukraine&apos;s cross-border incursion launched in August 2024. Ukrainian troops captured two North Korean soldiers as POWs on Jan. 11. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously reported that North Korean forces fighting for Russia had suffered 4,000 casualties, with two-thirds of the losses being soldiers killed. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, attributed the high losses to North Korea&apos;s lack of combat experience and its use of human wave attacks with limited equipment.	https://kyivindependent.com/south-korea-ukraine-discuss-transfer-of-north-korean-pows/	2025-03-17T06:36:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2192716379.jpg
Anna Maksymenko wins Ukraine's first Grand Prix fencing gold since 2020	Ukrainian fencer Anna Maksymenko, 17, secured her first career gold medal at the Budapest Epee Grand Prix on March 16. This marks Ukraine&apos;s first Grand Prix victory in fencing since 2020 when Olha Kharlan won gold in saber in Montreal. It is also the first gold in epee competitions since 2013. Maksymenko defeated Canada&apos;s Leonora MacKinnon 15:9 in the semifinals, setting up a final match against Italy&apos;s Giulia Rizzi, a Paris 2024 Olympic team champion. The final was tightly contested, with Maksymenko trailing 9:11 in the last period. However, she equalized with 30 seconds left and then executed a decisive counterattack to win 12:11. The victory marks Maksymenko&apos;s first individual Grand Prix medal, adding to her previous silver in a team event at the World Cup level. On March 9, Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh claimed the gold medal at the European Athletics Indoor Championships in Apeldoorn, Netherlands.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-fencer-anna-maksymenko-wins-first-career-gold-at-budapest-epee-grand-prix/	2025-03-17T06:02:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/480967641_1271575851193556_3934336492471747526_n-2.jpg
Vucic vows to 'protect' Serbia from repeat of Ukraine's EuroMaidan	Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on March 16 drew comparisons between the ongoing anti-government protests in Serbia and Ukraine&apos;s 2014 EuroMaidan Revolution, vowing to &quot;protect and defend&quot; the country from such an event. His comments followed a massive rally in Belgrade on March 15, culminating months of near-daily protests against corruption and misgovernance, posing the most significant challenge to Vucic&apos;s 13-year rule. Vucic accused protest organizers of spreading misinformation, including claims that authorities had shut down the internet and used sonic cannons against demonstrators. &quot;Then they came up with a story about a sonic cannon... but the army does not have such weapons,&quot; Vucic said in a video address published on social media, insisting that what was shown was an anti-drone rifle, not a crowd-control device. Vucic compared the accusations to those made against ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych during the EuroMaidan protests, which saw over 100 demonstrators killed before Yanukovych fled to Russia in 2014. &quot;That&apos;s how they started talking here: &apos;Vucic, you shot at your own people,&apos;&quot; the Serbian president said. &quot;There were no wounded; nothing happened to anyone, but they have to come up with something.&quot; The protests erupted in November following the deadly collapse of a newly reconstructed train station roof in Novi Sad, which killed 15 people. The reconstruction, financed with Chinese and state funds, was widely viewed as corrupt. Student-led demonstrations quickly grew into broader anti-government protests, demanding accountability and an end to corruption. Vucic, who maintains close ties with Moscow, has frequently used Kremlin-style rhetoric to discredit protests. The Serbian opposition, along with student activists, has accused authorities of deploying a sound cannon against demonstrators during a silent vigil for the Novi Sad victims, with footage of people fleeing after a loud blast circulating on social media. The Serbian president vowed an investigation into what he called &quot;brutal fabrications and lies&quot; and warned that those responsible would be prosecuted.	https://kyivindependent.com/serbias-vucic-vows-to-protect-and-defend-country-from-euromaidan-like-protests/	2025-03-17T05:45:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204766554--1-.jpg
Germany delivers Gepard air defenses, shells, drones, other aid to Ukraine	Germany has provided three Gepard anti-aircraft systems with 10,000 rounds of ammunition, 24 mine protection vehicles, and other defense aid to Ukraine in its latest round of aid deliveries announced on March 17. Berlin is Ukraine&apos;s largest military donor in Europe, second only to the U.S. in terms of defense assistance provided. The new delivery included 5,000 155 mm artillery shells, 2,000 122 mm shells, 8,000 120 mm mortar shells, and ammunition for Leopard 1 tanks, Marder infantry fighting vehicles, and IRIS-T air defense systems. Ukraine has also received fresh support in unmanned systems, including 50 Vector reconnaissance drones, 30 Gereon RCS tracked drones, and 30 drone detection systems. The latest tranche further included small arms, first aid kits, demining equipment, and border protection equipment. Germany initially allocated around 4 billion euros ($4.36 billion) in defense assistance to Ukraine in 2025. Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz held up an additional 3 billion euros ($3.27 billion) proposed by his coalition partners, but his incoming successor, Friedrich Merz, pledged to push the package through.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-delivers-gepard-air-defenses-shells-drones-other-aid-to-ukraine/	2025-03-17T05:27:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1242704312.jpg
Kyiv reportedly extraditing German suspected of rape who fought for Ukraine	Ukraine is extraditing a German citizen who fought in Ukraine&apos;s Defense Forces and is suspected of rape and other crimes, the BBC and Suspilne reported on March 17, citing sources in the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. Ben R. is suspected of rape in Germany and Ukraine and of possession and distribution of images of sexual violence, including with children, according to the BBC. The German citizen reportedly fought for Ukraine between 2022 and 2024. German prosecutors requested his extradition twice in late 2023, but Ukrainian authorities took the step only a year later, in December 2024. Ben R. was reportedly arrested in Sumy Oblast a month later and left Ukraine via the Polish border on March 17 to stand trial in Germany, the BBC reported. Ben. R reportedly appealed the decision twice, but both times with procedural violations, leading to the court rejecting the appeals. German prosecutors allegedly possess video evidence of Ben R. raping women, including two Ukrainians, one of whom is a minor. Both of them confirmed this during a pre-trial investigation by Ukrainian prosecutors, though the underage girl later withdrew her testimony. The suspected rape of a minor remains under investigation. Mehr als zwei Jahre lang hat sich Ben R. den deutschen Strafverfolgern in der Ukraine entzogen, nun wurde der fr&#xFC;here Bundeswehrsoldat in der Region Sumy festgenommen. Er soll nach Deutschland ausgeliefert werden.https://t.co/AfvBi9hfMq Ben R. officially served in the International Legion of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) but also carried out tasks for combat units of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the BBC reported after receiving confirmation from both agencies. According to the outlet&apos;s sources, Ben R. took part in the battle of Bakhmut. The International Legion is divided into two units, one under the military intelligence agency and the other under the Armed Forces. Citizens from over 50 countries have joined the unit since the start of the full-scale invasion, including military veterans from the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, Europe, and beyond, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence said. Initially lauded as a PR success, it soon became marred by scandals and stories about misconduct. Prior to his service in Ukraine, Ben R. served in the German military but was banned from performing military service in March 2022 and officially discharged a year later following a probe by German military prosecutors, the German newspaper Spiegel reported. Foreigners with criminal records cannot serve in Ukraine&apos;s defense forces. Last year, Ukraine extradited Craig Lang, a U.S. citizen who fought for Ukraine but was wanted in his homeland on murder, robbery, and other charges.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-reportedly-extradite-german-suspected-of-rape/	2025-03-17T05:01:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1738887156.jpg
Rubio asked Hungary not to block EU sanctions, Politico reports	Hungary has dropped its threat to block the extension of EU sanctions against Russia following a conversation between Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Politico reported on March 17, citing undisclosed sources. In January, Budapest said it plans to veto the sanctions renewal, citing U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s return to the White House and the possibility of a shift in U.S. policy toward Russia. Since then, Trump has warned Russia of additional sanctions and trade measures unless it agrees to peace talks in Ukraine. According to two Politico sources, Rubio urged Szijjarto to refrain from undermining the EU sanctions system, contributing to Budapest&apos;s decision to support the measures. The outlet nevertheless notes that Trump could alter his approach at any time by offering to ease sanctions as part of negotiations with Russia. If that happens, the EU could lose leverage over Hungary, which has repeatedly used its veto power to extract concessions from Brussels. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, widely considered the EU&apos;s most Russian-friendly leader, has consistently opposed military aid for Ukraine and warned that Ukraine&apos;s EU accession would &quot;destroy&quot; Hungary. Orban has maintained close ties with Russia despite its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The EU&apos;s sanctions framework includes economic measures and restrictions on over 2,400 individuals and entities linked to Russia. Since sanctions must be extended unanimously, a Hungarian veto could force the EU to negotiate new compromises or risk a lapse in enforcement.	https://kyivindependent.com/budapest-backs-down-on-eu-sanctions-veto-following-szijjarto-rubio-conversation-politico-reports/	2025-03-17T04:11:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202699955.jpg
EU approves third $3.8 billion tranche for Kyiv under Ukraine Facility program	Ukraine will receive 3.5 billion euros ($3.8 billion) after the Council of the EU approved the third installment of non-refundable grants and loans under the Ukraine Facility program, the Council announced on March 17. With this disbursement, Ukraine will have received nearly 20 billion euros ($21.7 billion) under the Ukraine Facility since the program was launched in early 2024. &quot;The Council concluded today that Ukraine had satisfied the necessary conditions laid down in the Ukraine Plan in order to receive a third disbursement from the Ukraine Facility,&quot; the statement reads. The Ukraine Plan outlines Kyiv&apos;s strategy for recovery, reconstruction, and modernization and a reform timetable as part of Ukraine&apos;s EU accession process over the next four years. To qualify for this funding, Ukraine implemented 13 key reforms, including measures to boost renewable energy, strengthen the independence of the energy regulator, and streamline border-crossing procedures in line with EU standards. The EU approved the four-year Ukraine Facility in February 2024, allocating 33 billion euros ($36 billion) in loans and 17 billion euros ($18 billion) in grants to support Ukraine&apos;s economy and reconstruction efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-approves-third-3-8-billion-tranche-for-kyiv-under-ukraine-facility-program/	2025-03-17T03:41:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/EUparl.jpg
Zelensky signs law permitting Ukrainian troops to operate abroad during martial law	President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed a law allowing Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces to be sent abroad during martial law, according to an official decree published on March 17. The law aims to enhance defense cooperation with partner nations, particularly by enabling Ukrainian forces to participate in training and receive military equipment, lawmaker Oleksii Honcharenko explained. &quot;This will allow us to attract international support to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s defense faster and more effectively,&quot; Honcharenko posted on Telegram. The legislation permits Ukrainian military units to be deployed to other countries for national security purposes, including repelling armed aggression, protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity, and exercising the right to self-defense under international law. The law does not concern the deployment of Ukrainian troops for combat operations on Russian territory. The decision to send military personnel abroad will be made by the president but requires approval from the Verkhovna Rada, the country&apos;s parliament. Deployments will be subject to a formal request detailing the mission&apos;s objectives, troop numbers, weaponry, and the conditions of their stay abroad. Zelensky vetoed the bill in January and returned it to parliament with amendments clarifying the decision-making process and ensuring compliance with international law. Lawmakers approved the revised version in late February.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-signs-law-permitting-ukrainian-troops-to-operate-abroad-during-martial-law/	2025-03-17T03:21:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/photo_2024-01-29_14-15-42.jpg
Territorial integrity, military size, alliances — FM Sybiha sets 3 'fundamentals' for potential peace talks	Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha outlined three key conditions for future negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine in an interview with RBC-Ukraine published on March 17. &quot;I don&apos;t like this definition (red lines). There are fundamental things that are non-negotiable, that cannot be touched upon,&quot; Sybiha said when asked what Ukraine&apos;s red lines are in potential talks. Sybiha stressed that Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity and sovereignty are non-negotiable, reaffirming that Kyiv will never recognize Russian-occupied territories as part of Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky voiced this stance back on March 12. Despite this, the Trump administration has suggested that Kyiv and Moscow must compromise on a peace deal, calling Ukraine&apos;s goal of restoring its pre-2014 borders &quot;unrealistic.&quot; Russian forces currently occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine, where reports of systematic repression, torture, and forced deportations continue to emerge. According to Sybiha, the second key condition is Ukraine&apos;s right to choose its alliances. He emphasized that no country should have a veto over Ukraine&apos;s NATO and EU aspirations. Kyiv officially applied to join NATO in September 2022, and in 2024, the alliance declared Ukraine&apos;s path to membership &quot;irreversible,&quot; though no formal invitation has been extended. Sybiha also underscored that Ukraine&apos;s ability to defend itself must remain unrestricted, meaning there can be no restrictions on the Ukrainian Armed Forces. &quot;Russia must be held accountable. These are all elements of a lasting peace,&quot; he said. On March 13, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was willing to accept a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire but demanded guarantees that Kyiv would halt mobilization, military training, and foreign aid deliveries &#x2014; conditions that could leave Ukraine vulnerable to renewed aggression. U.S. President Donald Trump is set to speak with Putin on March 18 to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. While Trump seeks to secure a deal, European allies and Ukraine warn that a rushed agreement without security guarantees may fail to ensure lasting peace.	https://kyivindependent.com/sybiha-on-negotiations/	2025-03-17T03:12:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170361277.jpg
Georgia sentences ex-President Saakashvili to additional 4.5 years over illegal border crossing	A court in Georgia has sentenced former President Mikheil Saakashvili to an additional four and a half years in prison on illegal border crossing charges, Georgian TV channel Mtavari reported on March 17. The latest ruling follows a nine-year sentence issued last week on large-scale state funds embezzlement charges, adding up to almost 12 additional years in prison for Saakashvili. The border crossing case concerns Saakashvili&apos;s secret return from Ukraine to Georgia on Sept. 29, 2021, despite being wanted by Georgian authorities. He was arrested on Oct. 1, 2021. Four others were charged in separate proceedings over Saakashvili&apos;s illegal entry and released on bail. Saakashvili, who served as Georgia&apos;s president from 2004-2007 and to 2008-2013, sought to align the country with the West but lost elections to the Moscow-friendly Georgian Dream party years after a defeat in the 2008 Russia-Georgia war. A longtime critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Saakashvili has accused billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, the honorary chairman of the Georgian Dream, of orchestrating his prosecution on Moscow&apos;s orders. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled last May that there were no grounds to believe that Saakashvili&apos;s criminal proceedings were unfair. Since Georgia follows the principle of sentence absorption, Saakashvili&apos;s earliest release date would be October 2030, considering his time in custody. Saakashvili, who holds Ukrainian citizenship and previously served as the governor of Odesa Oblast, has faced worsening health conditions during his custody. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in February 2023 that the &quot;Georgian government is killing&quot; Saakashvili after images surfaced showing his significant weight loss. The ruling follows mass protests in Tbilisi over Georgia&apos;s disputed October elections, which saw the Kremlin-friendly Georgian Dream party retain power. The crisis deepened after Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced that Georgia&apos;s EU integration could be delayed until 2028.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-court-sentences-ex-president-saakashvili-to-4-5-years-for-illegal-border-crossing/	2025-03-17T02:55:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1748648446.jpg
We won't be dragged into this' — Hungary opposes $22 billion EU aid package for Ukraine	Hungary&apos;s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on March 17 denounced EU plans to provide Ukraine with an additional 20 billion euros ($22 billion) in aid, a step allegedly on the agenda of a ministerial meeting in Brussels later the same day. &quot;We won&apos;t be dragged into this; we will not allow Hungarian taxpayers&apos; money to be used to finance arms shipments to Ukraine,&quot; Szijjarto said on Facebook, insisting instead that Budapest supports peace negotiations. European leaders have been calling for ramped-up support for Ukraine as the Trump administration&apos;s steps cast doubt on its commitment to Kyiv&apos;s security. U.S. President Donald Trump has been pushing for a swift peace settlement, temporarily cutting off military and intelligence backing for Ukraine to push it to the negotiating table. &quot;Thanks to President Trump, the hope of peace has never been closer in the past three years, which is why Brussels&apos;s intention to make peace negotiations impossible is unacceptable,&quot; Szijjarto said. &quot;In Brussels, the pro-war stance still prevails.&quot; Discussions about a possible 20-billion-euro package first emerged in February, but the assistance tranche was not included in the conclusions of an emergency EU summit on March 6. Hungary&apos;s leader, Viktor Orban, has consistently obstructed and delayed sanctions against Russia and military support for Kyiv. He has also lauded Trump&apos;s reelection, expressing expectations of a quick end to the war. While the EU recently managed to negotiate a unanimous extension of sanctions against Russia, European leaders grow increasingly concerned by Budapest&apos;s efforts to derail unity on Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-vows-to-oppose-22-billion-eu-aid-package-for-ukraine/	2025-03-17T02:43:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1258722653.jpg
Russia sanctions could be eased in exchange for security, justice for Ukraine, Ukrainian official says	Western sanctions against Russia could be eventually relaxed if the step ensures security and justice for Ukraine, top Ukrainian sanctions official Vladyslav Vlasiuk told Politico in an interview published on March 17. The U.S., the EU, and other international partners have imposed heavy sanctions against Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, aiming to undermine its ability to wage war. Vlasiuk said that easing the economic restrictions imposed on Russia is &quot;a matter of time,&quot; but stressed that it has to happen under the right conditions. He noted that sanctions are designed to push Russia to cease its aggression and commit to lasting peace rather than being a &quot;punishment of any kind.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened additional sanctions and tariffs on Russia while also temporarily cutting off military and intelligence support for Kyiv to push the two countries to peace talks. While saying it is premature to discuss what sanctions could be lifted, Vlasiuk added that Moscow is already asking to ease specific restrictions, indicating what hurts Russia the most. A lasting agreement with Russia would have to include justice and &quot;compensations for the Ukrainians&quot; for more than three years of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion, Vlasiuk noted. Western sanctions have primarily targeted Russia&apos;s energy sector, as oil and gas exports represent a major part of Moscow&apos;s war budget. The EU has sought to pivot away from Russian supplies, while the G7 imposed a trade cap on Russian seaborne crude oil. Over 460 international companies have exited Russia since February 2022, representing a loss of $6 billion in taxes paid to the Russian state, according to the Kyiv School of Economics. The Trump administration extended some of the sanctions but said that easing the restrictions would have to be part of an eventual peace deal. Last week, the U.S. did not extend an exemption allowing Russian banks to use U.S. payment systems for energy transactions, dealing another blow to Russia&apos;s oil industry.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-sanctions-could-be-eased-in-exchange-for-security-justice-for-ukraine-ukrainian-official-says/	2025-03-17T01:53:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1238830344.jpg
Russia open to civilian observers in Ukraine under possible peace deal	Russia is open to allowing unarmed observers and civilian missions in Ukraine as part of a potential peace deal, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said on March 16, according to state-owned news agency TASS. &quot;A peace treaty may provide for unarmed observers in Ukraine, a civilian mission to monitor the implementation of certain aspects of the agreement, or guarantee mechanisms,&quot; Grushko said. Kyiv has said that strong security guarantees are essential for any peace agreement. The deployment of international peacekeeping forces in Ukraine has been considered as one possible option. &quot;If we talk about a peaceful solution to the conflict in Ukraine, of course, it will have an external contour. We will demand that ironclad security guarantees be part of this agreement,&quot; Grushko said. The official reiterated that Russia sees Ukraine&apos;s &quot;neutrality&quot; and NATO non-membership as essential parts of any agreement. Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022. While the alliance declared in 2024 that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; no formal invitation has been extended. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 24 that Russian President Vladimir Putin would allow European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a deal, though Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has publicly rejected the idea. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer presented plans to send 10,000 peacekeeping troops to Ukraine during a high-level virtual summit in London on March 15, Sunday Times reported. French President Emmanuel Macron declared that Kyiv does not need Russia&apos;s approval to invite peacekeeping troops into its territory. Bloomberg reported on March 10 that Putin has set &quot;maximalist&quot; demands &#x2014; including territorial concessions, peacekeeper restrictions, and Ukraine&#x2019;s neutrality &#x2014; knowing they will likely be unacceptable to Kyiv and its Western allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-open-to-unarmed-observers-civilian-missions-in-ukraine-under-possible-peace-deal-deputy-fm-says/	2025-03-17T01:03:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203918696.jpg
3 killed, 12 injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least three civilians and injured at least 12 over the past day, regional authorities reported on March 17. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 90 of the 174 attack and decoy drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Seventy other decoy drones reportedly disappeared from radars without causing damage. Russian attacks in Donetsk Oblast killed one civilian in Myrnohrad and injured one in Siversk, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Five civilians were injured in Russian attacks against Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. An airstrike against the town of Kupiansk on March 16 reportedly injured a 57-year-old man and damaged 22 houses. In the village of Velyka Shapkivka, an airstrike started a fire and injured three women aged 56, 66, and 75 and a 66-year-old man, Syniehubov reported. One civilian was killed and three injured during Russian strikes in Kherson Oblast, according to the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. An apartment building and five houses were damaged. A drone attack against the Odesa district in Odesa Oblast injured a woman, damaged a kindergarten, a house, a shop, and a car, according to Governor Oleh Kiper. Damage to the energy grid left around 500 consumers in Odesa&apos;s suburbs without power, according to the statement. Russian attacks against Sumy Oblast killed one civilian and injured two, the regional military administration reported. One person was killed, and an apartment building was damaged during a mortar attack against the Seredyna-Buda community. Two injuries were reported in the Bilopillia and the Myropillia communities. Drone attacks against Poltava Oblast also led to emergency power outages, with almost 1,100 consumers left without electricity in the Kremenchuk district, Governor Volodymyr Kohut reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-133/	2025-03-17T00:30:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-17_09-16-38.jpg
Ukrainian drones attack fuel facility in Russia's Astrakhan Oblast, governor claims	Ukrainian drones attacked a fuel and energy facility in Russia&apos;s Astrakhan Oblast on March 17, causing a fire, regional governor Igor Babushkin claimed. &quot;Overnight, the Ukrainian Armed Forces again attempted a massive drone attack on facilities located in the region, including a fuel and energy complex,&quot; Babushkin claimed. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry said its forces had destroyed 13 drones over the oblast. Babushkin reported that fallen debris caused a fire at the facility, and one person was hospitalized. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Astrakhan Oblast is located in southwestern Russia and borders Kazakhstan. The city of Astrakhan is almost 800 kilometers (500 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. Ukraine has increasingly targeted Russia&apos;s energy and military infrastructure to disrupt Moscow&apos;s war effort. Overnight on March 14, Ukrainian drones struck the Tuapse oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai, igniting a gasoline storage tank. Kyiv has focused on hitting Russian refineries, oil depots, and defense industry sites, aiming to limit Moscow&apos;s ability to sustain its full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-strike-fuel-facility-in-russias-astrakhan-oblast-causing-fire-governor-says/	2025-03-17T00:14:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/backfire.jpg
US to withdraw from group investigating Russian leadership for crimes against Ukraine, NYT reports	The U.S. has privately told European officials that it is pulling back from an international group investigating Russian leaders for the crime of aggression committed against Ukraine, the New York Times reported on March 17, citing undisclosed sources. The move underscores the foreign policy shift in Washington as the Trump administration seeks to restore ties with Moscow while pushing for a swift peace deal in Ukraine. The decision is expected to be announced on March 17 in an email to the group&apos;s parent organization, the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust), the New York Times wrote. The Hague-based International Center for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine is a judicial hub supporting national investigations into the crime of aggression committed by the Russian leadership, including President Vladimir Putin, and Moscow&apos;s allies against Ukraine. While the group is made up of specialists from Ukraine, Poland, Romania, and the Baltic countries, the Biden administration appointed a special prosecutor to support the hub&apos;s activities in 2023. The Trump administration will also reduce the work of the U.S. Justice Department&apos;s War Crimes Accountability Team, which was launched in 2022 to investigate Russia for the atrocities it had committed during the full-scale invasion. Ukraine is investigating more than 150,000 possible war crimes committed by Russia as part of its all-out war, including the summary execution of prisoners and targeted aerial strikes against civilians. U.S. President Donald Trump has sought to mend the ties with Moscow in an effort to bring a swift end to the war while adopting a more antagonistic stance toward Ukraine and other partners. The U.S. has briefly halted military and intelligence support for Kyiv while also cutting key foreign aid supporting programs aimed at the prosecution of Russian war crimes and the restoration of Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure. On the international scene, the U.S. has sought to water down joint statements labeling Russia as the aggressor and the &quot;sole obstacle&quot; to peace.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-withdraw-from-group-investigating-putin-for-crimes-against-ukraine-nyt-reports/	2025-03-16T23:47:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/justice.jpeg
Trump plans to call Putin on March 18 to discuss war in Ukraine	U.S. President Donald Trump said he plans to have a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 18 to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported. &quot;I&apos;ll be speaking to President Putin on Tuesday. A lot of work&apos;s been done over the weekend,&quot; Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on March 17. The planned call follows U.S.-led negotiations in Saudi Arabia, where Washington proposed a 30-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. Kyiv accepted the deal during talks in Jeddah on March 11, prompting the U.S. to resume military and intelligence support for Ukraine. On March 13, Putin said Russia was also willing to accept the ceasefire but demanded guarantees that Ukraine would not mobilize troops, conduct training, or receive military assistance during the truce, making it potentially vulnerable to renewed Russian aggression. To discuss the proposal, U.S. Special Representative Steve Witkoff traveled to Moscow, where Putin reportedly signaled openness to the U.S. plan. &quot;We want to see if we can bring that war to an end. Maybe we can, maybe we can&apos;t, but I think we have a very good chance,&quot; Trump said. When asked about potential concessions in the ceasefire talks, Trump said discussions would include territorial matters and power plants. &quot;I think we have a lot of it already discussed very much by both sides, Ukraine and Russia. We&apos;re already talking about that, dividing up certain assets,&quot; Trump added. The expected phone call comes as Trump pushes to secure a deal, though European allies and Ukraine warn that a rushed agreement without security guarantees could fail to bring lasting peace.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-plans-call-with-putin-on-march-18-to-discuss-war-in-ukraine/	2025-03-16T23:39:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204976741-2.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 895,450 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 895,450 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on March 17. The number includes 1,210 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,344 tanks, 21,489 armored fighting vehicles, 40,785 vehicles and fuel tanks, 24,598 artillery systems, 1,318 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,104 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 29,467 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-895-450-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-03-16T23:10:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2003914665.jpg
Ukraine ceasefire faces battlefield challenges, envoy says	Steve Witkoff, Trump&#x2019;s special envoy to the Middle East, emphasized the challenges of implementing a ceasefire in Ukraine, citing the vast scale of the war. Witkoff paid a visit to Moscow on March 13 for talks on the 30-day ceasefire proposal that Ukraine had accepted after a U.S.-Ukrainian meeting in Saudi Arabia on March 11. &quot;A ceasefire involves how to get people to not be fighting with each other over a 2,000-kilometer border,&quot; he said on CBS News &quot;Face the Nation&quot; on March 16, noting the complexity of managing hostilities across such a large area. Witkoff pointed to key battlegrounds, including Kursk, and stressed the need to address strategic concerns like control over Ukraine&#x2019;s nuclear power infrastructure and access to Black Sea ports. &quot;There is a nuclear reactor that supplies quite a bit of electricity to the country of Ukraine. That&#x2019;s got to be dealt with,&quot; he said referring to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, adding that Russian objectives in specific regions must also be considered in negotiations. Europe&#x2019;s largest nuclear facility, the Zaporizhzhia plant in Enerhodar, has been under Russian occupation since 2022. Although still controlled by Russian forces, the plant is not currently producing electricity. Ukraine and its allies have consistently called for Russia to withdraw its troops from the site. Since the occupation began, the plant has been repeatedly disconnected from Ukraine&#x2019;s power grid due to Russian attacks on the country&#x2019;s energy infrastructure. Comparing the situation to the conflict in Gaza, Witkoff noted the differences in scope. &quot;Gaza is a finite, defined space, as compared to where the battle is being fought in Ukraine, Russia. So this is a much more complicated situation,&quot; he said. Despite these challenges, he insisted that no one is &quot;throwing their hands up in the air&quot; and that all stakeholders, including European partners, remain committed to seeking a resolution.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-ceasefire-faces-battlefield-challenges-envoy-says/	2025-03-16T22:27:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1927135939.jpg
Lviv airport could reopen by late spring, general director says	Lviv&#x2019;s Danylo Halytskyi International Airport may resume aviation operations as early as April or May, according to an optimistic scenario under government consideration, its general director told Vysokyi Zamok media outlet on March 15. Other potential dates for reopening Ukraine&#x2019;s airspace include the summer months. Five to seven airlines have expressed readiness to begin operations in Lviv within a month of the terminal&#x2019;s reopening, Tetiana Romanovska, General Director of Lviv Danylo Halytskyi International Airport said, adding that it could serve as a strong symbol of solidarity with Ukraine. Additionally, the government is considering reopening another airport in western Ukraine&apos;s Uzhhorod, located directly on the border with Slovakia and in close proximity to the borders of Hungary and Poland, all of which are NATO member countries. Romanovska confirmed that airlines such as Wizz Air, Air Baltic, Turkish Airlines, SkyUp, Austrian Airlines, Lufthansa, and LOT are prepared to operate from Lviv once flights resume. &quot;Right now, we are talking about restoring regular flights from Lviv,&quot; Romanovska said. &quot;SkyUp will likely take the lead in bringing back charter flights, as they have a well-developed route network in Europe and are ready to resume the same routes from Lviv or another Ukrainian city.&quot; Airlines have already begun preparations. &quot;This year, airline representatives have reached out to us, conducted their audits, and are analyzing the situation. Wizz Air completed its audit last year,&quot; Romanovska explained. She added that once a decision to reopen airspace is made, airline teams could arrive and begin operations within three to four days. &quot;We hope the airport will reopen in the summer period because that&#x2019;s when aviation traffic is at its highest&#x2014;during vacations, long daylight hours, and peak travel season,&quot; Romanovska said. &quot;But if it happens in April or May, that would be an extremely positive development for us.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/lviv-airport-could-reopen-by-late-spring-general-director-says/	2025-03-16T21:15:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2123636893.jpg
Erdogan tells Trump that Turkey supports US efforts to end Russia's war	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo&#x11F;an on March 16 &#xA0;spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump for the first time since his second term began in January, with the conversation covering key issues, including Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. During the conversation, Erdogan expressed support for President Trump&apos;s efforts to bring an end to the war. He emphasized that Turkey backs Trump&#x2019;s initiatives aimed at resolving the war and voiced hope for a positive outcome under his leadership. Turkey has positioned itself as a potential mediator in Russia&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine, now in its fourth year, by maintaining diplomatic and economic ties with both nations while supporting Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty. Leveraging its strategic position and influence in the Black Sea region, Turkey has facilitated negotiations, grain exports, and expressed willingness to participate in ceasefire monitoring. In late February, Turkey indicated its openness to deploying troops in Ukraine as part of a potential peacekeeping force. Sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that Erdogan raised the issue in separate meetings with President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov during visits to Ankara earlier in February. While Moscow has openly opposed the presence of NATO troops in Ukraine, Russia has yet to provide a clear response to Turkey&apos;s proposal.	https://kyivindependent.com/erdogan-tells-trump-that-turkey-supports-us-efforts-to-end-russias-war-against-ukraine/	2025-03-16T21:12:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1239585119.jpg
Plan A is get the shooting to stop' — Rubio says as US pushes for ceasefire in Ukraine	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described a recent meeting between U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin as &quot;promising&quot; while acknowledging the complexities of ending the ongoing war. Speaking on CBS&#x2019;s &quot;Face the Nation&quot; on March 16, Rubio said the discussions provided insight into whether Russia is genuinely considering a ceasefire or merely stalling for time. Rubio outlined the U.S. administration&#x2019;s two-phase approach to ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, now in its fourth year. &quot;Plan A is, get the shooting to stop so that we can move to Plan B, phase two, which is have everybody at a table, maybe not- maybe with some shuttle diplomacy, to figure out a way to permanently end this war in a way that&apos;s enduring and it respects everybody&apos;s needs and so forth,&quot; he said. The secretary emphasized that the priority remains achieving a ceasefire before beginning broader negotiations for a permanent resolution. However, he acknowledged that even reaching a ceasefire would be difficult, given the complexity of the battlefield and the interests at stake. While Rubio refrained from disclosing details of the negotiations, he remained cautiously optimistic. He said that President Donald Trump is committed to bringing the war to an end and is actively working to ensure a cessation of hostilities. &quot;No one is saying that that second part is easy, but we can&apos;t get even to that second part until we get past the first part,&quot; he said, underlining the administration&#x2019;s strategy. The secretary also highlighted the need for diplomatic engagement and potential concessions from both sides to achieve a lasting peace. &quot;This war cannot continue. The president has been clear about that, and he&apos;s doing everything he can to bring it to an end,&quot; he concluded.	https://kyivindependent.com/plan-a-is-get-the-shooting-to-stop-rubio-says-as-us-pushes-for-ceasefire-in-ukraine/	2025-03-16T19:38:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194552772.jpg
Lithuania backs EU plan for $43.5 billion in military aid to Ukraine, Reuters reports	Lithuania has voiced support for an EU initiative to provide Ukraine with up to 40 billion euro ($43.5 billion) in military aid this year, arguing that similar funding will be necessary in the future to prevent another Russian attack. &quot;If we can sustain this amount ... for a longer period of time, that would be the amount that would allow Ukrainians to keep their armed forces at current strength,&quot; Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys told Reuters on March 16. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022, Lithuania has been one of Ukraine&#x2019;s most vocal backers. The Baltic state ranks among Europe&apos;s top defense spenders, allocating 2.85% of GDP to defense in 2024, according to NATO estimates. Vilnius plans to increase that figure to between 5% and 6% from 2026 to 2030. EU foreign ministers are set to discuss the proposal in Brussels, with the plan introduced by the bloc&#x2019;s diplomatic service, led by former Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas. The talks come amid uncertainty over U.S. negotiations with Russia, the future of American military support for Ukraine, and Washington&#x2019;s broader security commitments to Europe. A document obtained by Reuters on March 14 revealed that EU diplomats have suggested doubling military aid for Ukraine to as much as $43.5 billion. Some member states have reacted cautiously, but Budrys stressed that long-term military support for Kyiv should not be tied to any potential peace talks. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s armed forces will be the main deterrence forces for Russians not to return,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-backs-eu-plan-for-43-5-billion-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-reuters-reports/	2025-03-16T17:58:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1520422838.jpg
Kremlin dismisses ceasefire as tactic to buy time for Ukraine’s military	The Kremlin claims that calls for a ceasefire in Ukraine are merely an attempt to give the Ukrainian military time to regroup and rearm, according to Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s aide, Yuri Ushakov. &quot;We see this as an effort to provide Ukrainian forces with a pause during a difficult period. The Russian army is advancing on all fronts, and under these circumstances, the ceasefire could be viewed as a way to allow Ukraine to strengthen its position,&quot; Ushakov told state-owned media on March 16. He added that Russia has conveyed its concerns to the United States and that while communication between the two countries continues, it does not extend to direct talks between the presidents. Ushakov also noted that a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin could be arranged quickly if necessary. During negotiations in Saudi Arabia, U.S. officials proposed a 30-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. Ukrainian representatives agreed to the idea, though President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously suggested limiting a ceasefire to air and water operations. To discuss the proposal, U.S. Special Representative Steve Witkoff traveled to Moscow. Following the visit, Putin reportedly signaled his willingness to accept the U.S. plan but insisted that any ceasefire must contribute to a long-term resolution of the war. Despite this, Ukraine remains doubtful that Russia would uphold a ceasefire agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-dismisses-ceasefire-as-tactic-to-buy-time-for-ukraines-military/	2025-03-16T15:51:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1252236776.jpg
Zelensky announces upcoming Ramstein summit in Brussels	Ukraine is preparing for the next Ramstein summit, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced in his evening address on March 16. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov is now in the process of organizing the next Ramstein-format Ukrainian Defense Contact Group (UDCG), Zelensky said. &quot;We are preparing for Brussels,&quot; he said. The last Ramstein-format UDCG meeting took place in Brussels on Feb. 12 under the chairmanship of the U.K. &#x2013; a position previously held by the U.S. Leadership over Ramstein transitioned following the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump. The meeting focused on coordinating support for Ukraine, including expanding defense production, financing new enterprises, and increasing arms supplies through European defense industry capacities. While specific dates have yet to be confirmed, the next Ramstein summit will likely take place in late March or early April. Zelensky also said that Ukraine is acquiring more ammunition, including artillery shells and additional missiles for its IRIS-T, NASAMS, and SAMP/T air defense systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-announces-next-ramstein-summit/	2025-03-16T14:27:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156503093.jpg
New Canadian PM discusses security guarantees, bilateral cooperation in call with Zelensky	Newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney discussed Canada&apos;s support for Ukraine in a phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Presidential Office reported on March 16. Carney was sworn in as Canada&apos;s prime minister on March 14, replacing former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as head of the governing Liberal Party. Trudeau announced his resignation in January. The leaders discussed increasing pressure on Moscow, particularly by imposing new sanctions against Russia&apos;s banking sector and its so-called &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of oil tankers. They also spoke about security guarantees for Ukraine, including Canada&apos;s commitment to providing economic support after the war ends. Carney and Zelensky also discussed defense cooperation and the possibility of joint production of long-range weapons and electronic warfare equipment. Canada recently participated in the &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; virtual summit convened by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer on March 15. Following the conference, Canada reiterated his support for Ukraine in a post on X. &quot;Canada supports the proposal for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine,&quot; Carney wrote. &quot;Now, Russia must stop stalling and launching its attacks. It&apos;s time for Russia to come to the table in good faith.&quot; Carney said his country remains &quot;Ukraine&apos;s steadfast ally&quot; and is committed to lending Kyiv &quot;the military support it needs to defend itself &#x2014; now and into the future.&quot; Under Trudeau&apos;s leadership, Canada was a strong ally of Ukraine, providing 19.5 billion Canadian dollars ($13.5 billion) in assistance, including 4.5 billion Canadian dollars ($3.1 billion) in military aid. Prior to the March 15 summit, Canada also signalled its willingness to partake in a potential peacekeeping mission in Ukraine. Carney, a former central banker, is widely expected to trigger a general election in the coming weeks. Canada is required to hold a general election no later than Oct. 20.	https://kyivindependent.com/new-canadian-pm-discusses-security-guarantees-in-call-with-zelensky/	2025-03-16T13:57:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204533696.jpg
No more lost territory, return of deported children — Kyiv names red lines for peace deal, Independent reports	Ukraine is ready to negotiate a peace deal with Russia, but remains firm on several key areas, the U.K. news outlet the Independent reported on March 16, citing senior Ukrainian officials. Kyiv has agreed to accept a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire, provided Russia also abides by its terms. U.S. officials are currently negotiating with Moscow on the details of the proposal. &quot;We are really willing to make peace, but we need a long-lasting peace, not a short ceasefire,&quot; a high-level Ukrainian source told the Independent, speaking on the condition of anonymity. &quot;We do not want our children fighting this battle.&quot; Ukraine has four key terms that must be upheld in order for the full-scale war to end, sources said. These are: Kyiv is prepared to accept a freeze along the current battle lines, sources told the Independent, but will not surrender any more territory to Russia despite Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s goal of fully occupying Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts. &#xA0; &#xA0; &quot;It is not reasonable to demand that, for example, Zaporizhzhia or Kherson be fully handed over &#x2014; that sounds like a f*** off to us,&quot; an official said. The White House has insisted that both Russia and Ukraine will have to make compromises in order to end the war, calling Ukraine&apos;s goal of restoring its pre-2014 borders &quot;unrealistic.&quot; U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that the Ukraine-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia on March 11 included discussions about potential &quot;territorial concessions&quot; as part of a negotiated settlement with Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 12 that Ukraine &quot;will not recognize any occupied territories as Russia&apos;s&quot; as a condition of any peace deal. &quot;This is the most important red line,&quot; he said. Putin said on March 13 that Russia is ready to agree to the U.S.-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine, &#xA0;but only if Kyiv accepts a series of oppressive demands. These include guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops or accept any military aid during the truce. &quot;Putin is playing games. We have made a strong move &#x2014; now it is his turn,&quot; sources told the Independent. &#x201C;We have proved we are reasonable; we are willing to have peace &#x2014; if Russia doesn&apos;t agree, the whole world will see they are liars.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/no-more-lost-territory-return-of-deported-children-kyiv-names-red-lines-for-peace-deal-independent-reports/	2025-03-16T12:57:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2163823789.jpg
West can send troops to Ukraine without Russia's permission, Macron says	Kyiv does not need Russia&apos;s permission to invite peacekeeping troops to its territory, French President Emmanuel Macron said in an interview with French regional newspaper Le Parisien on March 15. &quot;Ukraine is sovereign &#x2013; if it requests allied forces to be on its territory, it is not up to Russia to accept or reject it,&quot; Macron told Le Parisien. Macron has been at the forefront of plans to deploy Western peacekeepers on the ground in Ukraine. Along with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Macron has championed the idea as an alternative security guarantee for Kyiv in the event of a ceasefire. Russia has repeatedly rejected the notion of peacekeeping forces in Ukraine. In the interview, Macron reiterated the importance of supporting Ukraine and confirmed that European forces would be deployed only at Kyiv&apos;s request. He also emphasized the importance of maintaining &#xA0;pressure on Russia and dialogue with key international allies. In the coming days, Macron will meet with newly-elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to discuss Ukraine. Macron&apos;s remarks came shortly before he participated in a virtual summit of the &quot;coalition of the willing,&quot; a group of countries who have pledged to help secure a future peace in Ukraine. During the summit, participating international leaders expressed their support for Kyiv and discussed plans to send 10,000 peacekeeping troops to Ukraine. While the &#xA0;peacekeeping plan is still being finalized by the U.K., France, and other partners, the contingent would likely involve &quot;a few thousand troops&quot; from each country, deployed at &quot;key points&quot; in Ukraine, to conduct training and demonstrate long-term support.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-says-ukraine-can-accept-peacekeeping-troops-without-russian-permission/	2025-03-16T12:12:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2033880055.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine confirms withdrawal from Sudzha in Russia's Kursk Oblast	Key developments on March 15-16: Ukraine&apos;s General Staff on March 16 confirmed Ukrainian troops&apos; withdrawal from the logistics hub of Sudzha in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, days after Moscow claimed its capture. Instead of confirming the withdrawal with a statement, the General Staff posted the latest battlefield maps on social media, which showed a complete retreat from Sudzha. The confirmation comes as Russian troops scale up their offensive in the Russian border region, where Ukraine launched a surprise incursion in August 2024 in hopes of using the captured territories as a bargaining chip for potential peace negotiations. Kyiv has held on to its gradually shrinking foothold in Kursk Oblast despite a deteriorating logistics situation caused by Russia&apos;s intense use of artillery, drones, and glide bombs. As unconfirmed reports of a Ukrainian encirclement circulated online, U.S. President Donald Trump urged his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on March 14 to &quot;spare&quot; allegedly surrounded Ukrainian troops. Ukraine has denied the claims of encirclement. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on March 13 that its troops had captured Sudzha. The claim came a day after Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi confirmed ongoing battles in the suburbs of Sudzha and the surrounding areas. &quot;In the most difficult situation, my priority has been and remains to save the lives of Ukrainian soldiers. To do this, the units of (Ukraine&apos;s) Defense Forces, if necessary, are maneuvering to more favorable positions,&quot; Syrskyi said. Ukraine on March 16 appointed Andrii Hnatov as the new chief of the General Staff, promoting the major general as part of what Kyiv hailed as &quot;a military reform.&quot; Hnatov, who was formerly appointed as the deputy chief of the General Staff in February, will be replacing Anatolii Barhylevych, who took the role in February 2024. &quot;We are systematically transforming the Armed Forces of Ukraine to enhance their combat effectiveness,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in a Facebook post, applauding a promotion that he said came at his recommendation. Hnatov has over 27 years of experience in the military. He previously commanded a marine brigade, Operational Command East formation, and the Joint Forces of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. Umerov added that Ukraine appointed Lieutenant General Barhylevych as the Defense Ministry&apos;s chief inspector. His role is to oversee military standards and boost discipline in the Armed Forces, according to the minister. More than three years into the full-scale war, Ukraine is slowly withdrawing on multiple fronts amid a critical manpower shortage. Kyiv is trying to modernize the army in an attempt to solve long-standing issues, such as command culture and resource management. &quot;Transformation continues,&quot; Umerov wrote in the same Facebook post. Russian soldiers are amassing at the border to prepare to launch an attack on Ukraine&apos;s northeastern Sumy region, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 15. Zelensky said in a post on Telegram that Ukraine has observed areas along its eastern border where the Russian army is amassing force. &quot;This speaks to a desire to deliver a strike to our Sumy Oblast,&quot; Zelensky wrote. &quot;We understand this and will take countermeasures.&quot; The Ukrainian president also wrote that he hopes foreign leaders would note &quot;that in Moscow they are preparing to ignore diplomacy.&quot; U.S. diplomats were in Moscow this week to hash out a ceasefire deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who remains maximalist in his public demands for concessions from Ukraine. After talks in Saudi Arabia between the U.S. and Ukraine, Kyiv said it was ready to move forward with a ceasefire, provided Russia did the same. Zelensky also wrote that &quot;the situation on the Pokrovsk front has stabilized&quot; after several months during which the city in Donetsk Oblast had been at the center of fighting and periodic threats of Russian encirclement. &quot;Thanks to our Ukrainian forces, a significant quantity of Russian forces were pulled away from other fronts to Kursk Oblast,&quot; Zelensky wrote. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to hold a phone call with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin this week, Steve Witkoff, Trump&apos;s special envoy to the Middle East, said on March 16. &quot;I expect that there will be a call with both presidents this week, and we&apos;re also continuing to engage and have a conversation with the Ukrainians,&#x201D; Witkoff told CNN after meeting Putin in Moscow on March 13. Witkoff also said that the U.S. hopes to &quot;see a ceasefire within weeks,&quot; as cited by Axios. The expected phone call comes as Trump tries to end the war at any cost. European allies and Ukraine have warned that a rushed peace deal without adequate security guarantees won&apos;t result in lasting peace. Witkoff said the talks with Putin lasted a few hours and went well. He added that he expected the phone call between the two presidents to be &quot;really good and positive.&quot; &quot;We&apos;re bridging the gap between two sides,&quot; he said. &quot;The four regions are of critical importance here,&quot; Witkoff said, referring to Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, which are partially occupied by Russian troops. Witkoff also said that the U.S. is holding discussions with Ukraine, Russia, and European allies, including France, the U.K., Finland, &#xA0;and Norway. He claimed that Putin accepts &quot;Trump&apos;s philosophy&quot; on ending Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, Axios reported. &quot;The two sides are a lot closer today than they were a few weeks ago. We narrowed the differences,&quot; Witkoff said. Kyiv agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by the U.S. during talks in Jeddah on March 11, after which Washington resumed military and intelligence support for Ukraine. Russia is ready to agree to the U.S.-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine but demands guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops or receive military aid during the truce, Putin said on March 13. Meanwhile, U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said on March 16 that Ukraine was expected to exchange territories for security guarantees. &quot;This is going to be some type of territory for future security guarantees, the future status of &#x2013; of Ukraine,&quot; Waltz said on ABC News. He also said that &quot;a permanent pathway into NATO, or a permanent membership into NATO for Ukraine is incredibly unlikely.&quot; U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer presented plans to send 10,000 peacekeeping troops to Ukraine at a high-level virtual summit in London on March 15. The summit, which included 29 international leaders, was organized by the U.K. with the purpose of creating a &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; that could secure Ukraine in the event of a peace deal with Russia. Starmer&apos;s proposed peacekeeping contingent would include around 10,000 troops, mostly provided by the U.K. and France, U.K. military sources told the Sunday Times. Thirty-five countries have agreed to supply the peacekeeping mission with weapons, logistics, and intelligence support. The peacekeeping mission will be &quot;a significant force with a significant number of countries providing troops and a much larger group contributing in other ways,&quot; &#xA0;a senior government source said. In addition to European nations, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand joined the call, as did NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. The proposed force of 10,000 is significantly smaller than the 30,000 troops Starmer reportedly pitched to U.S. President Donald Trump during their White House meeting on Feb. 20. Previously, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that European partners would need to station 100,000 to 150,000 troops on Ukraine&apos;s front lines to effectively deter Russia. U.K. defense sources told the Guardian on Feb. 18 that a much smaller European-led peacekeeping forcec ould instead rely on intelligence, surveillance, and long-range monitoring to enforce a ceasefire. Following the virtual summit, Starmer announced that &quot;troops on the ground and planes in the sky&quot; would provide security guarantees for Ukraine following a future peace deal. The allied coalition will hold a second round of military talks on March 20, Starmer said. While France and the U.K. have been the most vocal about sending troops to Ukraine, some countries, including Italy and Finland, have expressed reservations. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni attended the summit and vocalized support for Ukraine, but said that Italy does not plan to participate in the proposed peacekeeping force.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-confirms-withdrawal-from-sudzha-in-russias-kursk-oblast/	2025-03-16T11:15:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2165345310.jpg

Suspect pleads guilty to murder of Odesa activist Demyan Hanul	Serhii Shalaiev, the man detained and charged with the killing of Ukrainian activist Demyan Hanul, pled guilty to the murder in a closed court hearing on March 16, according to regional prosecutor Ruslan Veremchuk. Hanul, 31, was shot dead in central Odesa on March 14. Hanul was well-known for his public activism, including his participation in Ukraine&apos;s EuroMaidan Revolution and the May 2 clashes against pro-Russian forces in Odesa. The suspect, 46-year-old Serhii Shalaiev, pleaded guilty to Hanul&apos;s murder in a closed court session, the news outlet Suspilne reported, citing Veremchuk. Shalaiev was detained hours after the shooting and identified as a deserter by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). Prosecutors charged Shalaiev with premeditated murder committed under order and illegal handling of weapons. Veremchuk, deputy head of the Odesa Specialized Prosecutor&apos;s Office for Defense of the Southern Region, said the hearing was held in a closed session to protect the identities of testifying witnesses. He also said investigators are still working to determine who else may have been involved in Hanul&apos;s murder. &quot;The perpetrator of this crime has been detained,&quot; Veremchuk said. &quot;One of the versions of the investigation is that it was a contract killing. Measures are being taken to identify the customer and other accomplices in the crime.&quot; Shalaiev has been wanted for military desertion since February 23, according to the SBU. He reportedly served as commander of a platoon in the 28th separate mechanized brigade. The court has imposed a pre-trial detention order on Shalaiev, who will be held in custody for 60 days without possibility of bail. Andrii Nebytov, deputy head of the National Police, previously said during a television broadcast on March 15 that investigators were considering three possible versions of the crime: a contract killing linked to Hanul&apos;s political activism, a crime of personal animosty, and an assassination linked to Russia. Hanul was a public figure and blogger who founded the Street Front NGO. He was active in rallies supporting Ukraine, charity fundraisers for the military, and campaigns to dismantle the city&apos;s Soviet and imperial monuments. The activist had previously reported threats against his life. In July 2024, Hanul claimed Russian sources had leaked personal information about his relatives and that a $10,000 bounty was offered for an attack on him. In reaction to the murder, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that dozens of law enforcement officials are involved in the investigation. &quot;I have instructed the interior minister, the head of the Security Service, the acting prosecutor general to throw all the necessary forces and means to establish all the facts,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/suspect-pleads-guilty-to-murder-of-odesa-activist-demyan-hanul/	2025-03-16T10:03:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2205194636.jpg

Air Force says 47 Russian drones shot down overnight	Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported on March 16 that it had shot down 47 Russian Shahed and other drones across the country overnight. Russian troops attacked Ukraine with 90 drones, targeting Kyiv, Kharkiv, Poltava, Sumy, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, and Odesa oblasts, according to the Air Force&apos;s report. The Air Force added that it had lost track of 33 Russian decoy drones but said that they had caused no damage. Russia&apos;s aerial attack against Ukraine comes as the U.S. is negotiating with Russia on a potential 30-day ceasefire, which Kyiv agreed to earlier in March. Russian drone attacks have targeted Ukraine every day. Since the start of the full-scale war, Russia has regularly launched drone and missile attacks on Ukraine, including cities far from the front line. The attacks have often targeted civilian sites and critical infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/47-russian-drones-shot-down-overnight-air-force-says/	2025-03-16T08:32:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1489471985.jpg

US launches airstrikes on Iranian-backed rebels as Trump orders 'decisive' military action	The U.S. launched airstrikes against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen on March 15 as President Donald Trump ordered &quot;decisive&quot; military action against the group. Trump also said that the U.S. would hold Iran &quot;fully accountable&quot; if it didn&apos;t end support for the Houthi rebels &quot;immediately.&quot; The U.S. attack against the Houthi rebels and the threat to Iran come as Moscow continues to expand its partnership with Tehran. Iran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed drones used in attacks against Ukrainian cities, as well as short-range ballistic missiles. The strikes on the Houthis also come amid increasing tensions between their main backer, Iran, and Israel, which is supported by the U.S., including a controversy over Tehran&apos;s nuclear weapons program. &quot;Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen,&quot; Trump said in a post on Truth Social, claiming that his predecessor Joe Biden&apos;s approach was &quot;pathetically weak.&quot; &quot;They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones.&quot; Trump said the U.S. would deploy &#x201C;overwhelming lethal force&#x201D; against the rebels &#x201C;until we have achieved our objective.&quot; CNN reported, citing the Houthi-run health ministry, that at least 31 people had been killed and 101 injured in Yemen by the U.S. strikes, and that most of the casualties were women and children. The Kyiv Independent could not verify this information. Despite worsening relations between the U.S. and Iran, Trump&apos;s team is trying to resume the long-frozen diplomatic relations with one of Tehran&apos;s backers, Russia. On March 13, Trump&apos;s special envoy Steve Witkoff paid a visit to Moscow for talks on the 30-day ceasefire proposal that Ukraine had accepted after a U.S.-Ukrainian meeting in Saudi Arabia on March 11.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-launches-strikes-on-iranian-backed-rebels-in-yemen/	2025-03-16T05:41:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204730188.jpg

To do this, the units of (Ukraine&apos;s) Defense Forces, if necessary, are maneuvering to more favorable positions,&quot; Syrskyi said.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-confirms-withdrawal-from-sudzha-kursk-oblast/	2025-03-16T03:22:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166820734.jpg
Trump denies reports on his envoy waiting for Putin, calls media 'sick degenerates'	U.S. President Donald Trump on March 15 denied reports that his special envoy Steve Witkoff had waited for hours for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Sky News reported on March 14, citing footage, that Witkoff had waited at least eight hours for Putin while the Russian leader was meeting Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, in what appeared to be a classic power play. Witkoff paid a visit to Moscow on March 13 for talks on the 30-day ceasefire proposal that Ukraine had accepted after a U.S.-Ukrainian meeting in Saudi Arabia on March 11. &quot;The fake news, as usual, is at it again!&quot; Trump said in a post on Truth Social. &quot;Why can&apos;t they be honest, just for once? Last night I read that President Vladimir Putin of Russia kept my highly respected Ambassador and Special Envoy, Steve Witkoff, waiting for over nine hours when, in fact, there was no wait whatsoever.&quot; &#xA0; Trump attacked the media that reported the story, saying that their purpose is &quot;to demean&quot; and calling them &quot;sick degenerates.&quot; He claimed that &quot;other meetings with other representatives of Russia did take place and, obviously, they took some time, but they were very productive.&quot; &quot;From there, things went quickly and efficiently, and all signs seem to be, hopefully, very good!&apos; Trump added. Putin said on March 13 that Russia was ready to agree to the U.S.-backed 30-day-long ceasefire in Ukraine but then followed by listing a number of demands &#x2014; a ban on Ukrainian mobilization or training of troops and a halt on Western military aid for Kyiv. Putin also hinted that Ukrainian troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast must surrender. Talks on a potential ceasefire come as Trump pushes for a rushed peace deal to end the war at any cost, keeping European and Ukrainian officials on alert.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-denies-reports-that-witkoff-waited-hours-for-putin/	2025-03-16T02:07:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196945288.jpg

Canada contributes additional $35 million toward restoring energy infrastructure in Ukraine	Canada contributed another 50 million Canadian dollars ($34.8 million) to the Ukraine Energy Support Fund, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Ministry said on March 14. Days prior, Ukraine received the first tranche of a loan of $1.7 billion covered by frozen Russian assets from Canada, the Ukrainian Finance Ministry announced on March 13. &quot;As Russia continues its ruthless attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, leaving millions without electricity, water, and heat, Canada is proud... to continue the important work it is doing to help Ukraine repair its critical infrastructure,&quot; Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said in a statement. Canada&apos;s total contribution to the Ukraine Energy Support Fund is now over $41 million. Canada also declared a future contribution of 10 million Canadian dollars ($7 million) to the fund. The Ukraine Energy Support Fund raises costs to restore energy facilities and support critical infrastructure. &quot;Contributions to the Energy Support Fund are directed toward purchasing equipment necessary for restoring energy facilities after enemy attacks and ensuring the stable operation of Ukraine&#x2019;s energy system,&quot; Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said. Part of the new contribution will go towards the healthcare sector to support critical social infrastructure through the development of solar energy to support operations. The added funding will help ensure the stable operation of the energy industry in Ukraine by restoring critical energy reserves for energy companies, Canada&apos;s International Development Minister Ahmed Hussen said. Various countries contribute to the Ukraine Energy Support Fund established in 2022 with the help of the EU. Iceland allocated over $2 million to the fund on March 11 and Italy promised to contribute $13.5 million on Feb. 28. Russian aerial attacks regularly target civilian infrastructure, including energy services. Support from allies has proven to be crucial in maintaining Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/canada-contributes-an-additional-36-million-to-ukraine-energy-support-fund/	2025-03-15T21:26:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1255039162.jpg
Italy does not plan to send peacekeepers to Ukraine, remains committed to 'effective security guarantees'	Italy does not plan to participate in a peacekeeping force on the ground in eastern Ukraine to guarantee a potential ceasefire, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni&apos;s office said on March 15. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosted an online summit of the &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; earlier on March 15. Attendees discussed how each nation could contribute to securing Ukraine in the event of a peace deal with Russia. Meloni attended the U.K.-led virtual summit on March 15 alongside 24 other nations at the multilateral event. Italy does not have plans to participate in a peacekeeping force on the ground in Ukraine, a statement put out by Meloni&apos;s office following the meeting read. Italy will continue to work with European and Western allies to &quot;define credible and effective security guarantees&quot; for Ukraine, the statement added. Following the summit, Ukraine&apos;s allies reaffirmed their support for the embattled nation and condemned Russia for its war against Ukraine. &quot;Russia does not give the impression of a country that sincerely desires peace... It does not respond to the proposals of the United States and Ukraine. It intensifies hostilities. President Putin wants to get everything and then negotiate,&quot; French President Emmanuel Macron said. While the U.K. and France have been the most vocal in supporting troops on the ground in Ukraine, leaders of other nations have expressed reservations about a military force. &quot;It is still too early to talk about putting troops on the ground because we don&#x2019;t have a ceasefire, we don&#x2019;t have a peace process... Once we have a clear plan, we start doing the commitments,&quot; Finnish President Alexander Stubb said on March 15. Stubb affirmed Finland&apos;s support for Ukraine but in line with other nations bordering Russia such as Poland, Finland has sought to offer Ukraine security in other ways while retaining troops on its own territory. In the face of the U.S. repeatedly ruling out NATO membership for Ukraine, Meloni said on March 6 that NATO could extend Article 5 protections to Ukraine without granting membership in the alliance. &quot;We need to think about more durable solutions&quot; than just sending European peacekeepers to Ukraine, Meloni said on the sidelines of an EU leaders meeting in Brussels on March 6. &quot;It&#x2019;s a different thing than entering NATO, but it implies extending the coverage that NATO countries have also to Ukraine,&quot; she added.	https://kyivindependent.com/italy-does-not-plan-to-send-peacekeepers-to-ukraine-remains-committed-to-just-peace/	2025-03-15T19:16:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189976147-1.jpg
Rubio discusses 'next steps' in phone call with Russia's Lavrov	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. State Secretary Marco Rubio held a phone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on March 15 as Washington attempts to persuade Moscow to accept a 30-day ceasefire deal. According to a statement by the U.S. State Department, Rubio and Lavrov discussed steps to restore contacts between the U.S. and Russia. &quot;Secretary Rubio and Foreign Minister Lavrov discussed next steps to follow up on recent meetings in Saudi Arabia and agreed to continue working towards restoring communication between the United States and Russia,&quot; State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement. Rubio also informed Lavrov of the United States&apos; operation on Houthi militants in Yemen. U.S. President Donald Trump announced earlier on March 15 on Truth Social that the U.S. had launched &quot;decisive and powerful Military (sic) action&quot; against the group. No additional details were provided on the call by the U.S. State Department. A similar readout by the Russian Foreign Ministry provided no additional details. Following talks with U.S. officials on March 11, Kyiv agreed to a temporary ceasefire, as long as Russia also abides by its terms. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on March 13 that Russia is ready to agree to the U.S.-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine but demands guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops, nor receive military aid during it. Putin&apos;s hesitation to implement a ceasefire comes as the United States resumed security assistance and intelligence sharing to Ukraine following breakthrough high-level talks in Saudi Arabia. As negotiations continue, Trump claimed during a speech at the Justice Department on March 14 that the White House has received &quot;some pretty good news&quot; regarding its attempts to secure a 30-day ceasefire agreement &#x2014; without specifying what the news was. Earlier on March 14, Trump claimed he asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to &quot;spare&quot; Ukrainian troops he said were surrounded by Russian forces in Kursk Oblast &#x2014; a claim he repeated during his speech. Kyiv has denied reports that its troops are encircled in Kursk. Rubio said on March 14 said that the administration was &quot;cautiously optimistic&quot; about progress towards a ceasefire, but added that the situation remains &quot;complex.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/rubio-discusses-next-steps-in-phone-call-with-russias-lavrov/	2025-03-15T18:09:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194442240.jpg
Duda denounces Russia for 'imperial greed,' reiterates calls to deploy US nuclear weapons in Poland	Polish President Andrzej Duda denounced Russia for its &quot;imperial greed&quot; in a wide-ranging interview with the BBC published on March 15. Duda called on the U.S. to deploy its nuclear weapons to Poland in an interview published on March 13. U.S. Vice President JD Vance said he would be &quot;shocked&quot; if the U.S. fulfilled Poland&apos;s request in response to Duda later that day. &quot;Ukraine must be sovereign and independent because otherwise there will be no peace, it will only be the end of the war due to the occupation of Ukraine by Russia,&quot; Duda said. The Polish president expressed his trust in U.S. President Donald Trump in resolving Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, saying accusations that Trump does not want to see Ukraine at the negotiating table are &quot;false.&quot; &quot;(A)s I understand it, President Trump does not want to be a participant, but rather a mediator,&quot; Duda said. The Polish leader noted that Ukraine&apos;s meeting with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia on March 11 ended on a positive note. At the bilateral meeting, the White House agreed to resume military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv. Ukraine agreed to a U.S. proposal for a temporary 30-day ceasefire, Russia did not. &quot;The meeting with Ukraine was successful, and the Russian side, as you can see, is behaving the way it is behaving,&quot; Duda said. Russia is an &quot;aggressor&quot; that invaded Ukraine and is &quot;killing civilians,&quot; Duda said, adding that Russia transferred nuclear weapons to Belarus as an &quot;obvious offensive tactic&quot; and not for defense purposes. &quot;As long as Russia uses offensive tactics, Russia is an aggressor. Russia attacked Ukraine without reason, it was not provoked in any way. It is an attack that was justified only by Russia&apos;s imperial greed, which wants to subjugate a state and its people,&quot; Duda said. The Polish president reiterated his calls for U.S. nuclear weapons to be stationed in Poland and welcomed calls for a French nuclear umbrella to protect Europe, including Poland. &quot;(I)t is a security issue because these weapons are not offensive, these weapons are defensive. I emphasize again, they are intended to protect primarily from a nuclear attack,&quot; Duda said. &quot;Secondly, it was Russia, without asking anyone, that deployed its nuclear weapons in Belarus. This is no secret to anyone, Putin openly spoke about it in an interview,&quot; Duda added. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko previously said that the transfer of Russian tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus was completed in early October 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/duda-denounces-russia-for-imperial-greed-in-interview-with-bbc/	2025-03-15T17:01:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1504051081.jpg
Everyone is really shocked and upset' — Trump administration puts Voice of America journalists on leave, cuts funding to Radio Free Europe	The Trump administration on March 15 followed up a on an executive order signed a day earlier by President Donald Trump vowing to gut funding for the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees Voice of America (VOA) and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). As a result of the executive order which deemed USAGM as among &quot;elements of the federal bureaucracy that the president has determined are unnecessary,&quot; grant funding to U.S.-funded media outlet RFE/RL was terminated. Journalists and employees working at U.S.-funded Voice of America were also placed on administrative leave. In an email obtained by the Kyiv Independent, employees at VOA were instructed &quot;not to enter USAGM premises&quot; nor &quot;access USAGM systems.&quot; &quot;You will be expected to immediately surrender your official USAGM identification badge and press pass, as well as any keys or other official government property, including documents, records, electronic and telephone devices, and other equipment,&quot; the email sent to VOA employees continued. &quot;Everyone is really shocked and upset, but we saw some signs of those decisions coming,&quot; a VOA journalist who was placed on leave told the Kyiv Independent on the condition of anonymity. In recent weeks, the government&apos;s human resource department sent emails to employees asking for personal emails and phone numbers in case they needed to be contacted, the VOA journalist told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We were suspicious obviously.&quot; &quot;Everyone is still shocked even though its been expected because everyone saw Elon Musk&apos;s tweets.&quot; Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who serves as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), on Feb. 9 called for shutting down RFE/RL and VOA. Responding to comments by U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Special Missions Richard Grenell, Musk wrote on X: &quot;Yes, shut them down. Europe is free now (not counting stifling bureaucracy). Nobody listens to them anymore. It&#x2019;s just radical left crazy people talking to themselves while torching $1B/year of US taxpayer money.&quot; Musk has criticized federal payments to media organizations like Politico, the Associated Press, and The New York Times, deeming them inefficient uses of taxpayer funds and moving to eliminate them. &quot;We are still considered government employees but not for long. No one is expecting that it will last,&quot; a VOA journalist said, adding that employees are expecting termination to be applied by the end of next week. Politico reported on March 14 that U.S. government-backed broadcaster Radio Free Asia was furloughing about 300 U.S.-based staff next week due to the suspension in funding. The move comes as Ostap Yarysh, a prominent Ukrainian correspondent at VoA, was dismissed on March 7, reportedly following an inspection by DOGE. The New York Times reported on Feb. 28 that the USAGM, which oversees VOA, launched an investigation into journalists who had spoken out against Trump&#x2019;s policies. VOA Director Mike Abramowit said in a statement on social media that over 1,300 journalists, producers and support staff were place on leave, criticizing the move as &quot;failing to protect U.S. interests.&quot; &quot;Even if the agency survives in some form, the actions being taken today by the Administration will severely damage Voice of America&#x2019;s ability to foster a world that is safe and free and in doing so is failing to protect U.S. interests,&quot; Abramowit wrote. In addition to the leave imposed on journalists at VOA, grant funding to U.S.-funded media outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) was put to a halt. In a letter sent by USAGM senior advisor Kari Lake, a staunch Trump supporter and former news anchor turned Republican Senate candidate, current U.S. government grant funding was terminated on March 15. &quot;This letter provides notice that that the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) is terminating you federal grant... and any other grants with USAGM,&quot; the letter obtained by journalists reads. In response to the termination of funding, Stephen Capus, the head of RFE/RL &#x2014; which first began broadcasting into the Soviet Union during the Cold War &#x2014; said that the decision was &quot;a massive gift to America&apos;s enemies.&quot; &quot;The Iranian Ayatollahs, Chinese communist leaders, and autocrats in Moscow and Minsk would celebrate the demise of RFE/RL after 75 years. Handing our adversaries a win would make them stronger and America weaker,&quot; Capus added. Trump has long criticized U.S.-funded media organizations, criticizing them over their coverage of the U.S. president, and often referring to them as &quot;fake news.&quot; In total, the networks reach an estimated 427 million people across the world and employed thousands of employees across the United States, Cuba, Europe, and Asia. The Trump administration has previously cut thousands of federally-funded positions, with the cuts directly impacting support for Ukraine. In February, the Trump administration terminated the employment of top officials from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) after they attempted to prevent representatives from Elon Musk&#x2019;s DOGE from accessing restricted areas.	https://kyivindependent.com/everyone-is-really-shocked-and-upset-trump-administration-puts-voice-of-america-journalists-on-leave-cuts-funding-to-radio-free-europe/	2025-03-15T16:13:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/gettyimages-2204719493-612x612.jpg
‘Painful for Russia:’ What new U.S. sanctions on Russian energy mean for Moscow	The Trump administration dealt a blow to Russia&apos;s energy sector last week after it let lapse an exemption allowing Russian banks to use U.S. payment systems for energy transactions. The move closed an important financial channel for Russian oil and gas exports and comes as Washington looks for ways to pressure Moscow to agree to a U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was open to a deal, but has demanded concessions from Kyiv before moving forward. A license put in place by the Joe Biden administration at the start of the full-scale invasion had allowed a number of Russian banks to continue receiving energy payments in U.S. dollars. The move aimed to prevent sharp increases in energy prices and avoid an energy crisis in countries dependent on Russian energy resources while otherwise maintaining sanctions pressure on Russia&apos;s financial system. As part of the Biden administration&#x2019;s most sweeping sanctions against Russia implemented in January at the end of Biden&#x2019;s term, the license&#x2019;s expiration date was cut short from the usual six-month period and scheduled to end on March 12. Allowing the license to expire &#x201C;is painful for Russia,&quot; said Ihor Burakovsky, head of the Board at the Institute for Economic Research and Policy Consulting. &quot;Oil and gas is the key sector of the Russian economy &#x2014; its key source of export revenues.&quot; &quot;Any restrictions that complicate countries&apos; access to the international financial system create serious problems for their economies,&#x201D; Burakovsky told the Kyiv Independent. Although most Russian banks were disconnected from SWIFT in early 2022, certain institutions, particularly Gazprombank, were permitted to process payments for energy exports. Foreign buyers paid in euros or dollars into special accounts at Gazprombank, after which the currency was converted to rubles to comply with Putin&apos;s demands for &quot;ruble payments&quot; for gas. &quot;This makes it harder for Russia to get paid for their energy,&quot; said James Angel, associate professor at the Georgetown School of Business. &quot;They have to go to more trouble to feed their war machine. Until they find an alternative way to get value for their energy, they will have less to spend on bombing Ukraine. Eventually, they will find a less efficient way to get paid.&quot; Burakovsky also noted that Russia is adept at finding ways around sanctions. Russia has created a large shadow fleet of approximately 800 vessels to evade sanctions put in place after the start of the full-scale invasion. Many of the fleet&apos;s ships &#x2014;&#xA0;poorly maintained and with murky owners that pose security and environmental risks &#x2014; are already under U.S. and EU sanctions. The new restrictions on payments undermine the Russian economy by significantly complicating energy exports &#x2014; the country&apos;s main source of income, experts say. &quot;The banking sector and access to international finance is currently the Achilles&apos; heel of the Russian economy,&quot; said Burakovsky. Traditional sanctions against Russia&apos;s oil and gas sector included restrictions on equipment supplies and extraction technologies and setting a price ceiling of $60 per barrel for oil. The new restrictions complicate a key aspect of Russia&#x2019;s energy sector &#x2014; conducting settlements between buyers and Russian exporters. Russia will be forced to seek alternative routes by using shadow schemes to circumvent restrictions or conducting payments in national currencies, Burakovsky said. This creates additional hurdles, especially with countries like India and China. &quot;Since the Indian rupee is not a freely convertible currency, it is very difficult to take it out of India. This creates a situation where Russia supplies oil to certain countries, but the money remains there,&quot; said Burakovsky. To circumvent Western sanctions, Russia has also begun using cryptocurrencies in oil transactions with China and India. Burakovsky notes that although the U.S. cannot completely stop Russia due to small volumes of bilateral trade, restricting access to the international financial system is &quot;an extremely painful issue.&quot; That could explain Russia&#x2019;s demands in lifting sanctions on oil exports as part of a ceasefire agreement. As Trump looks to negotiate a swift end to the war, his team has increasingly ramped up pressure on Kyiv and President Volodymyr Zelensky while making few demands of the Russian side so far. This has led to speculation that Trump could try to force Kyiv into an unfavorable peace deal that would effectively amount to Ukraine&#x2019;s surrender. The new sanctions could, however, be a signal from the Trump administration that it is ready to use sanctions to exert pressure on Moscow to agree to both a ceasefire and a peace deal. &quot;Closing this loophole now is a way to demonstrate greater resolve in the fight against Russian aggression and that the U.S. has not turned into Putin&apos;s puppet,&quot; said Angel. The new sanctions close what he describes as a critical &quot;loophole&quot; in the previous sanctions regime, he said. While Trump may be looking for a quick resolution to the war and granting Russia sanctions relief as part of any deal, sanctions are a joint effort by a coalition of 47 countries, including the EU, Australia, Japan, and Canada. &quot;Trump understands that the U.S. is an economic, military and political power, but in today&apos;s world its dominance is not absolute,&quot; Burakovsky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/painful-for-russia-what-new-u-s-sanctions-on-russian-energy-mean-for-moscow/	2025-03-15T14:18:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1477537303.jpg
Trump appoints Kellogg as Special Envoy to Ukraine, removes him from dealings with Russia	U.S. President Donald Trump appointed General Keith Kellogg as Special Envoy to Ukraine on March 15, where he will communicate directly with Ukrainian leadership rather than participate in negotiations with Russia as previously intended. Initially appointed as Trump&#x2019;s Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Kellogg was to be involved in direct peace talk efforts between the two countries. However, recent NBC News reports indicate that he was excluded from high-level peace at the Kremlin&apos;s request as Moscow perceived as being too sympathetic to Ukraine. &#x201C;General Kellogg, a Highly Respected Military Expert, will deal directly with President Zelensky, and Ukrainian leadership. He knows them well, and they have a very good working relationship together. Congratulations to General Kellogg!&#x201D; Trump announced on Truth Social. Although Trump did not explicitly say he would be removing Kellogg from dealings with Russia, the change in title is likely reflective to changing attitudes within Russia. Kellogg responded to the new appointment on X, thanking Trump for the new opportunity. &#x201C;I am deeply honored and humbled by President Trump&#x2019;s confidence in appointing me as Special Envoy to Ukraine. I have been privileged to have known Trump since 2015, and he will END THIS WAR. It is an honor to serve our great nation and advance the vital interests of the United States. America First!&#x201D; Kellogg wrote. Kellogg previously co-authored a peace plan that would freeze the front line in Ukraine, take NATO accession off the table for an extended period, and partially lift sanctions imposed on Russia. His peace proposals also call for continued U.S. military aid to Ukraine as well as strong security guarantees to Kyiv to prevent further Russian aggression. Kellogg previously visited Kyiv in late February for discussions with Ukrainian officials, but had since not been involved in a U.S. delegation in talks with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-appoints-kellogg-as-special-envoy-to-ukraine/	2025-03-15T13:15:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199838039.jpg
Western leaders reaffirm support for Ukraine following virtual summit hosted by Starmer	Western leaders reiterated their support for Ukraine following a virtual summit hosted by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on March 15, where leaders from 25 countries were in attendance. The virtual summit convened countries who could form a post-war peacekeeping force within Ukraine. As of March 13, the potential coalition consists of 37 countries, with the U.K. and France largely taking the lead as the only countries who have publicly committed to sending troops to Ukraine post-war. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese emphasized Australia&#x2019;s commitment to Ukraine, pledging to stand with the country &quot;for as long as it takes.&quot; &quot;I reiterated Australia&#x2019;s strong and steadfast support for Ukraine and restated that Australia will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,&quot; Albanese said in an official statement following the summit. He also stated that Australia is open to contributing to future peacekeeping efforts. &quot;President Putin&#x2019;s regime has imperialist designs, for Ukraine and beyond,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We must ensure Russia&#x2019;s illegal and immoral actions are not rewarded through any peace process.&quot; German Chancellor Olaf Scholz reaffirmed Germany&#x2019;s support for Ukraine, stating that &quot;Ukraine needs a just and lasting peace.&quot; He thanked Keir Starmer for convening the meeting and stressed that &quot;it is up to Russia to end the attacks and finally make peace possible.&quot; French President Emmanuel Macron criticized Putin, and accused Moscow of failing to engage in peace talks in good faith. &quot;Russia does not give the impression of a country that sincerely desires peace,&quot; Macron said after the summit. &quot;It does not respond to the proposals of the United States and Ukraine. It intensifies hostilities. President Putin wants to get everything and then negotiate.&quot; Macron argued that &quot;peace through strength&quot; remains the key to ending the conflict and that collective Western pressure on Russia is necessary. He also praised President Zelensky for proposing a ceasefire initiative and stated that for peace to last, Ukraine must have a &quot;strong army that defends its country.&quot; Finnish President Alexander Stubb expressed Finland&#x2019;s willingness to support Ukraine but was cautious about direct military involvement, in comments to the BBC. &quot;It is still too early to talk about putting troops on the ground because we don&#x2019;t have a ceasefire, we don&#x2019;t have a peace process,&quot; Stubb told the BBC. &quot;Once we have a clear plan, we start doing the commitments.&quot; Stubb emphasized that there are &quot;anywhere from zero to 50 different ways&quot; to support Ukraine, but insisted that direct military involvement would only be considered if a peace deal is reached. The virtual summit highlighted the growing pressure on Russia to engage in meaningful peace talks while reinforcing Western unity in supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s defense and long-term stability.	https://kyivindependent.com/western-leaders-reaffirm-support-for-ukraine-following-virtual-summit-hosted-by-starmer/	2025-03-15T12:26:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1775102025.jpeg
Russian attacks in Nikopol kill 1, injure 3, including children	Russia attacked the town of Nikopol in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast over a dozen times on March 15, killing one woman and injuring three people, including two children, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Two girls, aged 11 and 3 years old, were injured in the attacks, Lysak said. The children are being treated at a medical facility in Dnipro. A 70-year-old woman was killed, according to Ukraine&apos;s General Prosecutor&apos;s Office. Prosecutors have launched a war crimes investigation as a result of the civilian casualties. Another woman, aged 57, also suffered injuries, but is receiving outpatient care, Lysak said. Russia attacked Nikopol and the surrounding communities with artillery and drones on March 15, according to Lysak. The attacks damaged a religious institution, five homes, two outbuildings, 15 solar panels, a car, and a power line. Nikopol, located on the banks of the destroyed Kakhovka Reservoir, just across from Russian-occupied Enerhodar and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, is a regular target of Russian attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-in-nikopol-kill-1-injure-3-including-children/	2025-03-15T10:51:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/nikopol.jpg
EU 'without Ukraine' — Hungary's Orban posts list of demands to Brussels	Budapest has a series of demands for the European Union, including the exclusion of Ukraine from membership in the bloc, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced on March 15. Orban, widely regarded as the EU&apos;s most pro-Russian leader, has repeatedly opposed military aid for Ukraine and warned that Ukraine&apos;s EU membership would &quot;destroy&quot; Hungary. The list of demands comes shortly after the EU reportedly struck a deal with Hungary to renew sanctions on more than 2,400 primarily Russian targets hours before they were set to expire on March 15. &quot;What does the Hungarian nation demand from Brussels?&quot; Orban wrote on X. &quot;Let there be peace, freedom, and unity.&quot; He then listed 12 demands, the last of which reads: &quot;A Union, but without Ukraine.&quot; Orban&apos;s other demands include banning &quot;the unnatural re-education of our children,&quot; protecting &quot;Europe&#x2019;s Christian heritage,&quot; and &quot;peace in Europe.&quot; Under Orban&apos;s right-wing government, Hungary has repeatedly clashed with the EU, leveraging its member state veto power to obstruct sanctions against Moscow and deepening ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin despite Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. At an emergency summit on security for Europe and Ukraine held on March 6, 26 EU member states denounced Russian aggression and pledged continued support for Kyiv, while Hungary was the lone dissenting nation. In exchange for Hungary lifting its veto on the recent sanctions renewal, the EU on March 14 agreed to remove four individuals from the list, fewer than half the number Budapest had demanded. &#xA0;The EU will likely face another confrontation with Budapest in July, when a package of economic sanctions against Russia is up for extension. At the end of 2024, Hungary became the first EU member to lose out on over $1 billion in funds due to violations of EU standards. The bloc could take further action against Budapest if tensions continue to mount. &#xA0; If a majority of member states agree, Hungary could even be stripped of its voting rights and veto power. Ukraine applied for EU membership in 2022 and was granted candidate status within months. Accession talks began in June 2024, with European leaders setting 2030 as a target for Ukraine&apos;s potential entry.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-without-ukraine-hungarys-orban-posts-list-of-demands-to-brussels/	2025-03-15T10:29:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1689139196.jpg
Putin is lying to everyone' — Zelensky calls for 'strong pressure' on Russia after UK summit	President Volodymyr Zelensky on March 15 called for an international coalition to intensify pressure on Moscow and meet with skepticism any claims from Russian President Vladimir Putin about the situation on the battlefield. &quot;Putin is lying to everyone about the situation on the ground,&quot; Zelensky said in a post on X following a virtual summit of European leaders. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer convened the summit on March 15, bringing together 25 members of the &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; &#x2014;&#xA0;Ukraine&apos;s allies who have agreed to support future peacekeeping efforts. Along with European partners, the coalition now includes Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Japan. Following the talks, Starmer announced that the coalition&apos;s peacekeeping efforts were ready to move into the &quot;operational phase.&quot; Zelensky welcomed the coalition&apos;s plans to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine and urged world leaders to apply &quot;strong pressure&quot; to Moscow in order to secure a ceasefire deal. &quot;The world must understand that Russia is the only obstacle preventing peace,&quot; he said. Ukraine has agreed to accept a U.S. proposal for a 30-day interim ceasefire, provided Russia agrees to its terms. Putin on March 13 said that Russia was ready to agree to the ceasefire, but then demanded that Kyiv limit mobilization and training of troops during that period. He also demanded that the West halt all military aid to Ukraine as a condition of the ceasefire. Some analysts have said Putin&apos;s conditions amount to Ukraine&apos;s surrender. Putin has also claimed that Russian troops have encircled Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Kursk Oblast, a report Kyiv has vehemently denied. Zelensky directed his appeal beyond Europe and Western partners, calling on Latin American, Asian, and African nations to recognize that &quot;Putin has been lying to the world&quot; and to back strategies that advance &quot;peace through strength.&quot; in a week we&apos;ll have one	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-is-lying-to-everyone-zelensky-calls-for-strong-pressure-on-russia-after-uk-summit/	2025-03-15T09:42:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/ze.jpeg
Russia readying to attack Sumy as Donbas front stabilizes, Zelensky says	Russian soldiers are amassing at the border to prepare to launch an attack on Ukraine&apos;s northeastern Sumy region, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 15. Zelensky said in a post on Telegram that Ukraine has observed areas along its eastern border where the Russian army is amassing force. &quot;This speaks to a desire to deliver a strike to our Sumy Oblast,&quot; Zelensky wrote. &quot;We understand this and will take countermeasures.&quot; The Ukrainian president also wrote that he hopes foreign leaders would note &quot;that in Moscow they are preparing to ignore diplomacy.&quot; U.S. diplomats were in Moscow this week to hash out a ceasefire deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who remains maximalist in his public demands for concessions from Ukraine. After talks in Saudi Arabia between the U.S. and Ukraine, Kyiv said it was ready to move forward with a ceasefire, provided Russia did the same. Zelensky also wrote that &quot;the situation on the Pokrovsk front has stabilized&quot; after several months during which the city in Donetsk Oblast had been at the center of fighting and periodic threats of Russian encirclement. More recently, Russia has made major advances in Kursk Oblast, a territory in Russia that Ukrainian forces took in August and which Zelensky&apos;s administration had hoped to use as leverage in negotiations. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief has refuted recent reports that Ukrainian troops were under threat of encirclement in Kursk Oblast as Russia pushed further into Ukrainian-held Russian territory. &quot;Thanks to our Ukrainian forces, a significant quantity of Russian forces were pulled away from other fronts to Kursk Oblast,&quot; Zelensky wrote.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-as-the-donbas-stabilizes-russia-is-readying-to-attack-sumy/	2025-03-15T08:39:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/Ze.jpeg
Zelensky appoints Yermak to lead Ukraine's peace delegation	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a decree on March 15 creating a new delegation for international peace negotiations. The delegation will be led by Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelensky&apos;s office, the decree, published on the president&apos;s website, says. Other members include Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Yermak&apos;s deputy, Pavlo Palisa. According to the decree, Yermak, as head of the delegation, has the authority to modify its composition with the approval of the foreign minister. He can also bring on additional government officials, experts, and advisors. Yermak, Sybiha and Umerov also comprised the delegation who negotiated a deal with U.S. representatives in Jeddah for a 30-day ceasefire with fairly limited conditions, including a vague offer to allow U.S. companies into Ukrainian precious mineral mining. Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. are currently locked in negotiations over a potential ceasefire. After a U.S. delegation was in Moscow this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was open to a ceasefire deal, but listed a number of demands of Ukraine that would effectively subjugate Ukraine. Following the talks in Moscow, President Donald Trump said that the &quot;U.S. has received &apos;some pretty good news&apos; on Ukraine-Russia ceasefire, without providing further details. Yermak has been described in the past as the most powerful chief of staff in Ukraine&apos;s history, and has attracted criticism for accumulating unprecedented power and influence within the Zelensky&apos;s Presidential Office. Late last year, Politico included Yermak among the finalists for the &quot;dreamers&quot; category as part of its yearly list of the most influential people in Europe. &quot;Nearly three years into Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, Andriy Yermak&#x2019;s focus has moved from trying to win the war to trying to win the peace,&quot; Politico wrote of Yermak. The former television producer became Zelensky&#x2019;s chief of staff in 2020, becoming an indispensable gatekeeper for the Ukrainian president, dubbed &quot;The Fixer&quot; by Politico.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-appoints-yermak-to-lead-ukraines-peace-delegation/	2025-03-15T08:02:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2039876667.jpg
UK's Starmer says 'troops on the ground and planes in the sky' could secure Ukraine peace deal	Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced today that an expanded coalition of nations is ramping up efforts to back Ukraine in peace negotiations with Russia, following a high-level virtual summit in London on March 15. The coalition, which now includes more partners than were at the initial Lancaster House meeting two weeks ago, will also hold military talks on March 20 to develop &quot;stronger and robust plans&quot; for Ukrainian security guarantees, Starmer said in a press conference following the summit. &quot;We will now move to the operational phase,&quot; Starmer told reporters, emphasizing that the upcoming military discussions will focus on concrete security guarantees that could include &quot;troops on the ground and planes in the sky&quot; if necessary. &quot;We know from history, recent history, that a deal without security arrangements is not something which (Russian President Vladimir) Putin respects,&quot; Starmer said, warning that without proper security guarantees, &quot;Putin will breach the line again.&quot; Starmer also said that participating nations are actively discussing the seizure of frozen Russian assets as part of intensified economic pressure on Moscow. While acknowledging the legal complexities involved, Starmer confirmed that the coalition agreed to implement additional sanctions against Russia immediately. &quot;We agree we will keep increasing the pressure on Russia, keep the military aid flowing to Ukraine, and keep tightening restrictions on Russia&apos;s economy,&quot; Starmer said, calling Russian Putin&apos;s conditional response to peace overtures &quot;not good enough.&quot; Starmer was, however, vague on specific measures he and allies would take to compel Putin to drop some of his more exorbitant demands in ceasefire negotiations. Putin on March 13 said that Moscow was ready to agree to a U.S.-backed 30-day ceasefire but demanded that as part of any cessation of hostilities Kyiv would limit mobilization, training of troops and the West would halt military aid to Ukraine. Some have said Putin&apos;s demands amount to Kyiv&apos;s surrender. The expanded coalition now includes members from Europe, Canada and Australia as well as backing from Japan. Despite the U.S. under President Donald Trump disavowing much of his predecessor&apos;s Ukraine support, Starmer was keen to highlight his national security advisor&apos;s recent discussions in Washington. &quot;We are talking to the U.S. every day about what happens next,&quot; Starmer said, expressing confidence that President Trump is &quot;absolutely committed&quot; to achieving lasting peace in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/uks-starmer-offers-ukraine-troops-on-the-ground-and-planes-in-the-sky/	2025-03-15T07:09:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193577260.jpg
Inside Ukraine's desperate fight to stabilize Donbas front	Amid the escalating geopolitical circus, Ukrainian soldiers fighting in between order and chaos assert that the only way to stop Russia remains on the battlefield.

Russia attacks Ukraine with 178 drones overnight, targets energy infrastructure	Ukrainian defense forces intercepted 130 out of the 178 Russian attack drones launched at Ukraine during an overnight assault on March 14 that included attacks on energy infrastructure. The attack involved two Iskander-M ballistic missiles launched from Kursk Oblast and 178 Shahed-type attack drones along with various decoy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. &#xA0; The wave of attacks began at 7:30 p.m. local time on March 14 and continued throughout the night. Russia launched the drones from multiple locations including Orel, Millerovo, Kursk, Bryansk, and Primorsko-Akhtarsk in Russia, as well as Chauda in occupied Crimea. The Air Force reported that it shot down 130 Shahed-type strike drones and other UAVs over fourteen Ukrainian regions including Kharkiv, Poltava, Sumy, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, and Mykolaiv oblasts. An additional 38 Russian decoy drones were reported &quot;locationally lost&quot; without causing any damage. The attack caused damage in the Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Odesa, Sumy, Chernihiv, and Kyiv regions. Officials have yet to release information about casualties or details of the damage entailed. Reports indicate that the Russian attack hit Ukrainian energy infrastructure in Dnipropetrovsk and Odesa Oblast. Russia has been steadily expanding its air campaigns against Ukraine in recent months, with bombardments by flocks of Shahed drones a nightly occurrence. Ukraine has recently had some success in counterattacks. On the night of March 10, over 330 Ukrainian drones made it to Moscow. Subsequent strikes have hit Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-attacks-ukraine-with-178-drones-overnight-most-intercepted/	2025-03-15T05:39:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/477294535_1198923984935722_5644506664633572859_n-2.jpg
UK Prime Minister Starmer begins summit of Ukraine allies	U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has kicked off an online summit on March 15 of the &quot;coalition of the willing,&quot; who could go on to secure Ukraine in the event of a peace deal with Russia. Starmer urged attendees to &quot;keep the pressure up&quot; on Russian President Vladimir Putin in his opening remarks. The ongoing virtual summit is convening countries who could form a post-war peacekeeping force within Ukraine. As of March 13, the potential coalition consists of 37 countries, with the U.K. and France largely taking the lead as the only countries who have publicly committed to sending troops to Ukraine post-war. Twenty-five nations are attending today, per the U.K. government, which wrote that the meeting would seek &quot;concrete commitments.&quot; The European Union is by and large increasingly taking point on securing Ukraine&apos;s future. Following on a similar meeting at the outset of March, the summit is taking place just days after a U.S. delegation was in Moscow to discuss a ceasefire deal with Putin. Starmer in a statement on March 14 warned Putin against &quot;playing games&quot; with these ceasefire negotiations. Putin has maintained maximalist demands for Ukrainian to cede territory beyond what Russia has actually taken, as well as demilitarization. Starmer himself has become a leading light within European politics for his advocacy of Ukraine, as well as his singular talent at placating U.S. President Donald Trump. The U.K. and the U.S. have what&apos;s referred to the &quot;Special Relationship&quot; &#x2014; deep relations in trade, security and defense, and intelligence. A Starmer spokesperson said last week that, &quot;We&#x2019;ve always said that Ukraine, at the other end of this process, must emerge as a sovereign territory.&quot; The summit represents a pivot in the West&apos;s strategy toward the war in Ukraine to planning for post-conflict stability rather than solely focusing on immediate military support. Putin has been hostile to the presence of foreign soldiers in Ukraine to secure any sort of peace post-war. Ukraine maintains that without firm security guarantees from the West, Putin will use any cessation in hostilities to build up and attack Ukraine again.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-prime-minister-hosts-summit-of-ukraine-allies/	2025-03-15T03:59:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199562091.jpg
Senator Mark Kelly gets rid of his Tesla after Musk calls him 'traitor' for visiting Ukraine	Senator Mark Kelly said he was getting rid of his Tesla Model S after billionaire Elon Musk called the senator a &quot;traitor&quot; on his social media platform X for visiting Ukraine just days after the U.S. paused military aid to Kyiv. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m here in Washington driving to work for the last time in my Tesla,&#x201D; Kelly, a Democrat from Arizona, said in a video posted on X on March 14. &quot;When I bought this thing, I didn&#x2019;t think it was going to become a political issue. Every time I get in this car in the last 60 days or so, it reminds me of just how much damage Elon Musk and Donald Trump is doing to our country,&quot; he said in the video. Musk, owner of SpaceX and now head of the U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), called Kelly a &quot;traitor&quot; on X on March 10 in a thread of the senator&apos;s trip to Ukraine, which included visits with officials and embassy staff, as well as nurses, volunteers, and soldiers. Kelly, a former Navy pilot and astronaut who used to work with Musk&apos;s SpaceX, swiftly replied, criticizing Musk&#x2019;s stance. &quot;Traitor? Elon, if you don&apos;t understand that defending freedom is a basic tenet of what makes America great and keeps us safe, maybe you should leave it to those of us who do,&quot; he wrote on March 10. Along with his video saying that he was ditching his Tesla on March 14, Kelly wrote, &quot;I bought a Tesla because it was fast like a rocket ship. But now every time I drive it, I feel like a rolling billboard for a man dismantling our government and hurting people. So Tesla, you&#x2019;re fired!&quot; &quot;New ride coming soon,&quot; he wrote. The Musk-Kelly exchange came amid heightened tensions between the Trump administration and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and a heated argument in the Oval Office earlier this month. As the Trump team looks to bring a swift end to the war in Ukraine, it has increasingly put pressure on Kyiv, including temporarily pausing military aid and intelligence sharing, while so far making little demands of Russia and President Vladimir Putin.	https://kyivindependent.com/senator-mark-kelly-gets-rid-of-his-tesla-after-musk-calls-him-traitor-for-visiting-ukraine/	2025-03-15T01:35:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GlohTV5W8AAtNmS.jpeg
General Staff: Russia has lost 892,840 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 892,840 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on March 15. The number includes 1,180 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,315 tanks, 21,458 armored fighting vehicles, 40,571 vehicles and fuel tanks, 24,483 artillery systems, 1,315 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,103 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 29,233 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-892-840-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-03-15T00:45:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/IMG_2727--1--2.jpg
Fire erupts near railway station in Russia's Volgograd amid drone strike on oil refinery, media reports	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A fire broke out in a field near the Sarepta railway station in the Russian city of Volgograd in the early hours of March 15, the Russian news channel Astra reported, citing local accounts and geolocated footage. The fire erupted during on ongoing drone attack targeting a nearby oil refinery, residents said. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. The fire is reportedly located near a Gazprom gas station and the Sarepta railway station, several kilometers from the refinery, according to footage geolocated by Astra. Residents of Volgograd reported hearing several explosions and said drones were targeting the city. Russian authorities have not commented on the reported attack. The Volgograd refinery, owned by Russian oil giant Lukoil, has been targeted in previous attacks, most recently in a drone strike on Feb. 15. Ukrainian drones also attacked the facility on Jan. 31, according to the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. The refinery has been targeted multiple times throughout the full-scale war. Ukraine considers Russian oil refineries to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel products and profits continue to supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones.	https://kyivindependent.com/fire-erupts-near-railway-station-in-russias-volgograd-amid-drone-strike-on-oil-refinery-media-reports/	2025-03-14T21:33:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/Image-1_Lukoil-Volgograd-Refinery-Russia.jpeg
US has received 'some pretty good news' on Ukraine-Russia ceasefire, Trump claims	The White House has received &quot;some pretty good news&quot; regarding its attempts to secure a 30-day ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump claimed during a speech at the Justice Department (DOJ) on March 14. Following talks with U.S. officials on March 11, Kyiv agreed to a temporary ceasefire, as long as Russia also abides by its terms. Washington is now attempting to persuade Moscow to accept the deal. &quot;We&apos;ve had some very good calls today with Russia and with Ukraine,&quot; Trump said during his DOJ speech. &quot;They&apos;ve agreed for a ceasefire if we can get it with Russia, and it&apos;s not easy. It&apos;s a tough one. But I think we&apos;re doing it. ... I think we&apos;ve had some very good results. I haven&apos;t been able to say that to anybody else, I haven&apos;t wanted to say it until just before I came here, I got some pretty good news.&quot; Trump did not say what the good news was, nor did he provide additional details on the content of the negotiations. Despite his note of optimism, he acknowledged that there is still &quot;a long way to go.&quot; &#xA0; Earlier in the day, Trump claimed he asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to &quot;spare&quot; Ukrainian troops he said were surrounded by Russian forces in Kursk Oblast &#x2014;&#xA0;a claim he repeated during his speech. Kyiv has denied reports that its troops are encircled in Kursk. Trump also repeated his standard talking point on Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine: namely, that former U.S. President Joe Biden should not have &quot;let&quot; the war happen. &quot;Biden should have never let this war happen,&quot; he said. &quot;First of all, you don&apos;t want to pick on someone that&apos;s a lot larger than you, even with the money. That&apos;s a lot of money that we gave them.&quot; Trump has historically been hesitant to condemn Russia&apos;s blatant aggression and violations of sovereignty, instead preferring to lay the blame on the Biden administration and Ukraine&apos;s own NATO ambitions. Putin said on March 13 that Russia was ready to agree to the proposed 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, but soon followed that up with demands that Ukraine ban mobilizing and training more troops and that the West halt all military aid to Kyiv. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 14 said that the administration was &quot;cautiously optimistic&quot; about progress towards a ceasefire, but added that the situation remains &quot;complex.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-has-received-some-pretty-good-news-on-ukraine-russia-ceasefire-trump-claims/	2025-03-14T20:06:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2205126563.jpg
Germany on track to commit $3.2 billion in military aid to Ukraine, Merz says	A German parliamentary coalition has agreed to allocate 3 billion euros (approximately $3.2 billion) in new military aid to Ukraine as part of a plan to dramatically scale up Berlin&apos;s defense spending, incoming chancellor Friedrich Merz announced on March 14. Merz presented his ambitious spending plan to lawmakers in early March, saying he hoped to secure approval for the military aid under the current, outgoing parliament. A coalition of Merz&apos;s conservative Christian Democratic allliance (CDU/CSU), the Social Democratic Party (SPD), and the Green Party have agreed to reform Germany&apos;s &quot;debt brake&quot; rules and increase defense spending, Merz said in Berlin on March 14. Their combined backing gives Merz the necessary two-thirds support to secure approval when the budget is up for a vote on March 18. &quot;Germany is back,&quot; Merz said. &quot;Germany is making its large contribution to the defense of freedom and peace in Europe.&quot; Outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has confirmed that he will release the additional aid to Ukraine once parliament approves the defense spending package, Merz told reporters. Merz&apos;s ambitious plans for Germany&apos;s defense budget have taken shape amid a wider shift in European security policy. The continent is moving to rearm and assume greater responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s defense amid abrupt changes in U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump. Germany&apos;s next parliament is due to convene on March 25. Roughly one-third of the seats will be held by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the Left Party (Die Linke), both of which oppose military aid for Ukraine. Germany has allocated 4 billion euros ($4.1 billion) in military support for Ukraine this year, and the additional package would raise this to 7 billion ($7.2 billion). The defense articles contained in the new assistance include three IRIS-T air defense systems, three Skyranger air defense systems, 10 howitzers, surface-to-air missiles, 20 protective vehicles, artillery shells, and drones, the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported in January.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-to-commit-3-2-billion-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-merz-says/	2025-03-14T19:02:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200927348.jpg
G7 ministers affirm support for Ukraine amid US tensions with allies	Despite tensions between the Trump administration and several U.S. allies over trade policies and other disputes, G7 foreign ministers meeting in Canada reaffirmed their commitment to Ukraine. The diplomats from Canada, the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the European Union presented a united stance on supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty, though their final statement was notably less forceful than in previous years. The group&#x2019;s communiqu&#xE9;, released on March 14, affirmed Ukraine&#x2019;s &quot;territorial integrity and right to exist,&quot; while condemning Russian &quot;acts of aggression.&quot; However, its language was softer than the G7 leaders&#x2019; statement from November 2024, which had pledged &quot;unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes&quot; and labeled Russia &quot;the sole obstacle&quot; to peace. The shift in tone reflects the diplomatic challenges posed by U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s approach to foreign policy, which has at times questioned U.S. support for Kyiv. During the meeting in La Malbaie, Quebec, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio faced pressure from allies to clarify Washington&#x2019;s position on Ukraine. While he avoided direct confrontation, Rubio emphasized that the U.S. and its partners would &quot;not let things that we don&#x2019;t agree on stop us from agreeing on other things.&quot; Meanwhile, European ministers made symbolic gestures of solidarity with Ukraine. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and EU diplomat Kaja Kallas posted a photo of themselves dressed in Canada&#x2019;s national colors alongside a message to Joly: &quot;We&#x2019;ve got your back.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/g7-ministers-affirm-support-for-ukraine-amid-us-tensions-with-allies/	2025-03-14T18:05:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204487239.jpg
US 'cautiously optimistic' on ceasefire progress after Putin meeting	The Trump administration sees &quot;cautious optimism&quot; in ongoing ceasefire negotiations following a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. The envoy is expected to return this weekend, after which President Donald Trump will assess Russia&#x2019;s position and determine the next steps, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 14. &quot;There is reason to be cautiously optimistic, but by the same token, we continue to recognize this is a difficult and complex situation,&quot; Rubio added. &quot;It will not be easy. It will not be simple. But we certainly feel like we&#x2019;re at least some steps closer to ending this war and bringing peace.&quot; Kyiv has agreed to a temporary ceasefire proposed by Washington during the March 11 talks in Jeddah, contingent on Russia&#x2019;s adherence. The negotiations in Saudi Arabia also led to the U.S. resuming key military and intelligence support for Ukraine. &quot;Ukraine is not an obstacle to peace; it is a partner in restoring it,&quot; said Deputy Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, who participated in the talks. He emphasized that Ukraine&apos;s acceptance of the proposed truce demonstrates &quot;who is really interested in peace.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin said on March 13 that Moscow is prepared to accept the ceasefire but demanded that Ukraine halt mobilization, military training, and foreign military aid deliveries during the truce. Trump called Putin&apos;s remarks &quot;very promising&quot; but &quot;not complete,&quot; adding that he is open to meeting with the Russian leader. Rubio emphasized that U.S. foreign policy is based on actions rather than trust. When asked whether he believes Putin&#x2019;s commitments, Rubio dismissed the question. &quot;It&#x2019;s not about trusting, it&#x2019;s about actions,&quot; he said. &quot;You either do things or you don&#x2019;t. That&#x2019;s what foreign policy is driven by, and that&#x2019;s how our decisions should be made.&quot; While the White House sees progress, officials acknowledge the challenges of securing a ceasefire that meets U.S. and Ukrainian conditions. The administration expects further internal discussions this weekend after Witkoff briefs Trump on his talks in Moscow. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s been a good week on that front, but there&#x2019;s a lot of work that remains to be done,&quot; Rubio said. &quot;We&#x2019;ll know more once Special Envoy Witkoff returns and we have a chance to all convene and talk about it.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/rubio-says-us-cautiously-optimistic-on-ceasefire-progress-after-putin-meeting/	2025-03-14T16:29:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193483462.jpg
Macron urges Russia to accept US-Ukraine ceasefire proposal	French President Emmanuel Macron called on Russia to accept a proposed 30-day ceasefire deal put forward by the United States and Ukraine. Macron said he discussed the situation on March 14 with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and President Volodymyr Zelensky. In his evening address, Zelensky said that he and Macron had talked about diplomatic efforts, the feasibility of a ceasefire, and the technical aspects of its oversight. He emphasized that Ukraine has France&#x2019;s full support in these matters. Ukraine has started assembling a team to develop monitoring mechanisms for a potential 30-day ceasefire, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha announced on March 14. Speaking at a press conference in Kyiv alongside Austrian Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger, Sybiha emphasized the complexity of establishing an effective oversight process. &quot;We have already started forming a national team to develop appropriate processes to properly control a possible ceasefire. This is an extremely complex process,&quot; he said. Kyiv agreed to the U.S.-proposed truce during March 11 talks in Jeddah, contingent on Russia&#x2019;s adherence to its terms. The negotiations also resulted in Washington resuming military and intelligence assistance to Ukraine. Sybiha underscored the logistical challenges of enforcing a ceasefire along Ukraine&#x2019;s 1,300-kilometer (800-mile) front line. Ukraine remains skeptical of Russian intentions, citing past violations of the Minsk agreements. &quot;So now everything will be aimed at ensuring that the Ukrainian side is ready with the appropriate teams, developments, and modalities,&quot; Sybiha added. According to Kyiv, Russia violated the previous Minsk accords 25 times. On March 13, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow was open to accepting the ceasefire but insisted that Ukraine suspend mobilization, military training, and foreign military aid deliveries for the duration of the truce. U.S. President Donald Trump responded to Putin&#x2019;s remarks, calling them &quot;very promising&quot; but &quot;not complete,&quot; and indicated a willingness to meet with the Russian leader. Zelensky dismissed Putin&#x2019;s statement, warning that Russia is already laying the groundwork to reject the ceasefire.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-urges-russia-to-accept-us-ukraine-ceasefire-proposal/	2025-03-14T15:00:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2167956439.jpg
‘I can’t sit and watch it’ – US volunteers join Ukrainian army after Trump’s sharp policy turn	Editor&#x2019;s note: Soldiers interviewed for this article are identified only by their first name, callsign, or nickname due to security reasons. William, a 25-year-old U.S. Army veteran, has come to Ukraine to join the Ukrainian military in its fight against Russian aggression just days after his contract with the U.S. military ended in March. The artilleryman&#x2019;s original plan was to come here in summer, but as the new U.S. President Donald Trump made a dramatic U-turn in Ukraine policy, the need to travel to the war-torn country felt more urgent. &#x201C;It&apos;s frustrating to sit around doing nothing when you know you can do something right,&#x201D; William told the Kyiv Independent a day before leaving for Ukraine. William says he has felt drawn to Ukraine ever since the 2013-2014 EuroMaidan Revolution in Kyiv. As a high school student in Tennessee, he was moved by the Ukrainian uprising against a pro-Russian, anti-Western regime. He is among the many Americans who have decided to join the Ukrainian army during the full-scale invasion, especially after the heated exchange between Trump, his Vice President JD Vance and President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Oval Office on Feb. 28. In the following week, the U.S. abruptly suspended its military aid and intelligence sharing for Ukraine &#x2013; before resuming it this week. However, the U.S.&#x2019; increasing alignment with Russia continues to cast doubt on the future of its support for Ukraine. One of the most elite Ukrainian units accepting foreign volunteers received &#x201C;a massive spike&#x201D; of applications, according to an international serviceman involved in recruiting. The source, who spoke anonymously due to his unit&#x2019;s regulations, said that a few thousand applications came in after the Oval Office meeting, with &#x201C;a significant amount of guys expressing outrage and shock over what has been happening with the shift in American policy.&#x201D; U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky meet in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on Feb. 28, 2025. (Photo by Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)Another recruit, Ron, &#xA0;who was previously deployed in Afghanistan with the U.S. Army, said he contacted the Ukrainian military as soon as Trump took office and the U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing bans were set forth. Feeling &#x201C;embarrassed by my country,&#x201D; the American exit in supporting Ukraine &#x201C;sealed it for me&#x201D; to come fight in Ukraine, the 35-year-old Colorado native explained. &#x201C;I&apos;m a patriot. I love my country. But the people who are in charge of it right now are destroying it, just destroying what it should stand for,&#x201D; Ron told the Kyiv Independent a month before his departure for Ukraine. &#x201C;It&apos;s an absolute shame to me. I just can&apos;t sit by and watch it happen anymore, especially when the people of Ukraine are so freaking brave, and they&apos;re doing such great work with the limited equipment we have given them.&#x201D; While Ron said he was &#x201C;shocked&#x201D; that Trump was reelected as the president, he, like some other American recruits, also cautiously hoped that &#x201C;maybe he would actually do the right thing on Ukraine.&#x201D; &#x201C;But that first month of him in the office just completely shattered any illusion of that for me,&#x201D; Ron said. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s just selfish and only wants quick fixes,&#x201D; Ron added, referring to the U.S. trying to pressure Ukraine into a rushed peace deal to end the war at any cost. Trump has pledged to end the war quickly, resuming the long-frozen diplomacy with Russia and priding himself on having a &#x201C;very close relationship&#x201D; with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. Trump&#x2019;s America-first policy has also left European nations on alert. Media reports have suggested that he is considering a dramatic shift in the U.S.&#x2019;s involvement in NATO, refusing to defend another member state as part of Article 5 if it doesn&#x2019;t meet the defense spending threshold. Worried that the U.S. could eventually completely abandon Europe, Ron said he decided that he needs to do his part to avoid what he believes could be &#x201C;a general war in Europe with Russia&#x201D; in the near future. A former U.S. Army Cavalry Scout, who goes by his callsign Juggernaut, also said he &#x201C;felt sick to the stomach&#x201D; after seeing the U.S. decreasing its support for Ukraine despite Russia&#x2019;s horrific war crimes against civilians across the country. He finished his seven-year contract with the U.S. Army a week after Trump&#x2019;s inauguration. He came over to Ukraine in February and is currently awaiting training with a Ukrainian unit. Although he voted for Trump in 2024, the 28-year-old Hawaii resident said he felt &#x201C;really disappointed&#x201D; in his leadership even though he understands the America-first policy. &#x201C;We only have so long on this earth, and worrying about ourselves isn&#x2019;t going to bring us any gratification at the end of our lives,&#x201D; Juggernaut told the Kyiv Independent from eastern Ukraine. He said that his fear of coming here and &#x201C;dying for no reason&#x201D; faded when he arrived in Ukraine and saw first-hand what the country and its people were going through. &#x201C;I kind of stopped thinking like that because I&apos;m a spiritual person, and it made me sick to my stomach, the idea of Russians taking over this country and these people here suffering even more than they already have,&#x201D; Juggernaut said. A 40-year-old father and lawyer from Texas, who introduced himself as Esquire, is another recruit waiting in Kyiv to join the Ukrainian military. While he has no prior army experience, he said he made the decision to enlist because he did not want to live for the rest of his days knowing he was &#x201C;a coward.&#x201D; Esquire wonders if his two kids and his wife, who begged him not to go, would ever forgive him for making what everyone back home believed would be &#x201C;a meaningful sacrifice,&#x201D; but he stressed that he could not just watch the world turn upside down. &#x201C;I feel betrayed, sickened, and like my country is no longer what I thought it was,&#x201D; Esquire told the Kyiv Independent at a cafe in Kyiv. &#x201C;I mourn my country like I mourn a dead friend.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/a-massive-spike-in-foreign-volunteers-joining-ukrainian-army-after-us-sharp-policy-turn/	2025-03-14T14:36:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204541704.jpg
Ukraine’s cyber chief wants ‘tens of thousands’ more computer whizzes to combat Russian hackers	Formally a brigadier general, Oleksandr Potiy is today tasked with guarding Ukraine on the civilian side &#x2014; far from the battlefield but right at the front line of Russia&#x2019;s cyber war. Potiy is in camo fatigues when he addresses the crowd of IT workers and foreign investors for the keynote address at the Kyiv International Cyber Resilience Forum that took place on March 11-12. &#x201C;Our priority is a departure from the traditional schema of a KSZI,&#x201D; Potiy tells the Kyiv Independent in an interview on the conference&#x2019;s sidelines, referring to a Soviet acronym for information defense that had a reputation of being corrupt. &#x201C;We totally changed the approach.&#x201D; In December, Potiy took charge of Derzhspetszvyazku, or the State Service of Special Communications. The agency guards the Ukrainian government&#x2019;s digital infrastructure. It&#x2019;s a job that&#x2019;s grown massively in the four years since Potiy first joined the agency, which now has a headcount of 1,300. Russia has long been a breeding ground for some of the most aggressive hackers in the world. As an overture to the February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, those hackers launched a salvo of cyber attacks at Ukraine, one that continues to the present day. Despite systems &#x2014; including massive telecomms networks &#x2014; going down periodically, Ukraine has remained remarkably steadfast in the face of this assault. The agency monitors and tracks upwards of 3,000 attacks each year on the Ukrainian civil government alone &#x2014; not including the military, whose digital security falls to the Defense Ministry and intelligence agencies. The most recent report for the first half of 2024 counts among major threats a DDoS gang going by &#x201C;From Russia with Love&#x201D; and another cyber gang based in Russian-occupied Luhansk who &#x201C;factually are traitors,&#x201D; per the report. Those are in addition to hacking groups long associated with Russian intelligence and General Staff like Sandworm and Armageddon. Attacks have included a spear-phishing campaign that used QR codes to short-circuit Signal &#x2014; increasingly a go-to messenger for Ukrainians seeking security away from Russian-originated Telegram &#x2014; and link hostile devices that government officials are unaware are reading their classified or private comms. The aggregate figure of the most recent report notes a significant increase in the total number of attacks but a merciful decline in those defined as &#x201C;critical&#x201D; from 31 to 3. Nonetheless, Ukraine needs a new training and certification scheme, Potiy said, ambitiously aiming at fostering a new generation of cyber security specialists, &#x201C;tens of thousands if not more,&#x201D; with solid jobs within Ukraine. It is one of his core ambitions for his first year in charge of the agency. &#x201C;We have educational institutions that turn out cybersecurity specialists who could provide services,&#x201D; Potiy continued. &#x201C;But there&#x2019;s no job market.&#x201D; Aside from a simple mass of professional cybersecurers, Potiy aims to distribute the authorities &#x2014; decentralization, in other words. Centralization is one of the cardinal sins of cybersecurity, one that was likely responsible for a collapse in government data that rattled Ukraine in December. The agency is taking as a model for a new regional network of cyber offices the European Union&#x2019;s National Coordination Centers. An overarching goal of the Ukrainian government is the &#x201C;harmonization&#x201D; of its practices with EU law &#x2014; preparation for eventually joining the union. At the conference, the agency signed a memorandum of understanding with a number of European counter-parties, entailing some fairly vague concepts of cooperation. Part of what that translates to in practice is data-sharing from the agency to the West on the cyberattacks they face, Potiy explains. &#x201C;We have obtained unique experience, which today can prove useful to partners from around the world,&#x201D; Potiy told the crowd at the conference&#x2019;s opening. The Ukrainian cyber dataset is potentially extremely valuable for Western cybersecurity agencies, as many of the attacks Russian hackers are launching against Ukraine today are easy enough to replicate on Western systems tomorrow. Speaking on what turned into the last day of frozen U.S. weapons aid and intel sharing with Ukraine, Potiy noted that the agency had not stopped providing its network of data to analogous Western cyber agencies, including the American CISA. &#x201C;We have a very tight relationship with our American partners and friends,&#x201D; Potiy said. &#x201C;We, as competent technical professionals, are still working with them like we worked before.&#x201D; In addition to its cyber duties, by an odd set of circumstances at the war&#x2019;s outset, the agency ended up holding the purse strings for Ukraine&#x2019;s drone purchases. It retains, today, a budget of Hr 65 billion &#x2014; just over $1.5 billion. Potiy&#x2019;s own ascension in December was part of a scandal in which anti-corruption activists raised alarms that the new office would stop publishing information on those drone purchases, including cost and quantity, on Ukraine&#x2019;s public platform for government acquisitions, Prozorro. &#x201C;Everything&#x2019;s done in accordance with the legislation of Ukraine, including acquisitions going through Prozorro,&#x201D; said Potiy. When asked if that was going to change, Potiy answered, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s established procedure.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-cyber-chief-talks-decentralization-and-the-need-for-tens-of-thousands-more-computer-whizzes-to-combat-russian-hackers/	2025-03-14T13:45:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/1-187.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Kyiv denies Trump's claims of Ukrainian encirclement in Kursk Oblast	Key developments on March 14: Ukraine&apos;s General Staff on March 14 denied claims that Ukrainian troops were encircled in Kursk Oblast amid Russia&apos;s ongoing offensive in the region. The General Staff said that Russia had been reporting an alleged encirclement of Ukrainian forces in Kursk Oblast &quot;for political purposes and to put pressure on Ukraine and its partners.&quot; The statement came after U.S. President Donald Trump said that his administration held &quot;productive discussions&quot; with Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 13, during which he urged him to &quot;spare&quot; surrounded Ukrainian troops. &quot;At this very moment, thousands of Ukrainian troops are completely surrounded by the Russian military, and in a very bad and vulnerable position,&quot; Trump wrote, without providing any evidence. Speaking during a meeting of Russia&apos;s Security Council, Putin claimed on March 14 that some Ukrainian troops &quot;are blocked&quot; in the embattled Russian region. Following Trump&apos;s remarks, he said that Ukrainian soldiers must surrender in Kursk Oblast. Neither Trump nor Putin provided evidence that Ukrainian troops are currently surrounded at any location. &quot;The units have regrouped, moved to more favorable defense lines and are completing their assigned tasks in Kursk Oblast,&quot; the General Staff said. &quot;There is no threat of encirclement of our units.&quot; &quot;Our soldiers are repelling the enemy&apos;s offensive and inflicting effective fire damage from all types of weapons.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. Later in the day, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on March 14 that the Kursk operation &quot;has completed its task.&quot; He said that Ukraine was able to stabilize the situation near Pokrovsk as well. Drones launched by Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) struck two gas compressor stations and a warehouse storing missiles for Russia&apos;s S-300/S-400 air defense systems, an intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on March 14. The long-range drones targeted gas compressor stations in Russia&apos;s Tambov and Saratov oblasts, according to the source. Another strike reportedly hit a missile depot near the village of Radkovka in Belgorod Oblast, triggering a detonation of stored ammunition. &quot;The SBU conducted another successful special operation on enemy territory, causing significant damage to Russia&apos;s budget and reducing its ability to finance and sustain the war,&quot; the source said. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. Ukrainian drones struck the Tuapse oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai overnight on March 14, setting fire to a gasoline storage tank, regional Governor Veniamin Kondratiev said. &quot;The area of the fire is more than 1,000 square meters, and emergency services are working,&quot; Kondratiev wrote on Telegram, claiming there were no casualties. Russian pro-government media outlet Mash reported that the fire was caused by debris from a downed drone. Eyewitnesses reportedly heard a series explosions over several minutes. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Kyiv has not commented on the attack. The Tuapse oil refinery, with an annual processing capacity of 12 million tons, plays a key role in supplying fuel to the Russian military. Following an earlier strike, the facility underwent an emergency shutdown in May 2024. Russian President Vladimir Putin has not abandoned his maximalist goal of controlling Ukraine, despite U.S. efforts to broker a ceasefire, the Washington Post (WP) reported on March 13, citing sources familiar with classified U.S. intelligence reports. Putin has a &quot;long-standing desire to restore &#x2018;Mother Russia&apos;&quot; and remains determined to assert power over Kyiv, one official said commenting on the U.S. intelligence assessment circulated among President Donald Trump&apos;s administration on March 6. Some officials reportedly believe that even if Russia agrees to a temporary truce, Moscow will use the pause to rearm, violate the agreement, and create provocations to blame on Ukraine. Moscow views Trump as weak, lacking a basic set of principles, and potentially open to manipulation, a European intelligence official told WP, citing fresh intelligence. If a permanent ceasefire is reached, Russia is likely to revert to the &quot;hybrid&quot; or non-military tactics it used to undermine Ukraine before its full-scale invasion in 2022, the official added. U.S. officials are reportedly cautious in assessing what peace terms Putin might agree to, but see no indication that he has backed down from his demand to bring Kyiv into Russia&apos;s sphere of influence. The fate of Ukraine&apos;s Russian-occupied territories was discussed with the U.S. during the talks in Saudi Arabia earlier this week, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on March 14. Zelensky&apos;s comments come days after Kyiv agreed to a 30-day ceasefire put forth by the U.S. during the negotiations in Jeddah. Russian President Vladimir Putin placed demands in order to begin talks on a possible ceasefire that included guarantees to not mobilize or train new troops, nor receive military aid during from the West. Previously, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Ukraine-U.S. talks included discussions about potential &quot;territorial concessions&quot; as part of a negotiated settlement with Russia. According to Zelensky, discussions of the territories were not part of the meeting&apos;s agenda. He reiterated that Ukraine will not recognize any occupied territories as part of Russia under a potential future peace agreement with Moscow. &quot;The American side goes into details. For example, the city of Enerhodar... You can&apos;t just say: here&apos;s the (Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power) Plant, and the city is separate. I believe that the issue of territories is the most difficult one after the issue of establishing a ceasefire,&quot; Zelensky said. Control over the nuclear plant in occupied Enerhodar was discussed during U.S.-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia, U.S. President Donald Trump said.

Russian missile attack on Kryvyi Rih injures at least 4	Russian troops attacked a residential area in Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast with ballistic missiles injuring at least four people, Governor Serhii Lysak said. Explosions in Kryvyi Rih were reported almost immediately after the Air Force said on March 14 that Russia had launched missiles. Photos published on social media show a building severely damaged by the Russian attack. The consequences of the attack are yet to be determined. Emergency service workers are currently working on site, Lysak said. Last week, Russia struck a hotel in Kryvyi Rih, killing six people and injuring over 30 others, including children. Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelensky, remains a frequent target of Russian missile attacks. With a population of about 660,000, it is the second-largest city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, located roughly 70 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the nearest front line.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-on-kryvyi-rih-injures-at-least-4/	2025-03-14T12:23:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-14_20-30-28.jpg
Belarus Weekly: Belarus drops out of top 20 global arms exporters list	Russia proposed building a drone factory in Belarus with an annual capacity of 100,000 units. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko appoints new government ahead of his seventh &#x201C;inauguration.&#x201D; Belarus cracks down on the unemployed amid workforce shortages. UN experts urge Belarus to end the incommunicado detention of political prisoner Siarhei Tsikhanouski, after two years of him being hidden from the public eye. Belarus drops out of the top 20 global arms exporters, SIPRI report finds. Russia has proposed to build a drone factory in Belarus capable of producing 100,000 drones every year, the press office of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko reported on March 6. Deputy Head of the Russia Presidential Administration Maxim Oreshkin made the offer during a meeting with Lukashenko at a military exhibition in Minsk, the press office said. The drones will reportedly be built using Russian licenses. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s very important that Belarus has its own (drone) production facilities, which would strengthen both its economy and national security,&#x201D; Oreshkin said. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re ready to build the plant. We guarantee: you wouldn&#x2019;t be able to build it in Russia the way you could build it here,&#x201C; Lukashenko said in response. The announcement does not specify whether the plant will produce military drones. Yury Kozarenko, a member of the Russian delegation, said that drone production in Belarus could contribute billions to Belarus&#x2019;s GDP, as drones are also used in agriculture, logistics, and education. A staunch Kremlin ally, Lukashenko has repeatedly claimed that Belarus needs to prepare for war and adapt to modern warfare. The Belarusian Defense Ministry reported on Nov. 15, 2024, that it was developing military drones domestically. By the end of 2025, the Belarusian military is expected to have &#x201C;a wide range of combat drones,&#x201D; including a 30-kilometer range &#x201C;Chekan-V&#x201D; and &#x201C;Peacemaker&#x201D; with a reported 10 kilogram warhead and a 100 kilometer range, according to the Head of Application and Development of the Unmanned Aerial Systems department of the Belarusian army, Mikhail Bransky. Currently, Russia uses around 100 to 200 Iranian-developed Shahed-type kamikaze drones in its daily attacks on Ukraine, Vadym Skibitskyi, the deputy head of Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence agency (HUR), said on March 3. Russia plans to increase the number of drones and sites from which drones will be launched, he added. Since July 2024, Russian drones have crossed into Belarusian airspace with increasing frequency. Some of them have crashed in the vicinity of residential areas, although so far without causing casualties. Minsk has never publicly objected to Moscow over these incursions, and local authorities tend to conceal incidents and provide no comment. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, not yet officially inaugurated as president following the Jan. 26 sham presidential elections, has appointed a new government, naming Alexander Turchin as the country&#x2019;s new prime minister. Lukashenko began his seventh consecutive term as president amid widespread repressions and in an atmosphere of fear, human rights activists report. The Belarusian autocrat maintained his grip on power by brutally suppressing nationwide protests that engulfed the country following fraudulent 2020 presidential elections. Turchin, the new prime minister, was appointed on March 10, after previously serving as head of the Minsk regional executive committee. He is under EU, U.K., Swiss and Norwegian sanctions over the suppression of mass protests in 2020. Following the appointment, Turchin told reporters that Belarus would not see any &#x201C;significant course correction,&#x201D; adding that his approach would be one of &#x201C;evolution without revolutions.&#x201D; His predecessor, Raman Halouchanka, was transferred to the position of head of the Belarusian National Bank. While announcing the appointment, Lukashenko called for the bank and the government to &#x201C;find common ground&#x201D; in terms of financing the economy. Analysts say the appointment of Halouchanka will weaken the bank&#x2019;s monetary policy, as the former prime minister lacks a background in finance. Lukashenko has previously ordered government interventions in the economy, and was forced to subsidize struggling state-owned enterprises. Inflation risks are mounting, according to Beroc, the country&#x2019;s leading independent economic think tank. In 2024, inflation was reined in to 5.2% with the help of heavy government regulation of consumer goods pricing. If the restrictions were to be relaxed, inflation would accelerate to 6-8%, experts believe. Lukashenko presented the official appointments as the advent of a &#x201C;new generation&#x201D; in Belarusian leadership. However, the government consists largely of the same ministers, except for Uladzimir Karanik, formerly the chairman of one of the Regional Executive Committees, who was appointed deputy prime minister, and Kiryl Zalesky, the former head of the High-Tech Park information technology development initiative, who became minister of informatization. Political analysts do not foresee any real changes, saying that in general, the appointments were an &#x201C;old system masquerading as new.&#x201D; Belarusian authorities are attempting to remedy the country&#x2019;s current labor shortages by targeting the unemployed with a special tax, independent Belarusian media have reported. Belarus in 2015 adopted a Soviet-style decree requiring working-age citizens without formal employment or income to pay an annual fee of about $200. Dubbed &#x201C;the tax on parasitism,&#x201D; the measure sparked mass protests and was suspended in 2017. It came into effect again three years later, replacing the direct tax with the obligation to pay the full cost of household utilities, which are typically subsidized by the government. Currently, the rate is five times higher for those considered &#x201C;parasites.&#x201D; In February 2025, Belarus&#x2019;s Interior Minister Ivan Kubarkov announced raids against &#x201C;deadbeats&#x201D; &#x2014; the working-age citizens who have not been officially employed for a long time, have no declared income, and don&#x2019;t pay taxes. The announcement followed Lukashenko&#x2019;s claim on Jan. 21 that it was necessary to bring more unemployed people back into the labor market. Throughout the first weeks of March, Belarusians in Minsk were summoned en masse to the employment administration and questioned regarding their sources of income. The exiled Belarusian news outlet Nasha Niva reported that summons were delivered even to those who had left the country decades ago. Belarus is grappling with a serious labor shortages: the state jobs database currently lists 188,700 vacant postings, a significant amount for a nation of 9.5 million with an estimated 4-4.5 million workforce. Healthcare alone faces a shortfall of 10,000 workers. Up to 57% of employers in Belarus reported experiencing a shortages of staff, according to the independent research center rabota.by. The Eurasian Development Bank foresees further wage increases in 2025, fueled by competition over scarce labor. The natural aging of the population in Belarus is being exacerbated by the mass emigration of the most economically and politically active population, the economic think tank Beroc reports. By various accounts, between 300,000 and 500,000 Belarusians have left the country since 2020, after that year&#x2019;s fraudulent elections triggered massive protests and a subsequent crackdown on public protests. At the same time, former political prisoners are not being offered jobs, and workers are being dismissed for supporting an opposition candidate in 2020. On March 3, Lukashenko reiterated his demand that people who participated in protests should not be hired, slamming them as &#x201C;the enemies of the state.&#x201D; Sixteen United Nations human rights experts issued a statement on March 7 demanding that the Belarusian authorities disclose the fate and whereabouts of former presidential candidate and political prisoner Siarhei Tsikhanouski. The jailed activist, who sought to challenge Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko in the 2020 presidential elections, has been held incommunicado for the past two years. Among Belarus&#x2019;s 1,200 political prisoners, nine leaders of the 2020 pro-democracy movement remain fully isolated from the outside world in what&#x2019;s known as an incommunicado regime. The human rights community considers the regime to be a form of enforced disappearance that amounts to torture.

Blogger and entrepreneur Siarhei Tsikhanouski is serving a nineteen-and-a-half year term in prison. Arrested in May 2020, two months before the election, he was charged with obstructing the public&#x2019;s electoral rights, organizing riots, and inciting hatred. While in prison he was given an additional 18-month sentence for allegedly disobeying the penal colony administration. His lawyers and family have not received any information about him since March 2023. Belarus has dropped out of the world&#x2019;s top-20 arms exporters, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) published on March 10. Shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Belarus quickly became a major arms exporter, ranking 11th globally. Between 1999 and 2006, the country reportedly earned an estimated $1 billion by selling off the arsenal it inherited from the collapsed empire, prompting the U.S. Congress to pass a motion, which required annual reporting on Belarusian arms exports. Belarus had remained in the 20th position since 2019 despite a 37% decline in exports. Meanwhile, its arms imports, coming exclusively from Russia, grew by a third. In recent years, Serbia, Vietnam, and Uganda have been the top buyers of Belarusian weapons. Belarusian arms deals have drawn scrutiny, with multiple media investigations conducted into Lukashenko&#x2019;s close circle of businessmen, Alexander Zingman and Oleg Vodchits, for facilitating arms sales to African countries. On March 7, the head of the military government of Myanmar, Min Aung Hlaing, was in Minsk to discuss arms supplies, the exiled Myanmar Mizzima News Media reported. Belarus backed Russia in its aggression against Ukraine but has abstained from sending its troops to the battlefield. Experts attribute Lukashenko&#x2019;s reluctance to an overwhelming anti-war consensus domestically, which might cause massive unrest in Belarus while not providing much help to Russia on the front line.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-belarus-drops-out-of-the-top-20-global-arms-exporters/	2025-03-14T12:13:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204444160.jpg
Ukraine, US discuss fate of Russian-occupied territories, Zelensky says	The fate of Ukraine&apos;s Russian-occupied territories was discussed with the U.S. during the talks in Saudi Arabia earlier this week, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on March 14. Zelensky&apos;s comments come days after Kyiv agreed to a 30-day ceasefire put forth by the U.S. during the negotiations in Jeddah. Russian President Vladimir Putin placed demands in order to begin talks on a possible ceasefire that included guarantees to not mobilize or train new troops, nor receive military aid during from the West. Previously, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Ukraine-U.S. talks included discussions about potential &quot;territorial concessions&quot; as part of a negotiated settlement with Russia. According to Zelensky, discussions of the territories were not part of the meeting&apos;s agenda. He reiterated that Ukraine will not recognize any occupied territories as part of Russia under a potential future peace agreement with Moscow. &quot;The American side goes into details. For example, the city of Enerhodar... You can&apos;t just say: here&apos;s the (Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power) Plant, and the city is separate. I believe that the issue of territories is the most difficult one after the issue of establishing a ceasefire,&quot; Zelensky said. Control over the nuclear plant in occupied Enerhodar was discussed during U.S.-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia, U.S. President Donald Trump said. The largest nuclear plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in the city of Enerhodar, has been under Russian occupation since 2022. While the facility remains under Russian control, it is not currently generating electricity. Ukraine and its allies have repeatedly urged Russia to withdraw its troops from the plant. Throughout its occupation, the plant has been repeatedly disconnected from the Ukrainian power grid due to Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure. Russian forces currently occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine, from where reports of systematic repression, torture, and forced deportations regularly emerge.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-discusses-ter/	2025-03-14T12:07:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204348100.jpg
Conditions for Ukraine's surrender' — Why Putin's demands for ceasefire make no sense	Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s conditions for a ceasefire are unrealistic and tantamount to demanding that Ukraine disarm itself and surrender, analysts say. Putin said on March 13 that Russia was ready to agree to the U.S.-backed 30-day-long ceasefire in Ukraine but then followed by listing a number of demands &#x2014; a ban on Ukrainian mobilization or training of troops and a halt on Western military aid for Kyiv. Putin also hinted that Ukrainian troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast must surrender. Later the same day, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s envoy, Steve Witkoff, met Putin in Moscow. Trump reacted by saying on March 14, &quot;We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end.&quot; &quot;It appears that Putin pretends to accept a ceasefire in principle, in order not to be criticized for being obstructive, but demands concessions as a precondition,&quot; Richard Betts, professor emeritus of war and peace studies at Columbia University, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This is consistent with his previous demands that Ukraine must agree to concessions before Russia negotiates with it. In short, Putin appears to view negotiations for a peace agreement not as a bargaining process but as a process for arranging the conditions of Ukraine&apos;s surrender.&quot; Peter Rough, a senior fellow at Hudson Institute, argued that &quot;Putin can&apos;t afford to say no to Trump altogether but will add a series of conditions.&quot; &quot;Putin may not be able to take Kyiv in this round of war, but he may be able to get the Donbas, and he will try to apply the Georgia model of hybrid war to take Kyiv later,&quot; he said. &quot;His response to the ceasefire proposal is only the first in a series of counter-proposals to achieve that goal. The bottom line is he hasn&apos;t changed his goal of subsuming Ukraine.&quot; William Wohlforth, a professor focusing on international relations at Dartmouth College, also said that &quot;Putin&apos;s highly conditional &apos;unconditional&apos; acceptance of the &apos;idea&apos; of a ceasefire is meant to play for time and see how much pressure the Trump administration is willing to exert, and on whom, to make progress.&quot; &quot;To me, Putin&apos;s comments in response to the ceasefire idea suggest a desire to sustain momentum in the improvement in relations with the Trump administration while at the same time not saying anything that would compromise his larger political objective with respect to Ukraine,&quot; he added. Putin said, &quot;We agree with the proposals to cease hostilities, but they must lead to long-term peace and address the root causes of the crisis.&quot; Bettina Renz, a professor of international security at Nottingham University and the author of the book &quot;Russia&apos;s Military Revival,&quot; argued that &quot;his demand that the &apos;root causes&apos; of the war need to be addressed as a precondition for the ceasefire agreement is particularly concerning.&quot; &quot;Thinking back to February 2022, the &apos;root causes&apos; of and justifications for the invasion listed by the Kremlin were sweeping and included, amongst other things, NATO enlargement since the 1990s, a denial of the legitimacy of the democratically elected Ukrainian government, and the &apos;militarisation&apos; of Ukraine,&quot; she said. &quot;If addressing these &apos;root causes&apos; in Russia&apos;s favor is a precondition for a 30-day ceasefire agreement in the Kremlin&apos;s eyes, this is clearly unreasonable and unrealistic. At this point, it looks like the Kremlin will be prepared to agree to a ceasefire only under conditions that are ideal for Russia.&quot; Putin also claimed that Russian troops were &quot;advancing on almost all sections of the front line.&quot; &quot;Conditions are also being created there for us to encircle and block entire fairly large enemy units,&quot; he said. &quot;How will these 30 days be used? Will forced mobilization continue in Ukraine? Will weapons be supplied there? Will newly mobilized units undergo training? Or will none of this happen?&quot; Putin&apos;s claims about Russia&apos;s all-around advances were false. Russia has been on the offensive in Donetsk Oblast since 2023. However, in recent months, its advance has slowed down in many areas, with Ukraine even conducting counteroffensives near the towns of Pokrovsk and Toretsk. The Kremlin&apos;s only major success in recent weeks was Ukraine&apos;s withdrawal from a part of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast as Russian troops cut off logistical routes in the region. Putin&apos;s demand that Ukraine should stop mobilization and training and should not receive Western military aid does not make any sense and will not be accepted by Kyiv, experts say. &quot;Of course, Ukraine won&apos;t put limits on its own military forces. That would be suicidal,&quot; Rough said. &quot;It also won&apos;t stop asking for and receiving weapons from the West. That would be suicidal as well. These are non-starters, and even Putin must understand that.&quot; Stefan Wolff, professor of international security at the University of Birmingham, told the Kyiv Independent that Putin &quot;wants a weak Ukraine that is unable to defend itself and has no ability to resist Russian pressure.&quot; &quot;The sooner he achieves that, the more likely it is that he can impose his own conditions,&quot; he added. &quot;Part of his original war aims was the demilitarization of Ukraine, and part of this is depriving Ukraine of Western military support.&quot; Renz argued that &quot;Putin&apos;s concerns over Ukraine using a 30-day ceasefire to regroup and rearm, and over the difficulties of monitoring such a ceasefire, refer to limitations affecting any ceasefire agreement.&quot; &quot;Ceasefire agreements are always merely a first step in the cessation of armed conflict and a compromise, and their success can never be guaranteed,&quot; she added. &quot;Clearly, the Ukrainian leadership has similar concerns about a ceasefire agreement with Russia. However, in comparison to the Kremlin, the Ukrainian leadership willingly expressed the readiness to accept a ceasefire despite these risks.&quot; Volodymyr Ariev, a member of parliament from the opposition European Solidarity party, told the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine could put forward counter-demands. For example, Kyiv could say that Russia should stop transporting extra military equipment to Ukraine and recruiting soldiers for its war effort, he added. Putin also claimed that &quot;in the coming days, a physical blockade (of Ukrainian troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast) will take place, meaning that no one will be able to leave at all.&quot; &quot;There will only be two options &#x2014; surrender or perish,&quot; he said. &quot;If we cease hostilities for 30 days, what does that mean? That everyone there will be allowed to leave without a fight? Are we supposed to let them go after they have committed numerous crimes against civilians?&quot; No evidence has been provided for Putin&apos;s claim about alleged Ukrainian war crimes in Kursk Oblast, and there is no independent confirmation that Ukrainian troops are at risk of being blockaded. Everything that Putin said is either false or has no immediate confirmation. However, Trump has picked up some of the claims. On March 14, he urged Putin to &quot;spare&quot; the allegedly surrounded Ukrainian troops. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff denied Trump&apos;s claim that Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast were surrounded. Wolff said that Putin &quot;clearly wants the troops out to deprive Ukraine of a critical bargaining chip (Kursk Oblast), but he also would probably prefer taking as many of them as prisoners rather than allowing them to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s front lines elsewhere.&quot; &quot;Perhaps Putin would have been more pliable if these negotiations had happened at some other time,&quot; a Russian author living in exile who asked to remain anonymous out of security concerns told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;But now, against the backdrop of the events in the Kursk region and the latest statements and steps of the Trump administration, he seems to have only become more confident of his future impunity.&quot; Putin also raised the question of how violations of the ceasefire would be monitored and how the ceasefire would be enforced. Ukraine has also called for resolving this issue and suggested that European peacekeepers be deployed to enforce the ceasefire. However, the Kremlin has rejected the deployment of Western peacekeepers. Wolff argued that it &quot;makes sense from the Kremlin&apos;s perspective to ask for &apos;neutral&apos; observers because it weakens any potential security guarantees that Ukraine could get from having Western peacekeepers deployed.&quot; &quot;Putin&apos;s statement on the ceasefire proposal does not suggest readiness for peace, or at least not for a peace that would involve any kind of compromise from the Russian side,&quot; Renz said.

Ukraine, EU move to deepen cybersecurity cooperation as Russian threat rises	Ukraine and the EU took steps to deepen cooperation in cybersecurity as Russian hybrid attacks aiming to undermine support for Kyiv and flame tensions across the continent continue to rise. Ukraine and Europe&#x2019;s cybersecurity agencies signed a memorandum of understanding at the Kyiv International Cyber Resilience Forum this week to support joint research, innovation, and EU-funded projects in cross-border cybersecurity projects. The European Cybersecurity Competence Center, which is responsible for Europe&apos;s cybersecurity development, manages billions in EU funding through the Digital Europe and Horizon Europe programs. While Ukraine faces participation restrictions as a non-EU member, Kyiv hopes the memorandum will kickstart bringing the two even closer together in the field of cybersecurity. &quot;We expect that we will be able to involve Ukrainian businesses in these support programs, enabling them to interact more effectively with European businesses and develop together,&quot; Serhii Prokopenko, deputy head of cybersecurity at Ukraine&apos;s Security and Defense Council, told the Kyiv Independent. Russian hybrid operations in Europe are becoming more frequent and aggressive, especially since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, the EBU Investigative Journalism Network recently reported, citing 20 government, military, and intelligence officials from 10 countries. &#x201C;We see an increased Russian risk appetite &#x2014; and when I say risk, I mean not risk to them; risk to us, risk to our economies, to the safety of our citizens,&#x201D; NATO Deputy Assistant Secretary General for Innovation, Hybrid, and Cyber James Appathurai told EBU. Russian cyber and hybrid attacks on Ukraine in the rear, that is, beyond the battlefield, as well as against European partners to undermine support for Kyiv, &#x201C;are (from) the same threat actors, so technical exchange allows us to plan together,&quot; said Prokopenko. Prokopenko told the Kyiv Independent that he met with ECCC Director Luca Tagliaretti and agreed to coordinate a working plan soon. &quot;The memorandum serves as a framework agreement enabling both sides to begin practical cooperation,&quot; said Prokopenko. He also hopes Ukrainian government institutions, universities, and businesses will be able to participate in the programs made available through EU funding. The EU&apos;s Cyber Solidarity Act is currently enlisting companies for incident response, which Ukrainian firms are hoping to join. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s rapid development of military tech and artificial intelligence, all these innovative things emerging in Ukraine against the backdrop of the war, are also of interest to Europeans, and we will also interact with them in this direction,&quot; he said. In November 2023, Ukraine signed an agreement with the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity. The agreement required special approval from the European Commission as it was the first time the ENISA engaged with a non-EU country. &quot;This demonstrates that Europe is expecting us, that we&apos;re intensifying and deepening cooperation. While we cannot yet become a full member, we&apos;re already being seen as future members, and then we won&apos;t need to go through this stage,&quot; Serhii Prokopenko said. As part of the agreement, Ukraine now collaborates with ENISA on cybersecurity threats, regularly meeting with the European side to exchange threat analytics. Serhii Prokopenko, deputy head of cybersecurity at Ukraine&apos;s Security and Defense Council, at the Kyiv International Cyber Resilience Forum 2025 in Kyiv, Ukraine on March 11, 2025. (Kyiv International Cyber Resilience Forum)A key aspect of this partnership is aligning Ukrainian legislation with the NIS 2 Directive, which regulates cybersecurity across Europe. Prokopenko describes it as &quot;a complex law,&quot; whose norms partners are currently helping Ukraine to &quot;properly interpret.&quot; As part of its EU accession process, Ukraine is updating its 2021 cybersecurity strategy to align with European standards. &quot;As EU candidates, we will adopt European best practices and develop a new strategy taking these requirements into account because we are EU candidates, and we must comply,&quot; Serhii Prokopenko said. Ukraine&#x2019;s cybersecurity agency is in the process of auditing its current strategies, but Prokopenko expects that Ukraine will have a draft of the new strategy aligned with European standards within this year or next. Ukraine is also working on establishing cyber troops, according to Prokopenko. Several draft laws in Ukraine&apos;s parliament propose the creation of dedicated cyber military units, with the most likely scenario placing them within the armed forces. Plans to create Cyber Forces existed before the full-scale war, but priorities shifted due to Russia&apos;s invasion. &quot;Everything already exists, but we need legal status,&quot; Prokopenko said. Besides protecting critical infrastructure, cyber troops would conduct offensive or counter-offensive cyber operations. Currently, only Ukraine&apos;s Defense Intelligence Forces officially acknowledge conducting cyber attacks, periodically publishing information about attacks on infrastructure in Russia. Prokopenko says that European practices will help protect Ukrainian infrastructure from Russian hacker attacks. &quot;Critical infrastructure consists of IT, office networks, and industrial networks that interact with sensors and control technological processes. For IT, the general approaches are more or less the same for everyone. Still, for specific systems, such as in energy or water supply, specific protocols and steps are prescribed for rapid detection and effective threat response,&quot; he said. Under an earlier cybersecurity strategy, Ukraine anticipated the Russian threat but focused on deterrence, said Prokopenko. &quot;We are now in an active phase of war and, accordingly, we need to conduct more active operations,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-eu-look-to-deepen-cybersecurity-cooperation-as-russian-threat-rises/	2025-03-14T11:07:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/1-118.jpg
Ukraine troops in Kursk Oblast must surrender, Putin claims	Russian President Vladimir Putin said on March 14 that Ukrainian soldiers must surrender in Kursk Oblast after U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s request to &quot;spare&quot; the troops he claimed are surrounded. The General Staff said that Ukrainian units &quot;have regrouped, moved to more favorable defense lines, and are completing their assigned tasks&quot; in Kursk Oblast. Speaking during a meeting of Russia&apos;s Security Council, Putin claimed that some Ukrainian troops &quot;are blocked&quot; in the embattled Russian region. &quot;In order to effectively implement the U.S. president&apos;s call, an appropriate order from Ukraine&apos;s military and political leadership to its military units is necessary,&quot; Putin said. The Russian president claimed that Moscow &quot;will guarantee life and decent treatment in accordance with international law&quot; to captured Ukrainian soldiers. This claim is at odds with reports about Russia&apos;s treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs). There have been multiple accounts of Ukrainian POWs being tortured or killed while in Russian captivity. The POWs that returned from Russian captivity as part of prisoner exchanges required medical attention after facing food deprivation and beatings by Russian prison guards. A Ukrainian soldier who was previously held captive by Russian forces shows a picture of himself prior to captivity while undergoing rehabilitation in an undisclosed location in Ukraine on June 6, 2024. (Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)As of mid-December 2024, Kyiv has also found that 177 captured Ukrainian soldiers were executed on the spot while attempting to surrender. Instances of summary executions have been reported in Kursk Oblast as well. President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on March 14 that the Kursk operation &quot;has completed its task.&quot; He said that Ukraine was able to stabilize the situation near Pokrovsk as well. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi acknowledged on March 12 the &quot;difficult situation&quot; in the region but said that Ukraine will hold the defenses &quot;as long as reasonable and necessary.&quot; Ukraine launched the cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially seizing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. Since then, Russian forces, reinforced by North Korean troops, have steadily pushed back against Ukrainian forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-troops-in-kursk-oblast-must-surrender-putin-claims/	2025-03-14T10:59:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202844124.jpg
EU resists pressure from Hungary, extends Russia sanctions	The European Union has reached a deal with Hungary to renew sanctions on more than 2,400 primarily Russian entities and individuals hours before they were set to expire on March 15, an EU official with knowledge of the negotiations told the Kyiv independent. The EU had been braced for a standoff over the issue, just the latest diplomatic tussle between the largely pro-Ukraine bloc, and its most pro-Kremlin member. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has repeatedly opposed military aid for Ukraine and warned that Ukraine&apos;s EU membership would &quot;destroy&quot; Hungary. He has maintained ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin despite Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, amplifying Kremlin narratives in Europe. In exchange for Hungary lifting its veto, the EU on March 14 agreed to remove four individuals from the list, fewer than half the initial number demanded by Budapest. &quot;We know very well that our sanctions are working. They are biting and crippling the Russian economy,&quot; Anita Hipper, EU spokesperson for foreign affairs said following the renewal. &quot;And this is exactly the intended effect, because what we want to achieve with this is to ensure that Ukraine is strong and Russia doesn&apos;t have the money and the fuel to put in its war machine.&quot; The sanctions list, renewed for another six months, includes Putin, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, as well as members of the Russian State Duma and individuals responsible for sham elections and referenda in occupied Ukrainian territories. Individuals involved in the kidnapping and forced adoption of Ukrainian children, the atrocities in Bucha and Mariupol, as well as high-ranking officials, military personnel and Wagner group commanders are also among the 2,400 individuals and entities on the list. Hungary had demanded that five more individuals be removed from the list but folded on those demands following extensive negotiations with EU officials. Russian billionaires and businessmen Mikhail Fridman (L) and Petr Aven (R) pictured in Moscow, Russia, on March 16, 2017 (Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images)Mikhail FridmanOligarch Mikhail Fridman&#x2019;s removal had been high on Hungary&#x2019;s list of demands. Budapest&#x2019;s Ambassador to the EU had explicitly stated that removing Fridman, one of Russia&#x2019;s longest standing oligarchs, was a condition for lifting Hungary&#x2019;s veto. Despite this, he remains sanctioned. Fridman has &quot;cultivated close ties with Putin,&quot; according to the French sanctions register, and &quot;he is cited among Russia&#x2019;s biggest financiers and as a facilitator in Putin&#x2019;s inner circle.&quot; Investigative reporters revealed in May 2023 that Alfa Insurance, a subsidiary of Alfa-Bank owned by Fridman and Petr Aven, provided insurance for vehicles used by Russian forces in Ukraine. The company has also reportedly serviced the Main Office of Special Programs, which is responsible for guarding Russian President Vladimir Putin. Fridman also remains sanctioned by the U.S. and the U.K. Fridman and Aven had previously sold their stakes in Alfa-Bank and its insurance division in an effort to overturn the sanctions, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Feb. 6. A close associate of Fridman, Petr Aven was also on Hungary&#x2019;s wishlist. Aven is accused by the UK, France and Switzerland of &quot;destabilising or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.&quot; According to the Swiss sanctions registry, Aven is &quot;one of approximately 50 wealthy Russian businesspersons who regularly meet with Putin in the Kremlin.&quot; He is accused of taking directives from Putin and implementing his foreign policy agenda. &quot;Aven and his business partner Mikhail Fridman have been engaged in the Kremlin&#x2019;s efforts to lift the Western sanctions issued to counter Russian aggressive policy against Ukraine,&quot; it adds. Like Fridman, he is also sanctioned by the U.S. and the U.K. Hungary also wanted oligarch Alisher Usmanov to be delisted alongside his sister, Gulbakhor Ismailova, who was taken off the list. The Russian-Uzbek businessman made his fortune in metal and mining operations after the fall of the Soviet Union. Usmanov &quot;is associated with individuals within the government of Russia who are involved in destabilising and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine,&quot; according to the U.K.&#x2019;s sanctions list. France also says that Usmanov &quot;provided active material or financial support to Russian decision-makers responsible for the annexation of Crimea and the destabilisation of Ukraine.&quot; Usmanov also remains sanctioned by the U.S. and the U.K. Alisher Usmanov&apos;s super-yacht Dilbar is pulled into a covered floating dock of Luerssen shipyards on the Weser river at the harbour of Bremen on September 23, 2022 (Focke Strangmann/AFP via Getty Images)Dmitry MazepinHungary also sided with Dmitry Mazepin, who EU judges described as &quot;a member of the closest circle of President Putin.&quot; He founded Uralchem Group, which is &quot;one of the world&apos;s largest producers and exporters of nitrogen, potash and complex fertilizers,&quot; according to Forbes. EU court documents state that &quot;he is one of the leading businesspersons involved in economic sectors providing a substantial source of revenue to the Government of Russia.&quot; Mazepin is also sanctioned by the U.K. Finally, Hungarian officials went to bat for Musa Bazhaev. Sanctioned by the EU and the U.K, Bazhaev is among the top 200 richest people in Russia and through his business operations as head of the Alliance group is deemed to be &quot;providing a substantial source of revenue&quot; to the Russian government. Bazhaev had challenged the EU&#x2019;s sanctions against him but his case was rejected by the EU&#x2019;s General Court. Russia&#x2019;s sport minister since May 2024, Degtyaryov will be delisted as part of the deal reached between Brussels and Budapest. Degtaryov was involved in &quot;the inauguration of the de facto embassy of the unrecognised so-called Donetsk People&#x2019;s Republic in Moscow, and he contributes to undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine,&quot; according to the sanctions placed against him by Switzerland. He remains sanctioned by the U.S. and the U.K. National Olympic Committee Chairman Mikhail Degtyaryov during a signing ceremony at the Grand Kremlin Palace, March 4, 2025, in Moscow, Russia (Contributor/Getty Images)Viatcheslav Moshe KantorAn Israeli-British-Russian businessman, Kantor has been described by the French sanctions register as maintaining &quot;close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin&quot; which have allowed him to &quot;preserve his very large fortune.&quot; As he conducts business in &quot;economic sectors which provide a substantial source of revenue for the Russian government,&quot; he therefore contributes to &quot;destabilizing&quot; Ukraine. Kantor remains sanctioned by the U.K. Ismailova, the sister of Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov, will also be removed from the list at the behest of Hungary. &quot;She relies on a network of shell companies to hide the wealth of her brother,&quot; according to the Swiss sanctions register. Usmanov, who remains on the EU sanctions list &quot;provided active material or financial support to Russian decision-makers responsible for the annexation of Crimea and the destabilisation of Ukraine.&quot; She remains sanctioned by the U.S. and U.K. Separately to the negotiations with Hungary, Russian businessman Vladimir Rashevsky will be removed following his legal challenge against the sanctions being upheld by the European Court of Justice. Three other individuals will be removed as they are now deceased. Hungary withdrawing its veto means these sanctions will be renewed for another six months but another fight between Brussels and Budapest looms. Economic sanctions against Russia, including the freezing of nearly $200 billion in Russian central bank assets, also need to be renewed by the EU in July. &#xA0; As the U.S. signals an openness to easing sanctions against Russia, EU member states worry that Hungary could become emboldened in its dealings with Brussels and block the renewal of economic sanctions. As the EU&#x2019;s most pro-Kremlin member states continue to be a thorn in the bloc&#x2019;s side, other member states are considering moving against Budapest. If a majority of member states agree, Hungary could be stripped of its voting rights, and ability to veto, within the EU. Such a move, though politically difficult, could indicate that EU member states have finally lost patience with Hungary.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-resists-pressure-from-hungary-extends-russia-sanctions-including-those-on-mikhail-fridman/	2025-03-14T10:52:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2198451518.jpg
What Germany under Merz means for Ukraine and Europe, according to expert	Germany braces for major changes as incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz seeks to reshape the country&#x2019;s role on the continent. The Kyiv Independent sat down with J&#xF6;rn Fleck, senior director with the Europe Center at the Atlantic Council, to discuss what the new German government means for Ukraine and beyond. Speaking on Feb. 28, less than five days after Merz&#x2019;s party&apos;s election victory, Fleck saw potential for bolstering Ukraine&#x2019;s war effort and Europe&#x2019;s autonomy but also warned of the rising strength of radical, pro-Russian parties.	https://kyivindependent.com/what-germany-under-merz-means-for-ukraine-and-europe-according-to-expert/	2025-03-14T10:46:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_9408.jpg
Kyiv says Ukrainian troops 'regrouped' in Kursk Oblast, denies encirclement	Ukraine&apos;s General Staff on March 14 denied claims that Ukrainian troops were encircled in Kursk Oblast amid Russia&apos;s ongoing offensive in the region. The General Staff said that Russia had been reporting an alleged encirclement of Ukrainian forces in Kursk Oblast &quot;for political purposes and to put pressure on Ukraine and its partners.&quot; The statement came after U.S. President Donald Trump said that his administration held &quot;productive discussions&quot; with Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 13, during which he urged him to &quot;spare&quot; surrounded Ukrainian troops. &quot;At this very moment, thousands of Ukrainian troops are completely surrounded by the Russian military, and in a very bad and vulnerable position,&quot; Trump wrote, without providing any evidence. Speaking on March 13 about a U.S.-backed 30-day ceasefire, Putin claimed that the ceasfire would be beneficial to Kyiv given the situation in Kursk Oblast. He did not rule out a &quot;complete physical blockade&quot; of Ukrainian troops. &quot;The units have regrouped, moved to more favorable defense lines and are completing their assigned tasks in Kursk Oblast,&quot; the General Staff said. &quot;There is no threat of encirclement of our units.&quot; &quot;Our soldiers are repelling the enemy&apos;s offensive and inflicting effective fire damage from all types of weapons.&quot; Moscow claimed on March 12 to have retaken over 86% of seized territories in the region, including a key town of Sudzha, captured by Ukrainian troops at the start of the Kursk incursion in August 2024. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi acknowledged on March 12 the &quot;difficult situation&quot; in the region but said that Ukraine will hold the defenses &quot;as long as reasonable and necessary.&quot; Ukraine launched the cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially seizing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. Since then, Russian forces, reinforced by North Korean troops, have steadily pushed back against Ukrainian forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-says-ukrainian-troops-regrouped-in-kursk-oblast-denies-encirclement/	2025-03-14T09:01:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/Kurskaja.jpg
Man suspected of murdering prominent Odesa activist detained, authorities say	Hours after prominent Ukrainian activist Demyan Hanul was gunned down in Odesa, law enforcement detained a potential suspect. Hanul, 31, was a well-known public figure, blogger, and founder of the Street Front NGO. He participated in the EuroMaidan Revolution and the May 2 clashes against pro-Russian forces in Odesa. The activist had been active in rallies supporting Ukraine, charity fundraisers for the military, and campaigns to dismantle the city&apos;s Soviet and imperial monuments. He was shot dead in central Odesa on March 14. Following the murder, the shooter fled the scene. According to Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko, a weapon that was allegedly used was found in the apartment where the detainee was hiding. The suspect is allegedly a 46-year-old deserter, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed. In reaction to the murder, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that dozens of law enforcement officials are involved in the investigation. &quot;I have instructed the interior minister, the head of the Security Service, the acting prosecutor general to throw all the necessary forces and means to establish all the facts,&quot; Zelensky said. The SBU did not rule out Russia&apos;s involvement in the murder. Hanul had previously reported threats against his life. In July 2024, he claimed Russian sources had leaked personal information about his relatives and that a $10,000 bounty was offered for an attack on him.	https://kyivindependent.com/suspect-in-murder-of-prominent-ukrainian-activist-detained-in-odesa/	2025-03-14T08:20:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-14_16-12-59.jpg
Russia using cryptocurrency in oil trade with China, India to bypass sanctions, Reuters reports	Russia has begun using cryptocurrencies in oil transactions with China and India to circumvent Western sanctions, Reuters reported on March 14, citing four sources familiar with the matter. The cryptocurrency scheme currently represents a small fraction of Russia&apos;s $192 billion annual oil trade, according to the International Energy Agency, but its usage is reportedly increasing. According to the report, Chinese and Indian buyers of Russian oil pay intermediary trading firms in yuan or rupees. The funds are then deposited into offshore accounts, converted into Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Tether stablecoins, and withdrawn to another account before being exchanged for rubles in Russia. Reuters&apos; sources suggested that Russia will likely continue using digital currencies in energy trade even if Western sanctions are lifted, citing the speed and flexibility of cryptocurrency transactions. Meanwhile, China&apos;s state-owned oil companies are reportedly reducing purchases of Russian crude due to concerns over U.S. sanctions, Reuters reported, citing industry sources. The move comes as the Trump administration on March 13 declined to renew an exemption that previously allowed Russian banks to access U.S. payment systems for energy transactions. The decision is expected to complicate Russian oil purchases and could contribute to higher global energy prices.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-using-cryptocurrency-in-oil-trade-with-china-india-to-bypass-sanctions-reuters-reports/	2025-03-14T07:28:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1259096903.jpg
Trump claims he asked Putin to 'spare thousands of surrounded Ukrainian troops' in Kursk Oblast	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. President Donald Trump said his administration held &quot;productive discussions&quot; with Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which he urged him to &quot;spare&quot; surrounded Ukrainian troops, he wrote in a Truth Social post on March 14. &quot;At this very moment, thousands of Ukrainian troops are completely surrounded by the Russian military, and in a very bad and vulnerable position,&quot; Trump wrote. &quot;I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II. God bless them all.&quot; The statement comes as Trump&apos;s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, arrived in Moscow on March 13 and met with Putin late in the evening, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-claims-he-asked-putin-to-spare-surrounded-ukrainian-troops/	2025-03-14T07:00:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2177668198.jpg
Ukraine forming team to develop monitoring mechanisms for potential 30-day ceasefire, FM Sybiha says	Ukraine has begun assembling a team to develop monitoring mechanisms for a possible 30-day ceasefire, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on March 14. &quot;We have already started forming a national team to develop appropriate processes to properly control a possible ceasefire. This is an extremely complex process,&quot; Sybiha said at a press conference with Austrian Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger in Kyiv. Kyiv agreed to the U.S.-proposed truce during talks in Jeddah on March 11, contingent on Russian adherence. The talks also led to Washington resuming military and intelligence support for Ukraine. Sybiha said that upon returning from Jeddah, Ukrainian officials briefed President Volodymyr Zelensky on the discussions. He emphasized that Ukraine&#x2019;s 1,300-kilometer (800-mile) front line presents logistical challenges for ceasefire enforcement. Ukraine remains wary of Russian violations, citing its experience with the Minsk agreements, which Russia breached 25 times. &quot;So now everything will be aimed at ensuring that the Ukrainian side is ready with the appropriate teams, developments, and modalities,&quot; Sybiha said. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on March 13 that Moscow is prepared to accept the ceasefire but demanded that Ukraine halt mobilization, military training, and foreign military aid deliveries during the truce. Trump called Putin&apos;s remarks &quot;very promising&quot; but &quot;not complete,&quot; adding that he is open to meeting with the Russian leader. Zelensky dismissed Putin&#x2019;s response as &quot;manipulative,&quot; warning that Russia is preparing to reject the ceasefire. &quot;Now we have all heard very predictable, very manipulative words from Putin in response to the idea of silence at the front &#x2014; he is, in fact, preparing to reject it as of now,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address on March 13. Russia has sent &quot;additional signals&quot; to Trump regarding the ceasefire through special envoy Steve Witkoff, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on March 14.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-forming-team-to-monitor-potential-30-day-ceasefire-fm-sybiha-says/	2025-03-14T06:54:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197755028.jpg
Chinese state oil firms cut Russian crude purchases over sanctions fears, Reuters reports	China&apos;s state-owned oil companies are scaling back purchases of Russian crude due to concerns over U.S. sanctions, Reuters reported on March 14, citing industry sources. Chinese firms have avoided buying oil from suppliers directly hit by sanctions. &quot;They are taking a break for now while contemplating if there are ways to work around,&quot; a source told Reuters. Russia remains China&apos;s largest crude supplier, accounting for 20% of its total imports. While Beijing has strengthened economic ties with Moscow since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it has repeatedly denied allegations of directly supporting Russia&apos;s war effort. Despite China&apos;s deepening trade relationship with Russia, growing economic pressure has led many Chinese financial institutions to scale back dealings with Moscow, fearing secondary U.S. sanctions. China&apos;s state-run Sinopec and Zhenhua Oil have halted supplies entirely, while PetroChina and CNOOC have continued shipments in March but with reduced volumes, according to sources familiar with the matter. A Sinopec source said the company stopped purchasing Russian oil as it conducted additional checks on compliance with U.S. sanctions and awaits a &quot;clear picture&quot; of ongoing U.S.-Russia negotiations on ending the war in Ukraine. The company may resume supplies if talks lead to an easing or lifting of sanctions. PetroChina, a key buyer of Russia&apos;s ESPO (BCTO) crude from Russia&apos;s state energy company Rosneft, continued offshore shipments in March but at lower volumes, sources told Reuters. CNOOC, another major buyer, also reduced its shipments. In one of his final acts in office, former U.S. President Joe Biden imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia&apos;s energy sector on Jan. 10, targeting Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz; over 180 oil tankers transporting crude from Russia, Iran, and Venezuela; and insurance firms involved in Russian oil logistics.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinese-state-oil-firms-cut-russian-crude-purchases-over-us-sanctions-fears-reuters-reports/	2025-03-14T06:24:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1258888534.jpeg
Belarus will not merge with Russia in the near future, Lukashenko says	Belarus will not formally merge with Russia in the near future, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko said on March 14 while addressing the Russian Federation Council. &quot;If we are going to burst through this open door, we will ruin everything we have done. It is necessary to go calmly, step by step,&quot; Lukashenko said. In early January, independent Russian media Meduza reported, citing sources close to the Kremlin, that Putin may revisit plans to formally absorb Belarus once the war against Ukraine is resolved. Despite his claim of maintaining relations with a range og global actors including China, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the EU, Lukashenko said that Minsk will &quot;always side with Moscow.&quot; &quot;It can&apos;t be otherwise. Belarus will never leave Russia alone, just as Russia will never leave Belarus,&quot; he added, highlighting what he described as &quot;open fraternal relations&quot; between the two countries. Lukashenko&apos;s visit to Russia marks his first trip since securing a seventh presidential term in an election widely denounced as a sham. On March 13, he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Following their talks, Lukashenko and Putin signed a joint statement pledging to expand bilateral trade, economic, and investment cooperation. Belarus has been largely cut off from the West following Lukashenko&apos;s violent crackdown on mass protests in 2020 against fraudulent election results. Since then, his regime has further curtailed political freedoms and deepened its alignment with Moscow, providing logistical and military support for Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Even before launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin reportedly had devised a plan for the &quot;creeping annexation&quot; of Belarus by 2030. The plan outlined steps for &quot;harmonizing&quot; Russian and Belarusian laws, &quot;coordinated foreign and defense policy,&quot; and economic integration based on Russian interests. President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on Feb. 14 that Russia is once again building up troops in Belarus, possibly in preparation for large-scale operations against NATO countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-will-not-merge-with-russia-in-the-near-future-lukashenko-says/	2025-03-14T05:15:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204325998-1.jpg
Ukraine is the front line in the battle against oligarchic capitalism	The war in Ukraine is not just a fight for national sovereignty &#x2014; it&#x2019;s a battle at the crossroads of a collapsing global order. While Ukrainians heroically resist Russia&#x2019;s brutal invasion, the war has exposed the fractures of an economic system that has, for decades, concentrated wealth, power, and decision-making into the hands of a few. It is a test &#x2014; not only for Ukraine but for the entire world: Will this war be remembered as the moment democracy fought back against authoritarianism, or will it serve as yet another chapter in the story of oligarchs and corporate elites profiting from conflict while ordinary people suffer? For decades, the world has been sliding toward an era of oligarchical capitalism &#x2014; a system where political and economic power is no longer in the hands of democratic institutions but controlled by corporate monopolies, financial empires, and political elites. This war has accelerated that transformation, reshaping global energy markets, financial systems, and military-industrial economies in ways that will be felt for decades. While the world rightly focuses on Ukraine&#x2019;s survival, the war is also a struggle over who will control the global economy of the future. Russia&#x2019;s invasion wasn&#x2019;t just an act of territorial aggression &#x2014; it was a calculated gamble that Western economic dependence on Russian energy would prevent a unified response. It failed. But in the wake of sanctions and military realignments, the war has triggered an economic upheaval that is redrawing global supply chains and financial alliances. Ukraine is at the heart of this transformation. Its vast agricultural exports, industrial base, and newly discovered lithium reserves &#x2014; critical for the future of battery technology &#x2014; make it an economic battleground as much as a military one. The reconstruction of Ukraine will not only require billions in aid but will likely be shaped by the very corporate and financial interests that have long profited from global crises. At the same time, Western oligarchs and corporations are not passive actors in this conflict. While Russian elites seek to maintain their grip on power, Western defense contractors, energy giants, and private financial interests stand to gain massively from this war. The war economy is booming. European nations are re-militarizing at an unprecedented pace. The fossil fuel industry &#x2014; once thought to be in decline &#x2014; is experiencing a resurgence as nations scramble to secure energy independence. The war has also become a proving ground for new forms of digital warfare, surveillance capitalism, and AI-driven propaganda. The world is witnessing, in real time, how information can be weaponized, how financial systems can be leveraged as geopolitical tools, and how war accelerates the use of technologies that may outlast the battlefield. President Volodymyr Zelensky gives an interview to Turkish media after his visit to Ankara, T&#xFC;rkiye, on Feb. 19, 2024. (Mert Gokhankoc/dia images via Getty Images)Governments across the world are expanding surveillance measures, restricting dissent, and consolidating state power in response to the war. While some of these measures are necessary for security, history warns us that emergency powers granted in times of crisis rarely disappear when the crisis ends. The normalization of war economies and mass surveillance risks creating a permanent state of conflict-driven capitalism, where war is not an exception but an ongoing condition of economic and political life. Ukraine is proving to the world that authoritarian aggression can be resisted. But it is also exposing a deeper question: What kind of world will emerge from this war? If the global economic order continues to be dictated by the interests of oligarchs &#x2014; whether Russian, Western, or otherwise&#x2014;then the ideals Ukraine is fighting for will be at risk of being co-opted by the same elite interests that have manipulated wars and crises for centuries. This war must not become another chapter in the long history of wealth consolidation through conflict. Ukraine&#x2019;s fight for sovereignty must be met with an equally urgent fight for economic justice, democratic renewal, and the dismantling of the systems that have allowed oligarchical capitalism to thrive unchecked. If Ukraine&#x2019;s resistance is to mean something beyond its borders, the world must ensure that this is not just a war for survival but a moment that reshapes global power in the interests of people &#x2014; not just corporations, war profiteers, and financial elites. Ukraine&#x2019;s struggle is more than its own. It is a warning to the world &#x2014; and an opportunity to create a different future. The question is whether we will seize it.

How Ukraine’s defense tech is shaping the future of warfare	Geopolitical events over the past three years have forced a rethinking of the global security framework. Ukraine&#x2019;s battlefield has evolved into an innovation lab for modern defense technologies &#x2014; transforming not only how wars are fought but also how peace is secured. Drawing insights from the recent Brave1 Defense Tech Innovations Forum and Ukraine&#x2019;s own hard-won experience since 2014, it&#x2019;s clear: Ukraine is emerging as the epicenter of a defense revolution. In a world where old alliances and institutions struggle to keep pace with new threats, investing in Ukraine&#x2019;s defense technologies is an investment in a safer, more resilient future. Ukraine&#x2019;s reality has shattered the notion that war is a distant or isolated affair. As Ukrainian Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation Oleksandr Bornyakov stated, &#x201C;The world is not safe anymore.&#x201D; The ongoing Russia-Ukraine War has exposed the limitations of traditional security guarantors, such as the UN and NATO. Yet Ukraine&#x2019;s experience suggests that weak or outdated security frameworks only increase vulnerability in the face of hybrid threats from autocratic adversaries. For Europe, the lesson is clear: defense spending is not waste, but rather critical investment in peace and resilience. With looming threats from old rivals like Russia, amid emerging global uncertainty and the weakening of international institutions like the UN and NATO, the need to bolster defensive capabilities has never been greater. Channeling funds into innovative defense technology can transform Europe&#x2019;s security posture from passive crisis response to proactive mitigation. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war is rewriting the rules of modern warfare. On battlefields where conventional systems fall short, rapid innovation has become the only viable answer, with a demand for both new offensive and defensive systems. These evolving needs are driven by three interlocking factors: First, adaptation to small-scale threats. Traditional air defense systems, designed to counter large, fast-moving aircraft, have proven inadequate &#x2014; and too costly &#x2014; against smaller, slower-moving drones. Recognizing this gap, Ukraine has accelerated the development of both kinetic and electronic anti-drone technologies. This is quickly growing into Ukraine&#x2019;s competitive advantage, as few countries have invested as heavily in this area or have real experience in applying such systems. Second, economics of attrition. In a protracted state-vs-state war, attrition is a critical factor. Innovation is focused on maximizing value for money, making low-cost, high-impact solutions like drones the perfect weapon for the 21st century. We are also seeing international producers gradually adapt to this shift toward cost-effective, rapidly deployable solutions. Third, speed of innovation. Whereas typical defense procurement cycles in the EU or U.S. span decades, Ukraine&#x2019;s evolving battlefield demands a more rapid response. According to Ukrainian Armed Forces representatives, any innovation not reaching production within six months risks becoming obsolete.

(Oleksandr Magula/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)The revolution in modern warfare is far from over. While drones have already reshaped the battlefield, their full potential remains untapped until they evolve into fully autonomous, interconnected systems. Three areas are key to this transformation: First, automation. Operating a drone with a human in the loop is no longer as effective or safe, especially in environments saturated with electronic interference and fast-evolving countermeasures. The future lies in autonomous systems that can operate remotely and independently, reducing risks to human operators and improving operational efficiency. Experts predict not only improved control but also the emergence of drone swarms and fleets. Second, standardization. Rapid innovation has given rise to a wide variety of systems, which are often incompatible with one another. By adopting shared standards for new defense technologies, integration within a country&#x2019;s forces and among allies will be much simpler, allowing these innovations to be rolled out more quickly and on a larger scale. Third, interconnection. Drone warfare remains limited by the speed of human decision-making. Overcoming this challenge requires a robust digital infrastructure that connects a variety of systems, enabling them to operate as a single coordinated entity. This is a crucial next step for drone warfare, where Ukraine has the opportunity to outpace not only its enemies but even its allies, becoming a valuable asset for European security. Despite its challenges, Ukraine&#x2019;s defense ecosystem is currently one of the most innovative and agile in Europe. However, Ukrainian startups face significant roadblocks when attempting to export their technologies or partner with international companies and organizations. To fully harness the potential of its defense innovations, Ukraine needs some form of integration into the international security framework. Until recently, the goal was NATO membership. However, in the current volatile geopolitical landscape, alternatives like the proposed European Armed Forces can serve a similar purpose. In any case, if Ukraine maintains its speed of innovation and continues to attract funding into its fledgling defense sector, the country has the opportunity to not only improve its own security but also offer significant export capacity. Projections estimate a production capacity of 4.6 million drones by 2025, more than double the current planned procurement. This growing capacity represents a great opportunity for international investors and strategic partners. However, high-level political decisions from both Ukraine and its allies are needed to fully unlock it. Additionally, Ukraine could expand partnerships with its allies by offering battlefield testing to international partners. &#x201C;Adopted by the Armed Forces of Ukraine&#x201D; is quickly becoming the most valuable seal of quality in the defense industry, creating both technological and economic opportunities for the country going forward.

JD Vance says he would be 'shocked' if Trump agreed to station US nukes in Poland	U.S. Vice President JD Vance has said he would be &quot;shocked&quot; if the White House agreed to a Polish request to deploy American nuclear weapons on its territory as a deterrent against future Russian aggression. &quot;I haven&apos;t talked to the president about that particular issue, but I would be shocked if he was supportive of nuclear weapons extending further east into Europe,&quot; Vance told Fox News on March 13. The statement was in response to a statement from Polish President Andrzej Duda earlier on March 13 who said such a move would be justified given Russia had already taken similar steps by deploying tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus. &quot;The borders of NATO moved east in 1999, so 26 years later, there should also be a shift of the NATO infrastructure east. For me, this is obvious,&quot; Duda said. &quot;Russia did not even hesitate when they were relocating their nuclear weapons into Belarus,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;They didn&apos;t ask anyone&apos;s permission.&quot; Duda said he recently discussed the idea with Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, and hopes to revive a nuclear-sharing proposal that he unsuccessfully presented to former U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration in 2022. The proposal comes amid mounting warnings from Western leaders and intelligence agencies about the possibility of a large-scale war in Europe within the next five years. Russia&apos;s tactical nuclear weapons are designed for use on the battlefield in Europe and Asia and have a more limited range compared to strategic nuclear weapons, which could reach the U.S. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly issued nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West since launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. While those threats have not materialized, concerns persist over Russia&apos;s military ambitions beyond Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/jd-vance-says-he-would-be-shocked-if-trump-agreed-to-station-us-nukes-in-poland/	2025-03-14T04:52:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204115152.jpg
Putin sent 'additional signals' to Trump on ceasefire proposal, Kremlin says	Russia has sent &quot;additional signals&quot; to U.S. President Donald Trump regarding a proposed ceasefire through special envoy Steve Witkoff, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on March 14. Witkoff landed in Moscow on March 13 and met with Russian President Vladimir Putin late in the evening, according to Peskov. Following Witkoff&apos;s report to Trump, Moscow and Washington will discuss potential dates for a phone call between the leaders, he added in comments reported by Russian state media. &quot;Additional information was provided to the Russian side. Through Witkoff, Putin also passed information and additional signals to Trump,&quot; Peskov said. The visit comes as the U.S. seeks Russian agreement on a proposed 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, which Kyiv accepted during talks in Jeddah on March 11. The agreement led Washington to restart military and intelligence support for Ukraine after halting it last week. Putin said on March 13 that Russia is prepared to accept the ceasefire but demanded that Ukraine halt mobilization, military training, and foreign aid deliveries during the truce. Trump called Putin&apos;s remarks &quot;very promising&quot; but said they were &quot;not complete,&quot; addinghe is open to meeting with the Russian leader.

He claimed he spoke directly with Putin for over three hours during that visit.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-sent-additional-signals-to-trump-through-special-envoy-witkoff-kremlin-spokesperson-says/	2025-03-14T03:51:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204290859.jpg
Ukrainian activist Demyan Hanul shot dead in central Odesa	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story that is being updated. Ukrainian activist Demyan Hanul was shot dead in central Odesa, the National Police reported on March 14. Hanul, 31, was a well-known public figure, blogger, and founder of the Street Front NGO. He participated in the EuroMaidan Revolution and the May 2 clashes against pro-Russian forces in Odesa. The activist had been active in rallies supporting Ukraine, charity fundraisers for the military, and campaigns to dismantle Soviet and imperial monuments. The shooter fled the scene, and police have launched an investigation. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said he is taking personal control of the case, adding that a top investigative team from the National Police is en route to Odesa. &quot;An investigative team of the best officers has been formed with the central office of the National Police and has already left for Odesa. A regiment of the National Police has also been sent to Odesa,&quot; he said during an hour of questions to the government in the Verkhovna Rada. Pro-Russian media Tipichanya Odesa initially reported that the shooter was a man in military uniform. Klymenko denied this information. &quot;Operatives and police investigators are working to identify the shooter and arrest him,&quot; Klymenko added. Hanul had previously reported threats against his life. In July 2024, he claimed Russian sources had leaked personal information about his relatives and that a $10,000 bounty was offered for an attack on him.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-activist-demyan-hanul-shot-dead-in-central-odesa/	2025-03-14T03:14:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1043773770.jpg
With Putin demanding new concessions for a ceasefire, all eyes are on Trump’s next move	As a U.S. delegation in Moscow worked to hammer out a ceasefire agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader responded by demanding extensive concessions in exchange for a ceasefire deal in Ukraine. So far, Trump has made harsh demands on Ukraine while avoiding putting similar pressure on Russia. Now, attention turns back to Trump as to whether he will continue his trend of appeasement or double down and force Russia to accept a deal. Speaking at a press conference on March 13, Putin demanded guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops nor receive military aid during the proposed 30-day ceasefire, which some experts see as an attempt to prolong negotiations rather than a sincere attempt at peace. Putin&#x2019;s comments came two days after Kyiv agreed to a ceasefire proposed by Washington during talks in Saudi Arabia on the condition that Russia also accept the terms. Putin also said that further talks are needed to prepare for a ceasefire, including a conversation directly with Trump.

(Mikhail Klimentyev / Sputnik / AFP via Getty Images)Trump responded that Putin&apos;s statement was &quot;very promising&quot; but &quot;wasn&#x2019;t complete,&quot; adding he is willing to meet with the Russian president. Ahead of the Russian leader&#x2019;s demands, &#x201C;Trump was very clear: Accept this or I am going to get tough on you,&#x201D; John Herbst, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine under George W. Bush, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Trump&apos;s going to look like a world-class fool if he lets Putin get away with saying no to this proposal. Now that doesn&apos;t mean that Trump, therefore, must do something. &#xA0;But there will be serious pressure on him to do something against Russia,&#x201D; he added. One potential response could be increasing sanctions, a move that Senator Lindsey Graham has pushed for in the event that Putin rejects the ceasefire proposal. &#x201C;If Russia refuses (a ceasefire), we should sanction the hell out of them,&#x201D; Graham wrote on X on March 11 after Washington and Kyiv inked their deal. Nothing in Trump&#x2019;s actions since his inauguration in January has indicated any willingness to put pressure on Russia, said Jenny Mathers, a lecturer in international politics at the U.K.&apos;s Aberystwyth University. Trump has escalated pressure on Ukraine by halting military aid and intelligence sharing until a ceasefire deal was signed, demanding Ukraine sign over natural resource rights to the U.S., berating President Volodymyr Zelensky at a meeting in the Oval Office, suspending a Ukrainian refugee program, and ending USAID funding used to rebuild critical infrastructure struck by Russian missiles. In contrast, despite threats of doubling down on Russian sanctions, Russia has largely evaded escalatory pressure from Trump. Whether or not Trump is willing to change this stance is still up in the air. Another question is whether or not Trump will view Russia&#x2019;s new ceasefire demands as a rejection. &#x201C;Trump seems to be in the mindset of viewing any demands from Russia as reasonable rather than insane, and no list of concessions demanded from Ukraine (by Russia) as outrageous,&#x201D; Mathers said. Still, a scenario where Trump responds to Putin rejecting the deal by throwing his support behind Ukraine is &#x201C;not entirely far-fetched,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Trump is notoriously vain and thin-skinned and easily offended. If he decides that Putin is making him look like a fool in the eyes of the world and not showing him respect, then he could lash out. But even if that happens, Trump could change his mind again,&#x201D; Mathers added. &#x201C;Honestly, one of the few constants in the foreign policy of Trump 2.0 is the affinity for Russia.&#x201D; The ceasefire agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine signed on March 11 featured limited details, including a resumption of U.S. weapons and intelligence, the option to extend beyond the 30 days, and a vague admission of American corporations into Ukrainian mining. It doesn&#x2019;t include the preconditions for a ceasefire Putin named last June, which were largely seen as a non-starter and would have been an effective surrender for Ukraine. The demands Putin set included a full withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from four eastern oblasts &#x2013; Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia &#x2013; which Russia does not fully control.

(Maxim Shemetov / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)According to Ryhor Nizhnikau, a Russia expert at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, entering peace negotiations may be a delay tactic while Putin furthers his goal of &#x201C;political capitulation&#x201D; from Ukraine. &#x201C;Putin will try to prolong the negotiations, which in the meantime will give him opportunities to definitely further deteriorate or disrupt relations between Washington and Kyiv and Washington and its European allies within the process,&#x201D; said Nizhnikau. Sergei Parkhomenko, a Russian-born columnist and political commentator, agreed that Putin may choose to engage in &#x201C;long, tedious negotiations,&#x201D; but that he isn&#x2019;t yet willing to make concessions or sign a peace deal. &#x201C;He needs this war for its own sake, more than he needs victory in it, more than he needs Ukraine, and more than he needs anything else,&#x201D; Parkhomenko told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;For him, war is a way of life, a method of governing the country, a way of maintaining himself in power.&#x201D; In his evening address after Putin made his comments, Zelensky echoed the same sentiment. &quot;Putin is afraid to say directly to President Trump that he wants to continue this war, that he wants to kill Ukrainians. That&apos;s why they in Moscow demand such preconditions for a ceasefire that will make it impossible or will (postpone it) as long as possible,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/with-putin-demanding-new-concessions-for-a-ceasefire-all-eyes-are-on-trumps-next-move/	2025-03-14T03:03:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1152488863.jpg
Finland sentences Russian neo-Nazi mercenary Yan Petrovsky to life for war crimes in Ukraine	The Helsinki District Court sentenced Russian neo-Nazi mercenary Yan Petrovsky to life in prison for war crimes committed in Ukraine, Finnish public broadcaster Yle reported on March 14. Petrovsky, co-leader of the Rusich paramilitary unit, was convicted of war crimes in Luhansk Oblast on Sept. 5, 2014, during Russia&apos;s invasion of Donbas. Prosecutors presented video evidence showing him ordering and participating in the execution of Ukrainian soldiers. Petrovsky denied all accusations, but the court ruled that the video recordings provided sufficient proof of his involvement. Rusich, a notorious Russian neo-Nazi group, has documented and published evidence of its own war crimes, including torture and extrajudicial killings. One of the five charges against him was dismissed. Ukraine had requested Petrovsky&apos;s extradition, but a Finnish court ruled on Dec. 8, 2023, that he could not be sent to Ukraine, citing concerns over prison conditions under the European Convention on Human Rights. The Rusich unit, linked to Russia&apos;s Wagner Group, has a long history of brutality. Co-founder Alexey Milchakov gained notoriety for publishing images of animal cruelty and openly celebrating war crimes. Petrovsky has been under EU and U.S. sanctions since 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/finland-sentences-russian-neo-nazi-mercenary-petrovsky-to-life-for-war-crimes/	2025-03-14T02:53:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2187712266.jpg
Ukrainian drones strike Russian gas facilities, air defense missile depot, source claims	Drones launched by Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) struck two gas compressor stations and a warehouse storing missiles for Russia&apos;s S-300/S-400 air defense systems, a security source told the Kyiv Independent on March 14. The long-range drones targeted gas compressor stations in Russia&apos;s Tambov and Saratov oblasts, according to the source. Another strike reportedly hit a missile depot near the village of Radkovka in Belgorod Oblast, triggering a detonation of stored ammunition. &quot;The SBU conducted another successful special operation on enemy territory, causing significant damage to Russia&apos;s budget and reducing its ability to finance and sustain the war,&quot; the source said. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. 0:00/1&#xD7;The purported moment of a Ukraine Security Service (SBU) drone strike on industrial equipment at Russian gas compressor stations, published on March 13 (Exilenova / Telegram)The S-300 and S-400 systems are Russia&apos;s primary long-range air defense weapons, capable of intercepting aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic threats. Ukraine targets Russian gas compressor stations to disrupt energy exports, a key source of revenue for Moscow&#x2019;s war effort. Ukraine has consistently targeted Russia&apos;s fossil fuel and military infrastructure to weaken its ability to sustain prolonged aggression. Overnight on March 14, Ukrainian drones also hit the Tuapse oil refinery in Krasnodar Krai, setting fire to a gasoline storage tank. Russian pro-government media outlet Mash claimed the fire was caused by debris from a downed drone, while eyewitnesses reported hearing a series of explosions.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-target-russian-gas-facilities-air-defense-missile-depot-source-claims/	2025-03-14T01:48:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-14-at-10_47_13.png
Putin still seeks control over Ukraine despite US peace efforts, WP reports	Russian President Vladimir Putin has not abandoned his maximalist goal of controlling Ukraine, despite U.S. efforts to broker a ceasefire, the Washington Post (WP) reported on March 13, citing sources familiar with classified U.S. intelligence reports. Putin has a &quot;long-standing desire to restore &#x2018;Mother Russia&apos;&quot; and remains determined to assert power over Kyiv, one official said commenting on the U.S. intelligence assessment circulated among President Donald Trump&apos;s administration on March 6. Some officials reportedly believe that even if Russia agrees to a temporary truce, Moscow will use the pause to rearm, violate the agreement, and create provocations to blame on Ukraine. Ukraine had agreed to the truce during talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided Russia did as well. The deal led Washington to resume military and intelligence support for Kyiv. Putin said on March 13 that Russia is prepared to accept the U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire, but only if Kyiv halts mobilization, military training, and arms imports. Zelensky later dismissed Putin&apos;s conditions as &quot;Russian manipulations&quot; and called for tougher sanctions on Moscow. Trump, who has previously warned of &quot;devastating&quot; financial consequences for Russia if the war continues, said on March 13 that Putin&apos;s statement was &quot;very promising&quot; but &quot;wasn&apos;t complete.&quot; Moscow views Trump as weak, lacking a basic set of principles, and potentially open to manipulation, a European intelligence official told WP, citing fresh intelligence. If a permanent ceasefire is reached, Russia is likely to revert to the &quot;hybrid&quot; or non-military tactics it used to undermine Ukraine before its full-scale invasion in 2022, the official added. U.S. officials are reportedly cautious in assessing what peace terms Putin might agree to, but see no indication that he has backed down from his demand to bring Kyiv into Russia&apos;s sphere of influence. Western security officials told Bloomberg on March 10 that Putin has deliberately set &quot;maximalist&quot; demands on territorial concessions, peacekeepers, and Ukraine&apos;s neutrality, knowing they are likely unacceptable to Kyiv and European nations.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-still-seeks-control-over-ukraine-despite-us-peace-efforts-wp-reports/	2025-03-14T01:01:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1988745197.jpg
Ukrainian drones strike Tuapse oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar Krai, governor says	Ukrainian drones struck the Tuapse oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai overnight on March 14, setting fire to a gasoline storage tank, regional Governor Veniamin Kondratiev said. &quot;The area of the fire is more than 1,000 square meters, and emergency services are working,&quot; Kondratiev wrote on Telegram, claiming there were no casualties. Russian pro-government media outlet Mash reported that the fire was caused by debris from a downed drone. Eyewitnesses reportedly heard a series explosions over several minutes. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Kyiv has not commented on the attack. 0:00/1&#xD7;A purported video showing a fire burning at the Tuapse oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai following a reported attack by Kyiv on March 14, 2025. (Astra / Telegram)The Tuapse oil refinery, with an annual processing capacity of 12 million tons, plays a key role in supplying fuel to the Russian military. Following an earlier strike, the facility underwent an emergency shutdown in May. Kyiv has intensified attacks on Russian fossil fuel infrastructure, seeking to disrupt revenue streams that fund Moscow&apos;s war effort. Ukrainian forces regularly conduct long-range drone strikes on military and industrial targets inside Russia. Earlier this week, 74 drones were shot down on approach to Moscow in the early hours of March 11, authorities claimed, marking the largest drone attack against Russia&apos;s capital during the full-scale war. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its forces had intercepted a massive strike of 337 Ukrainian drones across multiple regions, including 91 over Moscow Oblast, 126 over Kursk Oblast, 38 over Bryansk Oblast, and others over the Belgorod, Ryazan, Kaluga, Lipetsk, Oryol, Voronezh, and Nizhny Novgorod regions. This is the largest number of drones launched against Russia in a single attack during the entire full-scale war. The strike took place as Ukrainian and U.S. delegations were about to meet in Saudi Arabia to discuss possible peace terms with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-hit-russias-tuapse-oil-refinery-reportedly-setting-fuel-tank-on-fire/	2025-03-13T23:53:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-14_07-21-50.jpg

Majority of Americans believe Trump 'too closely aligned' with Russia, poll finds	Some 56% of Americans believe that U.S. President Donald Trump is &quot;too closely aligned&quot; with Russia amid shifting U.S. foreign policy, a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on March 13 found. A total of 40% of respondents disagreed with the statement, the poll showed, while 4% chose not to answer. Since taking office, Trump has distanced the U.S. from its traditional role as Ukraine&#x2019;s primary supporter, instead questioning Kyiv&#x2019;s commitment to peace and implying that Ukraine shares blame for the ongoing war. Those agreeing with the statement were split heavily along partisan lines, with 89% of Democrats and just 27% of Republicans agreeing that Trump &#xA0;is &quot;too closely aligned&quot; with Russia. Trump&#x2019;s recent stance on Ukraine, including his public rebuke of President Volodymyr Zelensky and short-lived halt on U.S. military aid to Kyiv, has drawn praise from Russian officials while raising concerns among European allies. His administration&#x2019;s position has prompted Russian officials to express optimism about a potential thaw in U.S.-Russia relations. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state television on March 3 that &quot;the new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations,&quot; calling the shift a positive development that &quot;largely aligns&quot; with Moscow&apos;s interests. Since taking office Trump has called for Ukraine to sign a mineral resource deal with the United States. The deal was derailed after a spat between Zelensky, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the White House on Feb. 28. Despite the complexities of the deal, a plurality of Americans, or 44%, said they support Trump&apos;s plan of &quot;conditioning U.S. military support for Ukraine on the U.S. getting a share of Ukraine&apos;s mineral wealth.&quot; The poll was conducted online among 1,422 U.S. adults between March 11-12 and has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.	https://kyivindependent.com/majority-of-americans-believe-trump-too-closely-aligned-with-russia-poll-finds/	2025-03-13T21:29:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1066818340.jpg

Enough is enough' — Greenland PM criticizes Trump's annexation efforts	Greenland&apos;s Prime Minister Mute Egede criticized U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s suggestion that the U.S. could annex Greenland in a Facebook post on March 13. &#x201C;The U.S. president has once again aired the thought of annexing us,&#x201D; Egede wrote. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t keep treating us with disrespect. Enough is enough.&#x201D; Egede announced plans to convene a meeting with Greenland&#x2019;s political leaders to reinforce their rejection of Trump&#x2019;s proposal. Trump&apos;s most recent comments about Greenland came during a White House meeting on March 12 with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. &#x201C;I think it will happen,&#x201D; Trump said in response to a reporter asking the probability of Greenland&#x2019;s annexation. He also claimed that the U.S. needs Greenland &#x201C;for international security.&#x201D; Greenland is an autonomous territory of Denmark and a NATO member state. The Arctic island houses both Danish and U.S. military bases and has vast reserves of mineral wealth. Russia has said it is monitoring developments regarding Trump and Greenland due to Moscow&apos;s own &quot;strategic interests&quot; in the Arctic region.	https://kyivindependent.com/enough-is-enough-greenland-pm-criticizes-trumps-annexation-efforts/	2025-03-13T20:04:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192273983.jpg
German Defense Minister calls for unified European approach toward defense procurement	German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius called for a unified European approach toward defense procurement in order to avoid bureaucratic delays, Reuters reported on March 12. &quot;We don&apos;t have time for this, it&apos;s excessive and expensive,&quot; he said. His remarks followed a meeting with defense ministers from the U.K., France, Italy, and Poland in Paris, where they discussed strengthening European defense and supporting Ukraine. Pistorius also called for coordinated and consistent arms purchases across Europe. &quot;We want to buy more, we want to buy consistently and simultaneously... together we can buy cheaper,&quot; he stated.

Trump's Ukraine envoy sidelined by Kremlin amid peace talks, NBC reports	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, was excluded from peace talks between Russia and the United States after the Kremlin said it did not want him present, NBC News reported on March 13, citing U.S. and Russian officials. Although Kellogg was appointed by Trump to negotiate an end to Russia&apos;s war, he has been notably absent from the recent peace talks in Jeddah and Riyadh. According to a Russian official that spoke to NBC News, Russian dictator Vladimir Putin did not want Kellogg included in the peace talks because he is perceived as being too sympathetic to Ukraine. Kellogg previously co-authored a peace plan that would freeze the front line in Ukraine, take NATO accession off the table for an extended period, and partially lift sanctions imposed on Russia. His peace proposals also call for continued U.S. military aid to Ukraine as well as strong security guarantees to Kyiv to prevent further Russian aggression. Kellogg previously visited Kyiv in late February for discussions with Ukrainian officials, but has since not been involved in a U.S. delegation in talks with Russia. Notably, Trump&apos;s special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, has emerged as a key negotiator with Russia. Witkoff, who previously traveled to Russia to negotiate the release of American teacher Marc Fogel, arrived in Moscow on March 13 to discuss the 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine proposed by the U.S. According to experts who spoke with the Kyiv Independent last month, Kellogg may still have a role to play, particularly regarding U.S.-Europe relations. However, others suspect that Kellogg may have been fully sidelined and will no longer be involved in brokering peace between Ukraine and Russia. Kyiv agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia did as well. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on March 13 Russia is ready to agree to the U.S.-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine but demands guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops, nor receive military aid during it.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-ukraine-envoy-sidelined-by-kremlin-nbc-reports/	2025-03-13T17:58:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1242112038.jpg
US to resume shipping long-range bombs to Ukraine, Reuters reports	The United States is preparing to resume shipping long-range Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bombs (GLSDB) to Ukraine, Reuters reported on March 13, citing sources familiar with the weapon. According to Reuters, the GLSDBs, which have been upgraded to more effectively counter Russian jamming, may be used by Ukrainian military forces in the coming days, as a stockpile is already present in Europe. The weapons will arrive at a critical time, as U.S. and Ukrainian officials have confirmed that Kyiv&apos;s supply of Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles, has been depleted. In total, the U.S. sent Ukraine less than 40 long-range ATACMS since the start of the full-scale invasion. Earlier this week, President Trump&apos;s administration agreed to resume security assistance to Ukraine, including military aid and intelligence sharing, following high-level talks in Saudi Arabia. Kyiv also confirmed its commitment to the interim 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington, on the condition that Russia agrees to the terms and implements them simultaneously. U.S. security assistance to Ukraine had been previously frozen following the heated meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on February 28. The GLSDB can reportedly strike at a range of 160 kilometers, expanding Ukraine&#x2019;s long-range capabilities, alongside Storm Shadow/SCALP and ATACMS missiles. The delivery of the GLSDB was first announced by the Biden administration in February 2023, with initial estimates putting their arrival in Ukraine in late 2023. Ultimately, the weapons were first delivered in February 2024. As talks on a 30-day ceasefire continue, the Trump administration toughened sanction on March 13 on Russia&apos;s oil and gas industry. The move comes as U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 7 that he is considering imposing sweeping banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until there is a ceasefire and peace agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-receive-long-range-bombs-from-us-reuters-reports/	2025-03-13T16:06:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/SAAB.jpg
Sweden to provide $137 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine	Sweden will provide Ukraine with more than 1.4 billion Swedish kronor ($137.7 million) in humanitarian aid, the country&apos;s International Development Minister Benjamin Dousa announced on March 13. The support package, its largest civilian support package to date, will go toward humanitarian assistance as well as Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction and development. According to Dousa, the funds will address urgent needs such as energy supply, housing, medical care, mine clearance, safe schooling, vocational training, and veteran support. &quot;We must strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s resilience in every way possible. The Ukrainians are defending both their own freedom and security ours,&quot; Dousa said in a statement. The support package will be allocated to a number of projects and initiatives, including more than $10 million toward the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for mine clearance and energy infrastructure support. In 2025, Sweden&apos;s total support to Ukraine will account for 14 percent of its overall development assistance budget. In recent months, Sweden, a staunch NATO ally, has continued to provide Ukraine with various aid packages. On March 8 the Swedish Embassy in Ukraine announced the country will provide 22.5 million Swedish kronor ($2.2 million) to support Ukrainian women. And on Jan. 30, the country announced a military aid package to Ukraine worth over $1.2 billion &#x2014; Sweden&apos;s largest tranche of military assistance since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Earlier in the day on March 13, neighboring Finland announced that the country will provide its own military aid package valued at approximately 200 million euros ($217.4 million).	https://kyivindependent.com/sweden-to-provide-137-million-in-civilian-support-to-ukraine/	2025-03-13T15:37:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2156168873.jpg
US toughens sanctions on Russian energy payments	The Trump administration has toughened sanction on Russia&apos;s oil and gas industry on March 13 by not renewing an exemption that allows Russian banks to access U.S. payment systems to conduct energy transactions. The exemption, initially issued by the Biden administration, was not re-signed by Trump and will make it more difficult for countries to buy primarily Russian oil, likely leading to higher oil prices. The exemption initially applied to transactions involving natural gas, oil and petroleum products, coal, uranium, and similar products. The move comes as U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 7 that he is considering imposing sweeping banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until there is a ceasefire and peace agreement. Kyiv agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia did as well. The talks in Saudi Arabia also led to the U.S. restarting key military and intelligence support for Ukraine, which had been halted last week. Trump previously ruled out lifting sanctions on Moscow before a deal is reached. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on March 13 that Russia is ready to agree to the U.S.-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine but demands guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops, nor receive military aid during it. Reuters reported on March 12, citing Russian sources, that Russia is unlikely to agree to a temporary truce in Ukraine proposed by the U.S., feeling it has the upper hand on the battlefield and viewing the ceasefire as a trap. Shortly after his inauguration, Trump threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions on Russia to force their hand in negotiations, saying &quot;we can do it the easy way or the hard way.&quot; In the following weeks, Trump instead lashed out at Ukraine, claiming President Volodymyr Zelensky was &quot;not ready for peace&quot; and halting military aid to Ukraine and intelligence sharing with Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-toughens-sanctions-on-russian-energy-payments/	2025-03-13T15:13:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1240913057.jpg

McDonald's relaunches breakfast menu in Ukraine amid full-scale war	McDonald&apos;s Ukraine announced the return of its breakfast menu in six Ukrainian cities after the menu&#x2019;s disappearance following the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale Russian in February 2022, the company said in a press release on March 13. The comeback of McDonald&apos;s breakfast in Ukraine follows months of customer requests, with social media users repeatedly calling for its comeback and turning it into a viral trend. The announcement comes as more Western companies expand offerings to Ukrainian customers amid the full-scale war, with some companies choosing to reopen storefronts across the country. &quot;Around 60% of goods and products for McDonald&apos;s in Ukraine come from local suppliers. The company provides stable and large-scale orders, helping create new jobs and increasing tax revenues,&quot; said Oleksandr Bohorodov, CFO of McDonald&apos;s Ukraine. Breakfast is now available in six western Ukrainian cities &#x2013; Lviv, Lutsk, Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, Yaremche, and Kovel &#x2013; until 10:30 AM in restaurants and 10:15 AM for delivery. Before relaunching its breakfast menu, McDonald&apos;s has been testing it in Vinnytsia since December. After Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, McDonald&apos;s temporarily suspended operations and reopened its first three restaurants in Kyiv in September 2022. McDonald&apos;s said breakfast will return to more cities in the coming weeks. However, in eastern regions closer to the front line, including Poltava, Dnipro, Kremenchuk, Kryvyi Rih, Kropyvnytskyi, and Oleksandriia, the breakfast menu will remain unavailable. The obstacles are primarily air raids and related operational difficulties, McDonald&apos;s wrote. For safety reasons, McDonald&apos;s restaurants close during air raid alerts, and all employees must take shelter. Once the alert ends, it takes about an hour to restart equipment and prepare for reopening, the company said. According to air raid statistics, on March 12, Sumy Oblast was under alert for 20 hours, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast for 17.5 hours, and Kharkiv Oblast for over 14 hours per day. Currently, 109 McDonald&apos;s restaurants are operating in 36 cities across Ukraine, the same number as before the invasion, employing around 10,000 people. Fifteen McDonald&apos;s locations in Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv, and Sumy remain closed, while restaurants in Dnipro, the main city of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, reopened in 2023. In January 2025, a Russian missile strike on Kyiv damaged Ukraine&#x2019;s oldest McDonald&apos;s, which first opened in 1997 as the country&apos;s first-ever location. Other retailers like H&amp;M reopened in November 2023, while Inditex, a Spanish-owned multinational company that owns Zara and other brands, reopened some of their stores in Kyiv in 2024. Swedish furniture giant Ikea also reopened their stores in Ukraine last summer. In 2022, following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, McDonald&apos;s closed its 847 restaurants in Russia, taking a financial hit of $55 million per month before fully exiting the Russian market.	https://kyivindependent.com/mcdonalds-relaunches-breakfast-menu-in-ukraine-amid-full-scale-war/	2025-03-13T13:37:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1243384031.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia needs war, Zelensky says in response to Putin's preconditions for ceasefire	Key developments on March 13: Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s remarks about a 30-day ceasefire indicate that he is preparing a rejection of the U.S. proposal, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during his evening address on March 13. &quot;Putin is afraid to say directly to (U.S.) President (Donald) Trump that he wants to continue this war, that he wants to kill Ukrainians. That&apos;s why they in Moscow demand such preconditions for a ceasefire that will make it impossible or will (postpone it) as long as possible,&quot; Zelensky said. Kyiv agreed to a temporary truce proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia did as well. Days after, on March 13, Putin said he was ready to agree to the proposal but demands guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops, nor receive military aid during it. Zelensky described Putin&apos;s response as &quot;Russian manipulations.&quot; &quot;Now we have all heard very predictable, very manipulative words from Putin in response to the idea of silence at the front &#x2014; he is in fact preparing to reject it as of now,&quot; Zelensky said. In his response during a press conference on March 13, Putin mentioned the situation on the battlefield, claiming that a ceasefire would be beneficial to Ukraine now as Russia is advancing along the front line. He also raised the question of who would control the temporary truce along the more than 2,000-kilometer front line. The American side is ready to organize the oversight and verification of the temporary ceasefire, according to Zelensky. He also argued that a truce would make it possible to address all security issues and &quot;put a plan to end the war on the table.&quot; &quot;We do not set conditions that complicate anything. Russia does that,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;They need a war.&quot; Zelensky called for pressure on Putin by imposing sanctions on Russia. Previously, Trump warned that Moscow could face &quot;devastating&quot; financial consequences if it chooses to continue its all-out war against Ukraine. Trump said on March 13 that Putin&apos;s statement regarding the 30-day ceasefire was &quot;very promising&quot; but &quot;wasn&#x2019;t complete,&quot; adding he is willing to meet with the Russian president. Russian forces have retaken Sudzha, a key stronghold of Ukrainian troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on March 13. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claim. As of late March 12, the Ukrainian military confirmed battles in the Sudzha area. Ukrainian troops captured Sudzha, a town with a pre-war population of 6,000 some 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s border, at the start of the Kursk incursion in August 2024. Military analysts from the DeepState monitoring group and the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank have also reported that Russia has partially or fully seized Sudzha, as Ukraine is allegedly withdrawing from the town. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry published a video of the ruined Sudzha after its reported recapture. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the footage&apos;s veracity. &quot;The Russian military almost entirely destroyed Sudzha with airstrikes,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, an official at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &quot;The town and its surroundings were destroyed, and few civilian buildings survived.&quot; The news comes at the heels of a rapid Russian advance in the border region that seemed to have greatly diminished the Ukrainian salient. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, said on March 12 that Russia has retaken more than 86% of the territory in Kursk Oblast captured by Kyiv in mid-2024. The Russian Defense Ministry also reported capturing the settlements of Melovoi and Podol as of March 13. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi acknowledged the &quot;difficult situation&quot; in the region but said that Ukraine will hold the defenses &quot;as long as reasonable and necessary.&quot; Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) drones attacked a camouflaged drone production facility in Russia&apos;s Kaluga Oblast late on March 12, HUR sources confirmed to the Kyiv Independent. Drone production lines were located on the grounds of an aerated concrete plant in the village of Obukhovo in Kaluga Oblast&apos;s Dzerzhinsky district, one of the sources claimed. The statement comes after Kaluga Oblast Governor Vladislav Shapsha said that 25 drones were downed over the region overnight, with drone wreckage setting fire to an unspecified industrial facility in Dzerzhinsky district. One employee suffered minor injuries, and the fire has been extinguished, according to Shapsha. Locals reported powerful explosions and a fire at the plant on social media. Drone debris also damaged a cell tower and a power line in the Khvastovichsky district, the southernmost part of Kaluga Oblast, Shapsha said. Russian air defenses downed 77 drones overnight, including 30 over Bryansk Oblast, six over Kursk and Voronezh oblasts each, and five over Rostov and Belgorod oblasts each, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. An unspecified infrastructure facility was also damaged on the evening of March 12 in Voronezh Oblast, a region bordering Ukraine&apos;s Luhansk Oblast, Governor Alexander Gusev said on his Telegram channel. The targeted facility was part of the region&apos;s gas infrastructure, the Baza Telegram channel reported, citing residents. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Airports in Penza, Saratov, and Volgograd imposed temporary flight restrictions overnight, Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency announced. Washington has discussed with Ukraine the control of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant as part of a potential peace deal, U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 13. Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said that Ukraine and the U.S. had discussed a lot of details of the final deal, including &quot;concepts of land.&quot; &quot;We have been discussing with Ukraine land and pieces of land that would be kept and lost and all of the other elements of a final agreement,&quot; Trump said. &quot;There&apos;s a power plant involved, a very big power plant involved. Who is going to get the power plant, and who is going to get this and that, and so you know it&apos;s not an easy process. But phase one is the ceasefire,&quot; he added. The largest nuclear plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in the city of Enerhodar, has been under Russian occupation since 2022. While the facility remains under Russian control, it is not currently generating electricity.

Hungary seeks removal of Russian oligarch Fridman from EU sanctions list, FT reports	Hungary&#x2019;s ambassador to the EU demanded that Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman be removed from the sanctions list, threatening to block the extension of EU sanctions imposed on about 2,000 Russians otherwise, the Financial Times reported on March 13, citing four officials familiar with the matter. Hungarian leadership, broadly seen as the most Russian-friendly in the EU, has repeatedly obstructed and delayed the bloc&apos;s sanctions against Moscow and military aid for Ukraine. The travel restrictions and asset freezes on politicians and businessmen who supported Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine will expire on March 15, unless all EU member countries decide to extend them for another six months. The bloc&apos;s ambassadors are meeting in Brussels on March 13 after several days of talks that failed to reach a compromise, according to the Financial Times (FT). Initially, Budapest sought a removal of eight names from the sanctions list, including Russian oligarchs Petr Aven and Alisher Usmanov, but finally focused on Fridman, the newspaper wrote. Fridman and Aven were sanctioned by the EU on Feb. 28, 2022, for their ties to the Kremlin and support for Moscow&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine. In April 2024, the EU&#x2019;s General Court lifted sanctions against the two, ruling that the EU had failed to demonstrate their role in undermining Ukraine. However, subsequent EU decisions kept them on the sanctions list under a different justification, classifying them as &quot;leading businesspersons providing substantial revenue&quot; to Russia. Ukraine&apos;s staunchest allies, such as the Baltic States, reportedly opposed any easing of EU sanctions against Moscow. Hungary&apos;s idea to remove Fridman from the sanctions list was backed by Luxembourg, three unnamed officials told FT. Last year, Fridman filed a lawsuit against Luxembourg, where his stake in the London-based investment company LetterOne is located. The oligarch claimed $15.8 billion in sanctions-related damages.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-seeks-removal-of-russian-oligarch-fridman-from-eu-sanctions-list-ft-reports/	2025-03-13T12:39:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1168816031.jpg
US opposed to frozen conflict in Ukraine, Zelensky's chief of staff says	The U.S. opposes settling Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine as a frozen conflict, Presidential Office Head Andriy Yermak said on March 13. &quot;We have been very clear that we will never agree to a frozen conflict. We are very much against it, and our positions align with our American partners,&quot; Yermak said. Speaking on national television, Yermak said that the Ukraine-U.S. meeting in Saudi Arabia on March 11 &#x2013; which he had led &#x2013; and a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire are just the beginning, with more work ahead. Kyiv agreed to a temporary truce, provided that Russia did as well. Days after, on March 13, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he is ready to agree to the proposal but demands guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops, nor receive military aid during it. Washington opposed an agreement that would be similar to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum or the 2014-2015 Minsk agreements, which failed to prevent or stop Russia&apos;s aggression, Yermak said. According to Yermak, the Ukrainian and American delegations also agreed that European representatives would participate in the peace process. Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy, said earlier that Europe will not be directly involved in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, but its interests will be considered.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-opposed-to-frozen-conflict-in-ukraine-zelenskys-chief-of-staff-says/	2025-03-13T12:20:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2201664857.jpg
‘Putin thinks Trump is an easy mark,’ John Bolton says in interview	Instead of approaching the war in Ukraine from a geopolitical and moral perspective, U.S. President Donald Trump is framing his policy on Russia through the lens of his personal relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to former U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton. &#x201C;Trump thinks Putin is his friend. He trusts Putin,&#x201D; Bolton told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Putin thinks Trump is an easy mark. And as a former KGB agent, Putin knows exactly how to manipulate him, and I think that&apos;s what he&apos;s been doing since the inauguration, if not before,&#x201D; he explained. Bolton served as the national security advisor to Trump from 2018-2019 during his first administration. Bolton&apos;s 2020 memoir, &#x201C;The Room Where It Happened,&#x201D; offers a candid account of the tumultuous turn his working relationship with Trump took, highlighting his concerns about his ability to effectively lead, including his impulsive decision-making on complex policy issues and lack of understanding of the importance of a strong U.S. foreign policy. In an interview with the Kyiv Independent, Bolton provided his insight on why Trump appears so eager to appease the Kremlin, why any U.S. attempt to align with Russia to deter China would be a &quot;fantasy,&quot; and the missed opportunities the U.S. for more than a decade to deter Russian aggression not only in Ukraine but beyond. This interview was conducted several hours before Putin signaled he was ready for a ceasefire on the condition that Ukraine doesn&#x2019;t receive more military aid or build its military. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. John Bolton, former national security advisor, speaks during a senate briefing hosted by the Organization of Iranian American Communities (OIAC), to discuss U.S. policy on Iran in Russell Building on March 16, 2023.

(Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Trump has repeatedly claimed that negotiating with Russia is easier than with Ukraine. Despite Russia&#x2019;s nightly attacks on Ukraine, he continues to insist that Putin wants peace. Why do you think Trump is so eager to cater to the Kremlin&apos;s interests, especially when they have such maximalist demands? John Bolton: Trump has said many times publicly that he believes if he has good relations with a foreign head of state, then the U.S. has good relations with that country. And the opposite is also true. If he has bad relations with a foreign head of state, U.S. relations with that country are bad. Trump thinks Putin is his friend. He trusts Putin. He has said in just the past few weeks, &#x201C;Putin says he wants peace, and I trust him. I think if he didn&apos;t want peace, he would tell me.&#x201D; &#xA0;So that gives you a pretty good idea of how he sees Putin. Now, I don&apos;t think Putin thinks he&apos;s Trump&apos;s friend at all. I think Putin thinks Trump is an easy mark. And as a former KGB agent, Putin knows exactly how to manipulate him, and I think that&apos;s what he&apos;s been doing since the inauguration, if not before. The notion that Russia is easy to deal with dates back to 2018, when Trump left Washington for the NATO summit &#x2014; where he nearly withdrew from the alliance &#x2014; before heading to Helsinki for a bilateral meeting with Putin. As he was leaving the White House to get on helicopter Marine One, he said to the assembled press, &#x201C;You know, I&apos;ve got this NATO meeting, then I&apos;m going to meet Prime Minister Theresa May in London, then I&apos;m going to meet Putin in Helsinki. You know, the meeting with Putin could be the easiest of them all. Who would think it?&#x201D; Well, there&apos;s only one person who would think it, and it&apos;s Trump. That was almost six years ago, and nothing has changed. The facts about Russia&#x2019;s conduct in the war &#x2014; being the aggressor from the start &#x2014; simply don&#x2019;t matter to Trump. After all, he believes in helping his friends. President Volodymyr Zelensky has had a strained relationship with Trump &#x2014; through no fault of his own or Ukraine&#x2019;s &#x2014; ever since the infamous &quot;perfect phone call&quot; in the summer of 2019, which ultimately led to Trump&#x2019;s first impeachment. And Zelensky has tried very hard, I think, in the past six months to build a relationship with Trump, but as we saw in the catastrophe in the Oval Office a few weeks ago, it hasn&apos;t worked. And there are people like U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance, who I think have also decided they don&apos;t like Zelensky and don&apos;t like Ukraine &#x2014; Vance once said in his 2022 Senate campaign, &#x201C;I don&apos;t care what happens to Ukraine.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s an uphill struggle. The Kyiv Independent: The Republican Party historically championed strong defense policies and deterrence against U.S. adversaries like Russia. What do you think accounts for the party&#x2019;s shift in attitude toward Ukraine? John Bolton: I believe a majority of Republicans actually still support Ukraine, certainly out in the country among Republican voters. And I think quietly behind the scenes, a majority in Congress do, too, but they&apos;re intimidated by Trump. They&apos;re very worried that he will support candidates against them in a primary election to decide who the Republican nominee will be. And in districts that are very safely Republican, it doesn&apos;t matter who the Democratic nominee is in November. It matters whether the incumbent House member, let&apos;s say, can win against a primary opponent. But I think the situation is beginning to change. More people are beginning to speak out. Trump&apos;s tariff policies are causing a lot of concern, and that adds to concern about his 180-degree shift toward Russia in the Ukraine situation. If our European allies continue their efforts to clarify who&#x2019;s at fault in Ukraine and what&#x2019;s at stake, we&#x2019;ll just have to keep fighting this battle day by day. The Kyiv Independent: The Kremlin has recently said that Trump&apos;s apparent foreign policy shift aligns with their interests. What damage does a U.S.-Russia alliance cause on the global stage? John Bolton: It could come close to destroying NATO. Having watched Trump come very close to withdrawing from NATO at the Brussels summit in 2018, I saw more than I needed to see about how much he doesn&apos;t like the institution &#x2014; he hasn&apos;t changed his view on that. But even before a formal withdrawal, he could do a lot that would debilitate NATO and really undermine the capabilities of the institution to defend its own members or its interests in other conflicts. It&#x2019;s a very dangerous course that he&apos;s pursuing. They&apos;re certainly watching it very carefully in Beijing, where they believe that if the U.S. and NATO won&apos;t stand up for a country in the middle of Europe that&apos;s been invaded, we won&apos;t stand up for Taiwan, we won&apos;t stand up for the Southeast Asian countries near the South China Sea. So it really does have global implications for U.S. security and that of our friends and allies, too. The Kyiv Independent: Some argue that Trump sees a potential rapprochement with Russia as a way to deter China in the future. I&apos;m curious about your thoughts on that, especially given the uncharacteristically supportive statements China has made for Ukraine recently. What is the dynamic that&apos;s forming here? John Bolton: It&apos;s a fantasy to believe the U.S. can somehow use the conflict in Ukraine to separate Russia from China. In the abstract, separating Russia is a very good goal to have. But for reasons not having anything to do with Ukraine or the U.S., Russia and China have grown closer, and it&apos;s really almost impossible to separate Russia from them today. The China-Russia axis is far from perfect, but in the case of the Ukraine war, China has been a considerable assistance to Russia. They have laundered sanctioned Russian financial assets through their own opaque financial system out into global markets. They&apos;ve significantly increased purchases of Russian oil and gas. They&apos;ve talked about building new pipeline capacity, which from China&apos;s point of view would be a plus so they don&apos;t have to lift oil in the Persian Gulf and risk taking it across the Indian Ocean. And they&apos;ve provided a lot of political cover for Russia during this war, which they would expect reciprocity for if they went against Taiwan or did something in the South China Sea. There are still differences of interest between Russia and China. This is not the Cold War Sino-Soviet alliance that had an ideological bond. And obviously China is the partner in charge now, not Russia. So it&apos;s not exactly the same, but I think the idea that somehow Russia could be pulled away from China as part of a settlement in Ukraine is totally unrealistic. I don&apos;t think China has any good intentions in mind for Ukraine, either &#x2014; they see it as something obviously Russia wants to have. The Kyiv Independent: Given your hawkish stance on Russia, was there a decisive moment in the past decade of the war in Ukraine when the U.S. had a real chance to deter Russian aggression but failed? John Bolton: When former U.S. President George W. Bush said at the Bucharest NATO Summit in April of 2008 that Ukraine and Georgia should have been brought into NATO on a fast track, that was the time to do it. Four months later, we saw the Russians move into Georgia, occupying Abkhazia and South Ossetia &#x2014; and they&#x2019;re still there. The only effective deterrence (against Russian aggression) is NATO membership, which is something that obviously Finland and Sweden concluded after 75 years of neutrality. They watched what happened in Ukraine and concluded the only real security was behind a NATO border. We had a chance in 2008 to do that (for Ukraine), and France and Germany objected. After Russia&apos;s 2014 annexation of Crimea and takeover of part of the Donbas, the West did little to impose meaningful sanctions. Former U.S. President Barack Obama showed no interest in taking strong action. I believe this all but guaranteed that when the Kremlin felt ready for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, they expected little resistance. That expectation was reinforced by the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan &#x2014; negotiated by Trump but carried out by Biden &#x2014; which sealed the deal. There were several missed opportunities (to combat Russian aggression), and unfortunately, we&#x2019;re seeing the consequences today. The Kyiv Independent: &#xA0;The Trump administration has said the ball is in Russia&#x2019;s court regarding a Ukraine ceasefire. But given Russia&#x2019;s track record of violating agreements and shifting blame, can we argue that responsibility now lies with the U.S.? If Russia inevitably breaks another ceasefire, and tries to blame Ukraine, how do you think Trump&#x2019;s administration will respond? John Bolton: We&#x2019;ll have to see what happens with the ceasefire first. The ceasefire is not in Ukraine&apos;s interest &#x2014; anything that freezes the conflict along the existing battle lines is laying a foundation for annexation of all the territory on the Russian side by the Russians. That&apos;s been their pattern before. I think Putin has not had any incentive to come to the negotiating table because Trump&apos;s been giving him everything that he wanted. But I think now, with this ceasefire idea out there, Putin also has to be careful he doesn&apos;t lose credibility with Trump. I don&apos;t think he will outright reject the ceasefire. He may accept it, or I think most likely he&apos;ll say something like, &#x201C;I think a ceasefire idea is absolutely worthwhile and I&apos;m ready to proceed. In principle, I agree with it.&#x201D; But there would be technical details to work out there, which wouldn&#x2019;t get worked out anytime soon. Putin, judging by Russian propaganda from yesterday, seems convinced that they are on the verge of pushing the remaining Ukrainian troops out of Kursk. I don&#x2019;t think he will entertain negotiations until that operation is complete. In the meantime, he&#x2019;ll stall for time, mindful of preserving the goodwill he has built with Trump. Although Trump has given away so much at this point, it&apos;s hard to see what he could take back. Hi there, it&#x2019;s Kate Tsurkan, thank you for reading my latest interview. Given Bolton&#x2019;s experience of working alongside Trump, I felt like he was one of the best people to talk to about the ongoing problems surrounding the U.S.&#x2019;s increasingly uncertain role in achieving peace in Ukraine.

China is more likely than the EU to replace Starlink on the Ukrainian battlefield	Fears of a Starlink shut-off at the front line have racked Ukraine. European satellite internet firms took the opportunity to step forward as replacements &#x2014; but even collectively, they are unlikely to fill the void in coverage that Starlink&apos;s shut off would leave. Today, Starlink satellite internet service dominates both worldwide and at Ukraine&#x2019;s front lines. Moreover, Chinese rather than European competitors are building equivalent satellite constellations. If Ukraine is left waiting on an ally to provide an alternative to Starlink, Russia will likely get one from China first. The U.S. paused weapons aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine last week, though that aid resumed after ceasefire talks in Jeddah. Ukrainians had feared Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and semi-official but eminently visible member of President Donald Trump&#x2019;s team would cut Starlink access in Ukraine. Musk has tweeted, however, that he would &#x201C;never do such a thing or use it as a bargaining chip.&#x201D; &#x201C;Nobody knows right now if he&#x2019;ll cut it off,&#x201D; Colonel Pavlo Khazan of the General Directorate of Electronic and Cyber Warfare within the General Staff tells the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;But this would be a very serious problem.&#x201D; There are a handful of alternative satellite internet providers, but on the ground, Starlink still provides several hundred times more bandwidth than the nearest second &#x2014; while also being much cheaper and easier to use. Starlink has proved remarkably resistant to Russian electronic interference. &#x201C;There would probably be some kind of catastrophe,&#x201D; a head of intelligence for a unit near Pokrovsk told the Kyiv Independent, who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons, &#x201C;because right now, everyone is still on Starlinks.&#x201D; &#x201C;There are no real alternatives,&#x201D; a cybersecurity specialist with Ukraine&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry who asked to remain anonymous as they were not authorized to speak publicly told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;But I hardly think they&#x2019;re going to turn it off. It would be bad for business.&#x201D; The character of Ukraine&#x2019;s defense would fundamentally change without Starlink. The front would not necessarily collapse, but it would certainly go much darker. European satellite internet firms are looking to fill in for Starlink at the same time that the European Union is broadly looking to take up the mantle of protection that Trump is keenly throwing away. But while they are eagerly presenting themselves as alternatives, they ultimately fall down on numbers. Among major proposed alternatives are providers like Luxembourg&#x2019;s SES and the French Eutelsat Group, which includes the British firm OneWeb. Of all 10,000-plus man-made satellites in orbit around the earth, over two-thirds are Starlink&#x2019;s. They are, moreover, the best of their kind. &#x201C;No one had really built industrial-level laser comms terminals before at this massive scale, and so Starlink just did it,&#x201D; says Blaine Curcio, a space and satcom consultant who publishes the China Space Monitor. Starlink has been shut off on the Russian side of the line since the start of the war. That made Kursk the largest test bed for a Starlink-free Ukrainian military. Reports have found OneWeb provided Ukrainian soldiers with satellite internet in Kursk Oblast during their seven-month occupation of the Russian region. Starlink&#x2019;s nearest functional competitor, OneWeb has 648 satellites in orbit. OneWeb has not launched a new satellite since &#x201C;completing its fleet&#x201D; in March 2023. The fleet only has one satellite over Ukraine. OneWeb&#x2019;s satellites each provide a bandwidth of 7.2 gigabits per second, adding up to a network with a &#x201C;cumulative usable capacity of 1.1 terabits per second.&#x201D; Starlink&#x2019;s current V2 satellites offer 96 Gbps, and SpaceX claims that its V3 satellite under development will hit 1 Tbps per unit. As of the end of 2024, Starlink&#x2019;s total capacity was roughly 350 Tbps. A Terabit is 125,000 megabytes. Streaming a high-definition movie requires around 10 megabytes per second, meaning only 12,500 people worldwide could watch a movie at the same time on OneWeb. Curcio sees EutelStat&#x2019;s claims of stepping up in Ukraine as a way of patching up a long-tarnished reputation. &#x201C;They have been beaten down pretty badly because everyone thinks it&#x2019;s a complete cash sink,&#x201D; said Curcio. &#x201C;In addition to saying, &#x2018;Hey, we care about the Ukrainians,&#x2019; they&#x2019;re trying to show people that OneWeb is something that can actually work, because that&#x2019;s been a big challenge for them.&#x201D; OneWeb has been around for almost as long as Starlink but has not had an illustrious track record. EutelSat Group, formed following a merger with OneWeb near the end of 2023, has seen its share price collapse in the intervening years. It went up over 600% following comments by Eva Berneke that they are &#x201C;looking at&#x201D; replacing Starlink in Ukraine.

(Ed Ram/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)Starlink currently boasts 5 million users globally and over 42,000 terminals in Ukraine. Representatives for OneWeb declined to comment on their ability to replicate that scale but wrote in a statement to the Kyiv Independent that &#x201C;OneWeb solutions can provide an alternative for certain government and defense applications.&#x201D; OneWeb representatives would also not answer as to where to buy its terminals in Ukraine. On outside markets, they run upwards of $10,000. New Starlinks, for comparison, sell on Ukrainian online electronics stores for just over $400, compared to roughly $549 on U.S. Amazon. The numbers for other would-be EU competitors to Starlink are even grimmer. SES has a total of 70 satellites. Canadian firm Telesat is currently trying to get 198 satellites into orbit. They face remarkably slow launch times. These EU telecoms are unlikely to be able to expand coverage rapidly to cover Ukraine in the near term. &#x201C;It&apos;s not feasible because there&apos;s not enough spare satellites,&#x201D; says Curcio. &#x201C;There are other constellations in development that will be bigger in terms of mass, but OneWeb is the one that has actually achieved its fleet,&#x201D; says Juliana Suess, an associate at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, &#x201C;whereas Project Kuiper, IRIS&#xB2;, etc., they haven&apos;t got satellites up yet. So they&apos;re not really an alternative for now.&#x201D; The California-based Astranis is one firm that Curcio points to as more likely to be able to send a handful of satellites to Ukraine in the near future, largely because they do launches for relatively high-risk customers like the Peruvian satellite communications company Andesat, some of whom go broke and can no longer pay for Astranis&#x2019; service. Another military comms service called TooWay is a joint project between EutelSat and Viasat dating back to 2007 that Ukraine was already using before Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. &#x201C;With TooWay, the speed of transfer of this data and internet connection is very small. That is, you&#x2019;ll end up downloading one video for half a day,&#x201D; Volodymyr &#x201C;Tekhnar,&#x201D; a battalion commander for the 28th Mechanized Brigade who declined to provide his last name for security reasons, told the Kyiv Independent.

(Pierre Crom/Getty Images)Russia hacked and brought down Tooway an hour before attacking on Feb. 24, 2022, ultimately pushing Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces onto Starlink in the first place. Despite being a consumer technology, Starlink has also remained remarkably resistant to Russian electronic warfare. As a result, Ukraine today remains &#x201C;quite&#x201D; dependent on Starlink, said Suess. In the absence of Starlink, alternatives would, in effect, take Ukraine&#x2019;s front-line forces back in time from broadband to dial-up internet. It&#x2019;s not likely to destroy the Ukrainian line overnight. But Ukrainian soldiers would shortly face communications issues similar to those of their Russian counterparts, shrouding them in a thicker fog of war. &#x201C;We are prepared for the event that the Starlink network goes down. We may not have super speeds, but let&apos;s just say that we will be able to watch online as time goes on,&#x201D; said Tekhnar. Starlink has been geofenced to skirt the Russian line since before the outset of the full-scale war. Russian acquisition of limited access hastened advances like that on Vuhledar this past fall. Conversely, the Ukrainian advance near the end of 2022 slowed as Ukrainian forces pushed forward faster than Starlink was restoring coverage to areas previously blocked as being under Russian occupation. Much of the souring of the relationship between Ukraine and Musk began with Musk refusing a Ukrainian request to turn on Starlink to allow a military operation in Crimea. Ukraine on its own has a handful of satellites in orbit, mostly of a tiny experimental variety. As of the end of 2024, Russian state-owned space firm RosKosmos tallied 288 satellites in orbit. Suess noted that most Russian satellites &#x201C;don&#x2019;t look like they&apos;re suitable for tactical communications.&#x201D; &#x201C;Some of the communication satellites that Russia has that were used by the intelligence service, for example, were purely mailbox satellites,&#x201D; she explained. &#x201C;So you send up a signal or a message, and then you have to wait for that satellite to just come back around to the ground station in however many hours.&#x201D; Like Russia, Ukraine without Starlink will have to depend more on data streams that are narrower and more vulnerable to interference, including frequency bands of cell service reserved for military and greater reliance on on-the-ground radio comms like walkie talkies, as well as civilian cell towers that often behave erratically at the front. Streaming and sharing high-resolution footage of drone attacks would become a largely untenable luxury. Further into the future, however, the most likely alternative to Starlink for both Russia and Ukraine is not European but Chinese. The first alternative to Starlink that came to mind for Colonel Khazan was G60 Starlink, also known as the Thousand Sails, a network of satellites from the Chinese company SpaceSail. &#x201C;The most relevant company by far is SpaceSail,&#x201D; agreed Curcio. &#x201C;In the last year and a bit, they&apos;ve now launched 72 satellites, and I guess more importantly, they&apos;ve entered a handful of forward markets in different ways.&#x201D; After years of Chinese state projects falling short of launch goals, the government gave &#x201C;the green flag for somewhat private investment&#x201D; into the telecom industry at the end of 2023, Curcio said. SpaceSail was the primary beneficiary. The firm is, however, barred from providing services within China and has a strictly international aim. &#x201C;Give them 18 months and SpaceSail will probably be able to get a couple tens of gigabits per second, maybe, of capacity over that general part of the world at any given time &#x2014; maybe more. Maybe a hundred,&#x201D; said Curcio of Ukraine. This is, however, not likely to benefit Ukraine in the long term. Ukrainian government agencies have in recent years purged Chinese telecoms equipment like Huawei from their networks since the start of the war. Chinese companies routinely provide Russia with high-tech services and equipment that the U.S. and EU ban. In January, SpaceSail set up a subsidiary in Kazakhstan, a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States and a long-time eager intermediary for Russian sanctions evasion. SpaceSail&#x2019;s ongoing launches are consequently more likely to give Russian soldiers in Ukraine internet services that Ukrainian soldiers have long enjoyed than they are to help Ukraine move beyond Starlink.

Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant part of peace talks, Trump says	Washington has discussed with Ukraine the control of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant as part of a potential peace deal, U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 13. Trump&apos;s remarks come days after Kyiv agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia did as well. The talks also concerned potential territorial concessions, according to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said that Ukraine and the U.S. had discussed a lot of details of the final deal, including &quot;concepts of land.&quot; &quot;We have been discussing with Ukraine land and pieces of land that would be kept and lost and all of the other elements of a final agreement,&quot; Trump said. &quot;There&apos;s a power plant involved, a very big power plant involved. Who is going to get the power plant, and who is going to get this and that, and so you know it&apos;s not an easy process. But phase one is the ceasefire,&quot; he added. The largest nuclear plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in the city of Enerhodar, has been under Russian occupation since 2022. While the facility remains under Russian control, it is not currently generating electricity. Ukraine and its allies have repeatedly urged Russia to withdraw its troops from the plant. Throughout its occupation, the plant has been repeatedly disconnected from the Ukrainian power grid due to Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure. Russian forces currently occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine, from where reports of systematic repression, torture, and forced deportations emerge.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-occupied-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-part-of-peace-talks-trump-says/	2025-03-13T10:51:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1255012375.jpg
John Bolton on Trump’s Russian policy missteps	The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Kate Tsurkan sat down with former U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton to discuss why U.S. President Donald Trump considers Putin &#x201C;a friend,&#x201D; and why a ceasefire at this time would not be favorable for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/john-bolton-on-trumps-russian-policy-missteps/	2025-03-13T10:26:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_1337.JPG
BREAKING: Putin ready for ceasefire but demands 'guarantees' depriving Ukraine of aid	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. Russia is ready to agree to the U.S.-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine but demands guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops, nor receive military aid during it, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on March 13. Speaking at a press conference with Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, Putin said that the end of hostilities should &quot;address the original causes of the crisis,&quot; parroting the Kremlin&apos;s long-standing narrative about its all-out war against Ukraine. Kyiv agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia did as well. The talks in Saudi Arabia also led to the U.S. restarting key military and intelligence support for Ukraine, which had been halted last week. According to Putin, the proposed temporary truce must be designed in a way to lead to a long-term peace. He said that Russia wants guarantees that Ukraine will not mobilize or train soldiers, as well as won&apos;t receive weapons during the 30-day ceasefire.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-ready-for-ceasefire-but-demands-guarantees-depriving-ukraine-of-aid/	2025-03-13T09:15:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/03/GettyImages-1249872830.jpg
Russia seeks to prolong war, Zelensky says about lack of clear response to proposed ceasefire	Russia is trying to delay peace for as long as possible, given the lack of its clear position on a proposed 30-day ceasefire, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 13. Kyiv agreed to a temporary ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia did as well. The talks in Saudi Arabia also led to the U.S. restarting key military and intelligence support for Ukraine. Yuri Ushakov, a Russian presidential aide, said earlier on March 13 that the Kremlin was prioritizing a long-term settlement over a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine but the final position is up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to Zelensky, Kyiv is committed to moving quickly toward peace and is prepared to do its part in creating &quot;all of the conditions for a reliable, durable, and decent peace.&quot; &quot;Regrettably, for more than a day already, the world has yet to hear a meaningful response from Russia to the proposals made,&quot; he said. &quot;This once again demonstrates that Russia seeks to prolong the war and postpone peace for as long as possible.&quot; The U.S. is ready to organize the technical aspects of control over the temporary truce, Zelensky said. He voiced hope that Washington&apos;s pressure would be &quot;sufficient&quot; to compel Russia to end its all-out war. Zelensky&apos;s remarks come as U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, arrived in Moscow for talks on the proposed 30-day ceasefire. Witkoff is expected to meet Putin later in the day, who is unlikely to agree to a temporary truce in Ukraine, according to Reuters. The news agency reported on March 12, citing undisclosed Russian sources, that Moscow feels it has the upper hand on the battlefield and viewing the ceasefire as a trap. The ceasefire proposal coincided with Russia&apos;s breakthrough in Kursk Oblast. Moscow claimed on March 12 to have retaken over 86% of seized territories in the region, including a key town of Sudzha, captured by Ukrainian troops at the start of the Kursk incursion in August 2024. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi acknowledged the &quot;difficult situation&quot; in the region but said that Ukraine will hold the defenses &quot;as long as reasonable and necessary.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-seeks-to-prolong-war-zelensky-says-about-lack-of-clear-response-to-proposed-ceasefire/	2025-03-13T08:07:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204066732.jpg
The Counteroffensive: What Trump's intelligence sharing pause cost Ukraine	For nearly a week, Ukraine was left in the dark by its once-close ally, deprived of American intelligence as Russia advanced. Civilians suffered missile and drone attacks, while the military faced Russian offensives. All of this was aimed at forcing Ukraine into a &quot;peace&quot; agreement. &quot;(With U.S. President Donald Trump), there is a swing that goes back and forth. To be honest, I don&apos;t know what will happen next,&quot;said Maksym*, a Ukrainian soldier working with intelligence. After a weeklong pause, U.S. intelligence sharing resumed during talks between the U.S. and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia on March 11. During the hiatus, Ukraine&#x2019;s position weakened as Russian forces captured more territory and launched terror attacks on civilians. On March 8, for example, Russia launched a massive missile and drone attack on Odesa, hitting the port and civilian targets. This pause demonstrated that the U.S. was willing to cut its partner off from vital intelligence, even as Ukraine faced escalating threats. &#x201C;This is not Mean Girls. This is not some episode of some television show. This is very serious,&#x201D; said U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, announcing the resumption of intelligence sharing. Someone should remind him that it was his administration&#x2019;s actions that put people&#x2019;s lives in danger due to a political dispute. Trust is hard to build and easy to lose. Ukraine will never fully trust the Trump administration again, and every day will bring new worries about whether another slip of the tongue could lead to another suspension of support. This isn&#x2019;t &quot;deal-making&quot; as the Trump White House might frame it. It&#x2019;s hostage-taking, the worst kind: preventing long-time allies from defending themselves against a deadly foe. &quot;Of course, we were upset. That goes without saying. The lack of intelligence sharing brings a lot of problems,&quot; Maksym told The Counteroffensive. Before the war, Maksym worked in IT, with no military background. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion, he woke to a strange sound: &quot;Who sets off fireworks at five in the morning?&quot; It didn&#x2019;t take long to realize that those weren&#x2019;t fireworks. Worried that Russian forces might invade his home region of Rivne, bordering Belarus, Maksym left Kyiv to join Ukraine&apos;s territorial defense. Over the past three years, he&#x2019;s taken on multiple roles: training troops on drone operations, becoming an air defense specialist, and eventually working in intelligence. He now focuses on open-source intelligence and automating processes within Ukraine&#x2019;s military. While the exact sources of Ukraine&apos;s intelligence are unclear, Politico estimates that 80% of it comes from foreign sources, with the majority provided by the U.S. Specifically, the U.S. supplies Ukraine with radar data, satellite imagery, and alerts about Russian aircraft or missile launches. Thankfully, no one interviewed by The Counteroffensive considered the suspension of U.S. intelligence to be an irreversible catastrophe. Although this pause significantly hampered Ukrainian operations, Kyiv could still gather intelligence from its own drones, radio interceptions, and by working with other countries. However, U.S. intelligence had never been fully comprehensive. Washington shared only a portion of its data with Ukraine and sometimes did so with delays.

(Diego Fedele/Getty Images)The U.S. advantage is its unrivaled dominance in military satellite reconnaissance. With nearly 250 military satellites, the U.S. conducts near real-time surveillance. NATO countries combined have just about 50. For Ukraine, the suspension of satellite imagery from U.S.-based Maxar was particularly critical. Though Ukraine could purchase satellite imagery on its own, the cost was high. Maxar provides 90% of U.S. geospatial intelligence and can capture key locations every 3-4 hours with high resolution &#x2014; capabilities few others can match. &quot;We could see, for example, a Russian convoy moving toward a certain location, allowing us to prepare in advance. But now, our troops are somewhat &apos;blind,&apos;&quot; Maksym said before U.S. intelligence sharing resumed. Ukraine still had two satellites of its own and one provided by Germany, but Maxar&#x2019;s contributions were far more comprehensive. During the pause, France offered some assistance, though its capabilities were far more limited. French satellites specialize in electromagnetic spectrum monitoring, which can detect Russian activity. Additionally, suspending intelligence sharing complicated the use of U.S. weapons like the HIMARS precision-guided missile system, which relies heavily on American intelligence. Ukrainian forces have used HIMARS to disrupt Russian supply routes and destroy ammunition depots. However, without U.S. data, Ukrainian troops had to rely on their own drones for targeting. According to Oleksii Teplukhin, CEO of the Ukrainian AI startup Griselda, intelligence pauses like this severely hinder Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to plan deep strikes inside Russia. &quot;To take out an (Russian) oil depot, you don&#x2019;t just need to know where it&#x2019;s located. You need more detailed intelligence &#x2014; what was there last week, the exact position of the rectification column [a technological apparatus used for separating mixtures], and so on,&quot; Oleksii told The Counteroffensive. But the suspension didn&#x2019;t just impact the military. Civilians paid the price too. &quot;I&#x2019;m glad U.S. support has been restored. At the very least, it will help our air defense because, over the past few days, both drones and missiles have heavily terrorized cities like Dnipro and Odesa,&quot; Maksym said. Despite the setbacks, Maksym doesn&#x2019;t consider Americans enemies. He&#x2019;s puzzled by the motivations behind the White House&#x2019;s decisions. Going forward, though, he believes Ukraine will take steps to reduce its reliance on the U.S. and look more toward European allies, such as NATO, for intelligence. Ukraine has learned a vital lesson: it can&#x2019;t rely solely on others for its survival. Just as Kyiv developed its own long-range weapons when Western allies hesitated, it&#x2019;s likely to seek independent solutions for intelligence. &quot;The U.S. is a huge country, and any mistakes or inaccuracies on its part affect the entire world. It&#x2019;s like a voodoo doll for the whole planet,&quot; Maksym said. The name of the military service member has been changed for security reasons.

Ukraine receives $1.7 billion from Canada under G7 loan covered by Russian assets	Ukraine has received the first tranche of 2.5 billion Canadian dollars (about $1.7 billion) from Ottawa under the G7&apos;s Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) initiative, the Ukrainian Finance Ministry announced on March 13. The ERA mechanism, totaling $50 billion, provides loans to Ukraine that will be repaid using future profits from frozen Russian assets. According to the ministry, Canada&apos;s contribution to the initiative is $3.5 billion, and the loan will be granted for 30 years. &quot;Canada is a reliable and steadfast partner of Ukraine. I am grateful for the support of the ERA mechanism. It is a fair and necessary tool to hold Russia financially accountable for its crimes in Ukraine,&quot; Ukrainian Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko said. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, G7 countries have frozen approximately $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets. The ERA initiative, backed primarily by the U.S. and the EU, aims to use profits from these frozen assets to finance Ukraine&apos;s defense and reconstruction. In addition to the Canadian contribution, Kyiv received 752 million pounds ($970 million) as the first installment of the U.K.&apos;s contribution to the G7 loan, as Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on March 7.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-receives-1-7-billion-from-canada-under-g7-loan-covered-by-russian-assets/	2025-03-13T06:58:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2201099727.jpg
Putin has likely rejected Trump's ceasefire proposal — what now?	It looks like Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected the 30-day ceasefire proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump on the war against Ukraine. According to the Financial Times, citing an unnamed senior aide to Putin, Moscow does not want a temporary ceasefire and is pushing for a long-term peace settlement that will &quot;take into account its interests and concerns.&quot; Trump promised tough action against Russia if it failed to engage in peace talks over Ukraine. He suggested escalating military support for Ukraine and imposing severe sanctions on Russia in response. Keep in mind that when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky voiced similar skepticism about a temporary ceasefire and called for more substantive talks before pursuing long-term peace, he was harshly criticized. In that now-infamous Oval Office moment, Trump berated Zelensky for not being serious about peace, even threatening to cut military and intelligence support for Ukraine. This decision cost real lives. So what will Trump do now? Putin has just smashed the ball back into Trump&#x2019;s court, and now the president is scrambling to keep the game going. His next move will be crucial in signaling to all parties, particularly Putin, whether Trump is really willing to use a &quot;stick&quot; approach against Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) walks past a guard before a meeting with Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashshenko at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, on March 13, 2025. (Maxim Shemetov/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)Putin can smell weakness. He&#x2019;s seen it throughout the negotiation process with Trump, who already gave away much of his negotiating leverage before any talks even began &#x2014; promising Russia could keep all the territory it currently occupies, agreeing to no NATO membership for Ukraine, no security guarantees for Ukraine, and a quick lift on sanctions. Putin will likely exploit this weakness and Trump&#x2019;s apparent desire to win Putin&#x2019;s favor at Ukraine&#x2019;s expense. Putin&#x2019;s modus operandi in negotiations, both on Ukraine and with the West, has always been to use talks as a leverage point to secure concessions. He sees negotiations as a way to probe for weaknesses and demand concessions. His instinct here will be to play hard to get, drag talks out to show strength, or imply that Russia doesn&#x2019;t need a ceasefire &#x2014; the other side is the one that really wants it. The danger for Putin is that if he pushes too hard, drags things out too long, he risks angering Trump. The assumption here is that the U.S. would boost military support for Ukraine and increase sanctions on Russia. However, given that the Trump administration has thus far taken a carrot-and-stick approach &#x2014; offering carrots to Russia and sticks to Ukraine &#x2014; it&#x2019;s unclear whether Trump has the resolve to really take on Putin. If I have doubts, so does Putin, and he will likely test the U.S. position in these ceasefire talks. Understanding the Trump administration&#x2019;s willingness to play hardball now will be useful for Putin later when more substantive talks begin. Is Trump truly willing to play tough with Putin to secure peace in Ukraine?

Kyiv Mayor Klitschko announces more dismissals of city officials amid corruption probe	Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko announced further dismissals of top city officials on March 13 amid a widening corruption probe into land dealings in the capital. The dismissals follow revelations from Ukraine&apos;s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&apos;s Office (SAPO), which released recordings of Kyiv officials allegedly involved in fraudulent land schemes. &quot;Regarding the latest high-profile news concerning the capital&apos;s land sector, the city provides law enforcement officers with all requested documents and facilitates the investigation,&quot; Klitschko wrote on Facebook. The following officials are set to be dismissed: Ihor Dolinsky, director of the Kyiv Institute of Land Relations; Volodymyr Sharyi, director of the special housing fund; Viktor Pohrebnoi, director of the Financial Company Zhytloinvest; and Valentina Sviatina, deputy director of the Department of Urban Planning and Architecture, Klitschko said. Klitschko previously announced on Feb. 28 that Yurii Leonov, deputy director of the city&apos;s special housing fund, Oleksii Mushta, deputy head of an urban infrastructure management agency, and Petro Olenych, deputy head of the Kyiv City Administration, are also being fired. Kyiv city council member and chairman of the land commission Mykhailo Terentiev has written a letter of resignation from the Engineering Center communal enterprise director post. &quot;Also, the Udar political party faction recalls him from the Kyiv council deputies,&quot; Klitschko added. Investigators claim the suspects registered ownership of non-existent buildings to obtain land plots without a fair tender. Olenych was previously detained in February, with the High Anti-Corruption Court setting bail at Hr 15 million (nearly $360,000). He was released on Feb. 21 and claimed that his family had borrowed money for bail while he planned to seek suspension from office during the investigation. Authorities have charged 10 individuals in the case, seven of whom have been detained. The alleged mastermind, former Kyiv City Council member Denys Komarnytskyi, remains on Ukraine&apos;s wanted list.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-mayor-klitschko-fires-top-officials-amid-corruption-probe/	2025-03-13T06:44:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2198905810.jpg
Kyiv sees no surprises as Russia signals its rejection of US-backed ceasefire proposal	Russia is signaling its intention to reject a U.S. ceasefire proposal already accepted by Ukraine in Jeddah this week, setting the stage for a likely diplomatic standoff between Washington and Moscow. After nearly 48 hours of silence on the issue, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov on March 13 dismissed the idea of a ceasefire, describing it as a &quot;respite for the Ukrainian military&quot; and adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin would comment on the matter later in the day. Following weeks of tumultuous talks and meetings, including the now infamous Oval Office showdown, Ukrainian and U.S. officials on March 11 emerged from talks in Saudi Arabia in agreement over a ceasefire proposal. Kyiv said it was ready to accept a 30-day-long ceasefire if Russia did as well. In the words of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Kyiv&#x2019;s readiness meant the &quot;ball is in (Russia&apos;s) court,&quot; adding that if the Kremlin rejected the proposal, &quot;then we&apos;ll, unfortunately, know what the impediment is to peace here.&quot; In response to Ushakov&#x2019;s statement, a source in the President&apos;s Office told the Kyiv Independent that it is &#x201C;awaiting what Putin will say.&#x201D; The source added that it would be &quot;a question for the Americans&quot; if Putin rejects the U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal. The potential rejection came as no surprise in Kyiv. &quot;Putin is absolutely not interested in peace or a true ceasefire,&quot; lawmaker Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of the parliament&apos;s foreign affairs committee, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;On the other hand, he is afraid of (U.S. President Donald) Trump. So, he will try to formulate his response to Trump&apos;s proposal as a sort of agreement but with unacceptable demands.&quot; The expectation in Kyiv &#x2014; as well as in other Western capitals &#x2014; is that Putin will not back down from the maximalist demands he set out at the beginning of his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;Putin has not backed off one iota from his maximalist demands, which we all know, (includes) the four (oblasts) of eastern Ukraine, and the neutralization of Ukraine,&quot; General Sir Richard Shirreff, former deputy supreme allied NATO commander Europe, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;In other words, no NATO, the demilitarization of Ukraine, the &apos;denazification&apos; of Ukraine, by which he means installing a puppet government.&quot; Russia is set to demand Ukraine withdraw from areas of the four oblasts &#x2014; Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk &#x2014; it illegally annexed in 2022 despite not fully controlling them. The future of any peace process now hinges on Trump&apos;s response. The U.S. has a lot less leverage than it did just a few weeks ago. The Trump administration has ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine and said Kyiv must be prepared to concede territory. These moves were described by Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia and professor of international studies at Stanford University, as &quot;giving away all your strongest cards before the negotiation has started.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s an incredibly bad negotiating strategy on behalf of the Trump team,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent earlier this week. Ukraine has largely accepted that it won&apos;t be joining NATO in time to make a difference to the ongoing peace talks, but the issue of territorial concessions is still in play. Although Kyiv may be forced to agree to some sort of territorial concessions, it has previously rejected a full withdrawal from all four oblasts. Putin, however, said such a move would be a prerequisite for peace talks. These mutually incompatible viewpoints mean Trump will be forced to step in and mediate, though what exactly he will do &#x2014; and which side he&apos;ll come down on hardest &#x2014; remains to be seen. &quot;Trump&apos;s got to do something; otherwise, he&apos;ll look very weak,&quot; Shirreff said. Now, the U.S.&apos;s strongest hand remains economic pressure in the form of sanctions, something Trump has already threatened Russia with if they don&apos;t agree to the ceasefire proposal. John Herbst, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, told the Kyiv Independent that this puts immense pressure on Trump to follow through. &quot;If he suddenly makes a new demand on Ukraine because Russia is asking for it, he looks like Putin&apos;s poodle,&quot; he said. But there&apos;s always the possibility Trump could impose Putin&apos;s maximalist demands on Ukraine, something Shirref said would have enormous consequences for the entire world. &quot;If the international community signed up to that, it would mean the absolute final nail in the coffin of the international rules-based order,&quot; he said. &quot;Because it means that might is right, and that Putin has got what he wants by appalling force.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-sees-no-surprises-as-russia-signals-its-rejection-of-us-backed-ceasefire-proposal/	2025-03-13T06:37:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202985151.jpg
Putin aide claims NATO 'threatens' Russia in Baltic	Russian presidential aide Nikolai Patrushev claimed on March 13 that NATO is deliberately &quot;escalating&quot; tensions in the Baltic region, portraying the alliance as a threat to Russia&apos;s security. His comments come amid NATO&apos;s warnings that Russia may be ramping up hybrid operations in the region. Several undersea cables were damaged in recent months, leading the alliance to increase its presence in the Baltic Sea. Speaking to National Defense, a Russian military and political magazine, Patrushev alleged that NATO&apos;s naval forces are working to &quot;block&quot; Russia in the Baltic while ignoring diplomatic engagement with Moscow. Patrushev further accused the alliance, particularly the U.K., of provoking instability in the region. &quot;The forecast of the situation in the Baltic allows us to draw attention to the deliberate fomentation of regional tensions by the naval forces of European countries of the alliance,&quot; he said. Patrushev also claimed, without evidence, that NATO is conducting cyberattacks on Russian ships&apos; navigation systems to create maritime emergencies, including accidents and infrastructure failures. While Russian-linked vessels have been detained in connection to damaged Baltic Sea cables, Western intelligence agencies remain divided on whether they were acts of sabotage or accidental damage. Tensions between NATO and Russia have risen following Moscow&apos;s all-out attack against Ukraine. Western leaders and intelligence agencies have warned of a potential large-scale war in Europe within the next five years, citing Russia&apos;s increasingly aggressive posture.	https://kyivindependent.com/putins-aide-blames-nato-for-escalating-tensions-in-the-baltic/	2025-03-13T06:07:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1245767486.jpg
ECHR rules Ukraine failed to prevent, investigate violence in Odesa in 2014	The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled on March 13 that the Ukrainian government failed to prevent and adequately investigate deadly clashes between the EuroMaidan supporters and opponents in Odesa in May 2014. The ruling concerns seven applications filed by 28 individuals &#x2014; 25 relatives of the victims and three survivors &#x2014; between 2016 and 2018. Forty-eight people died in the violence that erupted between the two camps on May 2, 2014. A group of pro-Russian activists attacked a pro-EuroMaidan rally but retreated to the Trade Unions House after the ensuing violence. Forty-two of the EuroMaidan opponents died after the building caught fire as the two groups began throwing petrol bombs. Two pro-Ukrainian activists were also killed after suffering gunshot wounds. The ruling noted &quot;authorities&#x2019; failure to do everything that could reasonably be expected of them to prevent the violence in Odesa on 2 May 2014, to stop that violence after its outbreak, to ensure timely rescue measures for people trapped in the fire, and to institute and conduct an effective investigation into the events.&quot; The ECHR noted that Russian propaganda helped to instigate the clashes but acknowledged the applicants&apos; complaints that Ukraine failed to prevent the violence and adequately investigate it. The Ukrainian state was ordered to pay out compensations. The plaintiffs included relatives of victims from both camps, all of whom accused the Ukrainian state of inaction. Russian propaganda has heavily employed the violent episode in Odesa to vilify the EuroMaidan Revolution and falsely paint the movement as pro-Nazi and extremist. The EuroMaidan Revolution began in November 2013 when people gathered at Maidan Nezalezhnosti, Kyiv&apos;s central square, to protest pro-Kremlin President Viktor Yanukovych&apos;s refusal to sign the long-awaited Association Agreement with the European Union. Law enforcement officers, namely Berkut riot police, used violence to suppress the protests, including lethal force. More than 100 people were killed during the revolution, which culminated in Yanukovych fleeing to Russia. &quot;The Court noted that distortion of the events in Odesa had eventually become a tool of Russian propaganda in respect of the war waged by the Russian Federation against Ukraine since February 2022,&quot; the ECHR&apos;s ruling said. &quot;Enhanced transparency in the related investigative work by the Ukrainian authorities might have helped to prevent or counteract that propaganda effectively.&quot; The court noted that the investigation should have been &quot;carried out by an organ entirely independent from the police.&quot; At the same time, the ECHR dismissed allegations that the authorities were not impartial when investigating the deaths of EuroMaidan opponents and supporters.	https://kyivindependent.com/echr-rules-ukraine-failed-to-prevent-violence-in-odesa-in-2014/	2025-03-13T05:40:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-458286736.jpg
Top Putin aide opposes temporary ceasefire, calls it 'respite' for Ukraine	The Kremlin is prioritizing a long-term settlement over a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov said on March 13, calling the U.S. truce proposal a &quot;respite for the Ukrainian military.&quot; His remarks come as U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, reportedly arrived in Moscow for talks on a proposed 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to provide further comments on March 13. &quot;We believe that our goal is a long-term peaceful settlement, and we are striving for that, a peaceful settlement that takes into account the legitimate interests of our country and our known concerns,&quot; Ushakov said on state television. Ushakov added that he outlined Russia&apos;s position on the ceasefire to U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. &quot;I outlined our position that this (ceasefire) is nothing more than a temporary respite for the Ukrainian military, nothing more,&quot; Ushakov said. Waltz and Ushakov also agreed that Ukraine&apos;s potential NATO accession cannot be part of the peace settlement debate, Putin&apos;s aide claimed. The Trump administration has previously called Kyiv&apos;s prospects of joining the alliance unrealistic, while Russia has named a ban on Ukraine&apos;s entry as one of the key conditions in any negotiations. Asked about Witkoff&#x2019;s possible arrival in Moscow, Ushakov declined to comment, saying, &quot;We agreed that this kind of contact would be of a closed nature.&quot; Kyiv agreed to the U.S. proposal during negotiations in Jeddah on March 11, after which Washington resumed military and intelligence support for Ukraine. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham called for sanctions against Russia if Moscow refuses a proposed ceasefire. He promised to introduce new congressional measures targeting Russia and nations that continue to buy Russian goods, including oil, gas, and uranium. In the past, Moscow ruled out a temporary ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. Russian nationalist voices and pro-war bloggers have already spoken out against the U.S.-backed proposal. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed that U.S. officials are in Moscow but did not disclose Russia&apos;s position on the ceasefire proposal.	https://kyivindependent.com/ushakov-comments-on-ceasefire/	2025-03-13T04:34:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2160070185.jpg
Finland announces $217 million military aid package for Ukraine	Finland has announced its 28th military aid package for Ukraine, valued at approximately 200 million euros ($217.4 million), the Finnish Defense Ministry said on March 13. Finnish Defense Minister Antti Hakkanen confirmed that the package includes artillery ammunition, citing Ukraine&apos;s urgent need for such supplies. &quot;There is broad political support and national unanimity on the issue of assistance to Ukraine,&quot; Hakkanen said. The announcement comes as U.S. President Donald Trump urges Europe to take greater responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security while sending mixed signals on whether European allies should be involved in peace negotiations. During a meeting with Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, Hakkanen signed a memorandum of understanding on deepening defense cooperation. The agreement covers defense materiel, intelligence sharing, research and innovation, and munitions production. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Finland has provided Ukraine with 2.5 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in defense aid. On Feb. 26, Helsinki pledged an additional 660 million euros ($691 million) in military assistance, including domestically produced equipment.	https://kyivindependent.com/finland-announces-over-200-million-military-aid-package-for-ukraine/	2025-03-13T04:15:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2064209173--1-.jpg
Rheinmetall prepared to supply arms for possible Ukraine peacekeeping mission	German defense company Rheinmetall is prepared to supply weapons for a potential international peacekeeping mission in Ukraine following the end of Russia&#x2019;s war, the company&apos;s CEO, Armin Papperger, said on March 12, Deutsche Welle reported. Papperger said that Rheinmetall could provide &quot;more than 2,000 items&quot; for such a mission, including tanks, armored vehicles, electronic warfare systems, reconnaissance drones, and satellite technology for monitoring a demarcation line. Several European countries, including the U.K., France, Denmark, and Sweden, have previously expressed willingness to deploy peacekeepers to Ukraine. The Washington Post reported on Feb. 17 that up to 30,000 European troops could be involved in the ceasefire monitoring mission. Papperger noted that the talks remain theoretical for now, with no concrete negotiations underway with the company. While U.S. President Donald Trump claimed on Feb. 24 that Russian President Vladimir Putin would allow European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a peace deal, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has rejected the idea. Rheinmetall is one of Europe&#x2019;s largest arms manufacturers and a key supplier to Ukraine. Under German government contracts, it delivers 155 mm artillery rounds, Leopard 1 tanks, mortar shells, and surveillance drones. The company also opened a military vehicle repair facility in Ukraine in June 2024 and plans to build three additional plants in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/rheinmetall-prepared-to-supply-arms-for-possible-ukraine-peacekeeping-mission/	2025-03-13T03:52:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2076692591.jpg
Ukrainian drones strike covert UAV plant in western Russia, sources claim	Ukrainian military intelligence drones (HUR) attacked a camouflaged drone production facility in Kaluga Oblast late on March 12, HUR sources confirmed for the Kyiv Independent. Drone production lines were located on the grounds of an aerated concrete plant in the village of Obukhovo in Kaluga Oblast&apos;s Dzerzhinsky district, one of the sources claimed. Kyiv has carried out regular long-range drone strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia&apos;s rear, seeking to undermine its ability to wage its all-out war. The statement comes after Kaluga Oblast Governor Vladislav Shapsha said that 25 drones were downed over the region overnight, with drone wreckage setting fire to an unspecified industrial facility in Dzerzhinsky district. One employee suffered minor injuries, and the fire has been extinguished, according to Shapsha. Locals reported powerful explosions and a fire at the plant on social media. Drone debris also damaged a cell tower and a power line in the Khvastovichsky district, the southernmost part of Kaluga Oblast, Shapsha said. Russian air defenses downed 77 drones overnight, including 30 over Bryansk Oblast, six over Kursk and Voronezh oblasts each, and five over Rostov and Belgorod oblasts each, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. An unspecified infrastructure facility was also damaged on the evening of March 12 in Voronezh Oblast, a region bordering Ukraine&apos;s Luhansk Oblast, Governor Alexander Gusev said on his Telegram channel. The targeted facility was part of the region&apos;s gas infrastructure, the Baza Telegram channel reported, citing residents. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Airports in Penza, Saratov, and Volgograd imposed temporary flight restrictions overnight, Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency announced.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-strike-covert-uav-plant-in-western-russia-source-confirms/	2025-03-13T03:43:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/chasiv-yar-4.jpg
UK, France lead talks among 37 countries on 'coalition of the willing' in Ukraine, Bloomberg reports	London and Paris are leading discussions among 37 countries from Europe, Asia, and the Commonwealth on shielding Ukraine against any future Russian aggression in case of a peace settlement, Bloomberg reported on March 13, citing official sources. The &quot;coalition of the willing,&quot; which would provide security guarantees to Kyiv by sending peacekeeping troops, aircraft, or other support, was first presented by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer during the London summit on March 2, which hosted leaders of European nations and Canada. Officials from Australia, Japan, and New Zealand joined a follow-up meeting in Paris on March 11, expanding the potential coalition beyond the confines of NATO and Europe, undisclosed sources told Bloomberg. The U.S., which seeks to scale back its involvement in the Russia-Ukraine war and ruled out deployment of its own peacekeepers in the country, was not part of the discussions. The Trump administration has adopted a more confrontational stance toward Kyiv and Europe while seeking a reset of relations with Moscow. Kyiv&apos;s partners nevertheless hope to form a unified strategy to present to U.S. President Donald Trump and persuade him to commit some form of security guarantees, such as airpower or intelligence support, Bloomberg wrote. The coalition aims to form a &quot;reassurance force&quot; as a key security guarantee for Ukraine. Members who are reluctant to send their own troops to Ukraine can instead deploy soldiers to neighboring countries or provide ships, aircraft, intelligence, tanks, or other support, according to the outlet. Further details are to be discussed during a follow-up meeting this weekend. Russia has repeatedly rejected any presence of NATO peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a potential peace deal. Moscow has also been evasive on the issue of a 30-day ceasefire agreed upon between the U.S. and Ukraine. European countries have welcomed the proposed truce but stressed that security guarantees must be part of any stable peace deal. France, the U.K., and Germany also oppose Russia&apos;s efforts to demilitarize Ukraine, seeing the Ukrainian Armed Forces as the best possible security guarantee.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-france-lead-talks-between-37-countries-on-coalition-of-the-willing-in-ukraine-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-13T03:17:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2199562383.jpg
Trump's envoy Witkoff reportedly lands in Moscow as US seeks Russian agreement on ceasefire	A plane carrying Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s special envoy to the Middle East, has landed in Moscow, Russian pro-government media Interfax reported on March 13, citing aviation services. Witkoff&#x2019;s visit comes as the U.S. seeks Russian agreement on a proposed 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, which Kyiv accepted during talks in Jeddah on March 11. Washington subsequently resumed military and intelligence support for Ukraine after suspending it the previous week. The White House has not confirmed whether Trump plans to call Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the proposal. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has confirmed that U.S. negotiators are traveling to Russia but declined to reveal Moscow&apos;s position on the ceasefire proposal. U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz reportedly held a phone conversation with his Russian counterpart on March 12, and Witkoff is expected to meet with Russian officials, possibly including Putin, in Moscow. Witkoff previously traveled to Moscow in February for the release of U.S. teacher Marc Fogel from a Russian prison. Witkoff claimed he spoke directly with Putin for over three hours during his visit. According to Reuters, some U.S. officials and analysts fear Moscow could exploit the truce to deepen divisions between Washington, Kyiv, and their European allies while regrouping for further offensives.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-envoy-witkoff-reportely-lands-in-moscow-as-us-seeks-russian-approval-for-ceasefire/	2025-03-13T03:07:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196945288.jpg
Russian diesel exports to Africa reportedly plummet amid Ukrainian drone strikes	Russia has sharply reduced diesel exports to Africa following repeated Ukrainian drone attacks on its oil refineries, Russian pro-state media outlet RBC reported on March 13. Russian diesel exports to African countries nearly halved in February, dropping from 1.27 million tons in January to 684,000 tons, according to a report by the Price Index Center research project reviewed by RBC. Exports to Brazil fell by 41%, while deliveries to Turkey, Russia&apos;s largest diesel export market, declined by 12% to 1.13 million tons. &quot;The decline in exports is due to an increase in the number of incidents at refineries,&quot; the analysts said, referencing Ukrainian drone strikes. On March 10, Ukrainian military intelligence confirmed it had struck the Novokuybyshevsk oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Samara Oblast. A day earlier, a Ukrainian drone reportedly hit an oil depot in Cheboksary, Chuvashia Republic &#x2014; marking the first attack on the region. Ukraine considers Russian oil infrastructure a legitimate military target, arguing that fossil fuel revenues fund Moscow&apos;s war effort. Kyiv has systematically targeted Russian refineries, military sites, and logistics hubs to weaken Moscow&apos;s capacity to continue its full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-diesel-exports-to-africa-reportedly-plummet-amid-ukrainian-drone-strikes/	2025-03-13T02:48:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
Russia claims to retake Sudzha; Ukraine hasn't confirmed	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russian forces have retaken Sudzha, a key stronghold of Ukrainian troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on March 13. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claim. As of late March 12, the Ukrainian military confirmed battles in the Sudzha area. Ukrainian troops had captured Sudzha, a town of 6,000 residents some 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s border, at the start of the Kursk incursion in August 2024. Military analysts from the DeepState monitoring group and the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank have also reported that Russia has partially or fully seized Sudzha, as Ukraine is allegedly withdrawing from the town. The news comes at the heels of a rapid Russian advance in the border region that seemed to have greatly diminished the Ukrainian salient. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, said on March 12 that Russia has retaken more than 86% of the territory in Kursk Oblast captured by Kyiv in mid-2024. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi acknowledged the &quot;difficult situation&quot; in the region but said that Ukraine will hold the defenses &quot;as long as reasonable and necessary.&quot; The Russian Defense Ministry also reported capturing the settlements of Melovoi and Podol as of March 13. The development comes as the U.S. seeks to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. Kyiv has sought to leverage its positions in Kursk Oblast in potential negotiations but began to rapidly lose its ground in the region at the same time that the U.S. temporarily paused military and intelligence support for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-to-retake-sudzha-kyiv-hasnt-confirmed/	2025-03-13T02:17:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2166312603.jpg
French National Assembly backs resolution on seizing Russian assets	France&apos;s National Assembly, the lower chamber of the country&apos;s parliament, passed a resolution calling for increased support for Ukraine and the seizure of frozen Russian assets, Le Figaro reported on March 13. The resolution, whose significance is largely symbolic, urges the European Union, NATO, and allied nations to boost political, economic, and military aid for Ukraine. It also calls for the EU to move forward with seizing Russia&apos;s frozen assets &#x2014; valued at approximately $300 billion, two-thirds of which are held in Europe &#x2014; to finance Ukraine&apos;s military needs and post-war reconstruction. Kyiv has only received loans covered by interest earned from the frozen assets. Despite fierce debate, the resolution passed with 288 votes in its favor. Fifty-four lawmakers from the left-wing France Unbowed and the Communist Party opposed it, while the far-right National Rally abstained. French lawmakers also amended the resolution to push for &quot;an independent European defense&quot; and to explore the possibility of deploying a European peacekeeping force to Ukraine once hostilities end. The proposal aligns with efforts by French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer to advance a European-led initiative to support Ukraine, particularly amid uncertainty from Washington. Macron has previously floated the idea of sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, a suggestion that sparked backlash from the Kremlin. A recent Elabe Institute poll cited by BFM TV on March 4 found that roughly two-thirds of the French public favor maintaining or increasing aid to Ukraine, as well as deploying peacekeepers after a ceasefire. France, one of Ukraine&apos;s most vocal backers, has taken a leading role alongside the U.K. in supporting Kyiv as U.S. President Donald Trump pressures European nations to increase their contributions. Trump has repeatedly criticized former U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration&apos;s level of aid to Ukraine, insisting that European allies should bear more of the burden.	https://kyivindependent.com/french-national-assembly-backs-resolution-for-more-ukraine-aid-seizure-of-russian-assets/	2025-03-13T01:57:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204111315.jpg
Polish president urges US to deploy nuclear weapons in Poland	Polish President Andrzej Duda called on the U.S. to deploy nuclear weapons in Poland as a deterrent against future Russian aggression, he said in an interview with the Financial Times published on March 13. &quot;The borders of NATO moved east in 1999, so 26 years later, there should also be a shift of the NATO infrastructure east. For me, this is obvious,&quot; Duda said. Duda suggested that U.S. President Donald Trump could relocate nuclear warheads stationed in Western Europe or the U.S. to Poland, arguing that Russia had already taken similar steps by deploying tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus. &quot;Russia did not even hesitate when they were relocating their nuclear weapons into Belarus,&quot; Duda said. &quot;They didn&apos;t ask anyone&apos;s permission.&quot; Duda said he recently discussed the idea with Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, and hopes to revive a nuclear-sharing proposal that he unsuccessfully presented to former U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration in 2022. The proposal comes amid mounting warnings from Western leaders and intelligence agencies about the possibility of a large-scale war in Europe within the next five years. Then-Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and his Belarusian counterpart, Viktor Khrenin, signed an agreement in May 2023 to transfer tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, Poland&apos;s neighbor. Russia&apos;s tactical nuclear weapons are designed for use on the battlefield in Europe and Asia and have a more limited range compared to strategic nuclear weapons, which could reach the U.S. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly issued nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West since launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. While those threats have not materialized, concerns persist over Russia&apos;s military ambitions beyond Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron has also signaled a shift in nuclear policy, saying on March 5 that France is open to extending its nuclear umbrella to protect European allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-president-duda-urges-us-to-deploy-nuclear-weapons-in-poland/	2025-03-13T01:18:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1676988608.jpg
Russia suspected of killing 5 Ukrainian POWs in Kursk Oblast	Russian forces allegedly executed five Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) in Kursk Oblast, Ukrainian Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets reported on March 13. Lubinets referred to a video circulating on social media that purportedly shows unarmed Ukrainian soldiers killed after being captured by Russian troops. According to Ukrainian activist Serhii Sternenko, a video of the suspected execution was recorded in Kursk Oblast, near the village of Kozacha Loknya. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. &quot;We once again see a cynical disregard for international humanitarian law on the part of the Russian army,&quot; Lubinets said, adding that he had sent letters to the U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross to document the suspected war crime. The news comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin made his first visit to Kursk Oblast on March 12 since Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into the region in August 2024. During the visit, which took place amid a rapid Russian advance, Putin declared that Ukrainian military personnel captured in the region &quot;will be treated as terrorists.&quot; Ukraine has previously documented widespread violations of the Geneva Conventions by Russian forces, including the execution of 177 captured Ukrainian soldiers as of mid-December 2024. The U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine reported a sharp rise in executions of Ukrainian POWs, documenting 79 extrajudicial killings across 24 separate incidents since August 2024. Visual evidence of such atrocities continues to emerge, reinforcing concerns over Moscow&apos;s systematic violations of international law.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-executed-five-ukrainian-pows-in-kursk-oblast-ombudsman-says/	2025-03-13T01:11:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2166040846.jpg
5 killed, 28 injured in Russian strikes against Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least five civilians and injured at least 28 over the past day, regional authorities reported on March 13. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 74 of the 117 drones launched by Russia overnight over 11 regions, the Air Force reported. Thirty-eight decoy drones disappeared from radars without causing damage, according to the statement. Russia also launched one Iskander-M ballistic missile from Kursk Oblast, the Air Force said without commenting on the consequences. Four people were injured in Russian attacks against Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, according to Governor Serhii Lysak. A drone attack against Dnipro, the regional center, set fire to an infrastructure facility and damaged residential buildings. The victims included three women aged 52, 56, and 82, according to the statement. A 64-year-old woman was also injured during the Russian attacks against the Nikopol district. Three people were killed and 14 injured during Russian attacks in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. This included two people killed and one injured in Myrnohrad, one killed and another injured in Pokrovsk, eight injured in Kostiantynivka, two injured in Druzhkivka, and two others injured in Oleksiievo-Druzhkivka, according to the statement. A 60-year-old man was injured during a Russian attack against the town of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Russian strikes killed one person and injured six in Kherson Oblast, said the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. Two apartment buildings and 20 houses were damaged. In Sumy Oblast, one civilian was killed in the Seredyna-Buda community when attempting to handle a Russian drone, which subsequently exploded. Two more people were injured during Russian attacks against the Khotin community, the regional military administration reported. An overnight drone strike against the Okhtyrka community also set ablaze multiple garages, though no casualties were reported. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, a 50-year-old man was injured during a Russian strike against the Vasylivka district, Governor Ivan Fedorov said.	https://kyivindependent.com/5-killed-28-injured-in-russian-strikes-against-ukraine-over-past-day/	2025-03-13T00:42:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-13_07-15-01-1.jpg
Russia presents US with demands for possible Ukraine peace deal, Reuters reports	Russia has presented the U.S. with a list of demands for a potential deal to end the war against Ukraine and reset relations with Washington, Reuters reported on March 13, citing two undisclosed sources. According to the sources, Russian and U.S. officials discussed these demands during face-to-face and virtual conversations over the past three weeks. These broad conditions are said to largely mirror those Russia has previously made to Ukraine, the U.S., and NATO. The exact content of the list remains unclear, however, as does the issue of whether Russia is willing to engage in peace talks with Kyiv before these conditions are met. Russia&apos;s previously voiced conditions have included Ukraine permanently abandoning NATO aspirations, prohibiting foreign troop deployments on Ukrainian soil, and recognizing Crimea and four partially occupied regions &#x2014; the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts &#x2014; as Russian territory. In June 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted that Ukraine must withdraw from those four regions as a precondition for negotiations. President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated on March 12 that Ukraine would not recognize any occupied territories as part of Russia in any future peace agreement. Despite U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s claim on Feb. 24 that Putin would allow European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a deal, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has rejected the idea. Russia has also continued to push its long-standing demand that the U.S. and NATO address what it calls the &quot;root causes&quot; of the war, including the alliance&apos;s eastward expansion. Ukraine officially submitted its application to NATO in September 2022. Though NATO members pledged that Ukraine&apos;s path toward membership is &quot;irreversible&quot; at the allied summit in Washington in 2024, the Trump administration has ruled out the accession in the foreseeable future. Trump is waiting to hear from Putin on whether Russia will agree to a 30-day ceasefire that Ukraine has already accepted on the condition that Moscow does as well. Ukraine agreed to the proposal for the temporary truce during talks in Jeddah on March 11, after which Washington resumed military and intelligence support. Putin&apos;s response to the ceasefire proposal remains uncertain. Some U.S. officials and analysts fear that Moscow will use the temporary pause to deepen divisions between Washington, Kyiv, and their European allies while preparing for further offensives, Reuters writes. The Washington Post reported on a document drafted by a Moscow think tank close to the Federal Security Service (FSB) that lays out Russia&apos;s potential maximalist demands for ending the war. These include a buffer zone in northeastern Ukraine along the borders of Bryansk and Belgorod oblasts and a demilitarized zone in southern Ukraine. The document, drafted in February, further calls for &quot;the complete dismantling&quot; of Ukraine&apos;s current government and says that peace is unlikely before 2026. It is unclear what &#x2014; if any &#x2014; role this document plays in the Kremlin&apos;s decision-making. Western security officials told Bloomberg on March 10 that Putin has deliberately set &quot;maximalist&quot; demands on territorial concessions, peacekeepers, and Ukraine&apos;s neutrality, knowing they are likely unacceptable to Kyiv and European nations.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-presents-us-with-demands-for-possible-ukraine-war-deal-reuters-reports/	2025-03-13T00:13:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1251592140.jpg
Ukrainian drones set ablaze Russian factory, infrastructure site overnight, authorities claim	Ukraine attacked six Russian regions with close to 80 drones overnight on March 13, with fires reported at an infrastructure site in Voronezh Oblast and an industrial plant in Kaluga Oblast, according to Russian authorities. Kyiv has carried out regular long-range drone strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia&apos;s rear, seeking to undermine its ability to wage its all-out war. Russian air defenses downed 77 drones overnight, including 30 over Bryansk Oblast, 25 over Kaluga Oblast, six over Kursk and Voronezh oblasts each, and five over Rostov and Belgorod oblasts each, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. Drone wreckage set fire to a building of an industrial enterprise in Dzerzhinsky district in the northern part of Kaluga Oblast, Governor Vladislav Shapsha said. The fire has been extinguished, but one employee received a minor injury, the governor claimed. Drone debris also reportedly damaged a cell tower and a power line in the Khvastovichsky district, the southernmost part of Kaluga Oblast. Kaluga Oblast lies in the western part of Russia, bordering Moscow Oblast from the west. An unspecified infrastructure facility was damaged in the evening of March 12 in Voronezh Oblast, a region bordering Ukraine&apos;s Luhansk Oblast, Governor Alexander Gusev said on his Telegram channel. No casualties were reported. The targeted facility was part of the region&apos;s gas infrastructure, the Baza Telegram channel reported, citing residents. A fallen drone also started a fire in the village of Kalininsky in Rostov Oblast, but the nearby industrial facility was not damaged, according to Governor Yuri Slyusar. Airports in Penza, Saratov, and Volgograd imposed temporary flight restrictions overnight, Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency announced. The full extent of possible damage is being determined. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. The strikes come only two days after Ukraine launched what appears to be its largest drone strike against Russia, deploying over 330 drones across 10 different regions to attack oil facilities and other strategic sites.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-set-ablaze-russian-factory-infrastructure-site-overnight-authorities-claim/	2025-03-12T23:30:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/chasiv-yar-4.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 890,250 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 890,250 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on March 13. This number includes 1,200 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,307 tanks, 21,432 armored fighting vehicles, 40,355 vehicles and fuel tanks, 24,409 artillery systems, 1,314 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,103 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 28,983 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-890-250-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-03-12T23:11:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1863681631-1.jpg
White House won't confirm if it has mechanisms to enforce ceasefire with Russia	White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to say whether or not the U.S. has enforcement mechanisms in the event Russia violates a potential ceasefire when speaking to reporters on March 12. Ukrainian and U.S. officials met in Saudi Arabia for talks on March 11. At the conclusion of negotiations, Ukraine agreed to a U.S. proposal for a temporary 30-day ceasefire, so long as Russia complies with the terms. When asked whether the U.S. has enforcement mechanisms in place to ensure Russia abides by the ceasefire, Leavitt declined to comment. &quot;Well, that&apos;s obviously a grand hypothetical question that I won&apos;t comment on, because we&apos;re not there yet,&quot; Leavitt told reporters on March 12. Leavitt confirmed U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz had a telephone conversation with his Russian counterpart earlier in the day and that Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff is traveling to Moscow in the coming days to discuss the ceasefire. &quot;The current state of play is that the Ukrainians have agreed to a ceasefire, the Ukrainians have agreed to the peace plan that was put on the table yesterday in Saudi Arabia,&quot; Leavitt said. Negotiations are now &quot;on the tenth yard line of peace,&quot; Leavitt said, and it is &quot;up to the Russians to agree to this plan.&quot; Leavitt did not confirm if U.S. President Donald Trump plans to call Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the ceasefire proposal. &quot;(I)f that call happens, he will let you guys know,&quot; she said. Trump said on March 12 that American officials are already on their way to Russia to negotiate a ceasefire. It was also previously reported that Witkoff is expected to meet with Putin during an upcoming visit to Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/white-house-declines-to-say-if-it-has-enforcement-mechanisms-for-russia-in-potential-ceasefire/	2025-03-12T22:00:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200647187.jpg
EU parliament accuses US of 'blackmailing' Ukraine in joint declaration	EU lawmakers passed a wide-ranging joint declaration on March 12 condemning the U.S. for &quot;blackmailing&quot; Ukrainian leadership into capitulating to Russia. The declaration comes a day after Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office announced it was ready to accept Washington&apos;s proposal of a 30-day ceasefire, so long as Russia also complies with the terms. When Kyiv agreed to the plan, Washington resumed previously suspended shipments of military aid. The joint statement &quot;strongly deplores any attempts at blackmailing Ukraine&apos;s leadership into surrender to the Russian aggressor for the sole purpose of announcing a so-called &apos;peace deal.&apos;&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin is now being &quot;rewarded&quot; for Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, the resolution says. The declaration accuses the U.S. of trying &quot;to negotiate a ceasefire and peace agreement with Russia over the heads of Ukraine and other European states.&quot; It also denounces the U.S. for being &quot;counterproductive and dangerous.&quot; Support for Ukraine must be increased in the face of the foreign policy shift in Washington, the joint declaration says. The lawmakers proposed to further &quot;increase the effectiveness and impact of sanctions on Russia in order to definitively undermine Russia&apos;s ability to continue waging its brutal war of aggression against Ukraine and threatening the security of other European countries.&quot; The resolution was passed by 440 lawmakers in the European Parliament, which consists of 720 seats. Signatories included members of many political parties, including Greens, Socialists &amp; Democrats, Christian Democrats, and far-right conservatives. The U.S. has infuriated many lawmakers in Europe by repeatedly saying it will exclude the continent from potential Ukraine peace negotiations. Top European officials have decried the White House for pandering to Russia. Despite the condemnation from members of the European Parliament (MEPs), European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on March 12 praised the outcome of Ukraine&apos;s recent talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia and reaffirmed the EU&apos;s support for the embattled nation.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-parliament-accuses-us-of-blackmailing-ukrainian-leader-in-joint-declaration/	2025-03-12T21:21:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1246737828-1.jpg
Europe-bound Chinese rail shipments through Russia plummet due to transit restrictions	Russian restrictions and the seizure of dual-use goods have caused Europe-bound rail shipments from China via Russia to plunge, The South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on March 11. Russian authorities in October banned the transit of dual-use military and civilian goods to Europe via its territory. The restrictions apply to a range of goods that could potentially aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Since the ban, rail cargo volumes through Russia from China have been declining for months as Chinese logistics companies lose confidence in the trade route, industry players told SCMP. &quot;We have not dared to ship (goods through Russian rail routes) since November,&quot; Andrew Jiang, general manager of Shanghai freight forwarding company Air Sea Transport, said. Russia&apos;s new restrictions have caused Chinese rail shipments to be sent to Europe via alternative routes that bypass Russia. These include routes through Central Asian countries, such as Kazakhstan. Many Chinese freight companies learned about the restrictions weeks after their implementation. This has caused thousands of containers to be seized by Russian authorities. Moscow&apos;s restrictions allow Russian authorities to seize and keep hard-to-get Western-sanctioned goods. These items can then be used to manufacture weapons for the war against Ukraine. Russian authorities have confiscated large amounts of equipment that on the surface appear to be harmless, such as welding materials, metal fasteners, and airplane parts, importers of Chinese goods in Russia told the Moscow Times. Russian importers now face difficulty obtaining goods from Chinese suppliers due to a lack of confidence in Russian freight routes. China has become Russia&apos;s key economic partner, supplying Moscow with critical dual-use goods as sanctions have increasingly isolated the country from the global market. Russia has come to rely heavily on China since the launch of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-bound-chinese-rail-shipments-through-russia-plummet/	2025-03-12T20:16:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2160158492.jpg
Journalist Viktoria Roshchyna receives posthumous human rights award	Viktoria Roshchyna, a Ukrainian journalist who died in Russian captivity, was posthumously awarded the 2024 Homo Homini Human Rights Award by the Czech human rights organization &#xA0;People in Need on March 12. Sevgil Musayeva, the chief editor of the Ukrainian media outlet Ukrainska Pravda, accepted the honor on Roshchyna&apos;s behalf at a ceremony in Prague, activist Maksym Butkevych announced on social media. Roshchyna shares the award with Nigerian journalist Philip Obaji. Roshchyna received the Homo Homini award for her &quot;courage to tell the stories of Ukrainians in the Russian-occupied territories and for her long-term journalistic work dedicated to portraying issues threatening the democratic order of Ukraine, which she did not compromise on, even at the risk of her personal safety,&quot; the executive board of People in Need said. The journalist disappeared in August 2023 while reporting in Russian-occupied territory, with Moscow admitting her detention the following year. Previously, in March 2022, Roshchyna was detained for 10 days by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers while leaving Berdiansk in the direction of Mariupol. As a condition of her release, she was forced to record a video saying Russian forces had saved her life. Ukrainian officials confirmed Roshchyna&apos;s death on Oct. 10, 2024, but said that the circumstances were still under investigation. &#xA0; The Media Initiative for Human Rights, a Ukrainian NGO, reported in October 2024 that Roshchyna had been held in at least two notorious Russian prisons: the penal colony n. 77 in Berdiansk in occupied Ukraine and the detention center n. 2 in Russia&apos;s Taganrog. Both facilities are known for the use of torture against prisoners. Roshchyna was taken out of Taganrog detention center sometime in September 2024. According to Russia, she died on Sept. 19. Ukrainian prosecutors have classified Roshchyna&apos;s death as a war crime and murder.	https://kyivindependent.com/journalist-viktoria-roshchyna-receives-posthumous-human-rights-award/	2025-03-12T18:55:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/roshchyna.jpeg
Ukraine out of ATACMS missiles, AP reports	Ukraine has no more long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) in its arsenal, the Associated Press (AP) reported on May 12, citing unnamed U.S. and Ukrainian officials. The news comes as the U.S. resumes the flow of military aid to Kyiv after talks with Ukrainian delegates in Saudi Arabia on March 11. Washington suspended weapons shipments in early March. A U.S. official and Ukrainian lawmaker confirmed to the AP that Ukraine currently has no remaining ATACMS missiles. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to provide details on the status of the weapons. ATACMS are U.S.-supplied ballistic missiles can fly up to 300 kilometers (about 186 miles). Former U.S. President Joe Biden eased restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of ATACMS in November 2024, allowing Kyiv to launch them against military targets in Russia. The U.S. sent Ukraine less than 40 long-range ATACMS in total, the U.S. official told the AP. According to the official, Kyiv ran out of the missiles in January. The New York Times (NYT) reported in December 2024 that Kyiv was near the end of its supply of ATACMS and was limiting their use. Kyiv first began receiving older, shorter-range versions of ATACMS in fall of 2023. In the spring of 2024, the U.S. began shipping updated models with a range of up to 300 kilometers. &#xA0;At the time, Ukraine was only permitted to deploy these missiles against targets in occupied Ukrainian territory. Following Biden&apos;s change in policy &#x2014; which was accompanied by permission from the U.K. to attack Russia with British long-range Storm Shadows &#x2014; Ukraine launched a series of missile strikes against Russian airfields, military facilities, and weapons factories. U.S. President Donald Trump has previously said he disagreed &quot;very vehemently&quot; with the decision to permit Ukrainian long-range strikes against Russia with American weapons. Deliveries of U.S. weapons resumed this week after senior Ukrainian officials met with White House representatives in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on March 11. Washington imposed a freeze on military aid following a heated exchange between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. At the conclusion of the Jeddah talks, Ukraine announced that military aid had resumed and agreed to accept Washington&apos;s proposal for an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, provided that Moscow abides by the terms of the ceasefire simultaneously.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-out-of-atacms-missiles-ap-reports/	2025-03-12T18:01:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/ep30-take-4-01.png
Fires reported at infrastructure facilities in Russia's Voronezh and Rostov regions following drone strikes	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Infrastructure facilities in Russia&apos;s Voronezh and Rostov regions caught fire following multiple drone strikes, governors Alexander Gusev and Yuri Slyusar reported on March 12. In the Voronezh region, two unnamed infrastructure facilities were allegedly shelled, one of which caught fire. Russian air defenses reportedly shot down five drones in the Rostov region, with one falling on the territory of an industrial facility. Local residents reported that the drones targeted gas infrastructure. No casualties were reported, according to the acting governors&#x2019; statements. The Kyiv Independent is unable to immediately verify the reports. The attack comes amid an uptick in Ukraine&#x2019;s drone operations targeting Russian energy infrastructure. Kyiv has particularly taken aim at Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure as part of its strategy to undermine funding for the Kremlin&apos;s war operations. Both regions border Ukraine to the west. Voronezh is located around approximately 279 kilometers (173 miles) northeast of Kharkiv., and Rostov Oblast borders Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.	https://kyivindependent.com/fires-reported-at-infrastructure-facilities-in-russias-voronezh-and-rostov-regions-following-drone-strikes/	2025-03-12T16:30:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1258999936.jpg
Putin reportedly makes first visit to Kursk Oblast since start of incursion	Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 12 reportedly made his first visit to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast since Ukraine&apos;s incursion into the region began in August 2024. Putin, in a video released by the Kremlin, reportedly met with military leadership in the region while visiting an undisclosed command post in Kursk Oblast. The Kyiv Independent cannot independently verify the details or location of Putin&apos;s reported visit. The Ukrainian military has not publicly commented on the claims. The reported visit into the region comes amid a renewed Russian offensive in the region, with Russian troops reportedly having regained control of more than 86% of the territory in Kursk Oblast captured by Kyiv. Russian troops have entered Sudzha, a key Ukrainian-held stronghold in the Russian border region of Kursk. In the video, Putin is seen donning military attire for the first time since Russia&apos;s full scale invasion began in February 2022 &#x2014; instead of the suit that he typically wears for meetings with military personnel. The choice in attire mimics that of President Volodymyr Zelensky who has refused to wear a suit throughout the war &#x2014; symbolizing Zelensky&apos;s wartime leadership. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on March 10 that there is no immediate threat of encirclement as Ukrainian forces are repositioning to &quot;favorable defense lines.&quot; Syrskyi added on March 12 that Ukraine will hold the defense in Kursk Oblast &quot;as long as reasonable and necessary.&quot; Ukraine launched the cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially seizing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. Since then, Russian forces, reinforced by North Korean troops, have steadily pushed back against Ukrainian forces. Over seven months of fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Russian losses have reached nearly 54,900 personnel, with over 22,000 killed, Syrskyi claimed on March 12.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-reportedly-makes-first-visit-to-kursk-oblast-since-start-of-ukraines-incursion/	2025-03-12T14:43:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/d072c83-----_690x387.jpg
30-day ceasefire deal may be struck within days, Rubio says	A 30-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine may be finalized within &quot;days,&quot; U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 12. The temporary ceasefire agreement is contingent on whether Russia agrees to halt hostilities. Ukraine agreed to the U.S.&apos;s proposal for a 30-day truce during talks in Jeddah on March 11, after which Washington resumed military and intelligence support for Kyiv. The U.S. is expected to discuss the proposal with Russia in the coming days. &quot;Here&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;d like the world to look like in a few days: Neither side is shooting at each other &#x2014; not rockets, not missiles, not bullets, nothing, not artillery&quot; Rubio said in an airport in Ireland when asked about potential discussions regarding Ukraine ceding territory. &quot;The shooting stops, the fighting stops, and the talking starts.&quot; Reuters reported on March 12, citing Russian sources, that Russia is unlikely to agree to a temporary truce in Ukraine proposed by the U.S., feeling it has the upper hand on the battlefield and viewing the ceasefire as a trap. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov gave an evasive answer when asked about the U.S. proposal, explaining that the topic must first be discussed with the American side. Any ceasefire agreement would have to take Russia&apos;s battlefield advances into account and provide &quot;guarantees&quot; to Moscow, sources told the news agency. In the past, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top officials have ruled out a temporary ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that Russia could face &quot;devastating&quot; financial consequences if it chooses to continue its all-out war against Ukraine. &quot;There are things you can do that wouldn&apos;t be pleasant in a financial sense,&quot; Trump said. &quot;It would be very bad for Russia. I don&apos;t want to do that, because I want to get peace.&quot; Russia continues to occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory and made steady advances in Donetsk Oblast in late 2024. While Russia&apos;s advance in Ukraine&apos;s east has reportedly stalled earlier this year, Moscow&apos;s troops seemed to have made rapid gains in Kursk Oblast, the Russian border region where Ukraine has been fighting since August 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/30-day-ceasefire-deal-may-be-struck-within-days-rubio-says/	2025-03-12T13:39:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194552772.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Kyiv ready to fight in Kursk Oblast 'as long as necessary' as Russia claims to retake over 86% of seized territories	Key developments on March 12: Russian troops have regained control of more than 86% of the territory in Kursk Oblast captured by Kyiv, Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the General Staff of the Russian army, said on March 12, while Ukraine said it was ready to fight as long as needed. His claims come as multiple Ukrainian and Russian sources reported that Russian troops had entered Sudzha, a key Ukrainian-held stronghold in the Russian border region of Kursk. Following Gerasimov&apos;s reports, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi confirmed ongoing battles in the suburbs of Sudzha and the surrounding areas. &quot;In the most difficult situation, my priority has been and remains to save the lives of Ukrainian soldiers. To do this, the units of the Defense Forces, if necessary, maneuver to more favorable positions,&quot; said Syrskyi. He added that Ukraine will hold the defense in Kursk Oblast &quot;as long as reasonable and necessary.&quot; According to Gerasimov, Russian forces have recaptured 24 settlements and 259 square kilometers (100 square miles) of territory in Kursk Oblast. Russian news agency Tass published purported footage showing Russian President Vladimir Putin visiting one of the Russian troops&apos; control centers in Kursk Oblast, which is claimed to have marked his first trip to the embattled region since the beginning of Kyiv&apos;s incursion. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. The Ukrainian military has not publicly commented on the claims. Putin ordered to regain control over the entire territory of Kursk Oblast and to consider creating a &quot;security zone&quot; along the border with Ukraine, Tass wrote. Russia is seeking to push Ukrainian troops out of Kursk Oblast and move the fighting to Sumy and Kharkiv oblast. The Russian president also said that Ukrainian soldiers captured in Kursk Oblast should be labeled as &quot;terrorists.&quot; Russia&apos;s General Staff claimed that over 400 Ukrainian troops have been taken captive in the region. Over seven months of fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Russian losses have reached nearly 54,900 personnel, with over 22,000 killed, Syrskyi claimed on March 12. Ukraine wanted to demonstrate to U.S. President Donald Trump and its European partners that it is serious about ending the war, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 12 about why Kyiv agreed to Washington&apos;s temporary truce proposal. While Ukraine initially proposed a partial ceasefire that would extend only to aerial and naval operations, U.S. delegates proposed a full truce during talks with Ukrainian officials in Jeddah on March 11. After receiving the proposal, Zelensky said Ukraine was &quot;ready for a 30-day ceasefire format offered by the U.S. side.&quot; &quot;I have repeatedly stressed that none of us trust Russia... but we will not play with narratives that we want the war to continue,&quot; Zelensky said at a press conference. &quot;I am very serious, and it is important for me to end the war. I want the U.S. president to see this; so that Europe and everybody unites to push Russia toward ending the war.&quot; The Ukrainian president also noted that the ceasefire would be only the first step toward a full peace. After the war ends, martial law will be lifted, and elections will be held, he added. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed on March 12 that Ukraine-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia on March 11 included discussions about potential &quot;territorial concessions&quot; as part of a negotiated settlement with Russia. &quot;Yeah, we&apos;ve had conversations,&quot; Rubio said in an airport in Ireland when asked about potential discussions regarding Ukraine ceding territory. The Trump administration has repeatedly said that both Kyiv and Moscow will have to make compromises for a peace deal, calling Ukraine&apos;s goal of restoring its pre-2014 borders &quot;unrealistic.&quot; Russian forces currently occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine, from where reports of systematic repression, torture, and forced deportations regularly emerge. Rubio also said that the Jeddah talks covered &quot;what a negotiation process would look like&quot; and reiterated, &quot;There is no military solution to this conflict.&quot; The official acknowledged that Ukraine requires security assurances to deter possible future Russian aggression and emphasized that &quot;Europeans will need to be involved in this regard.&quot; Trump has so far refused to offer such security guarantees, saying during his Feb. 28 meeting with Zelensky that responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security should fall on Europe. Small Russian infantry groups have stepped up assault operations in Ukraine&apos;s south over the past two weeks as they look to improve Moscow&apos;s battlefield positions, a spokesperson for the military told Ukrinform on March 12. Thirty-five attacks have been recorded in the area today so far, with Russian forces pushing on the Huliaipole and Orikhiv sectors in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, said Vladyslav Voloshyn, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command. &quot;This is not an offensive or part of the enemy&apos;s strategic actions, but tactical attempts to improve their position relative to the combat line,&quot; Voloshyn said. Russia has also intensified artillery shelling and air and missile strikes on Ukraine&apos;s Tavria group of forces, which covers Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, Voloshyn said.

Ukraine says it's ready to fight in Kursk Oblast 'as long as necessary,' as Russia claims to retake over 86% of seized territories	Russian troops have regained control of more than 86% of the territory in Kursk Oblast captured by Kyiv, Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the General Staff of the Russian army, said on March 12, while Ukraine said it was ready to fight as long as needed. His claims come as multiple Ukrainian and Russian sources reported that Russian troops had entered Sudzha, a key Ukrainian-held stronghold in the Russian border region of Kursk. Following Gerasimov&apos;s reports, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi confirmed ongoing battles in the suburbs of Sudzha and the surrounding areas. &quot;In the most difficult situation, my priority has been and remains to save the lives of Ukrainian soldiers. To do this, the units of the Defense Forces, if necessary, maneuver to more favorable positions,&quot; said Syrskyi. He added that Ukraine will hold the defense in Kursk Oblast &quot;as long as reasonable and necessary.&quot; According to Gerasimov, Russian forces have recaptured 24 settlements and 259 square kilometers (100 square miles) of territory in Kursk Oblast. Russian news agency Tass published purported footage showing Russian President Vladimir Putin visiting one of the Russian troops&apos; control centers in Kursk Oblast, which is claimed to have marked his first trip to the embattled region since the beginning of Kyiv&apos;s incursion. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. The Ukrainian military has not publicly commented on the claims. Putin ordered to regain control over the entire territory of Kursk Oblast and to consider creating a &quot;security zone&quot; along the border with Ukraine, TASS wrote. Russia is seeking to push Ukrainian troops out of Kursk Oblast and move the fighting to Sumy and Kharkiv oblast. The Russian president also said that Ukrainian soldiers captured in Kursk Oblast should be labeled as &quot;terrorists.&quot; Russia&apos;s General Staff claimed that over 400 Ukrainian troops have been taken captive in the region. Russia launched a renewed offensive in Kursk Oblast last week and reportedly made rapid advances. The developments coincided with the U.S. instituting a temporary pause on all military and intelligence support for Ukraine. Syrskyi said earlier on March 10 that there is no immediate threat of encirclement as Ukrainian forces are repositioning to &quot;favorable defense lines.&quot; Ukraine launched the cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially seizing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. Since then, Russian forces, reinforced by North Korean troops, have steadily pushed back against Ukrainian forces. Over seven months of fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Russian losses have reached nearly 54,900 personnel, with over 22,000 killed, Syrskyi claimed on March 12.	https://kyivindependent.com/syrskyi-says-ukraine-ready-to-fight-in-kursk-oblast-as-long-as-necessary-russia-claims-to-retake-over-86-of-seized-territories/	2025-03-12T12:44:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2166312567.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — The foreign arms producer showing real results in Ukraine	The following is the March 11, 2025 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. For all the hype around foreign weapons producers setting up shop in Ukraine to help it fend off Russia&#x2019;s invasion, they have little to show for it. With the exception of the Prague-domiciled conglomerate Colt CZ, which has set up assembly of its Bren 2 assault rifles inside Ukraine, reporter Kollen Post writes in his latest. The Ukraine-assembled rifle &#x2014; dubbed the &#x201C;Sich&#x201D; for the center of life of the Ukrainian historical nomad-warrior Cossacks &#x2014; offers swappable components for alternating between Soviet and NATO calibers. Ondrej Bohac, head of public sector at Colt CZ, said that something in the &#x201C;upper tens of thousands&#x201D; are already in Ukrainian hands and &#x201C;tens of thousands should be assembled (in Ukraine) this year.&#x201D; The company&#x2019;s ultimate goal is to &#x201C;get rid of Ukrainian dependence on Soviet weapons, like the AK-47, and not only on the weapons themselves but also on the ammunition, which is still produced mainly in Russia and Belarus,&#x201D; Bohac told Post. Ukraine does not seem close to running through its old stockpiles of ammunition, but as with the conversion from Soviet 122 and 152 mm artillery to NATO-standard 120 and 155 mm, the transition is a long-term Western turn. Many international arms giants have announced plans to build their wares inside of Ukraine, ranging from Rheinmetall to Northrop Grumman to Baykar, but those projects have mostly stalled out, writes Post. Colt CZ is one of the first to set up production, putting the firm in a relative frontier position. Its experience will be a bellwether for NATO-based weapons manufacturers expanding to Ukraine. Read the full profile here. Ukraine&apos;s Central Bank raised the key policy rate from 14.5% to 15.5% per annum from March 7, adding that it was ready to take further steps to curb growing inflation in the country. The move marks the second raise of the key policy rate since the beginning of 2025. In late January, the central bank raised it from 13.5% to 14.5%. Inflation reached its highest level in about 18 months in January as a result of a lower harvest, growing business costs, particularly energy, and continued Russian attacks. Price growth was expected to peak sometime in the middle of this year, but tense relations with the Donald Trump administration have soured expectations. Pyshnyi also warned of increasing risks due to less favorable economic trends caused by &quot;further geopolitical polarization of countries&quot; and &quot;the corresponding fragmentation of global trade.&quot; Preident Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Friday, Feb. 28, 2025 (Jim Lo Scalzo / Getty Images)Minerals deal: Will it ever happen?After the Oval Office showdown a couple of weeks ago and the subsequent collapse of the minerals agreement, everyone in town is wondering what&#x2019;s up with the deal. Some reports have suggested that in retaliation for an argument in the White House, Trump was negotiating for a &#x201C;better deal.&#x201D; But multiple sources have told the Kyiv Independent that the details of the agreement haven&#x2019;t changed, and that it&#x2019;s more a matter of when the two sides will sign it &#x2014; which remains unclear. It could all hinge on this week&#x2019;s meetings in Saudi Arabia. Trump&apos;s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News that he was &#x201C;really hopeful&#x201D; that President Volodymyr Zelensky would return to the U.S. to sign the deal in the near future. Ukraine&#x2019;s government plans to spend $2.6 billion purchasing 4.5 million first-person-view (FPV) drones this year as part of a large-scale effort to equip its military with advanced technologies, the Defense Ministry said on March 10. Ukraine purchased 1.5 million drones in 2024, with 96% of spending going to Ukrainian producers. A Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support to Kyiv. The agency funded school reconstruction, bomb shelters, critical energy repairs, and civil society initiatives. A Russian attack on Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure overnight on March 7 forced Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy company DTEK to shut down one of its gas production facilities in Poltava Oblast. Meanwhile, DTEK is in talks with U.S. suppliers to bring more natural gas to Europe, Wall Street Journal reported. Ukraine&apos;s largest state-owned energy company, Naftogaz, and Poland&apos;s petroleum refineries company, Orlen, have signed a contract for the supply of approximately 100 million cubic meters (mcm) of liquefied natural gas (LNG), Naftogaz announced on March 7. As Russia continues targeting Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure, domestic gas production has declined due to Russian strikes, forcing Ukraine to increase imports. Ukraine has received 752 million pounds ($970 million) as the first installment of the U.K.&apos;s contribution to the G7 loan covered by frozen Russian assets, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on March 7. &quot;The funds will go towards strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities,&quot; Shmyhal said on X.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-business-roundup-the-foreign-arms-producer-showing-real-results-in-ukraine/	2025-03-12T12:37:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/production_cz_04.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 17	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 17 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from March 3&#x2013;9, 2025. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Ukraine&#x2019;s President signs IMF-mandated budget code amendments on public investments President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky has signed draft law #12245, introducing amendments to the budget code to enhance the management of public investment projects. The legislation fulfills one of the International Monetary Fund&apos;s structural benchmarks. The reform establishes a general public investment fund, which will be allocated by the newly formed Strategic Investment Council within the government &#x2014; a body that mirrors the composition of the Cabinet of Ministers. Under the new framework, multiple budget allocations will be consolidated into this &#x201C;fund of funds.&quot; The government will then oversee its distribution across priority projects. Ukraine&#x2019;s Parliament to vote on two Ukraine Facility bills Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, is set to hold final votes on two legislative proposals tied to the country&#x2019;s commitments under the Ukraine Facility program. Lawmakers will consider draft law #8222, which introduces a new civil service pay structure based on Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development SIGMA principles. The bill aims to classify government positions by function and align public sector wages with the private sector. Over the next five years, salaries for government employees are expected to reach 70-90% of the equivalent private-sector compensation for positions of similar complexity and responsibility. The reform is a requirement of Ukraine Plane under the Ukraine Facility program, with a Q1 2025 deadline. Additionally, parliament will review draft law #11290, which is said to be aimed at strengthening cybersecurity measures and enhances protection of state information resources. Anti-Corruption Committee to review ARMA reform bill ahead of final vote The parliamentary committee on anti-corruption policy is set to review draft law #12374-d, a piece of legislation aimed at reforming the Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA), ahead of its second and final reading in parliament. The bill introduces a competitive selection process for ARMA&#x2019;s leadership, granting international experts a decisive vote in the selection commission. Under the Ukraine Facility program, the legislation must be fully adopted by March 31, 2025, to meet Ukraine&#x2019;s international reform commitments. Ukrainian government allocates additional Hr 570 million for delayed payments under winter support and national cashback programs The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has allocated Hr 570 million (approximately $13.5 million) from the state budget&#x2019;s reserve fund to cover delayed payments under the winter support program and the national cashback program. The decision follows a public statement by the Economy Ministry, which cited operational issues as the reason for payment delays for December and January. The funding will be used to ensure beneficiaries receive their overdue financial assistance. Last week, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal confirmed that the national cashback program would be extended for the coming years, signaling continued government support for the initiative.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-17/	2025-03-12T12:32:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1398149194.jpg
Russian intelligence recruited teenagers for terrorist attack in western Ukraine, SBU claims	Russia&apos;s intelligence service blew up two teenagers it had recruited to carry out a terrorist attack in the western city of Ivano-Frankivsk on the evening of March 11, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reported on March 12. Explosions were reported near the railway station and in a high-rise building in Ivano-Frankivsk. One person was killed and three other injured, authorities said. The remote detonation of self-made devices used in Russian intelligence planned attacks is a new tactic of Moscow&apos;s in its covert operations against Ukraine, allowing it to carry out attacks while getting rid of perpetrators, Serhii Andrushchenko, SBU&apos;s deputy head, previously told the Kyiv Independent. According to law enforcement, the recruited agents were two teenagers aged 15 and 17 who sought quick money on Telegram channels. Russian intelligence services allegedly recruited them online and offered payment for carrying out a series of terror attacks in the city. A Russian handler rented an apartment for the teenagers in a high-rise building near the local railway station, the SBU said. Following Russia&apos;s instructions, the two made explosives and two devices disguised as thermoses. They equipped both explosives with remote detonators, according to the SBU. The teenagers were allegedly heading to a designated location to place one of the explosive devices when the Russian intelligence service activated the explosives in their package. Another explosive was detonated in the rented apartment. The 17-year-old boy was killed, and the 15-year-old was hospitalized with serious injuries. Two passers-by &#x2014; a 20-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman &#x2014; also suffered injuries. If charged, the 15-year-old could face life imprisonment. In February, the SBU reported that Russia recruited the attacker responsible for a deadly explosion at a military enlistment office in Rivne. Russia also recruited minors via social media to set fire to military cars parked in Ukrainian cities, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said. Last year, cases of setting fire to military vehicles were recorded in Kyiv, Odesa, and Dnipro.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-intelligence-behind/	2025-03-12T12:23:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/7c4dbf1182188d844e1b5b7ca0c7016c.jpg
There will still be war' — Ukraine's soldiers on ceasefire proposal, Russia, and Putin	The &quot;ball is in (Russia&apos;s) court,&quot; U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 11 after Kyiv and Washington emerged from talks in Saudi Arabia in agreement over a ceasefire proposal. After the negotiations with Washington, Ukraine announced that it was ready to accept a 30-day-long ceasefire if Russia also complied with it. Now, all eyes are on Moscow as it mulls a response to the proposal, but expectations are not high &#x2014; even if a ceasefire comes into force, Moscow has a long history of disregarding them. After Russia invaded Ukraine&apos;s east with the use of proxies and annexed Crimea in 2014, Moscow violated multiple ceasefire deals 25 times, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a meeting with Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. We asked five serving Ukrainian soldiers what they thought of the ceasefire proposal and if they think Russia will agree to its terms. I&#x2019;m not sure that Russia will agree to a ceasefire. Trump wants to show that he&#x2019;s the only one making decisions in this situation, but Putin is unlikely to dance to the tune of a U.S. president. However, if Russia does agree to a ceasefire, it means their situation is worse than it seems. In that case, it&#x2019;s a clear signal that the pause should be short, and Russia must be pressured even harder on the front line.

(Alice Martins/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)&apos;Veter&apos; former company commander, just returned to the military after a few months break. Fought in Donbas in 2014-2018 during previous &apos;ceasefires&apos; with Russia And when will they reach an agreement? It could take a day or a year to reach an agreement. This has legalized Russia at the negotiating table. The murderer is now sitting among the prosecutor and the judges. And he is given every right to say that he is not a murderer. They will now start bargaining, and what will they bargain with? With Ukraine, our state, our lands, our people. And what will these 30 days do, even if there is a truce and the shooting stops? Has no one thought about what will come after them? Has anyone thought that Russia will then go further and accumulate forces and means? Russia has a strategic plan for 2035 to capture Ukraine along the east bank in its entirety or even the entire country. They will not deviate from this plan. They will take a break for 30 days to replenish their forces, resources, etc., and then move forward. The question here is what we will do in the meantime. In Ukraine, during this period, there should be heavy manpower reinforcements (in the army) and 100% replenishment of ammunition and equipment. Starting with small arms, ending with aviation, and everything in between. Because here we often think, &#xA0;&#x201C;Oh, that&apos;s it, the war is on hold, we can sit and have a smoke.&#x201D; And everyone will sit on their asses until the storm hits again and the Russians push on. And when they do, everyone will start shouting again, &#x201C;Give us weapons urgently, give us people urgently.&#x201D; I have seen previous &#x201C;truces&#x201D; in Donbas. There was a ceasefire, a &#x201C;harvest truce,&quot; and we were standing on Krymske (in Luhansk Oblast). &#xA0;Their subversive groups were working constantly. I was the acting platoon commander. They hit my position with a Pion (a Soviet self-propelled 203 mm cannon). There were dead and wounded. No one stopped anything, it was just a &quot;light version&quot; (of the war). We&apos;ve been through this before. An agreement with the Russians is not worth the paper it is written on. 26-year-old military service woman Regarding the 30-day ceasefire, it is a good opportunity to show the world that Ukraine is most interested in peace. No other country in the world is as interested in ending this war as Ukraine. And the main thing is the conditions under which we do this. We have already seen what Trump has proposed. It does not work. It is too stupid to use the same non-working scenario and repeatedly fall into the same trap. Fortunately, we learn from our mistakes and do not want to make the same mistakes for the second, third, or tenth time. However, we must show the international community that Ukraine is more interested in peace than anyone else. Suppose there are 30 days of silence in Ukraine without missiles or drones. In that case, it would be a good opportunity to invite international representatives to Ukraine, show our capital, show different cities, show the front-line areas without danger to their lives, show how the military lives, and invite as many journalists as possible. We can do a lot in a month. Of course, the military will be able to rest and recover a bit. Their loved ones can travel to (Ukraine&#x2019;s) east and spend time with them without worrying about their safety. &#x491; I&apos;m sure not every military member will be allowed to go on vacation. But there is an opportunity to visit loved ones safely.

This time will be the same because I don&apos;t see that Russia is ready to start a ceasefire. I don&apos;t think it will change anything for me. There will still be war, it will still be the same job. But maybe, if there really is a ceasefire, it will be good that we can rotate our troops and organize some rest for some of our soldiers. sapper 25th Airborne Brigade I don&#x2019;t think Russia will follow through (with a ceasefire). They never keep their word. We went through this in 2014-2015. But I do really hope for a ceasefire, &#xA0;all the guys are very worn out and broken.	https://kyivindependent.com/there-will-still-be-war-ukrainian-soldiers-on-ceasefire-proposal-russia-and-putin/	2025-03-12T11:51:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2198799645.jpg
Trump said Ukraine is 'more difficult to deal with' than Russia — that might be about to change	Over the course of a tumultuous few weeks of talks, U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his frustration with Kyiv. On March 7, Trump declared that he finds it &quot;more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine&quot; than Russia. Yet, after weeks of strong-arming Ukraine into submission, the Trump administration is yet to ask Russia for a single concession, and real negotiations with the Kremlin have yet to actually begin. According to experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent, some of them with direct experience of diplomatic dealings with Moscow, the reality of coming up against Russian President Vladimir Putin in talks may come as a shock to Trump. &quot;I think (Putin) probably sees Trump as a useful idiot who is helpful in promoting his agenda,&quot; Ryhor Nizhnikau, a Russia expert at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, told the Kyiv Independent. Nizhnikau expects the Kremlin to reject the proposed ceasefire and come back with counter-proposals in an attempt to draw out the negotiating process, putting forward what he describes as &quot;a lot of dangerous ideas.&quot; Kyiv and Washington on March 11 emerged from talks in Saudi Arabia in agreement over a ceasefire proposal, as well as the resumption of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing. After the negotiations with Washington, Ukraine announced that it was ready to accept a 30-day-long ceasefire if Russia also complied with it. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio later said the &quot;ball is in (Russia&apos;s) court,&quot; adding if the Kremlin rejects the ceasefire proposal, &quot;then we&apos;ll, unfortunately, know what the impediment is to peace here.&quot; There had been no official response from the Kremlin, and even state TV propagandists had been largely silent on the matter. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov when asked by journalists about the proposal gave an evasive answer, saying they were &quot;getting a little ahead of yourselves.&quot; &quot;The Russians will definitely reject the ceasefire,&quot; Nizhnikau said. &quot;They cannot accept it because they say it&apos;s Washington&apos;s plan.&#x201D; Previous statements from Kremlin officials give an indication of what Russia is likely to demand. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan, National Security Advisor Mosaad bin Mohammad al-Aiban, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Ukrainian Head of Presidential Office Andriy Yermak, and Ukrainian Minister of Defense Rustem Umerov attend a meeting between the U.S. and Ukraine hosted by Saudi Arabia in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11, 2025. (Salah Malkawi/Getty Images)Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Feb. 17 there could be &quot;no thought of&quot; territorial concessions, suggesting Russia may well demand Ukraine withdraw from areas of the four oblasts &#x2014; Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk &#x2014; it illegally annexed in 2022 despite not fully controlling. Although Kyiv may be forced to agree to some sort of territorial concessions, it has previously rejected a full withdrawal from all four oblasts. Putin, however, said such a move would be a prerequisite for peace talks. How Russia&apos;s latest territorial demands will be met by Washington remains to be seen but Ambassador Kurt Volker, who served as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations in 2017-2019 and U.S. ambassador to NATO in 2008-2009, said it&apos;s likely that Trump will have anything but an easy time. &quot;I think he has some kind of belief that Putin has limited and reasonable demands, which is not the case. Putin has unlimited demands,&quot; he said. Volker believes that as negotiations continue and Trump&apos;s stated aim of a swift end to war moves further away, he will become &quot;very disappointed in Putin&quot; because he &quot;keeps moving the goalposts and upping the ante.&quot; There is also a self-inflicted wound that hobbles the U.S. as it enters talks in earnest with Russia &#x2014; the Trump administration has already thrown away some of its strongest cards. The White House has ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine and insisted it makes territorial concessions, with the return to pre-2014 and even pre-2022 borders taken off the table. &quot;They&apos;re giving Putin everything,&quot; Michael McFaul, former U.S. Ambassador to Russia and professor of international studies at Stanford University, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It&apos;s just like diplomacy 101 &#x2014; in any negotiation, you don&apos;t start by giving away all your strongest cards before the negotiation has started. And that&apos;s what it looks like the Trump team is doing.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelenskiy speaks at a news conference in Kyiv, Ukraine, on March 12, 2025. Zelenskiy calls for a period of monitored &quot;silence&quot; on the frontline before the 30-day truce proposed by the U.S. (Andrew Kravchenko/Bloomberg via Getty Images)McFaul said that Russia will have been emboldened by these concessions and will now simply demand more from the negotiating process. &quot;They just put it in their pocket, and they say, &apos;Well, what are you going to give us now?&apos; That&apos;s their strategy. And they sit quietly, and they wait,&quot; he said. McFaul added that the original maximalist aims of Putin&apos;s full-scale invasion &#x2014; the &quot;demilitarization&quot; of Ukraine and the removal of President Volodymyr Zelensky &#x2014; are very much still on the table, in large part because the U.S. has been agreeing with Russia and its demands. &quot;It&apos;s an incredibly bad negotiating strategy on behalf of the Trump team,&quot; McFaul added. What the U.S. could do, or would be prepared to do, in order to impose Ukraine&apos;s demands for a satisfactory peace upon a maximalist Russia remains to be seen, but Trump on March 12 appeared upbeat. Following announcing that he might speak with Putin this week, Trump emphasized the need to engage with Russia, expressing hope that Putin would also agree and that negotiations could move forward. &quot;It takes two for tango, as I have already said, so I hope he (Putin) will also agree as well, and I really think that would be 75% of the way, the rest is getting it documented,&quot; he said. &quot;Ukraine has agreed to it, and hopefully Russia will agree to it&#x2026; hopefully, we&apos;ll be able to wipe out a deal,&quot; he added. But McFaul points out another potential impediment to the Trump team&apos;s success &#x2014; experience. &quot;Lavrov&apos;s been at this for over two decades, he&apos;s pretty good at it. Rubio just started in this job a few weeks ago. And, you know, maybe he&apos;s just trying to figure out how to do this,&quot; he said. Regardless of whether or not U.S. negotiators can step up, for Russian-born columnist and political commentator Sergei Parkhomenko, negotiations and any thoughts of a genuine peace process are wishful thinking. &quot;Putin needs this war,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;He needs this war for its own sake more than he needs a victory in it, more than he needs Ukraine and more than he needs anything else. &quot;For him, war is a way of life, a method of governing the country, a way of maintaining himself in power. Therefore, real peace directly contradicts his political interests.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-said-ukraine-is-more-difficult-to-deal-with-than-russia-that-might-be-about-to-change/	2025-03-12T10:41:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203994697.jpg
US officials heading to Russia for ceasefire talks, Trump says	American representatives are on their way to Russia to discuss a proposed 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 12 during a meeting with Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin in the White House. &quot;We have people going to Russia right now,&quot; Trump said. Speaking to journalists in the Oval Office, the U.S. president said Washington has &quot;some positive messages about a possible ceasefire.&quot; He added that a potential of the temporary truce is now up to Russia. Kyiv agreed to a temporary ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia also did. The talks in Saudi Arabia also led to the U.S. restarting key military and intelligence support for Ukraine. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov gave an evasive answer when asked about the U.S. proposal, explaining that the topic must first be discussed with the American side. Trump also warned that Russia could face &quot;devastating&quot; financial consequences if it chooses to continue its all-out war against Ukraine. &quot;There are things you can do that wouldn&apos;t be pleasant in a financial sense,&quot; he said. &quot;It would be very bad for Russia. I don&apos;t want to do that, because I want to get peace.&quot; Shortly after his inauguration, Trump said that the U.S. can impose tariffs and sanctions on Russia to force their hand in negotiations, saying &quot;we can do it the easy way or the hard way.&quot; Recently, however, Washington reportedly considered easing sanctions on Russian oil, a major source of funding for the war in Ukraine. Earlier in a day, Reuters reported citing undisclosed Russian sources that Moscow is unlikely to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine, feeling it has the upper hand on the battlefield and viewing the ceasefire as a trap. In the past, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top officials have ruled out a temporary ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kyiv doesn&apos;t trust Russia but wanted to show to Trump and European partners that Ukraine is serious about ending Russia&apos;s full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-delegation-heading-to-russia-for-ceasifire-talks-trump-says/	2025-03-12T10:34:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203672248.jpg
Ukraine struggles to hold on in Kursk Oblast as Russia strikes back before peace talks	Ukraine&#x2019;s retreat from Kursk Oblast appears more likely as the latest news shows Russia taking ground amid intense attacks to drive Ukraine out, experts and soldiers say. Retaking Ukrainian-held territory in Kursk Oblast could leave Kyiv without its hard-fought bargaining chip before potential negotiations with Russia. In recent days, Russian forces have destroyed Ukrainian logistics in Kursk Oblast, claimed to capture several settlements, and reportedly entered the key town of Sudzha. Soldiers on the ground told the Kyiv Independent on March 7 that with &#x201C;zero logistics&#x201D; left, some would like to withdraw. Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership said on March 10 that there was no threat of encirclement for Ukrainian troops and ordered reinforcements. President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a briefing on March 12 that Ukrainian forces continue to fulfill tasks in Kursk Oblast, while the command is &#x201C;preserving the maximum of lives of our soldiers.&#x201D; The news comes as U.S. officials plan to meet with Russian representatives in the coming days to consider a temporary 30-day ceasefire discussed during U.S. talks with Ukraine in Saudi Arabia on March 11. &#x201C;Before any talks between Russia and the U.S., the Russians are trying to resolve (the Kursk problem) as quickly as possible, concentrating all the forces they can,&#x201D; Mykhailo Samus, military expert and director of the New Geopolitics Research Network, told the Kyiv Independent. Russians have brought their most effective drone units to Kursk Oblast, who are now fire-controlling Ukrainian logistic routes, thanks to Russia&#x2019;s advances on the right and left flanks of the salient, experts say. In Kursk Oblast, logistics are good &#x2014; with good roads and enough settlements where Ukrainian troops can reside and build shelters, Ruslan Mykula, a military analyst and co-founder of the DeepState OSINT project told the Kyiv Independent. But the main problem for Ukrainian forces is a section of about 10 kilometers of the main highway in Ukraine&#x2019;s Sumy Oblast between the village of Yunakivka and the Sudzha border crossing. &#x201C;Formally, all the logistics are tied to the Sumy-Sudzha asphalt highway, which is very easy to control, because the distances (to the enemy) there are not very long, about 5-7, maximum 15 kilometers, which is not a problem for modern drones,&#x201D; a retired military officer and defense expert Viktor Kevliuk told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Logistics routes are also not so numerous because the area is either swampy or bridges are destroyed,&#x201D; he added.

(Ed Ram / For The Washington Post via Getty Images)&#x201C;This operation turned into something similar to Krynky,&#x201D; Mykula said, referring to the village in the Russian-occupied east bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast held by Ukrainian forces for about nine months in 2023-2024. Ukrainians lost hundreds of soldiers during the dangerous river crossings &#x2014; the only conventional logistics route to Krynky. &#x201C;The road between Yunakivka and the (Kursk Oblast) border is like the Dnipro River (near Krynky), where every infantryman or vehicle can be hit by first-person-view (FPV) drones day and night,&#x201D; Mykula explained. While regular FPV drones are counteracted by electronic warfare equipment used by both Ukrainian and Russian forces, it is powerless against fiber-optic-controlled drones that use an exceptionally long wire unraveled during the flight. Some can fly up to 20 kilometers. &#x201C;Not all, but most of the fiber-optic crews in the Russian army are now in the Kursk Oblast. There is a huge concentration of drones there,&#x201D; Mykula said. According to Mykula, Ukrainian forces in Kursk Oblast never found a way to counteract this type of drone. Having cut logistics, Russian forces have pushed on the ground in the past several days. According to Kevliuk, Russian forces are trying to advance both with small infantry groups overnight or during low visibility to avoid drones and on high-speed vehicles such as motorcycles, civilian cars, quad bikes, and golf carts during the day, driving over minefields to quickly storm Ukrainian positions. On March 8, reports emerged that some Russian sabotage and assault groups had used an underground gas pipe to try to gain a foothold on the outskirts of Sudzha, emulating a similar operation where Russians used the sewers in Avdiivka. Ukraine&#x2019;s General staff published a video on March 9, claiming the destruction of those units. But according to open-source monitoring groups, on March 12, the fighting is ongoing in Sudzha. The Ukrainian military has not commented on Russian forces entering the town as of this publication. Other attacks are targeting alternative Ukrainian logistic routes that are known to Russians, according to Mykula. &#xA0; &#x201C;The (North) Korean soldiers&#x2019; offensive near Guevo (on Ukraine&#x2019;s right flank) had a clear task to enter the logistics route of the defense forces through the forest, which they did,&#x201D; Mykula said. A North Korean POW captured by Ukrainian forces during hostilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Photo published on Jan. 11, 2025. (President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)It could also be a move to encircle Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast. As part of these efforts, Russia has deployed two battalions of North Korean special forces, far better-prepared than previous North Korean soldiers sent to the area to fight, Kevliuk said. &#x201C;But the encirclement is not working so far, and it will not work in the future because the enemy simply does not have enough troops to do it,&#x201D; he added. Ukraine&#x2019;s continued incursion in Kursk Oblast has had two main goals, experts say. First was gaining Ukraine leverage in possible peace talks, where Ukrainian-controlled areas of Russia could be exchanged for some Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories, according to Ukraine&#x2019;s leadership. The second goal was to divert Russian forces from other parts of the front line, prevent further attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s Sumy Oblast, and take the fight to Russian soil. When the Kursk incursion began in August 2024, Russia&#x2019;s leadership decided to keep the momentum in Ukraine&#x2019;s east instead of diverting them to Kursk Oblast, according to experts. While Russia made small yet steady territorial gains in the east, it failed to achieve all of its major goals for 2024, Samus said. &#x201C;Pokrovsk is not occupied, and Chasiv Yar, Toretsk, and Kupiansk are not occupied. (The Russians) did not enter Dnipropetrovsk Oblast,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Now, there are 60,000 of not the worst Russian soldiers and North Korean soldiers (in Kursk Oblast), trying to resolve this issue before the start of negotiations between Russia and the United States,&#x201D; he added. However, the original idea that Ukraine&#x2019;s foothold in Kursk Oblast could affect negotiations held more weight before the U.S. President Donald Trump got involved, Samus says. &#x201C;This could be said before Trump, when the politics were formed traditionally, in some adequate, comprehensible ways.&#x201D; U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 30, 2025. (Oliver Contreras/AFP via Getty Images)If Trump and his administration continue to act in a way that contributes to Russia&apos;s interests &#x2014; halting military aid, denying Ukraine&#x2019;s security guarantees before peace talks, and lifting sanctions on Russia &#x2014; they might also decline to consider Kursk Oblast as a bargaining chip, Samus said. The U.S. restored its military assistance to Ukraine on March 11 after the talks in Saudi Arabia, and Ukraine said it would agree to the temporary 30-day ceasefire if Russia did the same. It was not immediately clear what the fate of Ukraine-controlled Kursk Oblast would be during any possible ceasefire. &#x201C;If (the Kursk region) cannot be traded at the strategic level, then (Ukraine&#x2019;s military command) must decide from an operational and tactical point of view whether it is more efficient to withdraw and use these forces in other areas,&#x201D; Samus said. Some experts say that Ukraine can stabilize the logistics and keep its foothold in Kursk Oblast if it sends more resources. But others, as well as soldiers on the ground, suggest that the Ukrainian retreat has already begun. Ukrainian troops are using &#x201C;very well-built&#x201D; Russian fortifications, well-concealed and fitted for local topography, which would allow them to stay there for a long time, according to Kevliuk.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos via Getty Images)&#x201C;War theory tells us that troops should keep a reserve (of supplies) for autonomous operations for 10 days,&#x201D; Kevliuk added. &#x201C;If this norm was met (by Ukrainian troops in Kursk), we can talk about 10-14 days (of fighting without logistics).&#x201D; &#x201C;There&apos;s very little room or reason to try to maneuver in Kursk anymore,&#x201D; said Emil Kastehelmi, a Finnish military analyst from the Black Bird Group open-source intelligence collective. One Ukrainian soldier who asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive matters told the Kyiv Independent that his unit had recently withdrawn from Kursk Oblast, losing almost all of their vehicles. &#x201C;It was a horror what was happening on that road,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We don&apos;t know what will happen next.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-struggles-to-stay-in-kursk-oblast-until-negotiations-during-russias-new-push/	2025-03-12T09:49:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2166040846.jpg
Russia has stepped up attacks in Ukraine's south over past two weeks, military says	Small Russian infantry groups have stepped up assault operations in Ukraine&apos;s south over the past two weeks as they look to improve Moscow&apos;s battlefield positions, a spokesperson for the military told Ukrinform on March 12. Thirty-five attacks have been recorded in the area today so far, with Russian forces pushing on the Huliaipole and Orikhiv sectors in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, said Vladyslav Voloshyn, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command. &quot;This is not an offensive or part of the enemy&apos;s strategic actions, but tactical attempts to improve their position relative to the combat line,&quot; Voloshyn said. Russia has also intensified artillery shelling and air and missile strikes on Ukraine&apos;s Tavria group of forces, which covers Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, Voloshyn said. Voloshyn&apos;s statement come amid Russia&apos;s breakthrough in embattled Kursk Oblast. Multiple Ukrainian and Russian sources claimed on March 12 that Russian troops had entered Sudzha, a key Ukrainian-held stronghold in the Russian border region of Kursk. Previously, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine&apos;s offensive into Kursk Oblast prevented Russian forces from carrying out large-scale operations in northeastern and southern Ukraine. Parts of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts have been occupied by Russian forces since the full-scale invasion of 2022. The regions remain a regular target of Russian aerial attacks. The Ukrainian military warned in fall 2024 that Russian forces were amassing in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in preparation for a southern offensive. Heavy fortifications were constructed around the regional capital of Zaporizhzhia ahead of the possible renewed push.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-has-stepped-up-attack-in-ukraines-south-over-past-two-weeks-military-says/	2025-03-12T09:24:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2074365868.jpg
Ukraine won't recognize occupied territories as Russian as part of any peace deal, Zelensky says	Ukraine will not recognize any occupied territories as part of Russia under a potential future peace agreement with Moscow, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on March 12. &quot;We are fighting for our independence. Therefore, we will not recognize any occupied territories as Russia&apos;s. This is a fact,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Our people have fought for this, our heroes died. How many injured, how many passed. No one will forget about it... This is the most important red line. We will not let anyone forget about this crime against Ukraine.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s comments come a day after Kyiv agreed to a 30-day ceasefire put forth by the U.S. during the talks between the two countries in Jeddah. Ukraine said it was ready to move forward with the ceasefire if Russia did the same. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio later confirmed that Ukraine-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia on March 11 included discussions about potential &quot;territorial concessions&quot; as part of a negotiated settlement with Russia. The Trump administration has repeatedly said that both Kyiv and Moscow will have to make compromises for a peace deal, calling Ukraine&apos;s goal of restoring its pre-2014 borders &quot;unrealistic.&quot; Russian forces currently occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine, from where reports of systematic repression, torture, and forced deportations regularly emerge. While a ceasefire and peace deal could freeze the war along current front lines, Ukraine is unlikely to ever recognize Russian-occupied territories as legally part of Russia. Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts are partially controlled by Russian troops. Russia claims to have annexed the whole territory of those regions in 2022 despite not controlling two regional capitals &#x2014; Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Moscow also controls all of Ukraine&apos;s Crimean peninsula. When asked about sanctions or other steps to put pressure on Russia in case of violation of the ceasefire, Zelensky said that this move would depend on the U.S. side.d &quot;If they (Russians) are not ready (for a ceasefire), we do hope that the American side will demonstrate exactly what it said,&quot; the president added. Senator Lindsey Graham called for sanctions against Russia if Moscow refuses from a proposed ceasefire. He promised to introduce new congressional sanctions targeting Russia and nations that continue to buy Russian goods, including oil, gas, and uranium. In the past, Russia has ruled out a temporary ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. Russian nationalist voices and pro-war bloggers have already spoken out against the U.S.-backed proposal.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-wont-recognize/	2025-03-12T08:36:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203160376.jpg
Ex-envoy to Russia slams Trump's negotiating strategy as 'incredibly bad'	The Kyiv Independent&apos;s Chris York sits down with Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia and political scientist, to discuss the Ukraine-Russia peace negotiations, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s approach to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the ideological parallels between Putinism and MAGA.	https://kyivindependent.com/ex-envoy-to-russia-slams-trumps-negotiating-strategy-as-incredibly-bad/	2025-03-12T08:19:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_9383.jpg
Losing foothold in Kursk Oblast would be 'politically significant,' experts say	As Russian troops are set to push Ukrainian soldiers out of Kursk Oblast, experts say Kyiv&apos;s withdrawal from the region could be &quot;politically significant.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s seven-month-long hold of a small portion of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast might be ending. On March 12, Russian troops entered the town of Sudzha, which served as Ukraine&apos;s main stronghold in the region. Fearing encirclement, Ukrainian troops have begun to pull back closer to the border. The news comes a day after Ukraine had agreed to the U.S. proposal for a 30-day-long ceasefire. The Kremlin said &quot;it was studying the proposal.&quot; &quot;It feels like we&apos;re getting to a position where people are trying to settle the front lines in anticipation that we might have a set of negotiations,&quot; said Scott Lucas, a political scientist and professor of American Studies and International Politics at University College Dublin&apos;s Clinton Institute. Western and Ukrainian experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said that Ukraine has already achieved certain political objectives by invading Russia in the first place and holding onto parts of Kursk Oblast for months. Kyiv will now have to decide whether it should reinforce the Kursk salient by sending more troops and resources that could be deployed elsewhere, or organize a retreat to avoid what could be a disastrous scenario on the ground. &quot;Ukraine wants to be able to show that it continues to stand and to resist, even as the Trump administration walks away,&quot; Lucas said, referring to the U.S.&apos; cutting off its military aid and intelligence sharing earlier in March. The U.S. on March 11 agreed to lift the ban on intelligence sharing following talks with the Ukrainian side in Saudi Arabia. However, the future U.S. support &#x2014; and Europe&apos;s readiness to take the lead in providing Ukraine with military aid &#x2014; remains uncertain.

(Fermin Torrano / Anadolu via Getty Images)And losing a foothold in Russia may have an impact on the mood both inside and outside Ukraine. Kyiv has repeatedly pointed out the success in Kursk Oblast even as Russian troops advanced significantly along the front lines in Donetsk Oblast, capturing long-time Ukrainian strongholds of Vuhledar, and Kurakhove. Both Kyiv and Western countries have labeled the partial occupation of Kursk Oblast as a crucial bargaining chip for possible peace negotiations when the time comes. &quot;(Ukraine&apos;s) position in Kursk is an important one because certainly it&apos;s something that would factor in any negotiation that may come about in the coming year,&quot; then U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters in January. Russia&apos;s inability to protect its own territory last August and its decision to pursue further invasion of Ukraine at the cost of keeping safe its own territory resulted in &quot;negative sentiments&quot; domestically, according to Oleksiy Melnyk, the co-director of foreign policy and international security at the Kyiv-based think tank Razumkov Center. &quot;It&apos;s not about the city of Sudzha or square kilometers, but about Russian territorial integrity,&quot; Melnyk said. But it may have been a poor decision for Kyiv to publicly discuss its openness for trading the Kursk salient for Ukrainian territory, he added. Earlier in February, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the Guardian that he planned to play the Kursk card in potential negotiations to &quot;swap one territory for another&quot; without clarifying which part of Russian-occupied territory Kyiv would ask for in return. Disclosing Ukraine&apos;s negotiation position has likely served &quot;as a digger&quot; for Moscow to concentrate its effort to deprive Ukraine of such a leverage, he stressed. A checkpoint with Ukrainian military personnel in Sudzha, Russia, on Aug. 16, 2024. (Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)Moscow is currently accelerating its push in Kursk Oblast, with the Russian Defense Ministry claiming on March 11 that it recaptured 12 settlements and 100 square kilometers (40 square miles) of territory there. Ukrainian troops on the ground have told the Kyiv Independent in recent days that the situation is ever more critical, as the logistics were hampered. Russian forces have gained ground south of Sudzha, potentially cutting off some Ukrainian positions from the rest of the salient. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, denied threats of encirclement. Losing the Kursk salient would likely not result in a further decline of U.S. support as &quot;we can&apos;t get into negative numbers in that sense,&quot; according to Steven Horrell, a non-resident senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis. Hanging onto the Kursk Oblast territory is an important bargaining chip &quot;in the international eyes,&quot; with the operation allowing Ukraine to show Western countries that it can still strike back despite battlefield setbacks, Horrell said. &quot;I think the surge of (Western) support after the Kursk offensive was concrete proof of that,&quot; he added. Now, with the operation seemingly dying out slowly, Ukraine&apos;s potential retreat from Kursk Oblast can reinforce U.S. President Donald Trump and his team&apos;s point that &quot;there is no way Ukraine can win,&quot; Horrell said. &quot;Losing Kursk, people begin to question whether or not you just have to simply give up,&quot; Lucas said.	https://kyivindependent.com/losing-foothold-in-kursk-oblast-would-be-politically-significant-experts-say/	2025-03-12T08:01:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2166312596.jpg
Kremlin quiet on ceasefire proposal, Russian milbloggers call it 'pure treachery'	Moscow has remained tight-lipped over the news that Ukraine has accepted a full 30-day ceasefire proposal during negotiations with the U.S. in Jeddah on March 11. After the negotiations with Washington, Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office announced that it was ready to accept the terms if Russia also complied with the agreement. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio later said the &quot;ball is in (Russia&apos;s) court,&quot; adding if the Kremlin rejects the ceasefire proposal, &quot;then we&apos;ll, unfortunately, know what the impediment is to peace here.&quot; By the afternoon of March 12, the only thing close to an official Russian position on developments was an evasive answer from Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov when asked by journalists about the proposal. &quot;Look, you are getting a little ahead of yourselves. We don&apos;t want to do that,&quot; he said, explaining the topic must first be discussed with the American side. Prominent Russian state TV propagandists are also uncharacteristically quiet on the topic. Vladimir Solovyov stuck to official reports coming out of the meeting during the day, while Olga Skabeyeva simply asked, &quot;What would we get in return?&quot; But less constrained by the official Kremlin line, Russia&apos;s vibrant and vocal community of pro-war military bloggers, or milbloggers, were more forthcoming in their appraisal of the ceasefire proposal. &#x201C;Any ceasefire at this stage is pure treachery and sabotage,&quot; the milbogger channel Ngp Razvedka, which has almost 100,000 subscribers, said. &quot;The Ukrainian Armed Forces are holding on with their last strength, and it is possible to roll into Sumy on their shoulders,&quot; it added. The theme of a ceasefire being an opportunity for Ukrainian forces to regroup and rearm was repeated by several other milbloggers &#x2014; Two Majors, which has over 1.2 million subscribers, said the pause in fighting would allow them to &quot;lick their wounds.&quot; Ukrainian soldiers stay underground awaiting orders in Sumy Oblast, Ukraine, on Sept. 30, 2024.

(Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)&quot;The truce proposal is actually Minsk-3, which will give the Ukrainian Armed Forces an opportunity to strengthen and rearm,&quot; milblogger Yuriy Podolyaka, told his more than 3 million subscribers. &quot;After that, the war will continue in much worse conditions for us. Therefore, we will not agree, that much is obvious.&quot; Some of the anger was also directed at U.S. President Donald Trump. Millblogger Vladislav Evtushenko, told his 10,000 subscribers that the &quot;right thing to do would be to shoot the old man in the other ear,&quot; referencing the failed assassination attempt on Trump last year. According to reports, Russia is unlikely to agree to the temporary truce, feeling it has the upper hand on the battlefield and viewing the ceasefire as a trap, Reuters reported on March 12, citing undisclosed Russian sources. Any ceasefire agreement would have to take Russia&apos;s battlefield advances into account and provide &quot;guarantees&quot; to Moscow, sources told the news agency. In the past, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top officials have ruled out a temporary ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. Russia continues to occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory and made steady advances in Donetsk Oblast in late 2024. While Russia&apos;s advance in Ukraine&apos;s east has reportedly stalled earlier this year, Moscow&apos;s troops seemed to have made rapid gains in Kursk Oblast, the Russian border region where Ukraine has been fighting since August 2024. One source told Reuters that a ceasefire could weaken Russia&apos;s position, as the West could pin the blame on Moscow should it fail to end the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-quiet-on-ceasefire-proposal-russian-milbloggers-call-it-pure-treachery/	2025-03-12T07:31:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1255667814.jpg
Temporary ceasefire or redrawing borders? What ‘territorial concessions’ mean to Ukraine, Russia, and the US	After Ukrainian and U.S. officials met in Saudi Arabia for peace deal talks to end the war with Russia, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed on March 12 that potential &quot;territorial concessions&quot; from Ukraine were part of the discussion. Since U.S. President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January and opened talks with the goal of ending the war quickly, members of his administration have repeatedly expressed that Ukraine will need to drop its long-standing demand that any end to the war involves a full return of captured territories. In recent months, Kyiv has relented and signaled that it is open to some sort of territorial concessions, inching closer to compromise between the two parties at war. But even with concessions potentially on the table, the parties in the conflict still have a stark divide to bridge. While a gulf remains between Russia and Ukraine on what territory could be up for negotiation, they also stand at odds on a far more basic question: how to define territorial concessions. &#x201C;The phrase &#x2018;territorial concessions&#x2019; means different things to different state actors,&#x201D; George Barros, who heads the Russia and geospatial intelligence teams at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), said in a written response to Kyiv Independent questions. Clarifying what the different sides mean when they use the phrase is &#x201C;key to understanding the opposing negotiating positions and the fraught information environment surrounding peace negotiations,&#x201D; he said.

(Salah Malkawi/Getty Images)Russia&#x2019;s demands: Ukrainian &#x2018;capitulation&#x2019;Russia&#x2019;s demands for concessions include the complete relinquishing by Ukraine of four oblasts &#x2014; Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. These oblasts contain wide swathes of territory that Ukraine currently controls, including the regional capitals of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. The four oblasts provide a valuable connection by land from Russia to Crimea, an autonomous region of Ukraine that Russia illegally annexed in 2014. Such a concession would transfer more land to Russia than simply freezing the current battle lines, where Russia currently controls around 20% of Ukraine&#x2019;s territory. In December, Russia said that a full withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from these oblasts would be a requirement to begin peace talks, a demand that Kyiv rejected. Not only is Russia seeking control of these territories, it is also seeking legal recognition from Ukraine and the U.S. that these territories belong to Russia. &#x201C;These demands are tantamount to a full Ukrainian and U.S. capitulation and would undermine the international-rules based order,&#x201D; said Barros. Last month, Russia also ruled out the idea of a territorial exchange &#x2014; exchanging land currently controlled by Russia for portions of Ukrainian-occupied Kursk in Russia. It is currently pushing forward in Kursk and regaining territory that Ukraine has held since the surprise offensive in August. In September 2022, Russia illegally enshrined ownership in its constitution over the four oblasts it now demands after illegal sham referendums in occupied territories, a move that holds no weight internationally. The move, however, complicates Russia&#x2019;s calculus in negotiations, said Andreas Umland, an analyst at the Stockholm Center for Eastern European Studies (SCEES). If Moscow formally agreed in negotiations that any of these territories do not legally belong to Russia, it would set a precedent Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely hoping to avoid, he explained. &#x201C;If there is some sort of compromise from Russia&#x2019;s side on territories that, according to its constitution, officially belong to Russia, then this could be a model for future breakups from the legitimate territory of Russia,&#x201D; Umland said. If a crisis broke out in a border region of Russia that wanted to break away, they could follow the model for changing or breaking the constitution to make that happen &#x201C;the same as was done in these Ukrainian territories,&#x201D; he said. Unlike Russia, Ukraine&#x2019;s position on territorial concessions has shifted over time. For the first years of the war &#x2014; and as recently as late last year &#x2014; Ukraine maintained it wouldn&#x2019;t negotiate any peace deal that didn&#x2019;t include a full restoration of Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereign land. Ukraine has demanded a return to its 2014 borders, prior to Russia&#x2019;s seizing of Crimea and a small area of the Donbas, though some see the 2022 borders as a more viable option, meaning the territory Ukraine held prior to the full-scale invasion. That position has softened in recent months as territory and troop losses mount during the third year of Russia&#x2019;s invasion and as the U.S. ramps up pressure on Ukraine to reach a quick settlement. While Ukraine now signals that it could accept the temporary occupation of territories Russia has seized, President Volodymyr Zelensky has underscored that Ukraine would still retain its legal claims to the land. &#x201C;We cannot legally acknowledge any occupied territory of Ukraine as Russian,&quot; Zelensky said in November. Ukraine is also not offering any concessions of land that Russia does not currently control.

(Andreas Arnold/picture alliance via Getty Images)The willingness among Ukraine&#x2019;s people to make territorial concessions to end the war quickly is at an all-time high, but the view is still in the minority, according to polling from the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published on Jan. 3. The poll found that around 38% percent of Ukrainians were open to conceding territory in a peace deal, up from 8% in December 2022. The number of Ukrainians who oppose giving up territories under any circumstances, &#x201C;even if this would prolong the war and threaten the preservation of independence,&#x201D; stands at 51%, according to the poll. A Gallup poll released in November 2024, however, found that just over half of Ukrainians were open to territorial concessions, compared with 38% who were not. Zelensky faces pressure to make a deal, but Ukrainian people are split over what type of deal is acceptable, said Umland of SCEES. &#x201C;I think that is also one of Russia&apos;s strategies,&#x201D; said Umland. &#x201C;They want to create this contentious issue in Ukraine.&#x201D; Neither poll clarified whether territorial concessions meant signing over land to Russia or an agreement where Ukraine would acknowledge occupation while still retaining its claim to the land. Russia and Ukraine&#x2019;s stances on territorial concessions are clear, if incompatible. What the U.S. means when it demands territorial concessions is far less explicit. Under the previous U.S. administration, former President Joe Biden ruled out handing land to Russia. &#x201C;The United States will never, never, never recognize Russia&apos;s claims on Ukraine&apos;s sovereign territory,&quot; U.S. President Joe Biden said on Sept. 29, 2022, after Russia illegally annexed Ukraine&#x2019;s four eastern oblasts. Trump&#x2019;s approach, however, has been far more transactional and no longer emphasizes Ukrainian sovereignty.

(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Trump reportedly said he wanted to see that Ukraine is willing to make territorial concessions before he restarted military aid to and intelligence Ukraine after cutting it in March, but hasn&#x2019;t specified what this could look like. Intelligence sharing and military aid were restored on March 11, after Ukraine and the United States agreed to a plan for a 30-day ceasefire. Whether Russia will agree to the terms is unknown. A Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on March 7 that it hadn&#x2019;t received any official proposals for territorial concessions. Earlier in March, Zelensky called for more clarity on the U.S.&#x2019;s position. Ahead of the March 11 talks in Saudi Arabia, a source in Zelensky&#x2019;s office responded to a question about what the Ukraine team expected to learn: &#x201C;Finally hearing what the Americans want from the negotiations.&quot; &#x201C;It&#x2019;s unclear what the U.S. is seeking in terms of territorial concessions,&#x201D; ISW&#x2019;s Barros said. &#x201C;For the U.S., there is a principled model for how to deal with wars of conquest: non-recognition of occupied territory. The U.S. never officially recognized the Soviet Union&#x2019;s occupation of the Baltic States, for example.&#x201D; After the Soviet army invaded and occupied the Baltic countries in 1940, Acting U.S. Secretary of State Sumner Welles issued a diplomatic statement known as the Welles Declaration. It condemned the Soviet Union&#x2019;s invasion and refused to recognize the Soviet-declared annexation of this territory. The statement &#x201C;lays out a principled blueprint&#x201D; for how the U.S. could handle a situation where Russia continued to occupy Ukrainian land without legally recognizing it, Barros added. The U.S. hasn&#x2019;t said whether it would follow a similar model. &#x201C;The stark reality is that Ukraine has offered some concessions to get to the negotiating table (concessions on territorial integrity) whereas the Russian side has not budged at all, and demands territorial concessions on lands that Russian forces haven&#x2019;t occupied on the battlefield,&#x201D; Barros said.	https://kyivindependent.com/temporary-ceasefire-or-redrawing-borders-what-territorial-concessions-mean-to-russia-ukraine-and-the-us/	2025-03-12T07:12:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201827435.jpg
Ukraine's military 'preserving maximum of lives of our soldiers' in Kursk Oblast, Zelensky says	Ukrainian troops operating in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast continue in their tasks despite intense Russian pressure, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a briefing on March 12. &#x201C;The military command is doing what it should do, preserving the maximum of lives of our soldiers,&quot; Zelensky said, urging a &quot;sober&quot; assessment of the battlefield situation rather than reacting to Russian information warfare. His remarks come as multiple Ukrainian and Russian sources claimed that Russian troops had entered Sudzha, a key Ukrainian-held stronghold in the Russian border region of Kursk. Russian news agency TASS published purported drone footage showing that Russian troops had entered the town center and raised a Russian flag. The Ukrainian military has not publicly commented on the claims. Roman Kostenko, secretary of the parliamentary defense committee, acknowledged that the situation in Kursk Oblast is &quot;complicated&quot; but said Ukrainian forces are working to stabilize the front line. &quot;I talked to the soldiers in the morning; they do not confirm our complete withdrawal from Sudzha... I have no information that our troops have completely left Sudzha as of two hours ago,&quot; Kostenko said at a press briefing. Sudzha is located less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Ukrainian border and 85 kilometers (53 miles) from the regional capital, Kursk. Russia launched a renewed offensive in Kursk Oblast last week and reportedly made rapid advances. The developments coincided with the U.S. instituting a temporary pause on all military and intelligence support for Ukraine. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said on March 10 that there is no immediate threat of encirclement as Ukrainian forces are repositioning to &quot;favorable defense lines.&quot; Ukraine launched the cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially seizing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. Since then, Russian forces, reinforced by North Korean troops, have steadily pushed back against Ukrainian forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-forces-continue-operations-in-kursk-under-heavy-russian-pressure-zelensky-says/	2025-03-12T06:54:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/fd0d9d5c4438dcaa95c1a8bd467e8c30_1686065778.jpeg
Ukraine doesn't trust Russia but wants to show US its readiness for peace, Zelensky says on ceasefire deal	Ukraine wanted to demonstrate to U.S. President Donald Trump and its European partners that it is serious about ending the war, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 12 about why Kyiv agreed to Washington&apos;s temporary truce proposal. While Ukraine initially proposed a partial ceasefire that would extend only to aerial and naval operations, U.S. delegates proposed a full truce during talks with Ukrainian officials in Jeddah on March 11. After receiving the proposal, Zelensky said Ukraine was &quot;ready for a 30-day ceasefire format offered by the U.S. side.&quot; &quot;I have repeatedly stressed that none of us trust Russia... but we will not play with narratives that we want the war to continue,&quot; Zelensky said at a press conference. &quot;I am very serious, and it is important for me to end the war. I want the U.S. president to see this; so that Europe and everybody unites to push Russia toward ending the war.&quot; After a heated exchange between Trump and Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28, the Trump administration accused Ukraine of not being ready for peace and froze military and intelligence assistance. The pause was lifted after Kyiv agreed to the ceasefire deal. The Ukrainian president also noted that the ceasefire would be only the first step toward a full peace. After the war ends, martial law will be lifted, and elections will be held, he added. The Trump administration has been pressuring Ukraine to hold elections even before a full peace agreement, even though the Ukrainian Constitution prohibits this under martial law. According to Zelensky, support from Kyiv&apos;s international partners will be required for &quot;technical monitoring&quot; of a full ceasefire. He also raised the question of whether Moscow is open to the agreement. The Kremlin has not voiced an official position on the proposal until it can discuss it with Washington. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said discussions with Russia would be held on March 12. Reuters reported earlier the same day that, according to undisclosed Russian officials, Russia is unlikely to agree to the proposal unless it takes into account Moscow&apos;s battlefield advances and other demands.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-doesnt-trust-russia-but-wants-to-show-trump-readiness-for-peace-zelensky-says-on-ceasefire-deal/	2025-03-12T06:34:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204065456--1-.jpg
Ukraine-US talks in Jeddah concerned potential territorial concessions, Rubio confirms	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed on March 12 that Ukraine-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia on March 11 included discussions about potential &quot;territorial concessions&quot; as part of a negotiated settlement with Russia. &quot;Yeah, we&apos;ve had conversations,&quot; Rubio said in an airport in Ireland when asked about potential discussions regarding Ukraine ceding territory. The Trump administration has repeatedly said that both Kyiv and Moscow will have to make compromises for a peace deal, calling Ukraine&apos;s goal of restoring its pre-2014 borders &quot;unrealistic.&quot; Russian forces currently occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine, from where reports of systematic repression, torture, and forced deportations emerge. Rubio also said that the Jeddah talks covered &quot;what a negotiation process would look like&quot; and reiterated, &quot;There is no military solution to this conflict.&quot; The official acknowledged that Ukraine requires security assurances to deter possible future Russian aggression and emphasized that &quot;Europeans will need to be involved in this regard.&quot; Trump has so far refused to offer such security guarantees, saying during his Feb. 28 meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky that responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security should fall on Europe. Kyiv agreed to a temporary 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia abides by it. Moscow has not officially declared its position on the proposal. U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 11 that Washington would engage Russian President Vladimir Putin this week to discuss the ceasefire terms. Rubio claimed the U.S. &#x201C;will have contact with Russians&#x201D; on March 12. The agreement led to the U.S. resuming military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, which had been suspended after Zelensky&apos;s Oval Office clash with Trump. The ceasefire proposal marks a significant shift for Kyiv, as Ukrainian officials have previously warned that a temporary pause in fighting would allow Russia to regroup and relaunch its offensive.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-talks-in-saudi-arabia-discussed-potential-territorial-concessions-rubio-confirms/	2025-03-12T06:01:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194087620.jpg
200,000-500,000 men could leave Ukraine after war ends and borders open, minister says	Between 200,000 and 500,000 men could leave Ukraine after the war with Russia ends and all travel restrictions are lifted, Deputy Prime Minister and National Unity Minister Oleksii Chernyshov said on March 12. Draft-age men are not permitted to leave Ukraine under martial law, which was instituted at the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, without a special permission. Speaking at a press briefing attended by the Kyiv Independent, Chernyshov stressed the demographic challenges facing Ukraine in the fourth year of the full-scale war. A January report by the National Bank of Ukraine estimated the net outflow of migrants from Ukraine at 200,000 this year and up to 500,000 in 2027. Some 32 million people live in Ukraine-controlled territories, Chernyshov said. Roughly 5 million Ukrainian refugees remain abroad under the temporary protection of host countries, while millions more live in Russian-occupied parts of the country. The minister estimated that only roughly 30% of the Ukrainians living abroad may return within the year after the war&apos;s potential end. Another 30% may not return at all, he added. Discussions about peace are gaining ground as the U.S. and Ukraine recently agreed on a temporary ceasefire, which they presented as a step toward a broader peace agreement with Russia. Demographic trends do not work in Ukraine&apos;s favor either. For every 150,000 Ukrainian children born in a year, 450,000 die in the same period, a figure excluding war-related deaths, according to the minister. This complicates an already dire situation in Ukraine&apos;s labor market. Ukraine currently lacks more than 4.5 million workers, Chernyshov said.	https://kyivindependent.com/200-000-500-000-men-could-leave-ukraine-after-war-ends-borders-open-minister-says/	2025-03-12T05:54:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1820446236.jpg
Northern Operational Command chief dismissed for unclear reasons	Major General Dmytro Krasylnykov, commander of Ukraine&apos;s Northern Operational Command, has been dismissed from his post, he told Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne on March 12. Krasylnykov said he was not given an official reason for his dismissal. The order, signed on March 7, places him in a reserve battalion. &quot;I&apos;m guessing, but I don&apos;t want to talk about it yet,&quot; Krasylnykov told Suspilne when asked about the possible reasons for his removal. The dismissal follows reports of intensified Russian advances against Ukrainian positions in Kursk Oblast, where Kyiv launched a cross-border incursion in August 2024. The Northern Operational Command oversees units deployed in Ukraine&apos;s northern regions, including Sumy Oblast, the launching ground for the Kursk incursion. Speaking to the outlet, Krasylnykov said he does not see any possible reasons for his dismissal, including in relation to the developments in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Roughly speaking, I left Kursk Oblast back in November (2024),&quot; he said. Russian forces reportedly have entered the town of Sudzha as of March 12, according to DeepState, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), and Russian state news agency TASS. Krasylnykov had commanded the Northern Operational and Tactical Group since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. In March 2023, he was appointed commander of the Northern Operational Command. On Feb. 28, 2022, Krasylnykov was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine and the Order of the Golden Star for his role in defending Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty. Concerns about the situation in Kursk Oblast have grown amid Ukraine&apos;s temporary loss of U.S. military and intelligence support after the Feb. 28 clash between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. The support was resumed on March 11 after Ukraine agreed to a U.S.-proposed temporary ceasefire.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-north-operational-command-chief-dismissed/	2025-03-12T04:53:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/468597721_967844978707860_4260084381588029574_n.jpg
Raiffeisen Bank International's subsidiary remains invested in sanctioned Russian entities, report says	Raiffeisen Bank International&apos;s (RBI) Russian assets manager continues to hold and promote investments in sanctioned Russian companies and government bonds, according to a joint investigation by the BankTrack NGO and the B4Ukraine coalition published on March 12. As of January, Raiffeisen Capital held around 31.7 billion rubles ($365 million) in shares and bonds in entities sanctioned by the U.S. and the EU for their role in supporting Russian aggression in Ukraine, the report said, citing financial documents. This sum is only part of the overall value of 70.9 billion ($818 million) rubles reportedly held across 10 funds. Austria&apos;s Raiffeisen banking group has been long scrutinized for failing to exit the Russian market despite the EU sanctions imposed at the outbreak of the full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022. The investigation highlights that these assets included roughly 2.7 billion rubles ($31 million) in state bonds issued after March 9, 2022, a cut-off date past which the EU banned trade in any transferable securities issued by the Russian government. The asset manager&apos;s other investments reportedly include about 1.6 billion rubles ($18.5 million) worth of shares in the Russian state-owned bank Sberbank and 2.2 billion rubles ($25.4 million) in the state energy giant Gazprom, both under Western sanctions. Raiffeisen remains the largest Western bank still operating in Russia, despite pleding in July 2024 that it would &quot;drastically&quot; scale down its business in the country. &quot;We must call these investments what they are: war profiteering with reckless disregard for the Ukrainian people and for European efforts to sanction the Russian war machine,&quot; said Max Hammer, a human rights campaigner at BankTrack. &quot;RBI must address and be made to answer for these violations, and it must provide detailed information on its financial links to the Russian war machine. If it fails to do so, European authorities should not hesitate to respond appropriately.&quot; The authors of the report argue that Raiffeisen Capital&apos;s investment activities may contravene European sanctions legislation. &quot;RBI has previously claimed that its Russian business is subject to rigorous due diligence and sanctions compliance checks, but these due diligence procedures have clearly not been enough to prevent the bank from investing in key sponsors of Russia&#x2019;s war of aggression,&quot; Nezir Sinani, the executive director at B4Ukraine, said in a statement. &quot;The time for RBI to decisively sever its relationship with Russia&#x2019;s wartime economy is long overdue.&quot; Raiffeisen Capital has not responded to the Kyiv Independent&apos;s request for comment at the time of publication.	https://kyivindependent.com/raiffeisen-bank-internationals-subsidiary-remains-invested-in-sanctioned-russian-entities-report-says/	2025-03-12T04:30:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1250736178.jpg
Russian, US intelligence chiefs call to discuss 'reducing confrontation,' Russian media reports	Sergey Naryshkin, director of Russia&apos;s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and CIA Director John Ratcliffe held a telephone conversation on March 11 to discuss reducing confrontation between Moscow and Washington, pro-Kremlin media outlet Kommersant reported. According to Kommersant, the agencies agreed to maintain communication &quot;to help ensure international stability and security, as well as to reduce confrontation.&quot; &quot;The two intelligence services discussed issues of interaction in the areas of common interest and crisis management,&quot; the service said, as quoted by Kommersant. Naryshkin last spoke with the CIA chief, a position held at the time by Bill Burns, in the summer of 2023. The renewed dialogue follows U.S.-Russia talks in Istanbul on Feb. 27 and an earlier round in Riyadh on Feb. 18, part of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s push for a swift peace deal between Ukraine and Russia. Russia&apos;s Foreign Ministry previously said that it hopes such discussions will &quot;strengthen trust&quot; between Moscow and Washington. The direct engagement between the U.S. and Russia has raised concerns in Kyiv and Europe that Washington is sidelining its allies. Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, has emphasized the administration&apos;s intent to reset relations with Russia, blaming previous U.S. leadership for avoiding direct engagement with Russian President Vladimir Putin.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-us-intelligence-chiefs-reportedly-discuss-reducing-confrontation/	2025-03-12T04:09:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-172750694--1-.jpeg
EU retaliates against new US steel, aluminum tariffs	The European Union announced measures in response to new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, planning duties on over $28 billion worth of U.S. goods, according to an official statement published on March 12. The move follows U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s decision to impose 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, reigniting trade tensions between Washington and Brussels. In response, the European Commission is launching countermeasures to protect businesses, workers, and consumers from what it called &quot;unjustified U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs.&quot; The EU&apos;s countermeasures could affect up to 26 billion euros ($28.3 billion) worth of U.S. goods exports, equivalent to the economic impact of the U.S. tariffs. The retaliatory steps will be introduced in two phases. Previously suspended countermeasures, first imposed during the first Trump term in 2018 and 2020, will lapse on April 1, responding to U.S. tariffs costing 8 billion euros ($8.7 billion) in EU exports. The second phase will introduce new countermeasures on April 13 in response to U.S. tariffs costing the EU 18 billion euros ($19.7 billion) in exports. &quot;We deeply regret this measure. Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business and even worse for consumers. These tariffs are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy,&quot; said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The commission signaled its willingness to negotiate a resolution, saying that the measures could be lifted if an agreement is reached. Trump defended the tariffs as a means to simplify duties on metals and suggested retaliatory measures against countries imposing tariffs on U.S. goods. The dispute dates back to Trump&apos;s first term, when his administration imposed duties on nearly $7 billion of European exports in 2018, citing national security concerns. The EU retaliated with its own tariffs on American products. A temporary truce was reached in 2021 under the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden, with the U.S. replacing the tariffs with a quota system and the EU freezing its countermeasures. Trump&apos;s new tariffs threaten to reignite the trade conflict, with the European Commission warning that such restrictions could disrupt supply chains and raise costs for businesses and consumers. The U.S.&apos;s tariffs threat Ukraine&apos;s industry as well. Steel production is a key sector of Ukraine&apos;s economy, the second-largest source of foreign currency after agriculture.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-announces-response-to-new-us-steel-aluminum-tariffs/	2025-03-12T03:22:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-688109050.jpg
Putin unlikely to accept 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, Reuters reports	Russia is unlikely to agree to a temporary truce in Ukraine proposed by the U.S., feeling it has the upper hand on the battlefield and viewing the ceasefire as a trap, Reuters reported on March 12, citing undisclosed Russian sources. Any ceasefire agreement would have to take Russia&apos;s battlefield advances into account and provide &quot;guarantees&quot; to Moscow, sources told the news agency. Ukraine agreed to the U.S.&apos;s proposal for a 30-day truce during talks in Jeddah on March 11, after which Washington resumed military and intelligence support for Kyiv. The U.S. is expected to discuss the proposal with Russia in the coming days. The Kremlin is yet to comment on the idea, but Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top officials have previously ruled out a temporary ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. Russia continues to occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory and made steady advances in Donetsk Oblast in late 2024. While Russia&apos;s advance in Ukraine&apos;s east has reportedly stalled earlier this year, Moscow&apos;s troops seemed to have made rapid gains in Kursk Oblast, the Russian border region where Ukraine has been fighting since August 2024. One source told Reuters that a ceasefire could weaken Russia&apos;s position, as the West could pin the blame on Moscow should it fail to end the war. Russian nationalist voices and pro-war bloggers have already denounced the ceasefire proposal. Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the international committee in the Russian Senate, said that any deal should be hashed out on Moscow&apos;s terms.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-unlikely-to-accept-30-day-ceasefire-in-ukraine-reuters-reports/	2025-03-12T02:55:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2161636677.jpg
Russia reportedly enters Ukraine-held Sudzha in Kursk Oblast; Kyiv hasn't confirmed	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russian troops have launched an offensive on the Ukrainian-controlled town of Sudzha in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the DeepState monitoring group, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), and the Russian state news agency TASS claimed on March 12. According to DeepState, Russian forces have entered the eastern part of Sudzha and are entrenching their positions. Russian state media outlet TASS published purported drone footage of the town, claiming Russian troops had entered the town center. ISW analysts reported that Russian troops continue to advance within Sudzha itself, as well as north of the town near the settlements of Kazachya Loknya, Yuzhny, Kubatkino, and Ivashkovskyi, and along the border in Ukraine&apos;s Sumy Oblast. The claims could not be immediately verified. The Kyiv Independent has contacted the Ukrainian military command in Kursk Oblast for comment and has been promised an official statement later. Sudzha is located less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Ukrainian border, with the regional capital, Kursk, lying 85 kilometers (53 miles) to the northeast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-reportedly-launches-assault-on-ukrainian-controlled-sudzha-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-03-12T02:21:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166820734.jpg
US resumes sharing intelligence with Ukraine, Gabbard confirms	Tulsi Gabbard, the U.S. director of national intelligence, confirmed on March 12 that the U.S. had resumed sharing intelligence with Ukraine per President Donald Trump&apos;s direction. The move follows U.S.-Ukraine talks in Jeddah on March 11, during which both sides preliminarily agreed on a 30-day ceasefire, and Washington resumed military and intelligence assistance to Kyiv. &quot;Because of @POTUS leadership, we are one significant step closer to ending the bloody war in Ukraine,&quot; Gabbard said on X. &quot;Per the President&apos;s direction, the pause on intelligence sharing with Ukraine has ended.&quot; The U.S. restricted intelligence sharing with Ukraine on March 5, shortly after pausing all military assistance flowing to the country. The steps followed a heated exchange between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28. U.S. intelligence has been crucial for Kyiv in planning precision strikes against Russia, monitoring the movement of Russian troops, and detecting Russia&apos;s aerial strikes. The full impact of the intelligence sharing pause remains unclear. During that short period, Russia achieved a significant breakthrough in Kursk Oblast and launched several deadly aerial strikes against Ukraine. Steve Witkoff, Trump&apos;s envoy for the Middle East, claimed that the restrictions did not concern intelligence needed for defensive purposes.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-resumes-sharing-intelligence-with-ukraine-gabbard-confirms/	2025-03-12T02:09:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203492012.jpg
Trump to invite Zelensky back to White House following Saudi talks	U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 11 that President Volodymyr Zelensky is welcome to return to the White House following talks in Saudi Arabia, where Ukraine agreed to a temporary ceasefire. Trump reiterated that Ukraine had accepted a full 30-day ceasefire proposal during negotiations in Jeddah and expressed hope that &quot;Russia will agree to it.&quot; &quot;We&apos;re going to meet with them (Russia) later on today and tomorrow, and hopefully, we&apos;ll be able to (work) out a deal. I think the ceasefire is very important,&quot; Trump said. When asked if Zelensky would be invited back to the White House, the U.S. president responded, &quot;Sure, absolutely.&quot; The development comes after weeks of strained ties between Kyiv and Washington following a heated Oval Office exchange between Trump and Zelensky on Feb. 28. This clash derailed plans to sign a bilateral mineral resources deal and led to the freeze of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing. In the aftermath, White House officials signaled that Zelensky needed to apologize and commit to peace talks to restore discussions. On March 4, Zelensky called the confrontation &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his willingness to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Following negotiations in Saudi Arabia, Ukraine confirmed its readiness to implement a temporary 30-day ceasefire, contingent on Russia&apos;s adherence to the agreement. The decision marks a significant shift, as Ukrainian officials had previously warned that any pause in fighting would allow Russia to regroup and prepare for future offensives. Talks in Jeddah also resulted in Washington restoring military and intelligence support to Ukraine, reversing Trump&apos;s earlier decision to suspend assistance after the Feb. 28 dispute.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-invites-zelensky-back-to-white-house-following-saudi-talks/	2025-03-12T01:52:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201820195.jpg
Slovakia’s protests prove the fight for Europe isn’t over	On March 7, tens of thousands of people took to the streets across Slovakia for the third time this year to protest the pro-Russian policies of Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico&#x2019;s government. They voiced concerns that Slovakia is drifting away from the European Union and its transatlantic allies. Their fears are well-founded. Since autumn 2023, a coalition of nationalist, EU-skeptic, and pro-Russian parties has held power in Bratislava. While Fico&#x2019;s left-wing Smer party pushes pro-Russian rhetoric, the Slovak National Party (SNS) promotes a &#x201C;pan-Slavic brotherhood&#x201D; with Moscow. The result is the same: under Fico, Slovakia is moving in a direction similar to Viktor Orb&#xE1;n&#x2019;s Hungary. Fico&#x2019;s government has demonstrated a clear alignment with Moscow. In September 2024, he falsely claimed that Nazi troops were fighting in Ukraine. He was also the first prime minister of an EU member state to grant an interview to the Russian state television channel Rossiya 1. In October 2024, &#x13D;ubo&#x161; Blaha, a European Parliament member of Fico&#x2019;s Smer, traveled to Moscow to &#x201C;apologize to the Russians for EU sanctions,&#x201D; provocatively stating, &#x201C;fascism and war come from the West, while freedom and peace come from the East.&#x201D; Fico met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in December 2024, and he had already accepted Putin&#x2019;s invitation to travel to Moscow in May 2025. In January 2025, a delegation from SNS also visited Moscow, where party chairman Andrej Danko called Putin &#x201C;a very reasonable and pragmatic leader.&#x201D; Concerned about the government&#x2019;s pro-Russian stance, the liberal opposition party Freedom and Solidarity (SaS) proposed enshrining Slovakia&#x2019;s EU membership in the constitution. The response from Fico&#x2019;s camp was both surprising and alarming: Tibor Ga&#x161;par, a former police chief indicted for criminal activity and now a Smer politician, suggested that Slovakia should consider leaving the EU if its rules were to change. Even President Peter Pellegrini, from the coalition partner Hlas, distanced himself from Ga&#x161;par&#x2019;s remarks. While a Slovak exit from the EU may still seem unlikely, many citizens are deeply unsettled by the government&#x2019;s direction. This frustration has fueled mass protests, where demonstrators wave Ukrainian flags and rally under the slogan &#x201C;Peace for Ukraine.&#x201D; Fico, however, has responded with conspiracy theories. When his government faced a no-confidence vote in January 2025 &#x2014; after losing several MPs and potentially its parliamentary majority &#x2014; he called for a closed session, claiming Slovakia&#x2019;s intelligence service (led by the son of Tibor Ga&#x161;par) had warned him of an attempted coup. According to Fico, NGOs active in Ukraine and Georgia were plotting to overthrow him &#x2014; a claim with no evidence, but one that echoed the rhetoric of Viktor Orb&#xE1;n in Hungary. Around the same time, Orb&#xE1;n himself visited Bratislava, further strengthening ties between the two leaders. In the end, Fico managed to block the no-confidence vote, despite his government&#x2019;s fragile majority. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico in Bratislava, Slovakia, on Oct. 1, 2023. (Vladimir Simicek/AFP via Getty Images)Fico&#x2019;s Orb&#xE1;n-like approach extends beyond foreign policy into domestic affairs. Ironically, Fico &#x2014; who pursued anti-Hungarian minority policies in his first term (2006&#x2013;2010) &#x2014; has now become a close ally of Orb&#xE1;n. Even Slovakia&#x2019;s Hungarian minority party aligns with Fico&#x2019;s anti-Ukrainian, pro-Russian stance. Like Orb&#xE1;n, Fico has worked to weaken democratic checks and balances &#x2014; amending criminal law in his interests, restructuring public media to silence critical journalists, and allowing SNS&#x2019;s nationalist culture minister to wage a political war against artists (theater and museum directors have been dismissed and replaced with loyalists). Despite these troubling developments, Slovakia under Fico remains freer and more pluralistic than Orb&#xE1;n&#x2019;s Hungary. The key difference is stability: Orb&#xE1;n has ruled since 2010 with a strong parliamentary majority, whereas Fico&#x2019;s coalition is fragile and divided. Some MPs from his smaller coalition partners, SNS and Hlas, have already left the government, though they have not yet voted against him. Fico&#x2019;s pro-Russian stance has so far been more of a rhetorical tool for domestic politics. Unlike Orb&#xE1;n, he ultimately did not block the EU&#x2019;s decision on Ukraine in early March, as he hopes the European Union will secure gas supplies for Slovakia. Fico&#x2019;s pragmatism can also be explained by the fact that a fully pro-Russian foreign policy and a boycott strategy at the European level would not even be entirely supported within his own coalition &#x2014; particularly by the Hlas party of President Peter Pellegrini. At the same time, the issue of Ukraine &#x2014; again in contrast to Hungary &#x2014; is a key mobilising force for the Slovak opposition. While the Hungarian opposition avoids open and direct confrontation with Orb&#xE1;n on this matter out of opportunism, tens of thousands of people take to the streets in Slovakia to demonstrate in support of Ukraine and against Fico&#x2019;s pro-Russian policies. Political instability and mounting public resistance continue to pressure Fico. On the streets of Slovak cities, the Ukrainian flag has become a symbol of pro-European commitment for many. They are not &#x201C;foreign agents,&#x201D; as Fico claims, but decent citizens of Slovakia who want to avoid the Orb&#xE1;nization of their country.

Maxar reportedly restores Ukraine's access to high-resolution satellite imagery	U.S. aerospace company Maxar Technologies has restored Ukraine&apos;s access to the Global Enhanced GEOINT Delivery (GEGD) service, allowing Kyiv to utilize high-resolution commercial satellite imagery again, Ukrainian media outlet Militarnyi reported on March 12, citing users of the service. Ukraine has relied on such imagery for defense and strategic planning, including tracking Russian troop movements, assessing battlefield conditions, and monitoring damage to Russian infrastructure. According to Militarnyi&apos;s sources, the program&apos;s resumption means Ukraine can again access critical satellite intelligence for defense operations. The move follows U.S.-Ukraine talks in Jeddah on March 11, where Washington agreed to restart key military and intelligence support for Ukraine. On March 7, Militarnyi reported that Maxar had restricted Ukraine&apos;s access to its satellite imagery, citing unnamed users. The company later confirmed the suspension in a statement to the Kyiv Independent, explaining that the restrictions applied specifically to imagery provided through U.S. government programs. CIA Director John Ratcliffe said on March 5 that the U.S. had halted intelligence sharing with Ukraine in a step seen as pressure tactics to push Kyiv toward peace negotiations with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/maxar-technologies-restores-ukraines-access-to-high-resolution-satellite-imagery/	2025-03-12T01:33:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1232955804.jpg
Georgia's ex-President Saakashvili sentenced to 9 more years in prison on embezzlement charges	Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili has been sentenced to an additional nine years in prison for an alleged large-scale embezzlement of state funds, the Tbilisi City Court ruled, as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s Georgian service reported on March 12. Judge Badri Kochlamazashvili found Saakashvili guilty of misappropriating 9 million lari (about $5.4 million at the time) from the state budget between May 2009 and February 2013 for personal expenses, including luxury hotels, cosmetic procedures, and designer clothing. Teimuraz Janashia, former head of the Special Guard Service, was also convicted in the case and fined 300,000 Georgian lari ($108,000) for abuse of office. Both men denied the charges, calling the trial politically motivated. Saakashvili, Georgia&apos;s president between 2004-2007 and 2008-2013, sought to take his country on a pro-Western path but lost elections to the Moscow-friendly Georgian Dream party a few years after the defeat in the Russia-Georgia war in 2008. The politician was detained upon returning to Georgia in 2021 and is currently serving six years in prison on charges of ordering the beating of opposition lawmaker Valery Gelashvili in 2005. He was also given a three-year sentence for abuse of power charges for pardoning four police officers convicted of murder in 2008. The former president, a longtime critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has accused oligrach Bidzina Ivanishvili, the honorary chairman of the Georgian Dream party, of orchestrating his prosecution on Moscow&apos;s orders. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled on May 23 that there were no grounds to believe that Saakashvili&apos;s criminal proceedings were unfair. In February 2023, President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Georgian government was &quot;killing&quot; Saakashvili after photos surfaced showing his deteriorating health and significant weight loss. Saakashvili holds Ukrainian citizenship and served as the governor of Odesa Oblast between 2015 and 2016. The ruling follows mass protests in Tbilisi over the disputed October election results, which saw the Kremlin-friendly Georgian Dream party retain power. Since the election, a number of Western countries have imposed sanctions on Georgia over the perceived democratic backsliding. The political crisis deepened after Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced that Georgia&apos;s EU integration could be delayed until 2028.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-ex-president-saakashvili-sentenced-to-nine-more-years-in-prison-for-embezzlement/	2025-03-12T01:15:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1251132287.jpg
Ukraine, US to start discussing ceasefire details next week, Yermak says	Kyiv and Washington have agreed to begin technical-level discussions on a temporary 30-day ceasefire in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine next week, Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak said on March 11 after talks in Saudi Arabia. &quot;Next week, we have already agreed that at the technical expert level, the teams will start talking about all the details,&quot; Yermak told reporters. The deal marks a surprising shift for Ukraine, which has previously warned that a temporary pause in fighting would allow Russia to regroup and launch further offensives. The proposal would require Moscow to abide by the ceasefire terms. Talks in Jeddah also led to Washington restarting key military and intelligence support for Ukraine, reversing a decision made after the Feb. 28 Oval Office confrontation between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to Yermak, the discussions also covered potential security guarantees for Ukraine, though he acknowledged that negotiations on this front are still ongoing. &quot;We understand exactly what we need. Our American partners understand this. They are sympathetic to this issue, but these conversations continue. Today, we have taken the first step, a very important one. And there is still much work to be done,&quot; he said. Trump has previously refused to commit to security guarantees for Ukraine, saying in February that Europe should take responsibility for Kyiv&apos;s security. Moscow has not publicly responded to the U.S.-backed proposal. Russian nationalist voices and pro-war bloggers have already expressed opposition to a ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. Trump said the U.S. would seek to engage Russian President Vladimir Putin in discussions on the plan this week. &quot;It takes two for tango, as I have already said, so I hope he (Putin) will also agree as well, and I really think that would be 75% of the way, the rest is getting it documented,&quot; Trump said on March 11.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-teams-to-start-ceasefire-technical-discussions-next-week-yermak-said/	2025-03-12T00:22:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-11_11-38-26.jpg
Updated: 14 killed, 33 injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over past day	Editor&apos;s note: The story was updated with the latest casualty figures from Kryvyi Rih. Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least 14 civilians and injured at least 33 over the past day, regional authorities reported on March 12. The casualties included children and Syrian crew members of a merchant vessel in Odesa. At least one person was killed and 10 injured during Russian attacks against Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. A series of explosions were reported in Kryvyi Rih after Russia launched a missile strike against the city early on March 12. A 47-year-old woman was killed, while nine other people were injured, Lysak said. Seven of them have been hospitalized, and three are in serious condition. High-rise buildings, administrative buildings, buses, garages, cars, shops, and a school were damaged. Russia also attacked the regional center, Dnipro, overnight, injuring a 42-year-old man, damaging 10 houses, a kindergarten, a school, and other buildings, and starting fires across the city. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast killed seven people and injured 13 over the past day, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. This included three people killed and three injured in Siversk, two killed and two injured in Rivne, one killed and two injured in Rodynske, one killed and another injured in Pokrovsk, four injured in Kostiantynivka, and one injured in Molocharka, according to the statement. In Kherson Oblast, two people were killed and seven injured, including two children, according to Oleksandr Prokudin, the regional governor. Three high-rise buildings, eight houses, a gas pipeline, utility buildings, and cars were damaged. Overnight, Russia struck a port in Odesa with a ballistic missile, damaging infrastructure and the Barbados-flagged merchant vessel MJ Pina, which was loading wheat for export to Algeria, Governor Oleh Kiper said. The Barbados-flagged merchant vessel MJ Pina damaged in a Russian missile attack late on March 11, 2025. (Governor Oleh Kiper/Telegram)Four Syrian crew members, aged between 18 and 24, were killed, while another Syrian crew member and one Ukrainian port employee were injured. Another ship and grain warehouses were also damaged.

Russia, China, Iran hold joint naval drills in Gulf of Oman	China, Iran, and Russia conducted joint naval drills on March 11 in the Gulf of Oman, Iran&apos;s state-affiliated Tasnim news agency reported. The exercises, named Maritime Security Belt 2025, were held near the strategic Strait of Hormuz, a key global shipping route through which a fifth of the world&apos;s traded crude oil passes. China, Iran, and Russia have maintained close ties, with Beijing and Tehran supporting Moscow&apos;s war effort despite Western sanctions. The latest drills come as Russia deepens military cooperation with Iran, which has supplied Moscow with thousands of Shahed attack drones used in strikes against Ukraine. China has become Russia&apos;s largest supplier of dual-use goods &#x2014; components that can be used in weapons production. The three countries have carried out similar exercises in past years, including in 2023 and 2024. The latest joint drills highlight ongoing coordination between the three authoritarian regimes as divisions grow in the West over U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s foreign policy shifts, including reduced military commitments in Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-china-iran-hold-joint-naval-drills-in-gulf-of-oman/	2025-03-11T23:39:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1248343324.jpeg
30-day ceasefire 'not a frozen conflict,' Ukraine's FM says	A 30-day ceasefire plan agreed upon between the U.S. and Ukraine &quot;is not a frozen conflict&quot; but the &quot;beginning of the path toward a just peace,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on March 11. Kyiv agreed to the temporary ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia abides by it. The talks in Saudi Arabia also led to the U.S. restarting key military and intelligence support for Ukraine. &quot;Ukraine is not an obstacle to peace; it is a partner in restoring it,&quot; said Sybiha, who was present at the talks. Ukraine&apos;s agreeing to the proposed truce demonstrates &quot;who is really interested in peace,&quot; he added. The deal is a surprising turnaround for Kyiv. Ukrainian officials have often warned about the dangers of a temporary pause in the fighting, arguing that it will provide Russia with a chance to recover strength and launch further attacks. &quot;The U.S. side will now talk to Russia about its willingness or unwillingness to end the war,&quot; Sybiha noted. In the past, Russia has also ruled out a temporary ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. Russian nationalist voices and pro-war bloggers have already spoken out against the U.S.-backed proposal. U.S. President Donald Trump said that Washington would seek to engage Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin this week to discuss the plan. &quot;It takes two for tango, as I have already said, so I hope he (Putin) will also agree as well, and I really think that would be 75% of the way, the rest is getting it documented,&quot; Trump said on March 11. &quot;We will have a big meeting with Russia tomorrow.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-proposed-ceasefire-not-a-frozen-conflict-ukraines-fm-says/	2025-03-11T23:23:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/483793538_1183688763331503_7338987230649715978_n.jpg

Iceland allocates over $2 million to support Ukrainian energy sector	Iceland will allocate over 2 million euros ($2.17 million) to Ukraine&apos;s Energy Support Fund, the Ministry of Energy reported on March 11. This will bring Iceland&#x2019;s total contributions to Ukraine&#x2019;s energy sector to more than 5.6 million euros ($6.09 million) thus far. According to Ukraine&apos;s Energy Ministry, Iceland made four tranches of contributions between 2023 and 2024. The funds have been used to buy equipment for energy companies in Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions. Herman Halushchenko, Ukraine&#x2019;s Energy Minister, stressed the importance of contributions like these for returning light and heat to the homes of Ukrainians, and for restoring infrastructure that was damaged by Russian attacks. &#x201C;Each contribution of partners to the Energy Support Fund of Ukraine is extremely important,&#x201D; Halushchenko said. &#x201C;We are grateful to Iceland for its support and another contribution to Ukraine&apos;s energy sustainability.&#x201D; The Icelandic parliament, Althing, adopted a resolution on long-term assistance for Ukraine from 2024 to 2028. The resolution aims to support the independence, sovereignty, borders, the safety of civilians, humanitarian aid, and reconstruction work in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/iceland-allocates-over-2-million-to-support-ukrainian-energy-sector/	2025-03-11T22:03:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-549681041.jpg
Von der Leyen welcomes US, Ukraine talks and reaffirms EU support	European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the results of Ukraine&#x2019;s talks with the U.S. in Jeddah, on March 11, and reaffirmed the EU&#x2019;s support. She praised the resumption of U.S. military assistance and intelligence sharing, as well as the initiation of a peace agreement proposal. &#x201C;This is a positive development that can be a step towards a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for Ukraine,&#x201D; von der Leyen said on X. She also added that the EU is looking forward to participating in the negotiation process. &#x201C;The EU is ready to play its full part, together with its partners, in the upcoming peace negotiations,&#x201D; she said. Ukrainian and U.S. delegates met in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11, in which the U.S. delegation proposed a 30-day complete ceasefire, pending Russia&#x2019;s agreement. The ceasefire proposal, along with the U.S. resuming military aid and intelligence sharing, were two major developments during the talks. Along with these topics, the delegations also discussed humanitarian efforts in achieving peace, including the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of detained civilians, and the return of forcibly displaced Ukrainian children.	https://kyivindependent.com/von-der-leyen-welcomes-us-ukraine-talks-and-reaffirms-eu-support/	2025-03-11T20:35:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1258844481.jpg
Russian attacks on Donetsk Oblast kill 4, injure 5	Russian troops launched a series of attacks on March 11 against Donetsk Oblast, killing at least four civilians and injuring five, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Two brothers, aged 11 and 13, were among those killed in the attacks. Additionally, two women, aged 51 and 57, died of severe injuries. Russian forces used FPV drones, artillery, and bombs to carry out the attacks in multiple settlements and cities of Donetsk Oblast, including Rivne village Molocharska village, Pokrovsk, and Rodynske. Some of the injured civilians are under serious condition, including a 14-year old child.

Poland ready to receive American aid for Ukraine	Poland is prepared to resume the transport of American aid to Ukraine through its territory, according to Minister of National Defense Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz. His comments followed the recent developments in the U.S.-Ukraine talks, including the March 11 decision to lift the suspension on intelligence sharing and military aid. The U.S. has suspended military aid and intelligence to Ukraine after a meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance in the White House that ended in a heated argument. Kosiniak-Kamysz expressed readiness to activate Poland&#x2019;s Jasionka hub, maintaining full operational capabilities for American support. In a TVN24 interview, Kosiniak-Kamysz acknowledged that, after several days of stalled negotiations, a return to talks was a crucial and positive step. &quot;We have to take this at face value, as an important step in returning to talks,&quot; he said. &quot;We are fully prepared to resume American support,&quot; the minister said. Kosiniak-Kamysz emphasized the importance of this development, adding that Trump could now test whether Russia&#x2019;s previous declarations were genuine or merely an attempt to undermine Western unity and solidarity with Ukraine. He noted that, despite the positive signal from the resumption of talks, it was still crucial to approach the situation cautiously.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-ready-to-receive-american-aid-for-ukraine/	2025-03-11T18:18:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161798255.jpg
Trump will talk to Putin soon as Russia flags possible contact with US in coming days	Russia said on March 11 it may engage in talks with the United States in the coming days, following U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s statement that he might speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week. &quot;We do not rule out contacts with U.S. representatives within the next few days,&quot; Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told state news agencies. After Kyiv signaled its willingness to accept Washington&apos;s proposal for an immediate, temporary 30-day ceasefire, extendable by mutual agreement, Trump emphasized the need to engage with Russia, expressing hope that Putin would also agree and that negotiations could move forward. &quot;For tango, it takes two, as I have already said, so I hope he (Putin) will agree as well, and I really think that would be 75% of the way, the rest is just paperwork,&quot; Trump said. &quot;Ukraine has agreed to it, and hopefully Russia will agree to it. We&apos;re going to meet with them later on, today and tomorrow, and hopefully, we&apos;ll be able to wipe out a deal. But I think the ceasefire is very important. If we can get Russia to do it, that&apos;ll be great. If we can&apos;t, we just keep going on, and people are going to get killed, lots of people,&quot; Trump told reporters at the White House. Cease-fire negotiations gained fresh momentum during talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, after previously stalling following a heated confrontation between the Ukrainian and U.S. presidents at the White House. In the wake of that tense exchange, the Trump administration had halted all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. The joint statement issued on March 11 marked a significant development, coming just hours after Russian officials reported that Ukrainian drones had launched the largest attack on Moscow since the war began. The United States agreed to lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine, Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office announced following the meetings.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-will-talk-to-putin-soon-as-russia-flags-possible-contact-with-us-in-coming-days/	2025-03-11T17:41:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183214747.jpg
US restores Ukraine aid following breakthrough talks, senior Ukrainian official says	The United States has resumed security assistance to Ukraine following high-level talks in Saudi Arabia, Deputy Head of the Presidential Office Pavlo Palisa announced on March 11. &quot;I have confirmation that security assistance from the U.S. has been resumed. The agreements are being implemented. The fight continues!&quot; Palisa wrote on Facebook. The announcement follows a meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian delegations in Jeddah, where the two sides sought to find common ground after weeks of strained relations. As one of the key outcomes of the talks, Kyiv confirmed its readiness to accept Washington&#x2019;s proposal for an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, provided that Russia agrees to the terms and implements them simultaneously. Tensions between Ukraine and the U.S. had escalated following a contentious meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Feb. 28. The heated exchange led to a freeze in military and intelligence support from the U.S., raising concerns in Kyiv about America&#x2019;s commitment to Ukraine&#x2019;s defense. The joint statement issued after the Jeddah meeting reaffirmed Ukraine&#x2019;s conditional support for the U.S.-proposed ceasefire, which could be extended beyond 30 days if all parties agree. &quot;The American side understands our arguments and accepts our proposals, I would like to thank President Trump for the constructive nature of the dialogue between our teams,&quot; Zelensky said following the meeting.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-restores-ukraine-aid-following-breakthrough-talks-senior-ukrainian-official-says/	2025-03-11T16:12:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/DSCF7967.jpg
Macron rallies Europe to back Ukraine following ceasefire talks, Le Monde reports	French President Emmanuel Macron urged European and NATO military leaders on March 11 to develop a concrete plan for &quot;credible security guarantees&quot; for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. Speaking at a closed-door meeting in Paris with military chiefs from more than 30 allied nations, Macron emphasized that Europe must &quot;throw its full weight behind Ukraine, and itself,&quot; according to Le Monde. His appeal followed Ukraine&#x2019;s endorsement of a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire and agreement to negotiations with Russia in Jeddah. The meeting included representatives from 34 countries, including Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, but no U.S. officials were present. Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer have taken the lead in forming a &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; to enforce an eventual ceasefire in Ukraine. The French presidency reported that military leaders from European and NATO countries, including the U.K. and Turkey, agreed that security guarantees for Ukraine &quot;should not be separated from NATO and its capabilities.&quot; These guarantees must be &quot;credible and long-term&quot; and should be paired with &quot;unfailing support for the Ukrainian army.&quot; French Defense Minister S&#xE9;bastien Lecornu underscored the importance of planning for Ukraine&apos;s future military needs, adding that: &quot;We will reject any form of demilitarisation of Ukraine.&quot; Concerns over Washington&apos;s shifting stance on Russia and Ukraine have fueled Europe&apos;s push to strengthen its own defenses. Trump&#x2019;s earlier decision to suspend military aid and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, along with his renewed negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, has raised fears that the U.S. may pressure Ukraine into a settlement favoring Russia. European leaders are scrambling to ensure that Ukraine&#x2019;s security does not become a bargaining chip in U.S.-Russia talks. &quot;It is simply a question of looking ahead and thinking about what the Ukrainian army should be in the future,&quot; Lecornu said. Following the military chiefs&#x2019; meeting, defense ministers from Europe&#x2019;s five largest military powers&#x2014;France, the U.K., Germany, Italy, and Poland&#x2014;are set to gather in Paris on March 12. EU and NATO representatives, as well as Ukraine&#x2019;s defense minister, will also take part in discussions focused on &quot;the necessary rearmament of Europe&quot; and continued military support for Kyiv. Macron has also scheduled talks with defense manufacturers later this week to push for increased weapons production, aligning with his call for France to switch to &quot;war economy mode.&quot; Starmer, meanwhile, will host virtual talks on March 15 with leaders of nations willing to back Ukraine&#x2019;s defense. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen recently announced a plan to mobilize approximately 800 billion euro ($843 billion) to strengthen European defense and provide &quot;immediate&quot; military support for Ukraine. France has also pledged to raise its defense spending to around &#x20AC;100 billion annually, doubling the planned 50.5 billion euro for 2025. Turkey, which has NATO&#x2019;s second-largest army, is positioning itself as a key player in regional security. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has backed Ukraine&#x2019;s calls for an aerial and naval truce, signaling his country&#x2019;s readiness to play a leading role in Europe&apos;s evolving security strategy.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-rallies-europe-to-back-ukraine-following-ceasefire-talks/	2025-03-11T15:38:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1977990485.jpg
If Russia refuses, we should sanction the hell out of them' — Trump, Sen. Graham, hope Putin agrees to ceasefire	U.S. President Donald Trump hailed Ukraine&apos;s agreement to a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire on March 11 as a significant step forward to a &quot;total ceasefire.&quot; Speaking to reporters at the White House following the announcements from Jeddah, Trump said the focus now shifts to Russia, urging President Vladimir Putin to accept the truce. &quot;Now we have to go to Russia and hopefully President Putin will agree to that also. And we can get this show on the road,&quot; he said. Trump added that if Russia refuses, the war will continue, leading to further loss of life. Trump confirmed that U.S. officials would meet with Russian representatives in the coming days to discuss the ceasefire. He also indicated he expects to speak with Putin later this week, emphasizing, &quot;It takes two to tango.&quot; Senator Lindsey Graham also praised Ukraine&apos;s decision to back the ceasefire, applauding the Trump administration&#x2019;s role in brokering the agreement. I am very encouraged to hear that Ukraine has agreed to the United States&#x2019; proposal for a 30-day ceasefire. Well done to the Trump Team.I hope Russia will follow.

Well done to the Trump Team,&quot; he said. Graham also issued a stark warning: &quot;I hope Russia will follow. If Russia refuses, we should sanction the hell out of them.&quot; Graham vowed to introduce new congressional sanctions targeting Russia and nations that continue to buy Russian goods, including oil, gas, and uranium. &quot;It is long overdue for Russia to feel overwhelming economic pain as a result of their brutal invasion of Ukraine,&quot; he said. Trump also told reported that Zelensky is welcome back to the White House after their tense meeting in the Oval Office last month. The Feb. 28 meeting had ended in controversy after Trump and Vice President JD Vance criticized Zelensky, accusing him of being disrespectful when he questioned whether Putin could be trusted in negotiations. The disagreement led to a heated exchange, and Zelensky left the White House abruptly, canceling a planned joint press conference with Trump and leaving a critical minerals agreement unsigned. Trump has since expressed mixed views on Ukraine&#x2019;s priorities, ruling out its NATO membership and falsely suggesting that Ukraine started the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/if-russia-refuses-we-should-sanction-the-hell-out-of-them-trump-sen-graham-hope-putin-agrees-to-ceasefire/	2025-03-11T14:31:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2147873245.jpg
Ball is in their court' — Rubio on Russia's move toward ceasefire with Ukraine	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio voiced hope on March 11 that Russia would accept the proposal for a temporary ceasefire with Ukraine. &quot;The ball is in their court,&quot; Rubio said during a press conference following the talks with Ukraine in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. After the negotiations with Washington, Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office announced that it was ready to accept the U.S. proposal for a temporary 30-day ceasefire if Russia also complied with the agreement. Rubio noted that if the Kremlin rejects the ceasefire proposal, &quot;then we&apos;ll, unfortunately, know what the impediment is to peace here.&quot; &quot;Ukraine is ready to stop shooting and start talking,&quot; Rubio said, adding that U.S. President Donald Trump has been clear that he wants to stop the war swiftly. Asked about the deadline for the &#x441;onclusion of a truce agreement, Rubio said Washington hopes to do it &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; During the talks, the Ukrainian delegation proposed to implement a partial truce in the sky and at sea, while the U.S. side wanted &quot;to try to do more,&quot; a source close to the Presidential Office told the Kyiv Independent. Russia&apos;s stance toward a partial ceasefire is unclear, the source added. Moscow has repeatedly rejected freezing hostilities along the current front line, believing it has the upper hand on the battlefield. &quot;Within a certain period of time, we will prepare a final agreement on how to end the war. Now, the discussions concern only the first steps,&quot; the source said. Ways to enforce a possible ceasefire also remain uncertain. Kyiv has previously emphasized that firm security guarantees from the U.S. and other partners should be a key part of any cessation of hostilities, arguing that Russia has repeatedly violated multiple ceasefires since the start of its aggression in 2014.	https://kyivindependent.com/ball-is-in-their-court-rubio-on-russias-move-toward-ceasefire-with-ukraine/	2025-03-11T13:26:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193483462.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine is ready for temporary ceasefire if Russia sticks to it; US to restore security, intelligence assistance to Ukraine	Key developments on March 11: Kyiv is ready to accept Washington&apos;s proposal to immediately implement a temporary, 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement, the Presidential Office announced on March 11 after the talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine is ready to take such a step only if Russia adheres to the terms of the ceasefire in the same way. &quot;Ukrainian proposal for this meeting with the Americans was three things: ceasefire in the sky &#x2014; missiles, bombs, long-range drones &#x2014; and ceasefire at sea, as well as measures to establish trust to this process, first of all &#x2013; the release of prisoners,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said following the meeting. &quot;The American side understands our arguments, accepts our proposals, I want to thank President (Donald) Trump for the constructiveness of our teams&apos; conversation,&quot; he added. And today, there was a proposal from the American side to take the first step right away and attempt to establish a complete ceasefire for 30 days, not only regarding missiles, drones, and bombs, not only in the Black Sea but also along the entire front line,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Ukraine accepts this proposal.&quot; Zelensky added that the U.S. &quot;must convince Russia&quot; to abide by it. The president added that as part of the deal, the U.S. agreed to resume intelligence sharing with Ukraine. During the talks, the Ukrainian delegation proposed to implement a partial truce in the sky and at sea, while the U.S. side wanted &quot;to try to do more,&quot; a source close to the Presidential Office told the Kyiv Independent. Russia&apos;s stance toward a partial ceasefire is unclear, the source added. Moscow has repeatedly rejected freezing hostilities along the current front line, believing it has the upper hand on the battlefield. &quot;Within a certain period, we will prepare a final agreement on how to end the war. Now, the discussions concern only the first steps,&quot; the source said. The United States will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine, Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office announced on March 11.The U.S. has suspended military aid and intelligence to Ukraine after a meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance in the White House that ended in a heated argument. The freeze on military aid has drawn criticism even from members of Trump&apos;s own party. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said that pulling aid from Ukraine in the midst of Russia&apos;s war would &quot;be worse than Afghanistan.&quot; U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz confirmed during a joint press conference in Jeddah that Washington will continue to provide military assistance to Ukraine under the so-called Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) program. The delegations also discussed the essential role of humanitarian efforts in achieving peace, including the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of detained civilians and the return of forcibly displaced Ukrainian children.The delegates will determine the composition of their negotiating teams to begin further negotiations to achieve a sustainable peace that will ensure Ukraine&apos;s long-term security, the Presidential Office&apos;s statement read. Ukrainian forces successfully attacked the Moscow Oil Refinery and a Druzhba oil pipeline facility in Oryol Oblast overnight on March 11, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. The statement comes after Russia claimed to have downed over 330 Ukrainian drones in the Moscow, Oryol, and eight other oblasts in a massive drone strike. The attack was carried out by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces in cooperation with the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and military intelligence (HUR), the General Staff said. The operation &quot;struck a number of Russian strategic objects, enabling armed aggression against Ukraine,&quot; the military said. Ukraine has repeatedly targeted industrial and military facilities in Russia&apos;s rear to undermine Moscow&apos;s ability to wage its war. Multiple hits were recorded at the Moscow Oil Refinery, which is capable of processing 11 million metric tons of oil per year and covers 40-50% of Moscow&apos;s gasoline and diesel supplies, according to the statement. Explosions were also reported at the Stalnoy Kon fuel facility in Oryol Oblast. This facility is a key part of the Druzhba oil pipeline infrastructure and ensures oil supplies to the Ust-Luga port in Leningrad Oblast. The facility lies around 170 kilometers (100 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its forces had intercepted a massive strike of 337 Ukrainian drones across multiple regions, including 91 over Moscow Oblast, 126 over Kursk Oblast, 38 over Bryansk Oblast, eight over Oryol Oblast, and others over the Belgorod, Ryazan, Kaluga, Lipetsk, Voronezh, and Nizhny Novgorod regions. This would mark Ukraine&apos;s most extensive drone strike against Moscow and Russia throughout the full-scale war. Russian officials did not report hits against any strategic targets but claimed that civilian sites were damaged across Moscow Oblast. Three people were allegedly killed by drone debris, while 18 were wounded, Moscow claims. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The Ukrainian military said it has &quot;detailed information about the strategic facilities&quot; enabling Russian aggression and &quot;adheres to the norms of international humanitarian law and takes measures to protect the civilian population as much as possible.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin remains unwilling to compromise in peace talks, complicating U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s efforts to secure a settlement, Bloomberg reported on March 10, citing undisclosed Western security officials. Putin has deliberately set &quot;maximalist&quot; demands on territory, peacekeepers, and Ukraine&apos;s neutrality, knowing they will likely be unacceptable to Kyiv and European nations, the outlet wrote. In June 2024, Putin insisted Ukraine must withdraw from the four partially occupied regions &#x2014; Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia &#x2014; as a precondition for negotiations. Despite Trump&apos;s claim on Feb. 24 that Putin would allow European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a deal, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has rejected the idea. Putin, according to Western officials, is prepared to continue the war if his conditions are not met, raising doubts about his seriousness regarding a settlement. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed the claims in a comment for Bloomberg, insisting that Russia remains open to diplomatic negotiations. &quot;Russia is open for peace efforts and prefers to reach our goals through peaceful and diplomatic means,&quot; he told Bloomberg. Russian forces have recaptured 12 settlements and 100 square kilometers (40 square miles) in Kursk Oblast previously held by Ukrainian troops, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on March 11. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. The statement comes after Moscow launched a new offensive in the Russian border region, reportedly achieving a breakthrough south of the key town of Sudzha in an effort to encircle the Ukrainian salient. Russia recaptured the settlements of Agronom, Bogdanovka, Bondarevka, Dmitryukov, Zazulevka, Ivashkovsky, Kolmakov, Kubatkin, Martynovka, Mikhailovka, Pravda, and Yuzhny in recent military operations, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. The DeepState monitoring group confirmed significant territorial losses on Ukraine&apos;s part in Kursk Oblast since Russia launched its offensive last week. The extent of the Ukrainian salient in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast as of March 10, 2025, according to the DeepState monitoring group. (DeepState/OpenStreet Maps)Russian troops and their North Korean allies have also reportedly begun launching attacks in the Sudzha area. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, claimed that there is currently no threat of encirclement as Ukrainian troops are moving to &quot;favorable defense lines.&quot; Syrskyi added that some of the settlements Russia claims to have retaken &quot;no longer exist&quot; as they have been destroyed by Russian fire. Ukraine&apos;s commander-in-chief added that he had decided to reinforce Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast with &quot;the necessary forces and means,&quot; including electronic warfare and drones. Concerns about the Ukrainian operation in Kursk Oblast, ongoing since August 2024, have mounted over the weekend amid reports of Russian advances. The development came shortly after the U.S. cut off military and intelligence support for Ukraine, allegedly to push Kyiv to the negotiating table.

US, Ukraine to present joint statement summarizing talks in Saudi Arabia, FT reports	The U.S. and Ukraine will present a joint statement on the talks between the states in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Financial Times (FT) reported on March 11. The news comes as the Ukraine-U.S. negotiations on a potential ceasefire in the war with Russia, as well as restoring U.S. military aid and intelligence, continue. The participants also discussed the minerals deal that collapsed on Feb. 28 after a heated argument between President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance. The talks are not scheduled to continue for a second day, FT reported. Ukraine was expected to propose a ceasefire at sea and in the sky and a ban on long-range strikes during the talks with the U.S., according to Suspilne. The official told the media outlet that such a ceasefire would be &quot;easy to install and to monitor.&quot; The Ukrainian delegation includes Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa. The U.S. delegation is led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-ukraine-to-present-joint-statement-summarizing-talks-in-saudi-arabia-ft-reports/	2025-03-11T11:14:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204495001.jpg
Over 50% of Ukrainians think West holds back military aid in fear of Russia losing war	According to a poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) at the request of the Kyiv Independent, 51.2% of Ukrainians believe that Western countries fear that Russia will lose the all-out war against Ukraine and hold off military aid to Kyiv as a result. The survey, commissioned by the Kyiv Independent, was conducted between Feb. 5 and March 10. Two thousand twenty-nine people took part, and the margin of error stands at 2.1%. According to the poll, 17% of respondents completely agreed with this statement, while 34.2% said they would rather agree. Another 21.3% said they would rather disagreed with the statement. The number of those who strongly disagreed stands at 17.7%, the survey showed. The poll was conducted when U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration took a number of steps widely seen as friendly toward Russia. The U.S. froze intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine soon after a heated argument broke out between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House on Feb. 28. U.S. officials have suggested the pause is &quot;temporary,&quot; without indicating when aid will resume. Given Trump&apos;s rhetoric and policy shift, European officials are considering stepping up support for Kyiv. In 2024, when Russia maintained an initiative on the battlefield, taking advantage of delays in defense aid to Ukraine from Western allies, primarily the U.S., Zelensky said that Western countries &quot;are afraid of Russia losing the war&quot; and would like Kyiv &quot;to win in such a way that Russia does not lose.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/over-50-of-ukrainians-think-west-fears-russias-loss-in-war-and-hold-back-military-aid-poll-shows/	2025-03-11T10:38:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1250459616.jpg
Didn't want to endanger his life' — JD Vance on criticism from his cousin who fought in Ukraine	U.S. Vice President JD Vance did not talk publicly about his cousin Nate&apos;s service in Ukraine because he &quot;didn&apos;t want to endanger his life more than it already was,&quot; he told Fox News on March 11. Nate Vance, a former U.S. Marine, defended Ukraine from 2022 to January 2025 as a member of the Da Vinci Wolves First Motorized Battalion, a volunteer unit. Nate Vance harshly criticized U.S. policy regarding Ukraine and condemned the behavior of his cousin and U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28, after which U.S. leaders berated the Ukrainian president for not being &quot;ready for peace&quot; and supposed lack of gratitude. &quot;As far as his criticisms, I have no interest in arguing with him in public, but I do feel the need to address one issue in particular: his failed effort to contact me. I am unsure why Nate felt the need to reach out to my Senate office, rather than to his mom, dad, or sister, all of whom I am in contact with regularly,&quot; JD Vance told Fox News. The vice president added that he &quot;always considered Nate the toughest guy (he) knew&quot; and that he was &quot;always happy to talk to him.&quot; Nate Vance volunteered to fight in Ukraine following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, but left shortly before the U.S. presidential inauguration out of fear of being captured by the Russian army. &quot;It had become complicated to stay. I couldn&apos;t take the risk of being captured,&quot; he said. JD Vance has repeatedly criticized Ukraine and Zelensky in the past, at times repeating Kremlin talking points.	https://kyivindependent.com/didnt-want-to-endanger-his-life-jd-vance-on-criticism-from-his-cousin-former-volunteer-fighter-in-ukraine/	2025-03-11T10:35:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198862659.jpg
France to 'refuse any demilitarization of Ukrainian army,' French defense minister says	France will not accept &quot;any demilitarization of the Ukrainian army,&quot; French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on March 11, The Guardian reported. &quot;Demilitarization&quot; and &quot;denazification&quot; were two insincere excuses that the Kremlin used to invade Ukraine in a war of territorial and ethnocidal aggression in February 2022. The Ukrainian army is &quot;the main guarantee&quot; of Ukraine&apos;s security, Lecornu said in the opening remarks at the Paris Defence and Strategy Forum, which gathered over 30 army chiefs to discuss what Europe and the West can offer in support of Ukraine as part of a peace deal with Russia. The French defense minister added that Europe is facing a &quot;new period&quot; in its history, significantly different from the Cold War and the period of &quot;peace dividends&quot; with several powers fighting for influence. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russia demanded that Ukraine reduce its army to 50,000 personnel. Moscow also sought to ensure that Kyiv &quot;did not develop, produce, purchase, or deploy missile weapons of any kind with a range of over 250 kilometers (156 miles) on its territory.&quot; Ukraine has repeatedly highlighted the need for security guarantees in the event of a ceasefire in the war with Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously stressed the need for a 1.5 million-strong army if Ukraine is not accepted into NATO. The Ukrainian army currently has 880,000 troops, making it the largest in Europe, according to Zelensky.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-to-refuse-any-demilitarisation-of-ukrainian-army-french-dm-says/	2025-03-11T10:31:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1695287073.jpg
Half of Ukrainians say territorial concessions, forfeiting NATO membership in exchange for ending war 'completely unacceptable'	According to a poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) at the request of the Kyiv Independent, 47.1% of Ukrainians consider it &quot;completely unacceptable&quot; to agree to territorial concessions and give up on NATO membership as a prerequisite to ending the war. Only 8.2% said they would &quot;easily agree&quot; to this scenario, while 38.1% of respondents called this option difficult but &quot;generally acceptable.&quot; 6.2% of respondents found it difficult to answer the question, and 0.4% declined to answer. The survey, commissioned by the Kyiv Independent, was conducted between Feb. 5 and March 10. 2,029 people took part, and the margin of error is a maximum of 2.1%. On March 10, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Kyiv would need to make territorial concessions as part of any agreement to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Foreign Ministry said that the country wasn&apos;t officially asked by Washington to agree to territorial concessions. NATO membership has also become increasingly elusive. &quot;You can forget about (NATO membership),&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump previously said. Russian forces continue to occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory. The Ukrainian population under Russian occupation has been subjected to systematic repression, torture, and abuse. President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested that to end the &quot;hot phase of the war,&quot; NATO would have to offer membership to Ukrainian territory under government control, with the invitation recognizing the country&apos;s internationally recognized borders. Bloomberg reported on March 10 that Russian President Vladimir Putin remains unwilling to compromise. Putin has deliberately set &quot;maximalist&quot; demands on territory, peacekeepers, and Ukraine&apos;s neutrality, knowing they will likely be unacceptable to Kyiv and European nations, the outlet wrote.	https://kyivindependent.com/47-of-ukrainians-oppose-to-refuse-from-nato-making-territorial-concession-in-exchange-for-ending-war-poll-shows/	2025-03-11T10:07:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1244707924.jpeg
US to inform Russia of US-Ukraine talks progress in Saudi Arabia, Peskov claims	Moscow is expecting to receive information from Washington on the progress of Ukraine-U.S. negotiations in Saudi Arabia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the Russian news agency Interfax on March 11. Peskov&apos;s statement comes amid the ongoing talks between the American and Ukrainian delegations in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. &quot;Today, there will be U.S.-Ukraine contacts in Jeddah. Somehow, the American side, which is looking for ways to reach a peaceful settlement, will inform us,&quot; Peskov said when asked about the potential meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s Middle East Envoy, Steve Witkoff. Witkoff was also supposed to attend the talks between Washington and Kyiv in Saudi Arabia but missed them. Multiple media outlets reported that Witkoff plans to travel to Moscow for a meeting with Putin. The reported trip to Moscow will follow the March 11 discussions between Ukrainian and U.S. officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Witkoff will join U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz on the American side. Despite being Trump&apos;s envoy for the Middle East, Witkoff has emerged as a leading figure in negotiations regarding Russia and Ukraine. On Feb. 18, he participated in talks with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia, which were held without Ukraine&apos;s participation.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-expecting-us-to-provide-information-on-talks-with-ukraine-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-03-11T08:47:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245735181.jpeg

Oil shipments via Druzhba pipeline halted due to Ukrainian drone attack in Russia, Hungary says	Oil supplies through the Druzhba pipeline from Russia to Hungary are halted due to a Ukrainian drone attack on a metering station on Russian territory, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on March 11 on Facebook. The Druzhba pipeline, one of the world&apos;s largest with a capacity of 2 million barrels per day (bpd), is a critical conduit for oil from Russian fields to European refineries. Hungary imports most of its crude oil via the Druzhba pipeline. Ukrainian forces reportedly struck the Druzhba pipeline in Russia&apos;s Oryol Oblast on March 11. Following the attack, Szijjarto said that the oil supply was halted. &quot;Due to the drone attack last night, crude shipments had to be suspended on the Druzhba oil pipeline to Hungary,&quot; Szijjarto said. &quot;I have just talked to the energy minister of Russia, who told me that due to the attack, shipments are not possible now, but works are underway, and if nothing extraordinary happens, then late afternoon or in the early evening, crude shipments to Hungary can resume,&quot; he added. The foreign minister called Ukraine to refrain from attacking the energy infrastructure supplying Hungary, as &quot;Hungary&apos;s energy supply is a matter of sovereignty.&quot; The EU has largely phased out Russian oil imports following Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. However, the Druzhba pipeline&apos;s southern branch remains active under exemptions for certain Central European countries. The northern branch primarily transports Kazakh crude oil to Germany via Poland&apos;s Gdansk port, as Poland ceased importing Russian pipeline oil in early 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/oil-shipments-via-druzhba-pipeline-halted-due-to-ukraines-attack-hungary-says/	2025-03-11T07:58:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--7-.jpg
White House lists Saudi talks with Ukraine, Russia in Trump's first 50 days achievements	The White House has listed the negotiations in Saudi Arabia with Ukraine and Russia as one of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s key achievements on his 50th day in office on March 10. &quot;President Trump has brought Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table through historic peace talks in Saudi Arabia in pursuit of peace,&quot; the statement reads. U.S. officials met with Russian representatives in Riyadh on Feb. 18 and in Istanbul on Feb. 27 to discuss restoring bilateral relations and preliminary peace talks, excluding Ukraine. These discussions were followed by a Ukraine-U.S. meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11. Trump&apos;s overtures to Russia have raised concerns in Kyiv and Europe that the U.S. is sidelining its allies in pursuit of a swift settlement. Tensions between Kyiv and Washington have only escalated after Trump&apos;s heated exchange with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. Trump subsequently froze all U.S. military aid and restricted intelligence sharing with Ukraine, aiming to pressure Kyiv into peace talks. Meeting U.S. delegates in Saudi Arabia, Ukrainian officials are expected to push for the resumption of U.S. support while proposing a ceasefire in the air and at sea as a first step toward a broader peace agreement. Trump said earlier that he is considering imposing sweeping banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and peace deal are reached. The U.S. president claimed his position is based on the fact that Russia is &quot;absolutely pounding&quot; Ukraine, likely referring to Russian advances in Kursk Oblast or the large-scale missile and drone attack on March 7.	https://kyivindependent.com/white-house-highlights-saudi-negotiations-as-trumps-50-first-days-achievement/	2025-03-11T06:39:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2089735306.jpg
Putin unwilling to compromise on Ukraine, sets maximalist demands, Bloomberg reports	Russian President Vladimir Putin remains unwilling to compromise in peace talks, complicating U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s efforts to secure a settlement, Bloomberg reported on March 10, citing undisclosed Western security officials. Putin has deliberately set &quot;maximalist&quot; demands on territory, peacekeepers, and Ukraine&apos;s neutrality, knowing they will likely be unacceptable to Kyiv and European nations, the outlet wrote. In June 2024, Putin insisted Ukraine must withdraw from the four partially occupied regions &#x2014; Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia &#x2014; as a precondition for negotiations. Despite Trump&apos;s claim on Feb. 24 that Putin would allow European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a deal, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has rejected the idea. Putin, according to Western officials, is prepared to continue the war if his conditions are not met, raising doubts about his seriousness regarding a settlement. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed the claims in a comment for Bloomberg, insisting that Russia remains open to diplomatic negotiations. &quot;Russia is open for peace efforts and prefers to reach our goals through peaceful and diplomatic means,&quot; he told Bloomberg. Trump has repeatedly promised a swift end to the war, but efforts toward a deal were derailed after his Feb. 28 confrontation with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House. Following the meeting, Trump halted U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine to pressure Kyiv into negotiations. Ukrainian and U.S. delegations are meeting in Jeddah on March 11 for key discussions that could shape Washington&apos;s future support for Kyiv. Ukrainian officials are reportedly expected to push for the resumption of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing while proposing a ceasefire in the air and at sea as a potential first step toward a peace agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-unwilling-to-compromise-in-peace-talks-setting-maximalist-demands/	2025-03-11T05:53:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1000100420.jpg
Ukraine targets Russian oil facilities in Moscow, Oryol oblasts in mass strike overnight, military claims	Ukrainian forces successfully attacked the Moscow Oil Refinery and a Druzhba oil pipeline facility in Oryol Oblast overnight on March 11, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. The statement comes after Russia claimed to have downed over 330 Ukrainian drones in the Moscow, Oryol, and eight other oblasts in a massive drone strike. The attack was carried out by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces in cooperation with the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and military intelligence (HUR), the General Staff said. The operation &quot;struck a number of Russian strategic objects, enabling armed aggression against Ukraine,&quot; the military said. Ukraine has repeatedly targeted industrial and military facilities in Russia&apos;s rear to undermine Moscow&apos;s ability to wage its war. Multiple hits were recorded at the Moscow Oil Refinery, which is capable of processing 11 million metric tons of oil per year and covers 40-50% of Moscow&apos;s gasoline and diesel supplies, according to the statement. Explosions were also reported at the Stalnoy Kon fuel facility in Oryol Oblast. This facility is a key part of the Druzhba oil pipeline infrastructure and ensures oil supplies to the Ust-Luga port in Leningrad Oblast. The facility lies around 170 kilometers (100 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its forces had intercepted a massive strike of 337 Ukrainian drones across multiple regions, including 91 over Moscow Oblast, 126 over Kursk Oblast, 38 over Bryansk Oblast, eight over Oryol Oblast, and others over the Belgorod, Ryazan, Kaluga, Lipetsk, Voronezh, and Nizhny Novgorod regions. This would mark Ukraine&apos;s most extensive drone strike against Moscow and Russia throughout the full-scale war. Russian officials did not report hits against any strategic targets but claimed that civilian sites were damaged across Moscow Oblast. Three people were allegedly killed by drone debris, while 18 were wounded, Moscow claims. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The Ukrainian military said it has &quot;detailed information about the strategic facilities&quot; enabling Russian aggression and &quot;adheres to the norms of international humanitarian law and takes measures to protect the civilian population as much as possible.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-russian-oil-facilities-in-moscow-oryol-oblasts-overnight-military-claims/	2025-03-11T05:41:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1211156715.jpg
OSCE Secretary General visits Moscow, shown aftermath of Ukrainian drone strikes, Russia says	Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Secretary General Feridun Sinirlioglu, who visited Moscow on March 11, was shown the aftermath of reported Ukrainian drone attacks. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its air defenses intercepted 337 drones across multiple regions, including 74 shot down near Moscow, marking what seems to be Ukraine&apos;s largest drone attack during the full-scale war. Russia itself continues daily attacks on Ukraine with missiles, drones, and guided bombs. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported intercepting 79 of the 126 Russian drones launched overnight on March 11, along with one Iskander-M ballistic missile. Russian officials claimed that three people were killed in Moscow Oblast, including a security guard in Domodedovo and two men who later died in the hospital. Eighteen others, including three children, were injured, according to Russia&apos;s Health Ministry. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the OSCE chief witnessed the damage firsthand, writing on Telegram, &quot;It is impossible to deny the obvious, especially what we have seen with our own eyes.&quot; Meanwhile, Andrey Kartapolov, head of Russia&apos;s State Duma Defense Committee, called for retaliatory strikes on Ukraine using the Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile. The strikes occurred just as Ukrainian and U.S. delegations were set to meet in Saudi Arabia to discuss possible peace terms with Russia. Ukrainian officials reportedly plan to propose a partial truce covering aerial and naval operations, hoping to restore U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing. The OSCE was formed in the 1970s at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which provided a platform for dialogue between the Eastern Bloc and Western Bloc during the Cold War. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov attended the OSCE Ministerial Meeting in Malta in person, the Foreign Ministry announced on Dec. 5.	https://kyivindependent.com/osce-secretary-general-visits-moscow-shown-aftermath-of-ukrainian-drone-strikes/	2025-03-11T05:11:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203925059.jpg
Ceasefire 'has never seemed closer,' Yermak writes but stresses need for security guarantees	Ukraine can achieve lasting peace with U.S. leadership, but this requires increased pressure on Russia and credible security guarantees, Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak wrote in an opinion article published by the Guardian on March 11. &quot;As I arrive in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, a ceasefire in the three-year war the Russian Federation has waged on my country has never seemed closer,&quot; Yermak wrote. Yermak nevertheless stressed that diplomacy alone will not bring about a ceasefire &#x2014; stronger political and financial pressure on Russia is essential to prevent a future resurgence of aggression. &quot;No one wants the current war to end more than our people &#x2014; but a peace must be found that is both just and sustainable,&quot; he added. Yermak outlined key conditions necessary for a sustainable peace, including security guarantees for Ukraine, tougher European sanctions against Russia, and the seizure of Russian frozen assets to support Ukraine. &quot;Europe cannot allow a ceasefire that serves only to allow Russia to rearm, rebuild its forces, and come back for more Ukrainian lands and resources,&quot; he warned. Despite Yermak&apos;s calls for U.S. involvement in security guarantees, President Donald Trump has refused to offer such assurances, saying during his Feb. 28 meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky that Europe should take responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security. Yermak welcomed Europe&apos;s ReArm Europe initiative, which includes up to 150 billion euros ($163 billion) for collective defense spending and an additional 20 billion euros ($21 billion) for Ukraine&apos;s military needs. The official also highlighted the importance of the EU&apos;s recently approved 16th sanctions package of sanctions, which expands export restrictions and targets Russian aluminum imports. The column was published as Ukrainian and U.S. delegates began talks in Jeddah on March 11. The meeting could shape Washington&apos;s future support for Kyiv and efforts to end the war. The Ukrainian delegation includes Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa. The U.S. delegation is led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.	https://kyivindependent.com/lasting-peace-in-ukraine-requires-increased-pressure-on-russia-security-guarantees-yermak-says/	2025-03-11T04:44:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204495015.jpg
Ukrainian serviceman saves stabbing victim in Venice	Editor&apos;s note: The article contains graphic content. A Ukrainian soldier on leave provided first aid to a victim of a stabbing attack in Venice on March 10, saving his life, according to the soldier&apos;s testimony and the Italian media. The incident occurred at 4:37 p.m. on March 10. A young man of a North African origin was stabbed after getting into an altercation with another man in Venice&apos;s historical center, the Corriere del Veneto newspaper reported. The injured man began bleeding and collapsed, while the assailant fled the scene. The vacationing Ukrainian soldier who was passing by aided the victim while other bystanders alerted the authorities, the newspaper wrote. &quot;The boy was lucky that I was nearby with a first aid kit and tourniquets. Otherwise, the s**t would have leaked out by the time the ambulance arrived,&quot; the soldier, who goes by the name Kapitan (Captain) Dvizhukha on social media, wrote. The identity of the victim and the attacker or the motivation behind the attack remain unclear.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-serviceman-saves-stabbing-victim-in-venice/	2025-03-11T04:03:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2161312993--1-.jpg
87% of Ukrainians believe Russia will not stop at occupied territories, survey finds	A vast majority of Ukrainians believe that Russia is determined to destroy Ukraine and will not stop at the territories it currently occupies, according to a survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published on March 11. The survey comes as U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 10 that Ukraine would need to make territorial concessions as part of any agreement to end the war. According to KIIS, 87% of Ukrainians believe that Russia intends to continue its aggression beyond the currently occupied territories. This belief is consistent across all regions, with 80% in the east and south and 89-90% in the west and center agreeing that Moscow will not stop at the current front line. Furthermore, 66% of respondents said that Russia&apos;s ultimate goal is Ukraine&apos;s destruction &#x2014; 28% believe Moscow seeks physical genocide, while 38% say it aims to seize most or all of Ukraine&apos;s territory and eliminate its statehood and national identity. A further 14% believe Russia seeks to occupy all or most of Ukraine and install a puppet government, while 7% think Moscow wants to consolidate control over the partially-occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. The findings align with Russian statements, as Russia&apos;s Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said on Dec. 16, 2024, that Moscow aims to capture the entirety of the four Ukrainian oblasts in 2025. Only 4% of respondents believe that Russia aims to maintain control over its existing territorial gains, and just 3% accept Russia&apos;s claim that it wants to &quot;denazify&quot; and demilitarize Ukraine. The remaining 7% were undecided. The survey was conducted between Feb. 14 and March 4, with 1,029 respondents aged 18 and older interviewed by telephone across all Ukrainian government-controlled regions. The survey results come amid growing concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s push for a swift end to the war could lead to a peace deal on unfavorable terms for Ukraine, potentially leaving it vulnerable to future Russian attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/87-of-ukrainians-believe-russia-will-not-stop-at-occupied-territories-survey-finds/	2025-03-11T03:32:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/kyiv.jpeg
Russian lawmaker proposes Oreshnik strike following Ukraine's mass drone attack	Russia should strike Ukraine using the Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile, said Andrey Kartapolov, head of Russia&#x2019;s State Duma Defense Committee, on March 11. The call for action comes in response to what seems to be the largest Ukrainian drone attack since the start of the full-scale war. &quot;The decision is up to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief (Russian President Vladimir Putin), but I think it would not be unreasonable (to launch the Oreshnik), better even more than one,&#x201D; Kartapolov said, as quoted by Russian state-owned news agency TASS. Kartapolov&#x2019;s comments follow reports from Russia&#x2019;s Defense Ministry that its air defenses intercepted a wave of 337 drones across multiple regions, with 74 reportedly shot down on approach to Moscow. In turn, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported intercepting 79 of the 126 Russian drones and one Iskander-M ballistic missile launched the same night. Russia conducts daily strikes on Ukraine using missiles, drones, and guided bombs. Russia has launched the Oreshnik missile against Ukraine once before, striking Dnipro in November 2024 after Kyiv successfully used U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles to hit a military target on Russian soil. Putin described the Oreshnik strike as a response to Ukraine&#x2019;s use of Western long-range weapons to strike inside Russia. While Putin announced plans for mass production of the Oreshnik, a U.S. official told the Kyiv Independent that Russia likely possessed only a small number of these experimental missiles. Following the November strike, the Moscow Times reported that the Kremlin staged a media blitz around the attack, citing Russian officials who said the campaign was designed to intimidate the West and deter further arms deliveries to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-lawmaker-proposes-oreshnik-icbm-strike-following-ukraines-largest-drone-attack/	2025-03-11T03:04:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2185403348.jpg
Russia claims to recapture 12 Kursk Oblast settlements amid new offensive	Russian forces have recaptured 12 settlements and 100 square kilometers (40 square miles) in Kursk Oblast previously held by Ukrainian troops, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on March 11. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. The statement comes after Moscow launched a new offensive in the Russian border region, reportedly achieving a breakthrough south of the key town of Sudzha in an effort to encircle the Ukrainian salient. Russia recaptured the settlements of Agronom, Bogdanovka, Bondarevka, Dmitryukov, Zazulevka, Ivashkovsky, Kolmakov, Kubatkin, Martynovka, Mikhailovka, Pravda, and Yuzhny in recent military operations, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. The DeepState monitoring group confirmed significant territorial losses on Ukraine&apos;s part in Kursk Oblast since Russia launched its offensive last week. The extent of the Ukrainian salient in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast as of March 10, 2025, according to the DeepState monitoring group. (DeepState/OpenStreet Maps)Russian troops and their North Korean allies have also reportedly begun launching attacks in the Sudzha area. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, claimed that there is currently no threat of encirclement as Ukrainian troops are moving to &quot;favorable defense lines.&quot; Syrskyi added that some of the settlements Russia claims to have retaken &quot;no longer exist&quot; as they have been destroyed by Russian fire. Ukraine&apos;s commander-in-chief added that he had decided to reinforce Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast with &quot;the necessary forces and means,&quot; including electronic warfare and drones. Concerns about the Ukrainian operation in Kursk Oblast, ongoing since August 2024, have mounted over the weekend amid reports of Russian advances. The development came shortly after the U.S. cut off military and intelligence support for Ukraine, allegedly to push Kyiv to the negotiating table.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-to-recapture-12-kursk-oblast-settlements-amid-new-offensive/	2025-03-11T02:55:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167241364.jpg
US 'will not be providing' military aid to Russia, Rubio says	The United States will not provide military aid to Russia, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on March 10 in a curious comment ahead of U.S.-Ukraine talks. Asked whether the Ukrainian delegation would push for renewed military aid during the meeting in Saudi Arabia, Rubio responded, &quot;I can assure you this: We will not be providing military aid to the Russians.&quot; The U.S. has been a key military supporter of Ukraine during the full-scale war. As relations between Kyiv and Washington soured after U.S. President Donald Trump took office, the new administration halted all defense assistance. Regarding the possibility of resuming U.S. military aid to Ukraine, Rubio suggested that the freeze could be lifted if Ukraine committed to peace talks. &quot;I mean, all of that came about because we felt that they were not committed to any sort of peace process or not interested in negotiations,&quot; Rubio said. Ukrainian officials plan to use the Jeddah talks to push for the resumption of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing, Financial Times reported on March 9. U.S. delegates previously held meetings with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 and in Istanbul on Feb. 27, where they discussed restoring bilateral relations and holding preliminary peace talks without Ukraine&#x2019;s participation.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-will-not-be-providing-military-aid-to-russia-rubio-says/	2025-03-11T02:20:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193483462.jpg
BREAKING: Ukraine, US begin key meeting in Saudi Arabia	Ukrainian and U.S. delegates are starting their talks in Jeddah on March 11 in a meeting that will likely have a major impact on Washington&apos;s future support for Kyiv and any effort to end the Russia-Ukraine war. &quot;A meeting of the Ukrainian and American delegations begins in Jeddah,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry announced. The Ukrainian delegation is said to include President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa. The U.S. delegation is led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. The expectations are high as the meeting presents a chance to mend the relations between Kyiv and Washington after a heated exchange between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. Zelensky visited Saudi Arabia on March 10 to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman but will not participate in the talks with U.S. delegates. 0:00/1&#xD7;A Ukrainian delegation, including President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, arrive for talks with U.S. officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11, 2025. (Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry)The televised spat in the White House led to the U.S. suspending all military aid and restricting intelligence support for Ukraine, endangering its ability to resist Russia&apos;s all-out war. Ukrainian officials aim to push for the resumption of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing at the Jeddah talks, the Financial Times reported on March 9. Ukraine will also reportedly propose a ceasefire in the air and at sea as the first step toward a peaceful settlement. While traveling to the meeting, Rubio said that Ukraine would need to make territorial concessions as part of any peaceful settlement. The meeting could also see progress on the minerals deal that has been on hold since the White House clash. &quot;The most important thing that we have to leave here with is a strong sense that Ukraine is prepared to do difficult things, like the Russians are going to have to do difficult things to end this conflict or at least pause it in some way, shape or form,&quot; Rubio told reporters on March 10, according to the New York Times. U.S. officials had previously met with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 and in Istanbul on Feb. 27 to discuss restoring bilateral relations and holding preliminary peace talks without Ukraine&apos;s involvement.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-begin-crucial-meeting-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-03-11T02:03:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204479826.jpg
US has not discussed Russia sanctions relief with EU, Rubio says	The U.S. has not discussed easing sanctions against Russia with the European Union, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on March 10, ahead of a meeting with Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia. Asked whether Washington had engaged in talks with the EU about rolling back sanctions imposed in response to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Rubio said, &quot;We&apos;ve not gotten to that stage.&quot; &quot;Obviously, the Europeans have their own set of sanctions, and we can&apos;t &#x2014; they&apos;ll have to make the decision about what they&apos;re willing to do,&quot; he added. Rubio emphasized that any final resolution to the war would have to involve European leaders &quot;because of their sanctions that they&apos;ve imposed.&quot; The U.S. has the means to increase pressure on Russia if necessary, but Rubio expressed hope that such measures would not be required. On March 7, U.S. President Donald Trump said he is considering imposing additional banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and peace agreement are established. Since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has been subjected to extensive economic sanctions from both the U.S. and the EU. The EU&apos;s sanctions framework includes economic restrictions and a list of over 2,400 individuals and entities subject to asset freezes and travel bans.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-has-not-discussed-russia-sanctions-relief-with-eu-rubio-says/	2025-03-11T01:48:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203802681.jpg
1 killed, 17 injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over past day	At least one person was killed and 17 others injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over the past day, regional officials reported on March 11. Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force intercepted 79 of the 126 Russian drones launched overnight, including Shahed-type attack drones, as well as one Iskander-M ballistic missile. Another 35 drones reportedly disappeared from radars before reaching their targets, likely acting as decoys to overwhelm Ukraine&#x2019;s air defenses. Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare systems, aviation, and mobile fire groups repelled the attack. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian strikes killed one person and injured two in Pokrovsk and injured one in Kostiantynivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Russian shelling and air strikes wounded 11 people in Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. A 61-year-old man was injured in Kharkiv Oblast when a Russian attack drone struck a warehouse roof, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. One civilian was also wounded in Sumy Oblast in a Russian drone strike, the regional military administration said. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, a 79-year-old woman was injured in a Russian attack, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. In Odesa Oblast, a house, a children&#x2019;s toy warehouse, and a fuel tank caught fire in a massive Russian drone assault. Authorities are still clarifying information on casualties, Governor Oleh Kiper said.	https://kyivindependent.com/1-killed-17-injured-in-russian-attacks-against-ukraine-over-past-day/	2025-03-11T01:09:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-11_05-37-11.jpg
Russia's Gazprom faces almost $20 billion in lawsuits from European energy firms	European energy firms have filed lawsuits against Russian energy giant Gazprom totaling 18 billion euros ($19.6 billion) over gas supply cuts, the Moscow Times reported on March 10. The claims stem from Gazprom&apos;s decision to drastically reduce gas deliveries to Europe in 2022 after Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that payments be made in rubles. When European customers refused, Gazprom significantly cut supplies, including through the Nord Stream pipeline. The total amount of claims against Gazprom is nearly equal to its net revenues from gas exports, which include $10 billion from sales to Europe and Turkey, $7 billion from China, and $2 billion from Central Asia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The largest lawsuit was filed by German energy company Uniper, formerly Gazprom&apos;s biggest client in Germany and a co-investor in the Nord Stream 2 project. The company imported 20 billion cubic meters of Russian gas annually and is seeking 14.3 billion euros ($15.5 billion) in damages over losses incurred after Russian supplies were halted. Gazprom has responded with counterclaims in Russian courts, seeking to block legal proceedings outside Russia. The Financial Times reported on March 2 that Matthias Warnig, a former Stasi officer and longtime ally of Putin, has been lobbying the U.S. to support a potential restart of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The pipeline, which was co-financed by five European energy firms, was severely damaged in an apparent sabotage attack in September 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-gazprom-faces-19-5-billion-in-lawsuits-from-european-energy-firms-over-gas-cuts/	2025-03-11T00:38:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1243251198.jpg
Ukrainian delegation on-site ahead of talks with US in Saudi Arabia, Yermak says	A Ukrainian delegation is on-site in Jeddah and preparing for key talks with U.S. officials on how to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine on March 11, Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak said. &quot;Protecting Ukrainian interests, clear vision on how to end the war; we will work effectively with our American partners,&quot; Yermak said on Telegram. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously announced that the Ukrainian delegation would include Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa. Although Zelensky arrived in Saudi Arabia on March 10 for a separate meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, he will not participate in the official negotiations. The U.S. delegation includes Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, and Trump&apos;s special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. The meeting follows heightened tensions between Kyiv and Washington after Zelensky clashed with U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. Shortly after, Washington suspended all military aid to Ukraine, and CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed on March 5 that the U.S. had also halted intelligence sharing, potentially limiting Ukraine&apos;s ability to conduct long-range attacks. Ukrainian officials aim to push for the resumption of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing at the Jeddah talks, Financial Times reported on March 9. According to Suspilne, Ukraine will propose a ceasefire in the air and at sea, along with a ban on long-range strikes, describing it as a step that would be &quot;easy to install and to monitor.&quot; Meanwhile, the U.S. delegation is expected to press Kyiv to accept a partial truce as a foundation for negotiations to end the war, Bloomberg reported on March 10. U.S. officials had previously met with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 and in Istanbul on Feb. 27 to discuss restoring bilateral relations and holding preliminary peace talks without Ukraine&apos;s involvement.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-delegation-preparing-for-talks-with-us-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-03-10T23:47:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1247528162.jpg

Moscow reportedly attacked by largest drone strike in full-scale war	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. Russian air defenses allegedly shot down 69 Ukrainian drones over Moscow overnight on March 11 in what may be the most extensive strike against Russia&apos;s capital during the full-scale war. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claims its forces intercepted 337 drones across multiple regions, including 91 over Moscow Oblast, 126 over Kursk Oblast, and 38 over Bryansk Oblast. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified.	https://kyivindependent.com/moscow-targeted-in-largest-drone-attack-in-war/	2025-03-10T23:02:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-11_06-24-30.jpg
Witkoff to meet Putin in Moscow, media reports	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s Middle East Envoy, Steve Witkoff, plans to travel to Moscow for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the coming days, multiple media outlets reported on March 10, citing sources familiar with the matter. Witkoff previously traveled to Moscow in February for the release of U.S. teacher Marc Fogel from a Russian prison. Witkoff claimed that he spoke directly with Putin for over three hours during his visit. Witkoff is expected to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during an upcoming visit to Moscow, an unnamed source told Bloomberg on March 10. Two people briefed on the plans later confirmed the reports in comments to Reuters. The reported trip to Moscow will follow the March 11 discussions between Ukrainian and U.S. officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Witkoff will join U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz on the American side. There is an &quot;expectation&quot; that the two sides will make &quot;substantial progress&quot; during the talks, Witkoff told Fox News in an interview on March 10. &quot;What&apos;s on the table, what&apos;s important to discuss are obviously security protocols for the Ukrainians, they care about that,&quot; Witkoff said. The talks carry high stakes for Ukraine, as the U.S. has frozen military aid and stopped intelligence sharing with Kyiv. Officials have said the outcome of the talks may determine whether Washington resumes support. Despite being Trump&apos;s envoy for the Middle East, Witkoff has emerged as a leading figure in negotiations regarding Russia and Ukraine. He previously took part in talks with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, held without Ukraine&apos;s participation.	https://kyivindependent.com/witkoff-to-meet-putin-in-moscow-sources-claim/	2025-03-10T22:40:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197640711.jpg
58 drones shot down over Moscow, mayor claims	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Fifty-eight drones were shot down as they approached the city of Moscow in the early hours of March 11, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin claimed. &quot;Emergency services are working at the site of the fallen debris,&quot; Sobyanin said. Eleven drones were shot down over the Ramensky district on the outskirts of Moscow, the mayor claimed. Sobyanin attributed the attack to the Ukrainian military. The Kyiv Independent could not verify Sobyanin&apos;s claims, and Ukraine&apos;s military has not yet commented on the attack. &quot;According to preliminary data, there is no damage or casualties at the site where the debris fell,&quot; Sobyanin said. Domodedovo and Zhukovsky airports in Moscow introduced temporary flight restrictions in response to the drone attack, Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) reported. A residential building was hit in the city of Vidnoye, a suburb of Moscow, local officials claimed. Drones were also shot down over Russia&apos;s Ryazan Oblast and Tula Oblast, according to Russian officials. Ukraine regularly strikes military and industrial targets deep within Russian territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/dozens-of-drones-shot-down-over-moscow-mayor-claims/	2025-03-10T21:50:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2153882832.jpg
Over 30 nations to join Paris talks on Ukraine security	Military officials from over 30 countries will attend discussions in Paris on establishing an international security force for Ukraine, an unnamed French military official told the Associated Press (AP) on March 10. European officials led by the U.K. and France have been developing a &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; to enforce a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. U.S. officials have repeatedly said Europe must bear responsibility for a ceasefire while refusing to offer concrete security guarantees. Representatives from Europe, Asia, and Oceania will meet in person and virtually on March 11, coinciding with a meeting between Ukrainian and U.S. officials on the same day in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine will be represented by a military official in Paris, the French official told the AP, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The U.S. was not invited to the event in an effort to demonstrate to White House officials that Europe can guarantee peace in Ukraine. &quot;It&apos;s not, &apos;This is what we need,&apos;&quot; the official said. &quot;It&#x2019;s more, &apos;What are you bringing to the pot?&apos;&quot; The force could be backed by heavy weaponry and weapons stockpiles that could be quickly delivered to the front line in the event Russia breaks a ceasefire, the official said. The talks will consist of two parts, the source said. In the first part, the U.K. and France will introduce their joint initiative. The second part will involve discussions, giving military officials a chance to share how their countries may contribute to the force. While talks on security guarantees have largely been based in Europe, officials from Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea will participate, the unnamed official said.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-30-nations-will-partake-in-paris-talks-on-ukraine-security/	2025-03-10T21:38:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/UNESCO.jpg
Musk blames X outage on 'massive cyberattack' linked to Ukraine	The social media platform X experienced waves of outages on March 10, which X owner and billionaire CEO Elon Musk attributed to a &quot;massive cyberattack&quot; linked to IP addresses originating in Ukraine. &quot;(W)e&apos;re not sure exactly what happened, but there was a massive cyberattack to try to bring down the ecosystem with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area,&quot; Musk told Fox Business. Musk claimed in a post on X that the attack was carried out &quot;with a lot of resources.&quot; &quot;Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved,&quot; he said. Cybersecurity experts have expressed skepticism of Musk&apos;s claims. Cyberattacks of this type, known as denial of service (DDoS) attacks, can be carried out by small groups or individual hackers. DDoS attacks direct excessive amounts of traffic at a website in order to overload its servers, often causing disruptions to service. An industry source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters that much of the traffic targeting X could be traced to IP addresses in the U.S., Vietnam, Brazil, and other countries. The amount of traffic coming from Ukraine was &quot;insignificant,&quot; the source said. Musk, who purchased X (then Twitter) in 2022, has a history of attributing technical glitches to cyberattacks. He also has a history of making inflammatory remarks and amplifying disinformation about Ukraine. .On the same day as the alleged cyberattack, Musk called U.S. Senator Mark Kelly a &quot;traitor&quot; for sharing details of his visit to wartime Ukraine. In his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), established by U.S. President Donald Trump, Musk has spearheaded the slashing of humanitarian aid to Kyiv and called to shut down U.S.-funded media outlets in Ukraine. These outlets are a waste of &quot;taxpayer money,&quot; responsible for &quot;torching&quot; up to a billion dollars in U.S. funds, Musk said. Musk is currently listed as the world&apos;s richest man alive.	https://kyivindependent.com/musk-blames-x-outage-on-massive-cyberattack-linked-to-ukraine/	2025-03-10T21:13:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202898156.jpg
Zelensky apologized to Trump for Oval Office clash, Witkoff claims	President Volodymyr Zelensky apologized for the heated argument in the White House between him and U.S. President Donald Trump, U.S. Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff said in a television interview with Fox News on March 10. Witkoff is part of a U.S. delegation set to meet Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia on March 11 in the first high-level talks between the two nations since the White House clash. &quot;Zelensky sent a letter to the president. He apologized for that whole incident that happened in the Oval Office. I think that was an important step,&quot; Witkoff said. Top White House officials demanded an apology from Zelensky in the aftermath of the Oval Office clash on Feb. 28. Zelensky issued a conciliatory statement on March 4 calling the incident &quot;regrettable&quot; and saying he was ready to work towards peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; It is not clear whether Witkoff was framing that statement as an apology or referencing other communications between Zelensky and Trump. Witkoff also said that there have been ongoing discussions among Ukrainian, U.S., and European officials since the incident, and expressed optimism that the upcoming talks in Saudi Arabia could revive the collapsed minerals deal between Washington and Kyiv. &quot;I would like to describe it as progress ... I would hope that there&apos;s a deal,&quot; Witkoff said. There is an &quot;expectation&quot; that the two sides will make &quot;substantial progress&quot; during the talks, he said. &quot;What&apos;s on the table, what&apos;s important to discuss are obviously security protocols for the Ukrainians, they care about that .... These are not complicated things,&quot; Witkoff said. &quot;They just need to be put on the table and everybody needs to be transparent about what their expectations are. Then we can begin to have a discussion around how we compromise.&quot; Ukrainian-U.S. relations reached a low point following the White House clash, as Washington paused military aid to Kyiv and stopped sharing critical intelligence. Witkoff claimed earlier in the interview that the U.S. had not stopped sharing intelligence needed for defensive purposes. The freeze on military aid has drawn criticism even from members of Trump&apos;s own party. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said that pulling aid from Ukraine in the midst of Russia&apos;s war would &quot;be worse than Afghanistan.&quot; U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that if the Saudi Arabia talks were successful, Washington might resume military aid to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-apologized-for-oval-office-clash-witkoff-says/	2025-03-10T20:15:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199709214.jpg
Zelensky, Saudi crown prince discuss return of POWs, Ukrainian children	President Volodymyr Zelensky held talks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on March 10, ahead of a planned meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian officials, the Presidential Office reported. Zelensky&apos;s team will remain in Jeddah to meet U.S. delegates and discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement with Russia on March 11. Zelensky is not expected to participate in the negotiations. The two leaders discussed Saudi Arabia&apos;s potential role in mediating the release of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) as well as the return of Ukrainian children who were illegally deported to Russia, the Presidential Office said. The Gulf countries have traditionally played the role of mediators between Russia and Ukraine, particularly in regard to prisoner exchanges. Zelensky and bin Salman also discussed possible security guarantees for Ukraine and strategies for bringing about &quot;a just and lasting peace.&quot; Zelensky spoke to the prince about Ukraine&apos;s plans to bolster defense production and the potential for cooperation with Saudi Arabia in this sector. Ukraine is interested in further developing cooperation with Saudi Arabia in the areas of trade and energy, the Presidential Office said. The leaders discussed the potential for future Saudi investments in Ukraine and Riyadh&apos;s contributions to Kyiv&apos;s reconstruction efforts. Zelensky initially intended to visit Saudi Arabia as part of a Middle East tour in February but delayed the trip due to bilateral U.S.-Russian talks in Riyadh on Feb. 18. The Saudi crown prince &#xA0;reportedly wanted Ukraine represented at that meeting, but was overruled by U.S. and Russian officials. The March 11 U.S.-Ukraine talks mark the first high-level meeting between the two nations since Zelensky&apos;s disastrous visit to the White House on Feb. 28. Following the meeting &#x2014;&#xA0;during which U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Zelensky and accused him of being ungrateful &#x2014;&#xA0;Washington froze military aid and paused intelligence sharing with Kyiv. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 10 that a successful meeting in Jeddah could lead to Washington resuming military aid deliveries. Rubio also said that Ukraine would need to agree to territorial concessions as part of a peace deal. Rubio will take part in the Jeddah talks alongside Trump&apos;s Middle East Envoy, Steve Witkoff, and U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. They will meet with Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff, Pavlo Palisa.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-saudi-crown-prince-discuss-return-of-pows-ukrainian-children/	2025-03-10T19:12:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/zel.jpeg
Musk calls Sen. Mark Kelly a 'traitor' over Ukraine trip, Kelly pushes back	Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur and head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), called Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly a &quot;traitor&quot; in a post on X after the senator shared details of his visit to Ukraine. In a thread on March 9, Kelly posted photos from the trip, emphasizing that while everyone wants the war to end, any agreement must protect Ukraine&#x2019;s security and not serve as a concession to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Musk responded directly to the post, accusing Kelly of betrayal. Kelly, a former Navy pilot and astronaut, swiftly replied, criticizing Musk&#x2019;s stance. &quot;Traitor? Elon, if you don&apos;t understand that defending freedom is a basic tenet of what makes America great and keeps us safe, maybe you should leave it to those of us who do,&quot; he wrote on March 10. Speaking to reporters later, Kelly dismissed Musk as &quot;not a serious guy&quot; and suggested he should &#x201C;go back to building rockets&#x201D; rather than engaging in political matters. The senator also accused Musk of prioritizing the interests of billionaires over the American people, pointing to his influence in government policies, including budget cuts affecting veterans&#x2019; services. During his visit to Ukraine, Kelly met with government officials, embassy staff, and military leaders. He described the trip as emotional, stressing the urgency of delivering munitions and intelligence support to Ukrainian forces. &quot;This is existential for them, and again, over the past week or so, we&apos;ve made it harder for them,&quot; he said, referring to recent U.S. policy shifts. Kelly warned that delays in providing military aid would lead to more Ukrainian casualties, adding, &quot;They will stick with us. We stick with them. They will be there for us in the future, no matter what we need.&quot; Musk&#x2019;s comments come amid heightened tensions in U.S.-Ukraine relations, following a contentious Oval Office meeting between President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. &#xA0; The discussion escalated into a heated exchange, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance blaming Zelensky for the war, despite Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. The meeting ended without an agreement that would have granted the U.S. access to Ukraine&#x2019;s mineral resources&#x2014;an arrangement Kyiv had hoped would secure continued American military support. Kelly, along with other Democratic lawmakers, has been vocal in opposing the Trump administration&#x2019;s shift away from strong U.S. backing for Ukraine. &quot;If we abandon our ally Ukraine, we will be viewed by other countries including our other allies as untrustworthy and in the future we shouldn&apos;t expect their help,&quot; he posted on X.	https://kyivindependent.com/musk-calls-sen-mark-kelly-a-traitor-over-ukraine-trip-kelly-pushes-back/	2025-03-10T17:27:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1674560753.jpg
Ukrainian lawmakers propose George Washington monument in Kyiv	A group of Ukrainian lawmakers has proposed erecting a monument in Kyiv to George Washington, the first president of the United States. A draft resolution for the monument was published on the website of Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, on March 10, under the number 3066. While the full text of the resolution has not been disclosed, it has already been submitted for consideration by parliamentary leadership. The initiative was put forward by lawmakers from the ruling Servant of the People party&#x2014;Oleksandr Kovalchuk, Mariia Mezentseva-Fedorenko, Yevheniia Kravchuk, and Halyna Yanchenko&#x2014;as well as independent MP Mykola Tyshchenko, who was expelled from President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s party in 2023. In an interview with the YouTube channel Superposition, Yanchenko emphasized the importance of strengthening ties between Ukraine and the United States rather than damaging them. She suggested that the monument could serve as a symbolic gesture of goodwill. Potential locations for the statue include sites where monuments to Soviet military figures Mykola Vatutin, a Soviet commander during World War II, and Mykola Shchors, a Bolshevik commander during the Russian Civil War, were previously dismantled.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-lawmakers-propose-george-washington-monument-in-kyiv/	2025-03-10T16:56:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2078569904.jpg
Denmark potentially open to sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine	Denmark is prepared to contribute troops if European peacekeeping forces are needed in Ukraine, Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said on March 10. Following a meeting of Denmark&#x2019;s parliament, the ministers said that the government had clarified its stance and received broad support from multiple parties. &quot;It is important that we in Europe send the right signals both to Putin and to Washington. That is what we are doing today by saying: If it comes to the point where a European presence is needed for a ceasefire or peace agreement to be reached, then Denmark is in principle prepared for that,&quot; Rasmussen said, according to Danish Broadcasting Corporation. According to a poll published by the Ritzau news agency on Feb. 21, about 53% of Danes support sending peacekeepers to Ukraine after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war comes to an end. Despite Denmark&#x2019;s readiness, Poulsen emphasized that no concrete plans have been made at this stage. Any potential deployment would depend on future developments. &quot;We have not made a decision to make a concrete effort. It must depend on how things develop. Therefore, this is an expression of timely care,&quot; he explained, highlighting that Denmark&#x2019;s position remains conditional on the evolving situation in Ukraine. Poulsen does not foresee all of NATO-member countries spearheading a peacekeeping mission but expects several individual states to provide security assurances to Ukraine. &quot;Now the initiative has been taken by the French and British sides to form an overview of what could potentially be needed,&quot; he said, noting ongoing discussions about what such a mission might entail. The specifics of Denmark&#x2019;s potential troop contribution remain unclear, as Poulsen indicated it is too soon to determine which soldiers might be deployed. He also stressed that any commitment to Ukraine must not come at the expense of security in the Baltic region.	https://kyivindependent.com/denmark-potentially-open-to-sending-peacekeeping-troops-to-ukraine/	2025-03-10T15:49:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166322485.jpg
UK to host virtual summit on Ukraine on March 15 as peacekeeping plans advance	U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer will host a virtual summit on March 15 to discuss support for Ukraine, following up on a similar meeting held in London earlier this month. Downing Street confirmed the gathering, which will bring together world leaders to assess the prospects for Ukraine and ongoing military assistance. &quot;You can expect the prime minister to host a second leaders&#x2019; meeting of the coalition of the willing, building on his Lancaster House summit,&quot; Starmer&#x2019;s spokesperson told reporters, referring to the March 2 meeting in London. As the U.K. and France continue discussions on forming a peacekeeping force for Ukraine, they remain the only countries to have publicly committed to sending troops. Other nations are expected to contribute either military personnel or other forms of support, though Russia has shown no willingness to accept such a deployment. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has provided little reassurance regarding a potential American security guarantee for Ukraine. Addressing recent comments from Trump, Starmer&#x2019;s spokesperson pushed back against U.S. president&apos;s assertion that Ukraine &quot;may not survive&quot; the war against Russia. &quot;We&#x2019;ve always said that Ukraine, at the other end of this process, must emerge as a sovereign territory,&quot; the spokesperson added, reinforcing the U.K.&apos;s commitment to Ukrainian independence and territorial integrity. Ongoing diplomatic and military talks between the U.K. and France aim to outline the structure and responsibilities of the proposed peacekeeping force. This week, U.K. Defense Minister John Healey and Chief of the Defense Staff Tony Radakin are scheduled to visit France for separate discussions on Ukraine. In addition, Foreign Secretary David Lammy will meet with G7 counterparts in Canada to further coordinate international support for Kyiv. On March 10, Lammy also spoke with U.S. Seceretary of State Marco Rubio and Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minsiter Andrii Sybiha about &quot;how we keep the process for peace moving forward ahead of discussions in Saudi Arabia.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-to-host-virtual-summit-on-ukraine-on-march-15-as-peacekeeping-plans-advance/	2025-03-10T14:34:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200011633.jpg
Despite Russian-backed Georgescu barred from presidential race, Romania's far-right still aim to win	Protests erupted in downtown Bucharest following the Central Electoral Bureau&apos;s decision to ban Russian-backed far-right politician Calin Georgescu from running in the upcoming re-run presidential elections. Georgescu, who is openly supported by the Russian and the U.S. administrations, said this was a &quot;direct hit against democracy.&quot; Following the announcement on March 9, Georgescu&apos;s supporters began setting the streets of Bucharest on fire and throwing bottles, stones, and firecrackers at the police. Riot police used tear gas in response. In November 2024, the relatively unknown Georgescu surprisingly won the first round of the vote. The result was promptly annulled, citing foreign interference in the election process. In connection to the case, Romania expelled the Russian military attache and his deputy for breaching diplomatic rules of conduct. Now, the Central Electoral Bureau cited technical irregularities in Georgescu&apos;s application, as well as the Constitutional Court&apos;s decisions to cancel the previous round of voting and ban another Russian-backed candidate, Diana Sosoaca. Supporters of far-right presidential candidate Calin Georgescu wave the Romanian flag as they face Romanian gendarmes during a protest near the Central Electoral Bureau in Bucharest on March 9, 2025, after the electoral bureau rejected Georgescu&apos;s candidacy for the re-run of last year&apos;s annulled presidential election. (Daniel Mihailescu/AFP via Getty Images)Georgescu said he would appeal, and the Constitutional Court will have the final say on his expulsion from the race. &quot;The decision was inevitable for the health of democracy, but this democracy will need deep repairs after elections in May,&quot; journalist Magda Gradinaru told Kyiv Independent. &quot;Romania&apos;s secret services failed in the final goal of preventing this crisis and they will need to be reformed (as well),&quot; she added. &quot;It is to be seen who will capitalize on Georgescu&apos;s electoral ban and to what extent social tensions can morph into violent social movements,&quot; said Gradinaru. &quot;This was a short-term solution, but the extremist populist platform remains, as does Russian pressure, social resentment, and tension. So this may just be the beginning of a crisis that Romania will have to manage in a complicated geopolitical context,&quot; she added. The leader of the far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) party, George Simion, said on Sunday evening that &quot;those who organized the &apos;coup&apos; should be skinned alive in the public square.&quot; He called on people to take part in protests in support of Georgescu. On Monday morning, Simion claimed his words were a &quot;metaphor,&quot; and he asked supporters to protest peacefully. Georgescu appeared publicly, holding hands with Simion and Anamaria Gavrila, the leader of another Romanian far-right project, Party of Young People (POT).

(Andrei Pungovschi/Getty Images)Georgescu was expelled from AUR in 2022 after being briefly investigated for declarations in support of Romania&apos;s World War II fascist leaders. Now, Georgescu relies on AUR and POT for support. In the December parliamentary elections, AUR secured second place with 18% of the vote, while POT gained 6.5%. Both remained in opposition. &quot;If Simion runs for president, some of the tension created by Georgescu&apos;s ban will be eliminated,&quot; analyst Oana Popescu Zamfir told Kyiv Independent. Romanian protesters take part in an anti-government rally on March 1, 2025 in Bucharest, Romania. Calin Georgescu, a pro-Russian candidate who won the first round of last year&apos;s election that was subsequently cancelled, was questioned by prosecutors earlier this week about the financing of his campaign. (Andrei Pungovschi/Getty Images)According to her, Simion&apos;s recent radical statements are meant to incentivize Georgescu&apos;s supporters to vote for him. &quot;It&apos;s important for Georgescu to explicitly support Simion,&quot; Popescu Zamfir said. Other candidates Georgescu&apos;s electorate may vote for, according to Popescu Zamfir, include former Prime Minister Victor Ponta, former acting President Crin Antonescu, or businessman and politician Gigi Becali. &quot;If Simion does not run, whoever wins the election will have less legitimacy,&quot; Popescu Zamfir said. The ongoing political crisis began last year with Russian meddling in Romania&apos;s elections and the subsequent rise of far-right politicians and their parties. While not making it into the top five according to most opinion polls, Georgescu suddenly took first place following a two-week viral TikTok campaign that involved working with local influencers. The campaign was artificially boosted, with over 66,000 fake TikTok accounts later banned by the platform. Georgescu has been actively promoting conspiracy theories and has been vocally supporting Russia. He called Ukraine a &quot;fictional state&quot; and claimed that the eventual partition of its territories is &quot;inevitable&quot; in an interview published on Jan. 29. The media also found evidence of Georgescu&apos;s links to paramilitary and fascist leaders, such as mercenary Horatiu Potra, who manages a group of soldiers in Congo. On Dec. 8, when the presidential runoff was scheduled to take place, Potra and 20 other people were detained by the police as they were driving to Bucharest carrying weapons and cash. On Feb. 26, the Romanian Prosecutor General&apos;s Office charged Georgescu with &quot;incitement to actions against the constitutional order&quot; and other crimes in a six-count indictment. The charges also included lying about campaign funding and initiating a fascist organization. According to law enforcement, Georgescu used over 1 million euros of undeclared funds and has been involved in neo-legionarism, a Romanian neo-fascist movement that draws its ideology from the country&apos;s Iron Guard militant group active in the run-up to World War II. Georgescu denied any wrongdoing. Supporters of presidential candidate Calin Georgescu cheer outside the Central Electoral Bureau on March 7, 2025 in Bucharest, Romania. (Andrei Pungovschi/Getty Images)On the same day, the Romanian police found dozens of guns, grenades, 25 kilograms of gold, $3.3 million, and 700,000 Romanian Leu ($152,500) in cash in the homes of Potra and his associates. On March 5, Russian military attache Victor Makovskiy and his deputy, Evgeny Ignatiev, were expelled from Romania. The move was connected to Georgescu&apos;s campaign. The next day, six people were arrested for allegedly being part of a military organization attempting to overthrow the government with help from Russia. &quot;These six people are just the visible tip (of the iceberg),&quot; analyst Armand Gosu told Kyiv Independent. &quot;This is the first time Romania openly accuses the Russian Federation of a plot against its state sovereignty.&quot; &quot;They (Russians) can wait years, even decades, that&apos;s why it&apos;s necessary for the Romanian state to neutralize this (entire) network,&quot; Gosu said. According to Popescu Zamfir, &quot;if eliminating the entire network is not possible, at least beheading these groups would avoid further existential threats.&quot; The rise in disinformation and buildup of far-right groups was missed by the government agency set to protect the country from malicious activity from abroad &#x2014; its intelligence. Independent journalist Victor Ilie from the local investigative project Snoop published a series of articles showing how Kremlin-linked creative agencies based in London pump millions of euros to create and promote conspiracy and far-right content in the Romanian digital space. &quot;While Romanians have been mistrustful of Russia, what confuses a part of the Romanian public now is that the U.S., which was considered the country&apos;s main partner, embraced the Russians, and that Georgescu claims that he is not pro-Russian, but pro-American, pro-Trump,&quot; Gosu said. &quot;It&apos;s very hard to explain that the Americans are not what they once were,&quot; he added. &quot;Now Romania is seen as the EU&apos;s weak link that can easily be broken.&quot; However, swift action against Georgescu and his associates showed that Romanian authorities were still eager to fight back. The crisis had also catapulted some new faces that are now set to challenge the far-right at the ballot, among them acting President Ilie Bolojan and Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan, who are gaining popularity.

Ukraine must make concessions in any peace deal, Rubio says	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 10 that Ukraine would need to make territorial concessions as part of any agreement to end the war. Speaking while en route to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for discussions with senior Ukrainian officials, Rubio emphasized the necessity of compromise from both Ukraine and Russia, stressing that difficult decisions would be required on both sides. &quot;The most important thing that we have to leave here with is a strong sense that Ukraine is prepared to do difficult things, like the Russians are going to have to do difficult things to end this conflict or at least pause it in some way, shape or form,&quot; he told reporters, according to the New York Times. Rubio&apos;s remarks came just over a week after a tense White House meeting between President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The meeting resulted in the Trump administration halting military aid to Ukraine due to disagreements over security guarantees in a proposed deal involving Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources. While Rubio did not specify details of a potential agreement, he made it clear that mutual concessions would be key to any diplomatic resolution. Addressing the military situation, Rubio expressed skepticism about a definitive victory for either side. &quot;I think both sides need to come to an understanding that there&#x2019;s no military solution to this situation,&quot; the secretary of state said. &quot;The Russians can&#x2019;t conquer all of Ukraine, and obviously it&#x2019;ll be very difficult for Ukraine in any reasonable time period to sort of force the Russians back all the way to where they were in 2014.&quot; He also noted that determining Russia&#x2019;s willingness to compromise would be a crucial step in future negotiations. Discussions in Jeddah are unlikely to include Trump&#x2019;s earlier proposal, which suggested that U.S. financial interests in Ukrainian natural resources could serve as compensation for American military support. Rubio also clarified that Ukraine&#x2019;s access to Starlink, the satellite internet service provided by Elon Musk&#x2019;s SpaceX, was never under threat. the U.S. still has leverage over Moscow and is attempting to bring Russia to the negotiating table. He also indicated that the resumption of military aid to Ukraine would be a topic of discussion on March 11.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-must-make-concessions-in-any-peace-deal-rubio-says/	2025-03-10T13:55:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203802681.jpg
Ukraine war latest: No threat of encirclement for Ukrainian troops in Russia's Kursk Oblast, Syrskyi says	Key developments on March 10: Ukrainian units are not currently under threat of encirclement in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on March 10. Syrskyi&apos;s statement follows reports on Russian and North Korean troops launching an attack on the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast. Russian forces have made a breakthrough south of the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast, potentially threatening to cut off some of the Ukrainian positions in the Russian region. Russian troops have destroyed Ukrainian troops&apos; logistics in Kursk Oblast, and Ukrainian soldiers face the risk of encirclement, a Ukrainian soldier and a medic deployed in the region told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity on March 7. &quot;There is currently no threat of encirclement of our units in Kursk Oblast. The units are taking timely measures to maneuver to favorable defense lines,&quot; Syrskyi wrote on Facebook. Ukrainian forces &quot;control the situation&quot; on the border between Sumy and Kursk oblasts, according to Syrskyi. Yet, several settlements on the border no longer exist, as they have been destroyed by Russian attacks, he added. Russia has been suffering heavy losses both in personnel and equipment, according to Syrskyi. Near the village of Plekhove, Russian forces lost an infantry battalion in four days of fighting, he said. Ukraine&apos;s commander-in-chief added that he had decided to reinforce Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast with &quot;the necessary forces and means,&quot; including electronic warfare and drones. Concerns about the Ukrainian operation in Kursk Oblast, ongoing since August 2024, have mounted over the weekend amid reports of Russian advances. The development came shortly after the U.S. cut off military and intelligence support for Ukraine, allegedly to push Kyiv to the negotiating table. A potential loss of the Kursk salient or Russian advances in Sumy Oblast would likely weaken Ukraine&apos;s negotiating position as it prepares for initial rounds of talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia. Russian forces are attempting to establish a foothold near Novenke, a Ukrainian village in Sumy Oblast near the border with Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, State Border Guard spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said on air on March 10. The news comes after Russia reportedly achieved a breakthrough in Kursk Oblast, seeking to encircle the Ukrainian forces fighting there and penetrate the Ukrainian border. &quot;These are small assault units, composed of a few people. They try to penetrate our territory, accumulate forces, and advance further into Ukraine, probably to cut off logistical routes,&quot; Demchenko said on national television. Moscow&apos;s troops have been reportedly trying to push toward Novenke, a village lying 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the regional center, Sumy, for several weeks. Ukrainian artillery and drone units continue attacking Russian troops, preventing them from accumulating forces, the spokesperson added. Ukrainian military intelligence&apos;s (HUR) drones struck the Novokuybyshevsk oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Samara Oblast overnight on March 10, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent, confirming earlier reports. The statement came after Russian and Ukrainian sources reported an attack against the facility earlier the same day. Ukraine has systematically targeted Russian oil refineries, military sites, and warehouses deep behind the front lines to undermine Moscow&apos;s capacity to wage its all-out war. The refinery&apos;s &quot;capacity amounts to 8.8 million metric tons of oil per year, making it one of the 10 largest (refineries) in Russia,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. The plant produces gasoline, diesel fuel, and fuel oil, &quot;which are critically important for transport and military equipment,&quot; the official added. This includes jet fuel used by supersonic aircraft such as Su-27 fighter jets and Tu-22 bombers, the HUR source claimed. Samara Oblast residents reported loud explosions overnight, Astra wrote, adding that a fire was recorded at the Rosneft-run oil facility. According to the HUR source, the facility was hit at around 2 a.m. local time. The refinery was not sufficiently protected by anti-drone defenses, the source added. The city of Novokuybyshevsk lies roughly 900 kilometers (560 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. The facility was previously attacked at least twice in March 2024. &quot;This refinery is strategically important for the Russian military as it ensures a stable fuel supply for military operations,&quot; Kovalenko said. The Russian pro-state agency RBC reported a fire at a warehouse in Novokuybyshevsk that covered an area of 1,500 square meters later the same day, without mentioning a drone attack. No casualties were reported. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its forces had shot down nine Ukrainian drones overnight, including three over Samara Oblast, two each over the Voronezh and Oryol oblasts, and one each over the Belgorod and Kursk oblasts. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The Ukrainian delegation will propose a ceasefire in the sky and at sea during the upcoming talks with the U.S. this week on ending the war with Russia, the Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne reported on March 10, citing a Ukrainian official speaking on condition of anonymity. Ukrainian and U.S. delegations will hold talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 to discuss ending the war with Russia. During the meeting, Ukraine will propose a ceasefire at sea and in the sky and a ban on long-range strikes, the source told Suspilne. The official added that such a ceasefire would be &quot;easy to install and to monitor.&quot; The Ukrainian delegation will also insist on releasing prisoners of war and is ready to sign an agreement on mineral resources with the U.S., according to the source. The mineral resource deal was derailed after a spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the White House on Feb. 28. The U.S. delegation, in turn, will insist that Kyiv agree to a partial truce that would enable negotiations to stop the Russian invasion, Bloomberg reported on March 10. Ahead of the meeting in Jeddah, Trump&apos;s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said on March 10 he expects substantial progress in negotiations with Ukraine. &quot;I think that we&apos;re going over there with an expectation that we&apos;re going to make substantial progress,&quot; Witkoff said in an interview with Fox News. When asked about the possible signing of the mineral resource agreement in Saudi Arabia, Witkoff said, &quot;All the signs are very, very positive.&quot; Witkoff also said that the U.S. and Ukraine would discuss territorial issues, security protocols, and intelligence sharing. The Ukrainian president previously announced that his Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa would take part in the talks. The U.S. delegation will be led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Witkoff.The U.S. officials previously met with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. The two sides discussed restoring bilateral relations and held preliminary peace talks without Ukraine&apos;s participation. The U.S. may resume military aid to Ukraine if there is progress during talks with Kyiv in Saudi Arabia this week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told journalists on March 10 en route to Jeddah, The Guardian reported. &quot;I think the notion of the pause in aid, broadly, is something I hope we can resolve. Obviously, what happens tomorrow will be key to that,&quot; Rubio said. Following President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s clash with U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, Washington suspended all military aid to Ukraine. CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed on March 5 that the U.S. had also halted intelligence sharing, potentially limiting Ukraine&apos;s ability to detect Russian missile strikes and carry out long-range attacks. Speaking about a potential truce, Rubio praised Ukraine&apos;s proposal for a ceasefire in the sky and at sea. &quot;I&apos;m not saying that alone is enough, but it&apos;s the kind of concession you would need to see in order to end the conflict,&quot; he said. Rubio also said that more details still needed to &quot;be worked out&quot; on the mineral resource deal between Ukraine and the U.S. The deal was derailed after the clash between Zelensky and Trump on Feb. 28. Neither Ukraine nor Russia &quot;has the cards&quot; in potential peace negotiations, U.S. President Donald Trump told journalists on March 10 ahead of talks between the U.S. and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia. The Ukrainian and U.S. delegations are to hold talks on March 11 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on ending Russia&apos;s war. The participants are expected to discuss potential ceasefire options and a mineral resource deal between the U.S. and Ukraine. &quot;I say they (Ukraine) don&apos;t have the cards. Nobody really has the cards. Russia doesn&apos;t have the cards. What you have to do is you have to make a deal, and you have to stop the killing. It&apos;s a senseless war, and we are going to get it stopped,&quot; Trump said. Trump&apos;s recent statement contradicts his previous ones, in which he claimed the opposite about Ukraine and Russia. On Feb. 20, Trump said that Russia held &quot;the cards&quot; in any peace talks with Ukraine as they occupy a significant part of Ukrainian territory. Eight days later, the U.S. president told his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, during a heated argument in the White House that he &quot;was not in a good position&quot; regarding the war and did not have &quot;the right cards.&quot; Following the spat in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, the U.S. suspended its military and intelligence aid for Ukraine. The Ukrainian delegation is expected to discuss the resumption of military aid in Saudi Arabia. The delegations will also discuss territorial issues, security protocols, and intelligence sharing, according to Trump&apos;s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff.

We're ready' — Ukraine heads into US peace talks with everything at stake	Kyiv officials will meet their Washington counterparts in Jeddah on March 11 for talks which will impact the future of diplomatic relations between the two countries and likely the future of the war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian side hopes the meeting would help mend ties with the White House and ensure that the future U.S.-led peace process doesn&apos;t pose an existential threat to Ukraine. &quot;The advice for Ukraine is just get yourself aligned with the United States,&quot; Ambassador Kurt Volker, who served as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations in 2017-2019 and U.S. ambassador to NATO in 2008-2009, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This pushback on the U.S&#x2026; is counterproductive,&quot; Volker said. The alignment, however, doesn&apos;t seem an easy task, as the U.S. administration has been publicly attacking Ukraine, calling its leader a dictator, and cutting off vital intelligence sharing that may derail Kyiv&apos;s ability to defend itself. In Jeddah, top of the agenda will likely be the critical minerals deal, the signing of which stalled last month following the disastrous meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Ukraine is still paying the price for what the Trump administration has tried to paint as Zelensky&apos;s unwillingness to engage in peace negotiations and Ukraine&apos;s lack of gratitude for U.S. military aid, which it froze a few days after the White House meeting. Kyiv is entering the talks with a weak hand but is prepared to do what it needs to to get the U.S. back on its side. &quot;We&apos;re ready,&quot; a source in the President&apos;s Office told the Kyiv Independent when asked about the prospect of signing the mineral deal. In an effort to convince the U.S. that Ukraine is serious about peace and in the hope that Washington will resume military aid and intelligence sharing, Kyiv is also reportedly proposing a partial ceasefire covering long-range drone and missile strikes, as well as hostilities in the Black Sea. The U.S., however, may now want to extort more from a weakened Ukraine. Having to offer so much to the U.S. before peace talks with Russia can begin in earnest is being keenly felt in Kyiv. When asked what Ukraine was expecting at the talks in Jeddah, the source in the President&apos;s Office replied: &quot;Finally hearing what the Americans want from the negotiations.&quot; Despite arriving in Saudi Arabia on March 10 for a meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Zelensky won&apos;t be part of Ukraine&apos;s official delegation, which will instead by led by his closest aide Andriy Yermak. Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Colonel Pavlo Palisa make up the rest of the team. The U.S. delegation includes Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, and Trump&apos;s special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. Even if Ukraine can get the U.S. back onside, the negotiations to end the war are still ahead, and Trump&apos;s rhetoric portends anything but an easy path. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy looks on as he arrives at the Special European Council in Brussels on March 6, 2025, to discuss support for Ukraine and European defense. (Nicolas Tucat / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;So many of the things that Trump has said in the last two or three days give you the impression that he thinks Ukraine was going to lose regardless, that the Biden administration wasted a lot of money prolonging (the war), and we just have to get that over with,&quot; Volker said. Nothing that has come out of the White House in recent weeks suggests Trump has any interest in reaching a peace agreement that is in Ukraine&apos;s interests. After Polish President Andrzej Duda said that Ukraine would not survive without U.S. support, Trump was asked in an interview on March 9 if he was &quot;comfortable&quot; with the thought of his actions potentially leading to the destruction of the country. &quot;Well, it may not survive anyway,&quot; Trump said. His assessment of Ukraine&apos;s future came around a month after he flippantly suggested the country &quot;may be Russian someday&quot; in comments that made clear his main interest lay in Kyiv&apos;s mineral wealth and the ability to pay back U.S. military aid. Trump&apos;s transactional approach to negotiations that appear to have little regard for Ukrainian lives, territory, or sovereignty is a major source of concern in Kyiv, and the country as a whole. &quot;The expectations (of the Jeddah meeting) are alarming,&quot; Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, lawmaker from the Holos party, chairman of the parliamentary committee on freedom of speech, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Because recently the U.S. administration has demonstrated a desire not for just peace, but for the fastest possible reconciliation between the victim and the aggressor, without taking into account the interests of the victim.&quot; Yurchyshyn acknowledged that an &quot;optimistic&quot; outcome for the talks would simply be to get relations back on track and for the U.S. to &quot;take into account the interests of Ukraine in the future negotiation process.&quot; But another unavoidable fact of the U.S.-led peace negotiations so far is that Washington has not yet had to truly negotiate with Russia. The much-vaunted first round of talks between Washington and Moscow on Feb. 18 produced little of actual substance &#x2014; restoring embassy staffing for further diplomatic missions, appointing representatives to further the negotiation process, and creating the necessary conditions for restarting U.S.-Russia relations. While repeatedly strong-arming Ukraine into proving it is serious about peace, the White House has said nothing so far about how it plans to make Russian President Vladimir Putin order his armed forces to put down their guns. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to journalists aboard Air Force One while traveling from West Palm Beach to Washington, U.S. on March 9, 2025. (Roberto Schmidt / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;I hope that Trump&apos;s team will explain to our delegation whether or not President Trump has a strategy or a plan with regard to Ukraine and Russian aggression against Ukraine,&quot; Oleksandr Merezhko, the chair of the parliament&apos;s foreign affairs committee, said. What form this plan may take and what concessions the U.S. demands of Russia remain to be seen, but after yet another mass missile attack on Ukrainian cities last week, &quot;Trump&apos;s rage has been intensifying,&quot; Axios reported on March 7, citing an unnamed White House official. Yet on the same day, Trump still stated he found it &quot;more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine&quot; than Russia, something Volker believes could soon change, saying his statement shows he has a &quot;really misguided set of assumptions about what&apos;s happening.&quot; &quot;I think he has some kind of belief that Putin has limited and reasonable demands, which is not the case,&quot; he said. &quot;Putin has unlimited demands, starting with Ukraine, that they should be part of Russia, but then even beyond Ukraine. And I think (Trump) doesn&apos;t quite believe that, at least not yet.&quot; Meanwhile, watching from the sidelines is Europe, so far excluded from peace negotiations despite being the very continent upon which the war is being waged. Until that changes, Brussels faces much the same challenges as Kyiv &#x2014; convincing Trump that Ukraine&apos;s interests need to be considered. &quot;We have reiterated at all levels precisely that it is in Ukraine&apos;s interest, in Europe&apos;s interest, and ultimately also in the U.S. interest to put Ukraine in a position of strength before entering into peace negotiations,&quot; Paula Pinho, chief spokesperson of the European Commission, told the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/were-ready-ukraine-heads-into-us-talks-with-everything-at-stake/	2025-03-10T12:46:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203792484.jpg
US military aid freeze could be 'resolved' during talks with Ukraine this week, Rubio says	The U.S. may resume military aid to Ukraine if there is progress during talks with Kyiv in Saudi Arabia this week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told journalists on March 10 en route to Jeddah, The Guardian reported.

US, Ukraine charities see surge in donations after Trump’s attacks – but stress this doesn’t fill the void	For members of the U.S.-based charity organization Razom for Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s Feb. 28 verbal assault on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky felt like &#x201C;a punch to the gut,&#x201D; as it undermined years of the country&#x2019;s diplomatic support for Ukraine in its ongoing fight against Russian aggression. &#x201C;We weren&#x2019;t alone in this feeling, though &#x2014; soon after, we received an influx of donations from thousands of Americans who were disappointed by the outcome of the meeting,&#x201D; Anastasia Rab, chief advancement officer for Razom, told the Kyiv Independent. In the wake of the confrontation, the Trump administration took unprecedented actions, including suspending military aid and curtailing intelligence sharing, which directly threatens Ukraine&apos;s ability to defend itself. Meanwhile, Trump&#x2019;s attacks on Zelensky seemed to shift blame for the war&#x2019;s duration from Russia to Ukraine itself, further exacerbating tensions. Despite these challenges, volunteer organizations on both sides of the Atlantic are seeing a slight increase in support, as Americans and Ukrainians alike, disheartened by the political setbacks, are more determined than ever to show their solidarity with Ukraine&#x2019;s effort. But these volunteer organizations can only do so much, they stress. Razom for Ukraine was founded in 2014 after the EuroMaidan Revolution and Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, witnessing firsthand the harsh realities of the ongoing war and its toll on Ukrainian civilians and soldiers alike. In the lead-up to Trump&#x2019;s inauguration in January, Razom&#x2019;s members felt what they described as a &#x201C;deep sense of duty and responsibility&#x201D; to step up to the challenges his presidency might present, with donations just one part of their broader effort. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve been working with politicians, press, and constituents on both sides of the (political) aisle to ensure that support for Ukraine continues to be bipartisan, and people have the information and support they need to craft good Ukraine policy,&#x201D; Rab said. Unlike many other organizations, Razom for Ukraine was not impacted by the recent U.S. government cuts to USAID (the United States Agency for International Development). Their nationwide donor base has allowed them to continue carrying out their mission. However, some of the 200 Ukraine-based organizations supported by Razom&apos;s Relief Fund &#x2014; which has helped over one million civilians by providing food, shelter, clean water, psychological support, and other necessities during the full-scale war &#x2014; were impacted by Trump&apos;s freeze on foreign assistance, hindering their work. According to Razom&#x2019;s website, they&#x2019;ve earmarked an additional $1.8 million in funds to make sure that these affiliated organizations are able to continue helping Ukrainian civilians impacted directly by the war. While Razom says it has experienced an uptick in donations from across the U.S. and is on track to meet its fundraising goals ahead of schedule, the organization emphasizes that there are still limits to what they can do. &#x201C;&#x200B;&#x200B;People are clearly stepping up and we&#x2019;re grateful for that engagement, but it&#x2019;s really important to note that this engagement can&#x2019;t compensate for the cut-off in military aid, financial aid, and intelligence sharing of the U.S.,&#x201D; Rab said. Many Americans have been watching the latest events unfold with the understanding that supporting Ukraine is not just an act of solidarity &#x2014; it&#x2019;s more critical than ever. &#x201C;Russia won&apos;t back down, if anything I fear things will continue getting worse. Without U.S. military funding or weapons, I fear the worst is yet to come,&#x201D; Emma Atul, who has spent summers in Ukraine as a volunteer English teacher, told the Kyiv Independent. Though between jobs and unable to donate as often as she&#x2019;d like, she remains committed to promoting the Ukrainian culture she&#x2019;s experienced firsthand and she says that Razom for Ukraine is always a reliable choice for her when it comes to where to donate &#x2014; even a small sum feels like she&apos;s making a difference. &#x201C;The least we as Americans can do is donate to charities and continue writing to our representatives. I may not be Ukrainian or have Ukrainian relatives but Ukraine has a special place in my heart.&#x201D; In Ukraine, where nearly everyone has lost someone to the war or has a loved one fighting on the front line, the latest news from the U.S. has been met with a quiet stoicism &#x2014; a familiar response, though still one that is never easy to bear. The priority of volunteer organizations on the ground in Ukraine remains largely unchanged &#x2014; no matter what happens, they continue to search for ways to help soldiers on the front lines and ease the suffering of civilians. Founded in 2014, Come Back Alive is one of Ukraine&#x2019;s largest and most vital wartime aid organizations, primarily tasked with purchasing weapons and other necessary equipment for the military. However, since 2022, the organization has also been investing in training for the Ukrainian army. &#x201C;This helps to efficiently use the material resources the army already has, as well as to save lives,&#x201D; Head of Partnerships Oleksandra Haivoronska told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;All these years, and not only in times of crisis, we have been trying to work to the fullest and build capacity. That&apos;s why we still evaluate all our projects from the standpoint of &#x2018;What does it give the country?&#x2019; and &#x2018;What does it change on the battlefield?&#x2019;&#x201D; The organization allows the public to track donations on its website. Donations from foreign supporters in particular saw a modest uptick following Zelensky&#x2019;s contentious visit to the White House at the end of February, according to Haivoronska. In the first two months of 2025, Come Back Alive received more than 363,000 donations totaling Hr 545.4 million ($13 million) &#x2014; an increase from the same period last year, when the organization collected Hr 452.6 million ($11 million) from 163,000 donations. The listed currencies of the donations include not only hryvnias but euros and dollars, indicating a global donor base. While some volunteer organizations in Ukraine rely more on grants than donations, they are closely monitoring the shifting dynamics of U.S. support. The Ukrainian Charity Alliance, founded in Kharkiv in 2018, focuses on aiding the most vulnerable groups in Ukrainian society through education, healthcare, social protection, legal assistance, and psychological support. Going into 2025, the organization proactively began strengthening its operational strategies to ensure readiness for the challenges the coming months may bring. &#x201C;We have a plan. We are currently working on a new fundraising strategy, which will be focused on raising funds abroad. We have established a board of trustees and are selecting ambassadors from other countries who will help us with this,&#x201D; Oleksii Kurtsev, director of the organization, told the Kyiv Independent. Though the Ukrainian Charity Alliance was not directly affected by USAID cuts, its team remains &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about the precedent set by the Trump administration&apos;s recent actions, which suggest that international law has faltered and power is now the dominant force in resolving conflicts. &#x201C;We can no longer rely on anyone but ourselves and our trusted partners, with whom we have been working for over three years to bring our shared victory closer,&#x201D; Kurtsev said. &#x201C;A strong global civil society has the power to challenge governments that prioritize only their own interests.&#x201D; Hi there, thanks for reading my latest article. As an American living in Ukraine for many years, it meant a lot to me to see that many of my fellow countrymen were as outraged by Trump&apos;s recent policy turns as I was. Supporting Ukraine is more important than ever, and that includes supporting charities, like the ones I wrote about here.

Ukraine to propose ceasefire at sea, in sky during talks with US this week, media outlet reports	The Ukrainian delegation will propose a ceasefire in the sky and at sea during the upcoming talks with the U.S. this week on ending the war with Russia, the Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne reported on March 10, citing a Ukrainian official speaking on condition of anonymity. Ukrainian and U.S. delegations will hold talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 to discuss ending the war with Russia. During the meeting, Ukraine will propose a ceasefire at sea and in the sky and a ban on long-range strikes, the source told Suspilne. The official added that such a ceasefire would be &quot;easy to install and to monitor.&quot; The Ukrainian delegation will also insist on releasing prisoners of war and is ready to sign an agreement on mineral resources with the U.S., according to the source. The mineral resource deal was derailed after a spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the White House on Feb. 28. The U.S. delegation, in turn, will insist that Kyiv agree to a partial truce that would enable negotiations to stop the Russian invasion, Bloomberg reported on March 10. Ahead of the meeting in Jeddah, Trump&apos;s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said on March 10 he expects substantial progress in negotiations with Ukraine. &quot;I think that we&apos;re going over there with an expectation that we&apos;re going to make substantial progress,&quot; Witkoff said in an interview with Fox News. When asked about the possible signing of the mineral resource agreement in Saudi Arabia, Witkoff said, &quot;All the signs are very, very positive.&quot; Witkoff also said that the U.S. and Ukraine would discuss territorial issues, security protocols, and intelligence sharing. The Ukrainian president previously announced that his Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa would take part in the talks. The U.S. delegation will be led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Witkoff. The U.S. officials previously met with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. The two sides discussed restoring bilateral relations and held preliminary peace talks without Ukraine&apos;s participation.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-propose-ceasefire-at-sea-in-sky-during-talks-with-us-in-saudi-arabia-media-reports/	2025-03-10T10:42:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169777527.jpg
No threat of encirclement for Ukrainian troops in Russia's Kursk Oblast, Syrskyi says	Ukrainian units are not currently under threat of encirclement in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on March 10. Syrskyi&apos;s statement follows reports on Russian and North Korean troops launching an attack on the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast. Russian forces have made a breakthrough south of the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast, potentially threatening to cut off some of the Ukrainian positions in the Russian region. Russian troops have destroyed Ukrainian troops&apos; logistics in Kursk Oblast, and Ukrainian soldiers face the risk of encirclement, a Ukrainian soldier and a medic deployed in the region told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity on March 7. &quot;There is currently no threat of encirclement of our units in Kursk Oblast. The units are taking timely measures to maneuver to favorable defense lines,&quot; Syrskyi wrote on Facebook. Ukrainian forces &quot;control the situation&quot; on the border between Sumy and Kursk oblasts, according to Syrskyi. Yet, several settlements on the border no longer exist, as they have been destroyed by Russian attacks, he added. Russia has been suffering heavy losses both in personnel and equipment, according to Syrskyi. Near the village of Plekhove, Russian forces lost an infantry battalion in four days of fighting, he said. Ukraine&apos;s commander-in-chief added that he had decided to reinforce Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast with &quot;the necessary forces and means,&quot; including electronic warfare and drones. Concerns about the Ukrainian operation in Kursk Oblast, ongoing since August 2024, have mounted over the weekend amid reports of Russian advances. The development came shortly after the U.S. cut off military and intelligence support for Ukraine, allegedly to push Kyiv to the negotiating table. A potential loss of the Kursk salient or Russian advances in Sumy Oblast would likely weaken Ukraine&apos;s negotiating position as it prepares for initial rounds of talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia.	https://kyivindependent.com/there-is-currently-no-threat-of-encirclement-of-ukrainian-units-in-russias-kursk-oblast-syrskyi-says/	2025-03-10T09:19:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2180021122.jpg
Zelensky arrives in Saudi Arabia ahead of Ukraine-US talks	President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 10 to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, The Guardian reported.Zelensky initially intended to visit Saudi Arabia as part of a Middle East tour in February but delayed the trip due to bilateral U.S.-Russian talks in Riyadh on Feb. 18. The Gulf countries have traditionally played the role of mediators between Russia and Ukraine, namely in regard to prisoner exchanges. Following Zelensky&apos;s meeting with the Saudi crown prince, the Ukrainian president&apos;s team will remain in the country on March 11 to meet U.S. delegates and discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement. Zelensky is not expected to participate in the negotiations. Zelensky previously announced that his Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa would take part in the talks.The meeting between the U.S. and Ukrainian delegations will occur after a heated argument between Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance on Feb. 28 in the White House Oval Office.Since that meeting, the U.S. has ended its military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-arrives-in-saudi-arabia-ahead-of-ukraine-us-talks/	2025-03-10T08:30:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156503093.jpg
Navigating the world of Trump and Musk's lies	Just a few years ago, the biggest purveyors of disinformation on the internet were bots, conspiracy theorists and Russian propaganda outlets. Today the world is a very different place and two of the most prominent sources of lies and mistruths are the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and the world&#x2019;s richest man, Elon Musk. The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Chris York sits down with Eliot Higgins, founder and creative director of the investigative outlet Bellingcat, to discuss how we arrived at this point and what can be done about it.	https://kyivindependent.com/navigating-the-world-of-trump-and-musks-lies/	2025-03-10T08:27:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_1275.JPG
Washington considers easing sanctions on Russian oil, Bloomberg reports	Advisers to U.S. President Donald Trump are discussing easing sanctions against Russia, including those imposed on Russian oil, a major source of funding for the war in Ukraine, Bloomberg reported on March 10, citing sources. The news comes as Ukraine and the U.S. are set to hold talks on ending Russia&apos;s war in Saudi Arabia this week. The Trump administration is seeking options to make &quot;a step forward&quot; and encourage the Kremlin to negotiate an end to the war. Easing the price ceiling on Russian oil is allegedly one option under consideration, Bloomberg reported, citing its undisclosed sources familiar with the matter. The oil price cap was approved by G7 countries in 2022 and came into effect in 2023. Currently the cap stands at $60 per barrel. Despite Russia&apos;s ability to sustain a wartime economy through increased military spending and industrial production, experts say it remains vulnerable and needs sanctions relief. The Kremlin has expressed interest in economic cooperation with the U.S., particularly in rare earth metals. Trump has also sought a minerals deal with Ukraine, which has significant lithium and rare earth metal reserves, as a way to offset the billions of dollars in American aid. However, his meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28 ended without an agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/washington-considers-easing-sanctions-over-russian-oil-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-10T08:03:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1258888534.jpeg
Russian woman seeks to adopt abducted Ukrainian child after her son was killed fighting in war, investigation says	A Russian woman, Olga Dorokhina, took a 4-year-old girl from the occupied part of Kherson Oblast and plans to adopt her, according to an investigation by Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne published on March 10. Dorokhina&#x2019;s son was previously killed while fighting against Ukraine, according to the investigation. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, at least 19,500 Ukrainian children have been abducted from occupied territories and transferred to other Russian-controlled areas, Belarus, or Russia itself, according to Ukraine&#x2019;s national database, Children of War. Dorokhina spoke about her trip and the girl&#x2019;s abduction from Ukraine during a conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin at an event, claiming she had &quot;found her daughter&quot; in Kherson Oblast. The child is now under her guardianship. Suspilne&#x2019;s investigative team identified Dorokhina as a native of Yelets, Lipetsk Oblast, Russia, who moved to occupied Simferopol in Crimea in 2016. Her husband, Oleksandr Dorokhin, is a former employee of Russia&#x2019;s Federal Penitentiary Service and a veteran of the Chechen war. Her eldest son, Vladislav Dorokhin, served in Russia&#x2019;s Black Sea Fleet before joining the 810th Marine Brigade to fight in Ukraine, Suspilne reported. Ukraine has so far managed to return 1,240 abducted children, according to the Children of War database. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Putin and Children&#x2019;s Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova over their involvement in the unlawful transfer of Ukrainian children. Human rights groups have said that Russia&apos;s mass abductions of Ukrainian civilians, including children, may constitute a war crime and a crime against humanity.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-woman-seeks-to-adopt-abducted-ukrainian-child-as-her-son-was-killed-fighting-in-war/	2025-03-10T07:20:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1246326347.jpg
US hasn't stopped sharing defense-related intelligence with Ukraine, Trump's envoy says	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. The U.S. has never stopped sharing intelligence with Ukraine that is needed for defensive purposes, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, told Fox News on March 10. The comments seem to confirm earlier claims in the media that the U.S. freeze on intelligence sharing with Kyiv, instituted on March 5, did not extend to information needed for defense operations. Restrictions on intelligence that could help Ukraine strike Russian targets remain in place, according to the latest information. The issue will be discussed at the U.S.-Ukrainian talks in Jeddah on March 11, Witkoff said before departing for Saudi Arabia. The Trump administration restricted intelligence sharing with Ukraine shortly after freezing all U.S. military assistance flowing to the country, which has faced Russia&apos;s all-out war for more than three years. The steps followed a heated exchange between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28, which underscored Washington&apos;s increasingly hostile stance toward Ukraine as it seeks to restore ties with Russia. According to Witkoff, the U.S. hopes for significant progress with Ukraine this week, which could include the signing of a natural resources deal that has been on hold since the Oval Office spat.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-hasnt-stopped-sharing-defense-related-intelligence-with-ukraine-trumps-envoy-says/	2025-03-10T06:49:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203659271.jpg
Do US-Russia talks on Ukraine mark a reappearance of colonial power play?	The unexpected negotiations between the United States and the Russian Federation that began in Saudi Arabia in February were strange. These off-line discussions in Riyadh, which included foreign ministers and presidential advisors from both countries, focused primarily on the fate of Ukraine and the future of European security. Yet, neither Ukraine nor the European Union, nor any of its member states, were present or in any other way involved in these purely bilateral face-to-face meetings. Other oddities were apparent. A Ukrainian delegation, led by First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, had just met with Saudi Arabian officials in Riyadh on Feb. 16. This delegation was there to prepare for a visit by President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was on a previously planned trip to the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia &#x2014; although the Saudi portion was canceled. Ukraine&#x2019;s president and government officials were physically nearby the American and Russian negotiators, who were discussing the future of the Ukrainian state in Riyadh. The absurdity of this situation in February illustrates the profound changes the international order may be undergoing today. The approaches of Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s inner circle and the Trump administration to Ukraine do not signal a new &quot;multipolar world.&quot; Instead, they reflect a return to the principles of the Yalta system, established during the final months of World War II. The idea of &quot;might makes right&quot; that, in spite of the Allies&#x2019; triumph over the fascist axis, prevailed in 1945 seems to resurface today, as outside powers attempt to divide continental Europe. During talks at Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam in 1943-45, Moscow was granted more East European territory than it had received before and at the start of World War II, in its talks with Nazi Germany. In protocols to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and German-Soviet Border and Friendship Treaty of 1939, Stalin had secured Soviet control over parts of East-Central Europe, including Poland and the Baltic states. But by 1945, the U.S. had handed over the entire eastern portion of the continent to Soviet imperialism, enforced Russification, state terrorism, and colonial exploitation. To show his disrespect for the new international system established in 1945, Stalin smuggled the Soviet &quot;republics&quot; of Ukraine and Belarus as founding members into the United Nations. After the collapse of the German empire in 1945, other European empires, too, lost most of their colonies. By 1989-1991, it seemed that the Russian land empire, in its communist form, had also come to an end. First, the nations of the Soviet bloc or &quot;outer empire,&quot; and then the republics of the Soviet Union&#x2019;s &quot;inner empire,&quot; gained formal independence. However, Moscow&#x2019;s 1945-1991 mockery of international law continued, albeit on a smaller scale, after the breakup of the Soviet Union. For example, without following the regular process of application and accession to the United Nations (as Serbia did after the breakup of Yugoslavia), Russia became a permanent member of the UN Security Council, even though the UN&#x2019;s statute still only mentions the Soviet Union. The Kremlin also managed to gain Western sanctioning for so-called &#x201C;peacekeepers&#x201D; in Moldova and Georgia, whose role was to &quot;keep pieces&quot; of a Russian rump-empire under Moscow&#x2019;s control. For 30 years after 1991, both the U.S. and Western Europe practiced a &quot;Russia First&quot; policy, where the interests of Russia&#x2019;s former colonies were secondary to those of Moscow. This strange policy even meant temporarily expanding the G7 to include Russia, creating a G8 group, which &#x2014; at least in the Kremlin&#x2019;s understanding &#x2014; reinforced Moscow&#x2019;s continued status as a world and imperial power. The most scandalous example of this approach was the (abortive) Russo-German Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project launched after, and in demonstrative disregard of, Russia&#x2019;s annexation of Crimea and covert military intervention in Eastern Ukraine in 2014. (L-R) Then-French Prime Minister Francois Fillon, then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel, then-Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, and then-European Union Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger turn a wheel to symbolically start the flow of gas through the Nord Stream Baltic Sea gas pipeline at a ceremony in Lubmin, Germany, on Nov. 8, 2011. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)In 2022, Germany and other Western European nations finally reversed their &quot;Russia First&quot; stance, finally recognizing the legitimacy and rationality of the interests of Moscow&#x2019;s former colonies. Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia&#x2014;though still partially occupied&#x2014;became candidates for membership in the European Union. The driving force behind this shift was Ursula von der Leyen, the German president of the European Commission, representing a nation that once had its own colonial plans for Ukraine. In contrast, the U.S., which itself began the decolonization process in the 18th century, seems to be today reversing its earlier liberationist stance toward Eastern Europe and its active support for Russia&#x2019;s former colonies breaking free from Moscow&#x2019;s neo-imperial orbit. At least rhetorically, the Trump administration appears to be returning to a Yalta-like approach, where the voices of smaller states are sidelined, and Ukraine&#x2019;s participation in negotiations about its future is unnecessary. Much of this occurs in direct or indirect contradiction to the letter and spirit of the 30-year old security assurances Washington gave Kyiv in the now infamous Budapest Memorandum. In December 1994, this historic document was signed in by Kyiv and the three depositary governments of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), i.e. the U.S., United Kingdom, and Russia in connection with Ukraine&#x2019;s decision to relinquish all of its Soviet-era atomic weapons and sign the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state. Trump&#x2019;s stance also conflicts with the 2008 Bucharest NATO declaration, in which U.S. President George W. Bush entrenched a NATO membership perspective for Ukraine and Georgia, as well as with the 2008 Strategic Partnership Charter and 2024 Bilateral Security Agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine. Time will tell how far this American reversal of its foreign affairs and thus of the overall course of contemporary world history will go.

Russia moves to curb Chinese car imports with higher fees, tighter regulations	Russia is moving to curb the flow of Chinese car imports, a decision that could deal a blow to Chinese manufacturers and traders who have increasingly relied on the Russian market, the Financial Times reported on March 10. China has remained a key economic partner for Russia throughout the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, supplying Moscow with critical dual-use goods and helping to keep its economy afloat amind Western sanctions. Chinese car exports to Russia surged sevenfold in 2023 compared to 2022, as Western sanctions over Moscow&#x2019;s war against Ukraine cut Russia off from brands like Volkswagen, Toyota, and BMW. Automakers in China, facing anti-dumping measures in the U.S., EU, Canada, Turkey, and Brazil, found a lucrative market in Russia, the Financial Times wrote. Chinese brands now account for 63% of the market, while domestic Russian brands have fallen to 29%. In response, Russian authorities have introduced measures to slow the influx. In January, Moscow raised the &quot;recycling fees&quot; for most passenger cars to $7,500, more than doubling the rate set last September. The fees will continue rising by 10-20% annually until 2030. Russian regulators have also blocked the sale of a Chinese truck model over alleged safety violations and warned that more compliance checks may follow. The move comes amid an expected decline in new car sales in Russia, with projections of a 30% drop in 2025 if high interest rates persist, according to Avtovaz CEO Maxim Sokolov. The state-owned Avtovaz is Russia&apos;s largest carmaker, known for its flagship Lada vehicle series. The Russian Central Bank raised its key interest rate to 21% in October 2024 to curb inflation from wartime spending. Despite its growing economic ties with Russia, Beijing insists it remains neutral in Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine and has even sought to position itself as a mediator.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-moves-to-curb-chinese-car-imports-with-higher-fees-tighter-regulations/	2025-03-10T06:23:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-164317197.jpg
5 steps for securing an eastward enlargement of the European Union	Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine is not only about Ukraine&#x2019;s freedom and survival, but also about the future of Europe&#x2019;s hard security. Russia wants to replace the cooperative, democratic security order in Europe, the principles of which were outlined 50 years ago in the Helsinki Final Act, with one where might makes right and Russia is an empire dominating large swathes of Europe. This would pose an existential security threat to the European Union and its member states. The EU&#x2019;s decision to open accession negotiations with Ukraine is a geostrategic investment that could strengthen the European security order and prevent Russia from achieving its ambitions. It does so not only by defending Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereign right to pursue a European path, but also by securing military capabilities and strategic resources for the EU. However, even though Ukraine could contribute to the EU&#x2019;s security in the long term as a full member, it is primarily Europe that must ensure Ukraine&#x2019;s security. NATO membership remains Ukraine&#x2019;s goal &#x2014; it is enshrined in the constitution and supported by a clear majority of Ukrainian citizens. However, there is currently no consensus within NATO on extending an invitation to Ukraine. This could change quickly, and European countries are right to insist that Ukrainian NATO membership would be the best and cheapest option for ensuring security in the North Atlantic area. Nonetheless, the prospects for Ukrainian NATO membership remain distant, so the EU must seriously consider how it can secure its geostrategic investment &#x2014; an EU eastward enlargement &#x2014; without security guarantees under NATO&#x2019;s Article 5. The EU may also face fundamentally new and urgent military challenges in light of U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s expressed ambition to reach a ceasefire deal in Russia&#x2019;s war. While the form of such a deal and the prospects for reaching it are far from certain, any form of ceasefire settlement would need to be followed by credible security assurances to Ukraine. Without this, Ukraine would be defenseless against renewed Russian aggression (as happened after the conclusion of the Minsk agreements). The possibility that EU member states and countries like the U.K. and Norway would have to deploy troops on Ukrainian territory in the case of a ceasefire deal cannot be ruled out. Against this backdrop, the need to step up the EU&#x2019;s hard security is not a distant task that needs to be realized only after Ukraine joins the EU. To secure an eastward EU enlargement and address potentially immediate military challenges, the EU must deliver on its ambition to become a geostrategic actor, both on its own and in close cooperation with NATO. It must show, through deeds, that it has both the political resolve and the capabilities to defend itself and its core interests. Some of the measures needed to achieve that ambition will require deviations from the status quo and reassessments of the EU&#x2019;s role. The feasibility of implementing the required steps to ensure the EU&#x2019;s hard security will not only stem from political desire in European capitals, but also from external circumstances and pressure from the U.S. These factors may provide the sense of necessity that, as in the past, enables EU member states to unite, shape, and reshape European cooperation. First, European policymakers should consider implementing key institutional reforms in foreign and security policy. Currently, the EU&#x2019;s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) remains intergovernmental; since decisions require consensus among member states, EU action can suffer from a lack of timeliness and effectiveness. A move to qualified majority voting (QMV) in the CFSP would enhance the EU&#x2019;s policymaking efficiency and could arguably be done without a Treaty change. QMV has been discussed in the past, but today&#x2019;s geopolitical challenges could provide the impetus to move ahead with it.

(Maxym Marusenko / NurPhoto via Getty Images)The CFSP is also an area that Ukraine and Moldova could be integrated into immediately, for example, by allowing them to participate in key CFSP decision-making forums and by integrating them into EU security initiatives such as the European Defence Agency (EDA) and Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO). Second, the EU&#x2019;s enhanced geostrategic role will require large-scale investments and efforts in security and defense. Defense spending in member states would need to exceed at least 3% of GDP, a significant portion of which would be devoted to military assistance to Ukraine and investments in the Ukrainian defense industry. The European Council conclusions on European defense from March 6 welcomed the European Commission&#x2019;s plans to facilitate increased national defense spending and provide member states with defense loans. They also called on the European Investment Bank (EIB) to adapt its lending practices to the defense industry, re-evaluate the list of excluded activities and increase the volume of available funding. These conclusions outline necessary steps in the right direction. Taking on EU common debt through defense bonds could also offer financial firepower for closing capability gaps and strengthening Europe&#x2019;s defense infrastructure. For such a step to be viable, countries that have traditionally opposed joint debt would need to change their frugal positions. Third, if the EU is to succeed in taking on a new role in world politics, European leaders must improve their strategic communication with citizens. A change in strategic culture in Europe &#x2014; based on an understanding among citizens of, for example, why enlargement is a geostrategic investment, why enlargement needs security, and the urgent military challenges the EU might face &#x2014; will be key to ensuring domestic support for investments in security and defense. Strategic communication with the citizens of EU member states about the concrete contributions that candidate countries can make to the EU&#x2019;s security and economic prosperity as full member states will also play an important role. Fourth, greater and closer cooperation between the EU and NATO will be necessary to ensure effective complementarity and intelligence sharing between the two organizations. One step could be sealing a new partnership between the EU and NATO, under which the EU would use its financial and regulatory tools to help member states fulfill NATO capability requirements and enforce more strictly defined NATO standardization agreements for equipment and ammunition to enhance interoperability. Trilateral exchanges between the EU, NATO, and groups of EU member states on creating military mobility corridors and consolidating multinational military logistics would further strengthen cooperation and could be proactively suggested to the U.S. by European states. Fifth, bearing in mind the possibility of a military operation on Ukrainian territory, European states should ensure they create the structures necessary for its implementation. There is a need to establish a joint military command, along with various staff structures, responsible for planning both the operation itself and potential reinforcements for deployed troops in the event of a crisis. Additionally, logistics and intelligence structures will need to be set up, and the military units that could participate must be identified. Ideally, these would be multinational formations already established within the framework of NATO&#x2019;s joint command in Europe, such as the Multinational Corps Northeast. The question of possible independent military operations by European NATO members, without the participation of the U.S., has arisen several times in NATO&#x2019;s history. These ideas have traditionally been rejected by Washington, partly because of concerns that an increasingly autonomous Europe would undermine U.S. authority in NATO, duplicate NATO resources, and threaten NATO cohesion. If Washington is shifting its approach to Europe&apos;s security, now may be the right time to revisit the idea of establishing European cells within NATO. This would allow Europe to take on the primary responsibility for ensuring Ukraine&#x2019;s (and Europe&#x2019;s) security, while maintaining critical U.S. support within NATO for logistics, airlift, and strategic reconnaissance.

Investigation: We tried to buy American chips as a Russian defense manufacturer — and it worked	Despite bans put in place by the U.S. and Europe on the supply of electronic components to Russia, dozens of Russian microelectronics suppliers continue to obtain and resell imported chips to Russian arms manufacturers successfully. Without these Western chips, Russia would not be able to produce key weapons &#x2014; like missiles, drones, and self-propelled howitzers. To prove that this line of supply continues to operate three years into Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, the Kyiv Independent tried ordering American microchips from Russian trading companies, posing as a Russian defense producer. We obtained a list of Russian firms supplying Western microcircuits to the Russian defense industry from leaked emails of the Russian state holding Ruselectronics. The Kyiv Independent obtained access to the leak together with OCCRP. (The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s first investigation based on the leak is available here. The investigation focused on the continued export of Russian weapons during the full-scale war.) We combed through the emails for mentions of the supply of American and European chips to Russia and followed the traces of the described transactions. According to the leaked letters, after the start of the full-scale invasion, companies of the Ruselectronics holding requested large volumes of various American and European chips from Russian suppliers &#x2014; and got confirmation that they could be supplied, despite sanctions. The leaked emails cover the first few months of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Through the emails, the Kyiv Independent identified an ecosystem of companies that came to the aid of Ruselectronics holding by building new supply chains for banned components. Using customs data, we also discovered a huge network of their foreign suppliers, mostly from China and Hong Kong. These records, together with our undercover experiment, prove that American and European-branded chips continue flowing to Russia &#x2014; the country that started the largest war in Europe since World War II. The U.S. and EU imposed sanctions and export restrictions immediately on the first day of Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and some even the day before. The restrictions, among other things, banned American and European chips from entering Russia, whose defense sector relies heavily on their use in producing weapons. Russia wasn&#x2019;t ready for it. From the leaked emails, it&#x2019;s clear that the producers had no significant stockpile of chips. On the second day of the invasion, one Ruselectronics employee emailed notes from an internal meeting to two colleagues. It mentions that &#x201C;delivery times for electronic components had increased, and prices had risen.&#x201D; The letter concludes that the holding would need to buy a year&#x2019;s worth of stock of electronic components. This and other emails suggest that the Russian arms manufacturer wasn&#x2019;t preparing for a protracted war. It didn&#x2019;t have extra stocks of imported chips at the start of the invasion but began procuring them immediately after the start of the invasion, bypassing the fresh restrictions. In April 2022, two months after the start of the invasion, Ruselectronics companies prepared proposals on how to reduce the risks of disruptions in the procurement of electronic components. Among other things, the proposals called for allocating additional funding to create stockpiles of electronic components. But the leaked letters reveal that suppliers faced difficulties procuring the electronics. In March 2022, Elitcom, a Russian supplier of Ruselectronics holding, wrote to say that it would fail to deliver chips produced by the American company Analog Devices on time. The contract for the chips was signed in December 2021, and one of Ruselectronics&#x2019; subsidiaries expected their delivery in May 2022. Elitcom explained that due to the Russian invasion, the American manufacturer had stopped deliveries to Russia, and Analog Devices&#x2019; official distributor &#x201C;did not confirm its readiness&#x201D; to fulfill the contract. But Elitcom had a plan and said it could arrange the supply of the necessary Analog Devices chips, despite sanctions. The company was offering to do so with the help of unnamed &#x201C;foreign partners&#x201D; who confirmed the chips would arrive in September-October 2022, several months later than originally planned. Similar cases occurred across the sector. Around that same time, a Russian electronics supplier, TestKomplekt, emailed a Ruselectronics&#x2019; subsidiary to warn that due to foreign restrictions, it had revised the terms of supply of American-branded chips, such as Analog Devices, Texas Instruments, Microchip Technology, Altera, Maxim Integrated, and others. Not a problem &#x2014; the company was still ready to supply them, but at new prices. The leaked emails contain direct evidence that Russian defense manufacturers can&#x2019;t produce weapons without Western chips, nor can they be substituted with analogs. For example, a sanctioned Ruselectronics&#x2019; subsidiary, the Istok Research and Production Corporation, argued that it needed to purchase certain American chips produced by Analog Devices because Russian and other analogs &#x201C;do not comply with the design documentation&#x201D; of the enterprise. The use of other chips &#x201C;is impossible,&#x201D; an internal note says. &#x201C;For the Russians, this stuff is absolutely critical,&#x201D; explains James Byrne, senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a London-headquartered security think tank. &#x201C;They can&apos;t build missiles without it. It&apos;s not like they&apos;re just going to give up.&#x201D; But the Russian arms manufacturers didn&#x2019;t have to give up the Western chips. There were those willing to supply them. An unobvious but important detail illustrated by the leaked emails is that Russian arms manufacturers don&#x2019;t import Western chips directly from abroad. They didn&#x2019;t do so even before the full-scale invasion. Instead, Russian arms manufacturers buy imported circuits within Russia. Whenever they need electronics, they tap into a vast network of Russian suppliers of imported electronic components like Elitcom or TestKomplekt. The network is a mix of state-owned and private companies that specialize in purchasing American and European chips. Some of them openly advertise the sale of American chips on their websites even now, in 2025, in the fourth year of the Russian war. It was these companies that came to the rescue of the Russian defense industry after the introduction of unprecedented Western export bans and sanctions, setting up workarounds to supply chips to Russia. These companies don&#x2019;t publicly advertise that their clients are Russian defense manufacturers. It is only through internal correspondence and access to contracts, which aren&#x2019;t public, that it becomes clear that these private firms with flashy websites are actually the lifeline of Russian missile production. Some Russian suppliers of Western chips for Russia&#x2019;s defense industry in 2022-2024. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)The leaked emails show that after the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine and the imposition of restrictions and sanctions, more than two dozen Russian providers of Western chips responded to Ruselectronics&#x2019; growing demand. Among them were Russian companies Modern Digital Technologies, Imotek, Elsup, AST Components, Orion-Electronika, Altex, Elesar-Grupp, Trade House Alfa-Komplekt ECB, Communication Systems Equipment, RTKT, GC Electromir, MTG, Electronintorg, and others. They confirmed their readiness to supply hundreds of different American-branded chips in response to requests from Ruselectronics&#x2019; subsidiaries in March&#x2013;April 2022. Some Russian chip suppliers took the initiative and approached representatives of Ruselectronics to advertise their capabilities, knowing they would struggle to obtain chips. In March 2022, the Russian design center Kristal wrote a letter to a Ruselectronics representative, informing him that the company had supply channels for imported electronic components from Texas Instruments, Analog Devices, Maxim, Microchip, Micron, NXP, Xilinx (AMD), Qorvo, and Broadcom. Kristal offered a meeting to discuss cooperation. &#x201C;Together with foreign partners, we have access to global distributors of electronic components,&#x201D; Kristal&#x2019;s CEO Leonid Zotov boasted in an email sent on the 19th day of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Who is behind suppliers like Kristal? Among the owners are a retired Russian major general, medium-sized entrepreneurs, a Russian oligarch, as well as employees of companies united in the state-owned Ruselectronics holding, or the Russian state defense corporation, Rostec, itself. For example, Elsup&#x2019;s owner is Vladislav Borodovitsyn. According to his Instagram page, he previously held a position as an employee of a research institute that is jointly controlled by Rostec and the investment company Sistema, owned by Russian oligarch Vladimir Yevtushenkov. Kristal is also controlled by Rostec and oligarch Yevtushenkov. Vladimir Yevtushenkov, Russian oligarch, owner of investment company Sistema. (Dyor/Wikimedia)Electronintorg is part of the state-owned Rostec&#x2019;s subsidiary Ruselectronics. Among the co-owners of AST Components, we found the retired Russian Major General Magomed Tolboev, who was also an aspiring politician, and his son Ruslan. Commercial proposals sent by Russian suppliers at Ruselectronics&#x2019; request included American electronic components used in Russian missiles and other weapons. Among the offers, the Kyiv Independent identified a number of American chips that had been found in Kinzhals &#x2014; Russian ballistic missiles that carry a warhead of nearly 500 kilograms used in strikes on Kyiv and more distant cities, killing civilians. According to the leak, Russian intermediary companies were also ready to supply U.S. chips that are used in Russian Kalibr and R-77 missiles, as well as in the Tornado-G system capable of launching 40 rockets at once and in the Giatsint-S, a tank-mounted gun.

(Source image: Wikimedia, war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua, leaked emails)Although the leaked Ruselectronics&#x2019; emails don&#x2019;t extend beyond May 2022, Russian intermediaries did not exhaust their ability to supply the Russian defense industry with Western chips. The Kyiv Independent managed to obtain Russian tax records from 2024 with a list of contractors for one Ruselectronics&#x2019; subsidiary: the Istok Research and Production Corporation. In 2024, Istok continued to receive supplies from the majority of the Russian providers of imported circuits that we encountered in the leaked emails. The Kyiv Independent decided to try and order American chips through Russian suppliers in February 2025 &#x2014; and was successful. To confirm that the flow of Western chips to Russia is not a fiction, we carried out an undercover experiment. The Kyiv Independent took on the role of an employee of a real Ruselectronics&#x2019; subsidiary, the Almaz research and production enterprise, which produces electronic systems for military equipment. Surprisingly, the most difficult aspect of the experiment was to create an email account with a Russian email service, as they are blocked in Ukraine. When that was done, trying to buy banned Western chips in Russia was easy. The Kyiv Independent prepared a request for a commercial proposal on behalf of Almaz, asking for circuits produced by American-headquartered companies, and sent the request to two dozen Russian suppliers of American chips. Ten of them responded, confirming their ability to deliver the required chips. The Russian companies Imotek, AST Components, Elsup, Altex, RTKT, and Vneshtekhsnab confirmed they were ready to deliver chips in 1.5 to three months. Modern Digital Technologies, Electromir, and Imotek sent their offers, specifying the years of chip production. They included chips from Analog Devices, Texas Instruments, and Atmel manufactured in 2022-2024. One of the Russian companies, Elesar-Grupp, sent a full list of the chips it currently had in its warehouse, indicating their quantity. There were millions of chips of famous American and European brands. The list, provided to the Kyiv Independent when it reached out under the guise of an Almaz employee, included chips from American manufacturers Analog Devices, Texas Instruments, Microchip Technology, Xilinx (AMD), ON Semiconductor, Intel, Dutch NXP, German Infineon, and many others. Among them were those used in Russian missiles and attack drones. In the fourth year of Russia&apos;s full-scale war in Ukraine, those American and European chips are still available to Russian intermediary firms, and through them &#x2014; to Russian arms manufacturers. Due to strict export bans imposed after the start of the full-scale invasion, Western chipmakers have stopped direct deliveries to Russia and banned official distributors from supplying their parts to Russian companies. Instead, Western chips enter Russia through third countries that have not imposed restrictions. The main suppliers of American chips to Russia are China and Hong Kong. Customs data since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 shows that dozens of companies, mainly registered in Hong Kong and China, sent Western chips to Russian electronic component traders cooperating with Ruselectronics holding. The companies are either Chinese providers of Western microelectronics with many years of experience or newly established entities without websites and public contact information. According to ImportGenius, the Hong Kong-based electronic component seller Analog Technology has supplied Western chips to the Russian companies Modern Digital Technologies and Imotek since 2022. Hong Kong-based Analog Technology was established in 2011 and positions itself as a seller of chips &#x201C;of all famous worldwide brands.&#x201D; It supplied all well-known American and European chip brands to Russian firms despite Western export restrictions, according to trade data. Another Hong Kong-based company, Icscan Electronic, registered in 2022, presents itself as a &#x201C;famous international one-stop purchasing service provider of electronic components,&#x201D; and has sold chips of various American brands to Russian Elsup. Chinese Berton Electronics, which claims to be &#x201C;an agent of electronic components of well-known brands,&#x201D; sold Western-branded chips to Russian Modern Digital Technologies. In their turn, Russian companies Elsup, Modern Digital Technologies, Imotek, and other chip traders resold imported circuits to Ruselectronics holding. The following chart provides a glimpse into the scale of the Chinese distribution network of Western chips.

(Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)The data provides insights into the link in the chain that gets U.S. chips into Russia despite export bans. In this chain, Chinese suppliers resell the chips to Russian buyers that then supply them to the Russian defense industry. How many times chips are sold and resold before ending up in a Russian defense company is anyone&#x2019;s guess. According to customs records, American chips are produced in different countries, including the U.S., China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines, and others. In other words, some of these chips were most likely manufactured in American factories located outside the U.S. &#x201C;The key Western producers have several production facilities in countries like China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and a few in Thailand and Taiwan. Some of these are Chinese factories working on license, while others are daughter companies,&#x201D; says Erlend B Bjortvedt, founder of Corisk, an Oslo-based consulting company that explores sanctions and sanction evasion. Bjortvedt adds that &#x201C;this does not reduce their liabilities to follow sanctions&#x201D;. &#x201C;This liability includes daughter companies and U.S. and EU citizens in the management or board of daughter companies abroad,&#x201D; he explains. Further sanctions on foreign companies that help Russia obtain scarce weapons components, as well as increased compliance by Western manufacturers, are two key steps to reduce such supplies, experts say. &#x201C;When a product that is prohibited for sale to Russia, according to U.S. rules, goes from China to Russia, this is not a violation from China&apos;s perspective. However, it would be a violation of sanctions from the U.S. point of view,&#x201D; explains Vladyslav Vlasiuk, Ukraine&apos;s presidential commissioner for sanctions policy. &#x201C;That&apos;s why Chinese companies that supply microelectronics to Russia appear on U.S. sanctions lists,&#x201D; Vlasiuk explains. It is noteworthy that half of the Chinese chip suppliers to Ruselectronics holding identified by the Kyiv Independent, as well as their Russian buyers, are not yet under U.S. sanctions. That is, their activities have not yet been noticed by the authorized U.S. sanctions authorities. The Kyiv Independent reached out to dozens of Chinese companies mentioned in this article for comments, but did not receive any replies by the time of publication. James Byrne of RUSI spoke to the Kyiv Independent about his experience of communicating with chip manufacturers. According to him, they complain that they have limited visibility, meaning they can only see &#x201C;one or two steps down with the chain.&#x201D; &#x201C;If you&apos;re Texas Instruments or Intel, you have large distributors. The distributors sell components to all sorts of entities all over the world. Let&apos;s say you sell to some distributor in Hong Kong, and then they sell to another entity in Hong Kong, and that entity ships them to the Russians. I think it&apos;s a difficult problem to solve, but it doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s impossible.&#x201D; The Kyiv Independent contacted all the Western chipmakers mentioned in the article. Those who responded called the resale of their chips to Russia illicit and unauthorized, condemning it. Reactions from chip manufacturers on third-party supplies to Russia. Part 1. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)Reactions from chip manufacturers on third-party supplies to Russia. Part 2. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)Large manufacturers can tighten control over who they sell banned goods to and refuse risky customers, some of the experts say. &#x201C;Western chips manufacturers have had tremendous growth and profits over the last decades, but they have not invested in compliance and internal investigation,&#x201D; says Erlend B Bjortvedt, who works closely with customs data analysis at Corisk. &#x201C;One company I researched had 60,000 employees but did not see big and obvious red flags in their value chain,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;The loopholes in the digital components industry can be closed by forcing producers to invest in internal control resources through preventive investigations with strong penalties, and by deterring third parties through forceful secondary sanctions of foreign banks,&#x201D; according to Bjortvedt. Until that happens, American and European components make it possible to produce new batches of Russian weapons that attack Ukrainian cities and kill civilians. Hi, this is Alisa Yurchenko, the author of this story. I&#x2019;m writing this note shortly after reading the news that the U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a suspension of military aid to Ukraine &#x2014; a move that will manifest, among other things, that Ukraine might not have the way to protect itself from the Russian missiles. It adds to the bitterness of this moment is the understanding that Russian missiles that have been hitting Ukraine in the past three years would not have been produced if it wasn&#x2019;t for the Western chips and other components. Stories like this can create the wrong impression that export restrictions on critical components to Russia have failed. But they did have some effect. The need for workarounds made the chips 40 percent more expensive for Russian importers. We see it in the leaked emails dating back to the first months of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Another, even more important result is a reduction in Russian imports of digital components and chips after December 2022, according to sanctions analysts. The trade through intermediaries has slowed down, they say. This gives us hope that if the pressure on Western chip sales through China, Hong Kong and other third countries is increased, Russia will not be able to produce missiles and other weapons.

Lukashenko appoints Alexander Turchin as Belarus's new PM	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has appointed Alexander Turchin as the country&#x2019;s new prime minister, state-owned news agency Belta reported on March 10. Turchin, who previously served as head of the Minsk regional executive committee, held key government positions, including chief of staff of the Council of Ministers in 2016 and first deputy prime minister in 2018-2019. After his appointment, Turchin told reporters that Belarus would not see any &quot;significant course correction,&quot; adding that his approach would be one of &quot;evolution without revolutions.&quot; Turchin is replacing Roman Golovchenko, who has held the office of prime minister since June 2020 and was now appointed head of the National Bank. Lukashenko presented the personnel changes as the advent of a &quot;new generation&quot; in Belarusian leadership. Lukashenko, in power since 1994 and widely regarded as Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s close ally, has faced repeated accusations of election fraud. His self-declared victory in the 2020 presidential election, widely denounced as illegitimate, triggered mass protests in Minsk that were brutally suppressed with Moscow&#x2019;s backing. Since then, over 8,000 people have been detained for political reasons, according to the Belarusian human rights group Viasna. On Jan. 26, Lukashenko claimed a seventh term in office in another election widely condemned as neither free nor fair. Though Belarus has not directly participated in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, it has allowed the Kremlin to use its territory as a staging ground for military operations.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-appoints-new-belarus-prime-minister/	2025-03-10T05:48:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/595a60fb-8831-3f7c-fa06-c257a42d8a53.jpg
Ukraine to buy 4.5 million FPV drones in 2025	Ukraine plans to purchase 4.5 million first-person-view (FPV) drones this year as part of a large-scale effort to equip its military with advanced technologies, the Defense Ministry reported on March 10. The total cost of the procurement exceeds Hr 110 billion ($2.6 billion), with Hr 102 billion ($2.4 billion) allocated through the Defense Procurement Agency. FPV drones, which are cost-effective and capable of precise targeting, have proven highly effective in destroying expensive military equipment. The Defense Ministry purchased several thousands of drones in 2023, while the following year, the amount increased to 1.5 million, said Hlib Kanevsky, head of the ministry&apos;s procurement department. Roughly 96% of the allocated sum went to Ukrainian producers and suppliers. Both Ukraine and Russia have increasingly relied on drone warfare, using aerial, naval, and ground-based drones for reconnaissance and combat missions. The number of Russian targets destroyed by Ukrainian drones rose by 22% in February compared to January, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi reported. Kyiv has also been accelerating the production of long-range missile-drone hybrids, with President Volodymyr Zelensky setting a target of at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-buy-4-5-million-fpv-drones-in-2025/	2025-03-10T05:10:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1574618594.jpg
Russia's arms exports plunge by 47% since full-scale invasion's start, SIPRI reports	Russia&apos;s arms exports fell by 47% in 2024 compared to 2022, when Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to a March report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). The decline is attributed to Russia prioritizing weapons production for its own military, the impact of Western sanctions, and increased pressure from the U.S. and its allies on countries purchasing Russian arms, the report said. Since 2022, Western sanctions have targeted Russian banks, energy exports, and dual-use goods, further straining Moscow&#x2019;s arms trade. Over the past five years, Russian arms exports have dropped by 64%, shrinking the country&#x2019;s global market share to 7.8%. While Russia supplied arms to 47 countries between 2018 and 2022, that number dropped to 33 in 2024. Asia and Oceania accounted for 74% of Russian exports, Africa 12%, and Europe 7.4%. India remains Russia&#x2019;s largest buyer, accounting for 38% of sales, followed by China (17%) and Kazakhstan (11%). Russia is still set to deliver arms under deals with India, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. Despite its declining market share, Russia remains one of the world&#x2019;s top three arms exporters, SIPRI noted. The U.S. continues to lead, controlling 43% of global arms exports.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-arms-exports-plunge-by-47-since-full-scale-invasion-sipri-reports/	2025-03-10T04:48:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2006245916.jpg
Russia attempting to gain foothold in Sumy Oblast, Border Guard warns	Russian forces are attempting to establish a foothold near Novenke, a Ukrainian village in Sumy Oblast near the border with Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, State Border Guard spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said on air on March 10. The news comes after Russia reportedly achieved a breakthrough in Kursk Oblast, seeking to encircle the Ukrainian forces fighting there and penetrate the Ukrainian border. &quot;These are small assault units, composed of a few people. They try to penetrate our territory, accumulate forces, and advance further into Ukraine, probably to cut off logistical routes,&quot; Demchenko said on national television. Moscow&apos;s troops have been reportedly trying to push toward Novenke, a village lying 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the regional center, Sumy, for several weeks. The battlefield situation at the Ukraine-Russia border areas of the Sumy and Kursk oblasts as of March 10, 2025, according to DeepState. The village of Novenke marked with a black symbol, the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast marked in blue. (DeepState/Open Street Maps)Ukrainian artillery and drone units continue attacking Russian troops, preventing them from accumulating forces, the spokesperson added. Concerns about the Ukrainian operation in Kursk Oblast, ongoing since August 2024, have mounted over the weekend amid reports of Russian advances. The development came shortly after the U.S. cut off military and intelligence support for Ukraine, allegedly to push Kyiv to the negotiating table. A potential loss of the Kursk salient or Russian advances in Sumy Oblast would likely weaken Ukraine&apos;s negotiating position as it prepares for initial rounds of talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia. Russian forces have begun collapsing the northern part of the Ukrainian Kursk salient, while destroyed bridges complicate Ukraine&apos;s ability to withdraw toward the key town of Sudzha, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think-tank said on March 9. Moscow has also reportedly deployed North Korean troops in the renewed attack in Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-attempting-to-gain-foothold-in-sumy-oblast-border-guard-warns/	2025-03-10T04:33:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204125313.jpg
Ukrainian drones mark 22% increase in Russian target destruction in February, Syrskyi says	The number of Russian targets destroyed by Ukrainian drones increased by 22% in February compared to January, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi reported on March 10, underscoring the importance of unmanned systems on the battlefield. The commander noted that first-person-view (FPV) drones and multi-rotor bombers remain the most effective tools. &quot;Unmanned systems have become one of the most important elements of warfare that save the lives of our soldiers,&quot; Syrskyi said after a monthly meeting on drone development. He stressed the need to introduce a unified standard for unmanned systems in Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces to improve coordination between units. Syrskyi also warned that Russia is rapidly adapting to Ukraine&#x2019;s drone warfare strategies and developing its own technologies, including fiber-optic-controlled drones. &quot;We have no right to lag behind... (Russia) in the technological war and must strengthen ourselves at the expense of our own resources,&quot; he added. Kyiv has significantly expanded domestic drone production over the past year, integrating drones into reconnaissance and combat operations. On Feb. 9, the Defense Ministry launched the &quot;Drone Line&quot; initiative to accelerate their deployment on the battlefield. Ukraine has also developed long-range missile-drone hybrids, such as the Palianytsia and Peklo models, featuring turbojet engines as alternatives to cruise missiles. President Volodymyr Zelensky has set a target of producing at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-drones-february/	2025-03-10T04:14:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2171705016.jpg
US officially closes 83% of USAID programs	The U.S. has officially canceled 83% of U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs, with the roughly 1,000 remaining contracts to be administered by the State Department, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 10. The decision to cancel 5,200 USAID contracts comes after a six-week review of the U.S.&apos;s top foreign aid agency, which the Trump administration accused of waste, fraud, and pushing a &quot;liberal agenda.&quot; Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support to Kyiv. The agency has funded school reconstruction, bomb shelters, critical energy repairs, and civil society initiatives. Elon Musk, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s ally who supposedly oversees the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has led the charge against USAID, laying off staff and attacking the agency in public, often making baseless or false claims about its work. Rubio thanked DOGE for &quot;this overdue and historic reform,&quot; claiming that the aborted contracts have &quot;spent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States.&quot; He did not provide any examples of how USAID programs endangered U.S. interests. The cuts are nevertheless smaller than indicated by a statement from the Trump administration last month, which talked about slashing 90% of all contracts. USAID cuts mark a significant realignment of U.S. foreign policy, which saw the Trump administration adopt increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Ukraine and other partners while seeking to renew ties with Moscow. The mass cancelation of USAID contracts also threatens various Ukrainian organizations and projects across multiple sectors, including energy, education, media, and humanitarian support.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-officially-closes-83-of-usaid-programs/	2025-03-10T03:36:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197486320.jpg
Ukraine arrests Kharkiv resident suspected of bombing, poisoning plot on Russia's behalf	Ukrainian security forces have detained a suspected agent of Russian intelligence who allegedly orchestrated an explosion near a war veteran&#x2019;s home and poisoned a soldier under the guise of providing volunteer aid, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reported on March 10. According to the investigation, the suspect, an IT specialist from Kharkiv, was recruited by Russian intelligence services and tasked with assembling improvised explosive devices (IEDs) containing metal fragments to maximize casualties. She allegedly hid one of the devices in a designated cache, where an accomplice retrieved it and placed it near the home of a Ukrainian army veteran. The explosion injured the veteran, who was later hospitalized. The SBU also accused the woman of poisoning a soldier by lacing food and medicine with toxic substances while posing as a volunteer. The serviceman was hospitalized and is in serious condition. Investigators believe Russian intelligence operatives first approached the suspect before the full-scale invasion when she was visiting relatives in Russia. By early 2025, she was receiving direct instructions from her handlers, the SBU said. Authorities are now investigating her potential involvement in other crimes. The court has ordered her detention without bail while the case proceeds.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-arrest-suspected-russian-agent-in-kharkiv-over-bombing-poisoning-plot/	2025-03-10T03:10:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/c0b50b27d0cf14e59599c06e8af88ab2.jpeg
EU prepares for possible Hungarian veto on Russia sanctions extension, media reports	The European Union is bracing for a potential Hungarian veto on extending sanctions against Russia, which are set to expire on March 15, Euractiv reported on March 10, citing undisclosed sources. EU diplomats were reportedly surprised that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban did not attempt to block the conclusions of the March 6 European Council meeting on Ukraine. The Hungarian prime minister declined to sign the summit&apos;s declaration in support of Ukraine, but the document was nevertheless published with the endorsement of 26 member states. Orban, widely regarded as the EU&apos;s most pro-Russian leader, has repeatedly opposed military aid for Ukraine and warned that Ukraine&apos;s EU membership would &quot;destroy&quot; Hungary. He has maintained ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin despite Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, amplifying Kremlin narratives in Europe. Diplomats suspect Orban&#x2019;s restraint at the summit was linked to the upcoming renewal of EU sanctions on Russia, which require unanimous approval from all 27 member states, Euractiv reported. The Hungarian prime minister has a history of leveraging EU decision-making to extract concessions. He has previously secured exemptions for Russian Patriarch Kirill and the domestic use of Russian oil products. Patriarch Kirill, a Kremlin ally and head of the Russian Orthodox Church, has openly supported Russia&#x2019;s war, yet Budapest has repeatedly blocked EU efforts to sanction him. The EU&apos;s sanctions framework includes economic measures and a list of over 2,400 individuals and entities subject to asset freezes and travel bans. If Hungary blocks the renewal, it could force the EU to negotiate additional compromises or risk a lapse in sanctions enforcement.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-prepares-for-possible-hungarian-veto-on-russia-sanctions-extension-media-reports/	2025-03-10T03:02:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2097682027.jpg
Come to Bucha, JD Vance	During a heated exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, U.S. Vice President JD Vance accused the Ukrainian president of leading &#x201C;propaganda tours&#x201D; of Russia&#x2019;s destruction in the country. Zelensky, in turn, asked Vance if he had ever been to Ukraine. Of course, Vance&#x2019;s criticism of Ukraine is not new. In a New York Times op-ed released in April 2024, Vance argued that America shouldn&#x2019;t help Ukraine, citing the burden of producing weapon systems like 155 mm shells and Patriot missiles. He suggested that the U.S. should pressure Ukraine to surrender territory it has lost to Russia and claimed that supporting Ukraine &#x201C;doesn&#x2019;t add up.&#x201D; Before Vance makes further assumptions and jeopardizes diplomatic relations with Ukraine, I&#x2019;m pleading &#x2014; with all due respect, as a fellow Ohioan &#x2014; for him to do what I did: travel to Ukraine and visit the town of Bucha, located in the suburbs of Kyiv. Bucha is the site of some of the first war crimes committed by the Russian army in Ukraine, uncovered in the initial months of the full-scale war. Seeing Bucha will help Vance understand that this war is about more than just territory; it&#x2019;s a war between good and evil. I&#x2019;m not an aid worker or foreign fighter. My visit to Ukraine was personal. In the early 2000s, as a record executive for Universal Music Group, I helped develop Ukraine&#x2019;s music industry. In May 2023, after more than a year of full-scale war, I traveled to Kyiv to check on my colleagues. I took the Kyiv Express, a 17-hour train from Warsaw to Kyiv. I saw destruction everywhere: bombed-out apartment buildings, malls, and machine gun-riddled cars and homes. Even a statue of the poet Taras Shevchenko had been shot up in the Borodianka town square. One of my colleagues offered to bring me to Bucha. Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw. I visited the site where mass graves were uncovered behind the local church. I spoke with an elderly church worker who survived the massacre by hiding in the basement for days. Listening to her terrifying account and seeing the destruction firsthand made it clear to me: this is a war of good versus evil. Bodies of civilians are seen in Bucha, Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine, on April 2, 2022, after the Russian army&apos;s retreat from the city amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine.

(Ronaldo Schemidt / AFP via Getty Images)Bucha is one of many reasons why Ukraine cannot simply surrender territory to Russia. The war crimes uncovered in Bucha were revealed only after the Russian army was driven out, three months after its occupation. In the territories Vance wants to hand over to Russia, war crimes have been committed daily for over two years &#x2014; including torture, executions, and the kidnapping of children. By suggesting America should pull back from helping Ukraine, Vance risks ignoring these atrocities. As a loyal Republican, Vance would do well to look to former U.S. President Ronald Reagan for inspiration. Reagan confronted evil with steely determination, resulting in the end of the Cold War. For Reagan, American values justified confronting the Soviet Union &#x2014; not excuses like production problems in weapons factories. Reagan, who loved Ohio and won the state&#x2019;s presidential election twice, understood the crucial role Ohio&#x2019;s military bases and weapons manufacturing played in the Cold War. But if Reagan were here today, I believe he would strongly disagree with Vance&#x2019;s policy of weakness. As a fellow Ohioan, I don&#x2019;t understand Vance&#x2019;s weak view of America. I grew up on a family farm in central Ohio, but we were both raised with the same Midwestern values &#x2014; to support good and confront evil. And what the Russian army is doing in Ukraine is among the greatest evils of this century. Both of us learned about Ohio&#x2019;s greatest figures in public schools, from abolitionists Harriet Beecher Stowe and Sojourner Truth to astronauts John Glenn and Neil Armstrong &#x2014; individuals who demonstrated courage and bravery. Most of Vance&#x2019;s constituents in Ohio support Ukraine. The Midwest is the heartland, and Ohioans consider ourselves the heart of America. What happened to your heart, Vance? Come to Bucha, Vance. You may find it there.

Russia expels 2 British diplomats, accuses them of espionage	Russia said on March 10 it had stripped the accreditation of two British nationals linked to the U.K. Embassy in Moscow, accusing them of espionage and &quot;subversive&quot; activities and ordering them to leave within two weeks. The move comes as the latest tit-for-tat move in a diplomatic row between London and Moscow. Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed it had &quot;identified signs of intelligence and subversive work&quot; by a second secretary of the British Embassy in Moscow and the spouse of another British diplomat. The FSB did not provide evidence to support the claims nor revealed further details of the diplomats&apos; alleged activities. The British Embassy denied the allegations as &quot;completely baseless,&quot; independent outlet Meduza reported, citing the Embassy&apos;s spokesperson. The U.K. previously expelled a Russian diplomat in February, while Moscow threw out six U.K. Embassy staff members in September 2024. Tensions between Russia and the U.K. have been mounting since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and London threw its military and political backing behind Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-expels-2-brits-accuses-them-of-espionage/	2025-03-10T02:43:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2170878445.jpg
No US-Russia meetings planned this week, Moscow says, denying media claims	No U.S.-Russia meetings will take place this week, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told Russian state-owned news agency TASS on March 10, disputing claims in the media. &quot;(A meeting) is not planned. Moreover, we received no information from the American side,&quot; Zakharova said in response to a journalist&apos;s question. This comes as CNN reported, citing a source, that the U.S. will hold separate meetings with Ukrainian and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia this week. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. The possible meeting would follow previous rounds of U.S.-Russia talks in Riyadh on Feb. 18 and Istanbul on Feb. 27. The news came amid U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s push for a swift settlement to the war, raising concerns that Washington is sidelining Ukraine and European allies in the process. Ukrainian and U.S. delegations are set to meet in Jeddah on March 11 to discuss a potential peace agreement with Russia and negotiations on a critical minerals deal. U.S. officials will reportedly assess Ukraine&#x2019;s willingness to mend ties with Washington following a contentious Oval Office exchange between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28. The fallout from that meeting led to the suspension of all U.S. military aid to Ukraine, worth billions, and a halt in intelligence sharing, potentially hampering Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to detect Russian missile strikes and conduct long-range attacks. The Financial Times reported that Ukraine is expected to push for the restoration of U.S. military and intelligence support at the March 11 meeting. As part of its negotiating position, Kyiv is reportedly prepared to propose a partial ceasefire covering long-range drone and missile strikes, as well as hostilities in the Black Sea, in hopes of securing renewed U.S. backing. Trump told reporters on March 9 that he expects Ukraine to sign the long-debated critical minerals deal with the U.S. but also wants to see indications that Kyiv is prepared for peace. Zelensky and European leaders have repeatedly stressed that security guarantees, including long-term U.S. support, must accompany any ceasefire agreement. Washington has yet to provide such assurances. Following his meeting with Trump, Zelensky reaffirmed Ukraine&#x2019;s commitment to working with the U.S. toward a negotiated settlement.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-us-meeting/	2025-03-10T02:11:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1237721878.jpg
Ukraine, German arms maker seek to triple IRIS-T air defense supply	Ukraine has signed a memorandum with German defense manufacturer Diehl Defense to triple the supply of IRIS-T air defense systems and missiles, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on March 9. The deal comes as Ukraine faces intensified Russian aerial assaults, including Russia&#x2019;s strike on Feb. 23, which marked the single largest drone attack since the start of the full-scale invasion. &quot;The signed agreement paves the way for large industrial projects that will strengthen the capabilities of Ukraine&apos;s air defense,&quot; Umerov wrote on Facebook. The IRIS-T is a modern surface-to-air missile system capable of countering aircraft, helicopters, drones, and cruise missiles. Germany has been a key supplier of the system, with outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announcing an order for 17 additional IRIS-T systems for Ukraine last September. In late December, President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed that Ukraine had received Germany&#x2019;s sixth IRIS-T battery.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-diehl-defense-sign-deal/	2025-03-10T01:12:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1241457826.jpeg
6 killed, 22 injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over past day	At least six people were killed and 22 others injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over the past day, regional officials reported on March 10. Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force said it had intercepted 130 of the 176 Russian drones launched overnight, including Shahed-type attack drones. Another 42 drones reportedly disappeared from radars before reaching their targets, indicating they were likely decoys meant to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defenses. Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare systems, aviation, and mobile fire groups repelled the attack. In Donetsk Oblast, three civilians were killed &#x2014; two in Pokrovsk and one in Zoria. Six others were wounded, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. Three more civilians &#x2014; a woman and two men &#x2014; were killed in Kharkiv Oblast by an explosive device dropped from a Russian drone, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Another woman was injured in the attack. In Kherson Oblast, nine people were injured, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a 56-year-old woman was hospitalized and is in moderate condition as a result of a Russian attack, and an 18-year-old girl was treated at the scene, Governor Serhii Lysak said. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, a 16-year-old boy and two men, aged 65 and 67, were wounded. A 79-year-old woman was also injured in an artillery strike, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-over-past-day-2/	2025-03-10T00:29:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-10_05-31-36.jpg

Half of global population descended from ancient group in what is now Ukraine, DNA research shows	Half of the human beings alive today are descended from the Yamnaya culture, a group that lived in what is now Ukraine 5,000 years ago, according to new DNA research led by David Reich, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School, the Wall Street Journal reported on March 8. Around 4 billion people can trace their ancestry to the Yamnaya, a community of cattle herders who lived in the areas that make up the modern-day Ukraine and expanded dramatically across Europe and Asia, the research shows. Researchers identified the village of Mykhailivka, lying in the Russian-occupied part of Kherson Oblast, as the genetic birthplace of the Indo-European peoples who spread across the European continent and West Asia in waves of migrations. The equestrian culture, dubbed Yamnaya after the pits (yama in Ukrainian and Russian) in which they buried their dead beneath mounds called kurgans, is seen as a shared ancestor to various ancient peoples, including the Romans, Celts, Persians, and Macedonians. The new DNA research analyzed remains of 450 prehistoric individuals from 100 sites across Europe and 1,000 previously known ancient samples, reinforcing earlier theories on the spread of the Yamnaya culture based on archeological and linguistic evidence. The ongoing Russian occupation of the Yamnaya culture&apos;s cradle undercores the damage wrought to Ukraine&apos;s cultural heritage by Moscow&apos;s war. As of February, 485 Ukrainian cultural sites have been confirmed as damaged during the war, including two archeological sites. Russia has also consistently looted Ukrainian artifacts from Crimea, Donbas, and elsewhere since 2014, transporting many to Russian museums.	https://kyivindependent.com/half-global-population-descended-from-ancient-group-who-lived-in-ukraine-new-dna-research-shows/	2025-03-10T00:20:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1437004229.jpg
Ukraine to push for resumption of US military, intelligence support at Saudi talks, FT reports	Ukrainian officials will push for the resumption of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing at upcoming talks in Saudi Arabia, the Financial Times reported on March 9, citing its undisclosed sources. Ukrainian and U.S. delegations are set to meet in Jeddah on March 11 to discuss a potential peace agreement with Russia and negotiations on a critical minerals deal. As part of its strategy, Kyiv is reportedly prepared to propose a partial ceasefire covering long-range drone and missile strikes, as well as hostilities in the Black Sea, in hopes that progress in talks will prompt Washington to lift its freeze on military and intelligence support. Following President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s heated meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, Washington suspended all military aid to Ukraine, worth billions. CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed on March 5 that the U.S. had also halted intelligence sharing, potentially limiting Ukraine&apos;s ability to detect Russian missile strikes and carry out long-range attacks. Two European officials told the FT that Ukraine views making progress in ceasefire talks as a necessary step to regaining U.S. support. A U.S. official told Reuters that the Jeddah meeting will serve as a test of Ukraine&#x2019;s willingness to make concessions to Russia in pursuit of a peace deal. Trump told reporters on March 9 that he expects Ukraine to sign the critical minerals deal with the U.S. but also wants to see signals that Kyiv is prepared for peace. Zelensky and European leaders have repeatedly emphasized that security guarantees, including long-term U.S. support, must accompany any ceasefire agreement. Washington has not offered such assurances. Following his Oval Office meeting with Trump, Zelensky struck a conciliatory tone, reaffirming Ukraine&#x2019;s commitment to working with the U.S. toward a peace agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-push-for-resumption-of-us-military-aid-intelligence-sharing-at-saudi-talks-ft-reports/	2025-03-09T23:50:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1494251171-1.jpeg
Drones reportedly attack 'one of 10 largest' Russian oil refineries	Drones attacked the Novokuybyshevsk oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Samara Oblast overnight on March 10, the independent Telegram channel Astra and a Ukrainian official claimed. Ukraine has systematically targeted Russian oil refineries, military sites, and warehouses deep behind the front lines to undermine Moscow&apos;s capacity to wage its all-out war. Samara Oblast residents reported loud explosions overnight, Astra wrote, adding that a fire was recorded at the Rosneft-run oil facility. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. The refinery&apos;s &quot;capacity amounts to 8.8 million metric tons of oil per year, making it one of the 10 largest (refineries) in Russia,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. The plant produces gasoline, diesel fuel, and fuel oil, &quot;which are critically important for transport and military equipment,&quot; the official added. The city of Novokuybyshevsk lies roughly 900 kilometers (560 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. &quot;This refinery is strategically important for the Russian military as it ensures a stable fuel supply for military operations,&quot; Kovalenko said. The Russian pro-state agency RBC reported a fire at a warehouse in Novokuybyshevsk that covered an area of 1,500 square meters later the same day, without mentioning a drone attack. No casualties were reported. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its forces had shot down nine Ukrainian drones overnight, including three over Samara Oblast, two each over the Voronezh and Oryol oblasts, and one each over the Belgorod and Kursk oblasts. On March 9, a Ukrainian drone reportedly attacked an oil depot in Cheboksary in Russia&apos;s Chuvashia Republic, marking the first strike against the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-reportedly-attack-russian-refinery-in-samara-oblast/	2025-03-09T23:33:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-630457640.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 886,320 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 886,320 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on March 10. This number includes 1,190 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,292 tanks, 21,400 armored fighting vehicles, 40,071 vehicles and fuel tanks, 24,271 artillery systems, 1,311 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,102 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 28,603 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-885-130-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022-2/	2025-03-09T23:13:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1258556806.jpeg
Lammy vows to unfreeze billions for Ukraine from Russian oligarch's Chelsea FC sale	U.K. Foreign Minister David Lammy vowed on March 9 to unfreeze billions of dollars of revenue earned from Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich&apos;s sale of the Chelsea Football Club (FC) and send the funds to Ukraine. Abramovich was forced to sell Chelsea FC once sanctions were enacted against him following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Abramovich and U.K. officials previously promised the funds from the sale would go to Ukraine. &quot;I&apos;m frustrated that it hasn&apos;t happened, is the truth &#x2014; and that money needs to be distributed, it needs to be used,&quot; Lammy told the Financial Times (FT) on March 9. 2.3 billion pounds ($2.97 billion) are currently frozen in a U.K. dedicated trust as officials decide how to obtain and utilize the funds. &quot;I&apos;m determined to see that money get out the door and to do all I can to bring that about,&quot; Lammy said. There are legal complexities, but Lammy said his &quot;first instinct is not litigation&quot; because of how long it could take. The U.K. government previously reported that the funds intended to help Ukraine remained in limbo due to a disagreement between U.K. officials and Abramovich. Ukraine&apos;s European allies are rushing to increase support following a military aid pause from the U.S. The U.K. has promised to deliver more military aid to Kyiv this year than ever before.	https://kyivindependent.com/lammy-vows-to-unfreeze-billions-for-ukraine-from-formerly-oligarch-owned-chelsea-fc/	2025-03-09T21:57:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2197755073.jpg
US to assess if Ukraine ready for 'realistic peace' at upcoming meeting, Reuters reports	The U.S. delegation that is set to meet with its Ukrainian counterpart on March 11 will assess if Ukraine is ready for a &quot;realistic peace,&quot; Reuters reported on March 10, citing unnamed officials. Ukrainians and U.S. officials will meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to discuss the framework of a peace agreement with Russia and continue talks on a critical minerals deal. The U.S. delegation will reportedly be looking for hints Ukraine is committed to improving ties with Washington following a heated argument between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 28. &quot;We want to see if the Ukrainians are interested not just in peace, but in a realistic peace,&quot; an unnamed U.S. official said. As part of their assessment, U.S. officials want to see whether or not Ukraine is ready to make concessions to Russia in order to end the war. &quot;You can&apos;t say &apos;I want peace,&apos; and, &apos;I refuse to compromise on anything,&apos;&quot; an unnamed official said. &quot;If they are only interested in 2014 or 2022 borders, that tells you something,&quot; another official said. Earlier on March 9, NBC News reported that the Trump administration did not plan to resume intelligence sharing and providing military aid until Zelensky indicated he was willing to make territorial concessions to Russia as part of a peace deal. The U.S. froze military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine in the days following the Oval Office clash. Trump told reporters on March 9 that the U.S. was &quot;just about&quot; to lift the pause on intelligence sharing. He also said he was optimistic about the Saudi Arabia talks. &quot;We&apos;re going to make a lot of progress, I believe, this week,&quot; he said. The delegation will be led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Trump&apos;s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. The officials previously met with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. The two sides discussed restoring bilateral relations and held preliminary peace talks without Ukraine&apos;s participation.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-will-assess-if-ukraine-ready-for-realistic-peace-at-upcoming-meeting-reuters-reports/	2025-03-09T20:44:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199704911.jpg
JD Vance's cousin, former volunteer fighter in Ukraine, condemns VP's 'ambush' of Zelensky	Nate Vance, the cousin of U.S. Vice President JD Vance and a volunteer fighting on Ukraine&apos;s front lines, said he is &quot;disappointed&quot; in his relative&apos;s stance on Ukraine. Vance, a former U.S. Marine, defended Ukraine from 2022 to January 2025 as a member of the Da Vinci Wolves First Motorized Battalion, a volunteer unit. &quot;Being your family doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m going to accept you killing my comrades,&quot; Vance said in an interview with Le Figaro published on March 9. Vance&apos;s remarks come at a low point in U.S.-Ukrainian relations, as Washington has halted intelligence sharing and military aid to Kyiv. The freeze followed a contentious meeting in the Oval Office between U.S. President Donald Trump, Vice President Vance, and President Volodymyr Zelensky. &#xA0; Nate Vance said he was disappointed in how his cousin treated Zelensky during the meeting. &quot;When (JD Vance) criticized aid to Ukraine, I thought it was because he needed to appeal to his electorate, that it was part of the political game,&quot; Vance said. &quot;But what they did to Zelensky was an ambush of absolute dishonesty.&quot; The vice president&apos;s continued distrust of Zelensky is unjustified, as are his views on Ukraine, Vance said. &quot;I thought I was going to choke ... His own cousin was on the front lines. I could have told him the truth, without pretense, without personal interest. He never tried to find out more.&quot; Vance said he tried to get in touch with his cousin several times with no success. &quot;I left messages at his office. I never heard from him,&quot; he said. Vance volunteered to fight in Ukraine following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, but left shortly before the U.S. presidential inauguration out of fear of being captured by the Russian army. &quot;It had become complicated to stay. I couldn&apos;t take the risk of being captured,&quot; he said. JD Vance has criticized Ukraine and Zelensky in the past, at times repeating Kremlin talking points. Protestors confronted the vice president for his treatment of Zelensky on several occasions following the Feb. 28 meeting.	https://kyivindependent.com/cousin-of-jd-vance-decries-vps-stance-on-ukraine/	2025-03-09T20:12:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201826980.jpg
US has 'just about' lifted pause on intelligence sharing with Ukraine, Trump tells media	The United States has &quot;just about&quot; ended its freeze on intelligence sharing with Kyiv, U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on March 9. CIA Director John Ratcliffe announced on March 5 that the U.S. had halted intelligence sharing with Ukraine, amid the fallout of the White House argument between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The move followed Washington&apos;s decision to immediately freeze all military aid to Ukraine. According to Reuters, when asked whether the U.S. would end the suspension of intelligence sharing, Trump told reporters, &quot;We just about have. We just about have.&quot; Trump also said he was optimistic about the upcoming talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia. Delegations will meet in the city of Jeddah on March 11 to discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. The meeting comes at a low point in U.S.-Ukrainian relations, with Washington exerting enormous pressure on Kyiv to accept a peace deal regardless of security guarantees. The pause on intelligence sharing has left Ukraine&apos;s civilians more vulnerable to deadly Russian aerial attacks. The New York Times (NYT) reported on March 6 that the freeze could affect crucial warnings about incoming Russian drones and missiles. In the days after the freeze went into effect, Russia carried out missile attacks on the cities of Kryvyi Rih and Dopropillia, killing 15 people and injuring over 80. According to Zelensky, Russia launched nearly 1,200 aerial bombs, almost 870 attack drones, and over 80 missiles at Ukraine over the past week. &#xA0; The U.S. has not indicated when it will resume sharing intelligence or providing military aid. The Saudi Arabia talks will be an opportunity for the U.S. to assess Ukraine&apos;s readiness to make concessions to Russia in order to advance a peace deal, U.S. officials told Reuters. Trump told reporters on March 9 that he believes Ukraine will sign a deal on critical minerals with the U.S., but that he also wants to see indications that Kyiv is ready for peace. &quot;They will sign the minerals deal but I want them to want peace ... They haven&apos;t shown it to extent they should,&quot; he said. Zelensky and European leaders have repeatedly stressed the importance of security guarantees backed by U.S. support to ensure the success of any future ceasefire agreement with Russia. The U.S. has not offered to provide any such assurances. In a conciliatory statement issued after the Oval Office meeting, Zelensky reiterated his willingness to work with the U.S. towards a peace agreement. &quot;Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-has-just-about-lifted-pause-on-intelligence-sharing-with-ukraine-trump-tells-media/	2025-03-09T19:34:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203694542.jpg
Ditching Ukraine would 'be worse than Afghanistan,' Republican senator says	The U.S. cannot cut off aid to Ukraine while it fights against Russia, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on March 9. The U.S. froze intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine soon after a heated argument broke out between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House on Feb. 28. U.S. officials have suggested the pause is &quot;temporary,&quot; without indicating when aid will resume. &quot;If we pull the plug on Ukraine, it&apos;d be worse than Afghanistan. I don&apos;t think (Trump) has any desire to do that,&quot; Graham said in a television interview on March 9. Until a ceasefire is reached, the U.S. must continue to assist Ukraine with military aid and intelligence sharing, the U.S. Senator continued. &quot;I am worried about cutting off intelligence and weapons to Ukraine as long as the fighting is going on,&quot; Graham said. The U.S. senator added he will introduce legislation to sanction Russia&apos;s banking and energy sectors &quot;next week&quot; in a bid to bring Moscow to the negotiating table. &quot;If they don&apos;t engage in ceasefire and peace talks with the administration, we should sanction the hell out of them,&quot; Graham said. Trump previously claimed he is considering imposing extensive tariffs and banking sanctions on Russia until a peace agreement is reached. &quot;Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely &apos;pounding&apos; Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large-scale banking sanctions, sanctions, and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and final settlement agreement on peace is reached,&quot; Trump said on March 7. Trump&apos;s administration has faced scrutiny for its mounting hostility towards Ukraine, a longstanding ally, alongside increasingly friendly attitudes toward Russia. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/ditching-ukraine-would-be-worse-than-afghanistan-us-senator-says/	2025-03-09T18:10:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1838188594.jpg
Ukraine 'may not survive,' Trump says	Ukraine &quot;may not survive&quot; Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion with or without American support, U.S. President Donald Trump told the right-wing media outlet Fox News in an interview on March 9. Trump&apos;s administration has faced scrutiny for its decision to stop providing critical military aid and intelligence to Kyiv &#x2014; a move that has been celebrated by the Kremlin. Fox News correspondent Maria Bartiromo questioned Trump about a statement from Polish President Andrezj Duda, who said in a previous interview with Fox that Ukraine would not survive without U.S. support. &quot;Are you comfortable with that? The fact that you walked away, and Ukraine may not survive?&quot; Bartiromo asked. &quot;Well, it may not survive anyway,&quot; Trump said. Trump then pivoted to his preferred talking points on the war in Ukraine &#x2014;&#xA0;the failures of former U.S. President Joe Biden, and Trump&apos;s belief that the war would not have started if he had won the 2020 presidential election. In the same interview, Trump accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of not being grateful for American assistance and claimed that he&apos;d been &quot;tougher&quot; on Russia &quot;than anybody&apos;s ever been.&quot; &#xA0; Trump did not directly address his decision to freeze military aid, nor did he say when or under what conditions the U.S. might resume weapons shipments. The decision to halt aid and intelligence sharing came immediately after the collapse of a natural resources deal between the U.S. and Ukraine, something the White House has touted as an essential way for the U.S. to &quot;recoup&quot; the money it has sent Kyiv throughout the full-scale war. While negotiations have resumed, NBC News reported earlier on March 9 that Trump will not unfreeze military aid even if the deal goes through. Trump wants to see a change in Zelensky&apos;s stance toward peace talks and a willingness to make territorial concessions to Russia, senior officials said. U.S. and Ukrainian delegations are planning to meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 to discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz suggested on March 5 that Trump may lift the pause on military aid once peace negotiations are arranged and confidence-building measures are taken, Reuters reported. Despite its insistence on forging a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, Washington has not agreed to provide Kyiv with any security guarantees following a potential ceasefire. Trump has also previously expressed ambivalence regarding Ukraine&apos;s ongoing sovereignty. In a Feb. 10 interview with Fox News, he said Ukraine &quot;may be Russian someday.&quot; &#xA0;Trump stressed that no matter the war&apos;s outcome, the U.S. wants its money back.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-may-not-survive-trump-says/	2025-03-09T17:47:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201520423.jpg
Nobody has been tougher on Russia,' Trump says	&quot;Nobody has been tougher on Russia,&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump told Fox News on March 9, in repsonse to criticisms that his administration has been friendly to the Kremlin. Trump&apos;s claim comes amid a U.S. freeze on intelligence sharing and military aid to Kyiv, as the full-scale war enters its fourth year and Russian forces intensify their assaults in eastern Ukraine. &quot;I think I&apos;ve been very tough to Russia,&quot; Trump told the right-wing media outlet Fox News in an interview. &quot;Tougher than anybody&apos;s ever been to Russia, if you think about it.&quot; Instead of responding to the current freeze on aid to Kyiv or Washington&apos;s apparent support of Russian demands, Trump focused on his actions during his first term as president. In particular, he repeated his claim that he &quot;stopped&quot; Russia&apos;s construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. During his first term, Trump signed off on a Congressional measure imposing sanctions against any businesses that contributed to the completion of the undersea pipeline, built to funnel Russian gas into Europe. &#xA0; &quot;I&apos;m the one that put sanctions on Russia,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I&apos;m the one that gave the javelins against Russia. I&apos;ve been very tough.&quot; Trump had little to say about the present state of affairs between the U.S., Russia, and Ukraine, though earlier in the interview he accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of not being grateful to the U.S. When asked if he was comfortable with risking Ukraine&apos;s very survival by withdrawing U.S. support, Trump did not give a firm answer. &quot;It may not survive anyway,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/nobody-has-been-tougher-on-russia-trump-says/	2025-03-09T17:03:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Trump.png
Starlink will 'never' shut off its terminals in Ukraine, Musk says	Starlink will never shut off its satellite internet terminals in Ukraine, U.S. billionaire Elon Musk said in a post to social media on March 9. Previously, European officials voiced concern Starlink could cut off Ukraine&apos;s access to its internet service, which is crucial to the war effort. Musk and top White House officials clashed with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski over the legitimacy of such concerns earlier on March 9. &quot;To be extremely clear, no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals,&quot; Musk said in a post to his social media platform, X. Ukraine&apos;s front line would collapse if it were not for Starlink internet access, Musk claimed, saying that the Russian army can &quot;jam&quot; all other forms of communication. &quot;We would never do such a thing or use it as a bargaining chip,&quot; the tech billionaire said. Poland will look for alternative suppliers if SpaceX turns out to be an unreliable provider of Starlink satellite internet for Ukraine, Sikorski said earlier in the day. His remarks drew swift criticism from Musk and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Sikorski should &quot;say thank you because without Starlink, Ukraine would have lost this war long ago and Russians would be on the border with Poland right now,&quot; Rubio said. &quot;Be quiet, small man. You pay a tiny fraction of the cost,&quot; Musk added to Rubio&apos;s remarks. Poland provides half of Ukraine&apos;s total 42,000 Starlinkk terminals, at a cost of about $50 million per year, according to Sikorski. Fears that Ukraine could lose Starlink access arose after Reuters reported on Feb. 21 that the U.S. had threatened to cut off service if Kyiv did not sign a deal on critical natural resources. Musk has denied these claims.	https://kyivindependent.com/starlink-will-never-shut-off-its-terminals-in-ukraine-musk-says/	2025-03-09T16:18:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1259126916.jpeg
Zelensky not grateful for US aid, Trump claims	U.S. President Donald Trump accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of being ungrateful for American military assistance in an interview with Fox News on March 9. Washington stopped providing military aid and intelligence to Kyiv in the wake of a contentious White House meeting on Feb. 28, during which Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance berated Zelensky for not sufficiently thanking the United States. In an interview with the conservative media outlet Fox News, Trump again lambasted Zelensky&apos;s supposed lack of gratitude and blamed former U.S. President Joe Biden for liberally dispensing funds to Ukraine following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;(Zelensky) took money out of this country under Biden like candy from a baby,&quot; Trump claimed. &quot;It was so easy. With that same attitude. I just don&apos;t think he&apos;s grateful.&quot; Trump did not say whether or not he would resume U.S. military aid to Ukraine. U.S. officials, including a senior member of the Trump administration, reportedly told NBC News that Trump does not plan to resume aid and intelligence sharing, even if Kyiv and Washington sign a deal on critical minerals. Trump wants to see a change in Zelensky&apos;s approach to peace talks with Russia and a willingness to make concessions &#xA0;&#x2014;&#xA0;including surrendering Russian-occupied territories to Moscow, officials said. Following the Oval Office confrontation and military aid freeze, Zelensky issued a statement expressing his readiness to participate in peace negotiations and &quot;work under President Trump&apos;s strong leadership.&quot; U.S. and Ukrainian delegations are planning to meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 to discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. An agreement betweenthe U.S. and Ukraine on natural resources remains stalled as Trump seeks a &quot;bigger, better deal,&quot; CBS News reported on March 4. In the meantime, the pause on U.S. intelligence sharing has left Ukrainian cities more vulnerable to Russian aerial strikes. The New York Times (NYT) reported on March 6 that the freeze could affect crucial warnings about incoming Russian drones and missiles. In the week following the freeze, Russia has launched deadly missile strikes on Kryvyi Rih and Dopropillia, killing 15 people and injuring over 80.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-not-grateful-for-us-aid-trump-claims/	2025-03-09T15:52:26-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203672195.jpg
Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh wins gold at European Athletics Indoor Championships	Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh claimed the gold medal at the European Athletics Indoor Championships in Apeldoorn, Netherlands, on March 9. Mahuchikh won the competition by clearing 1.99 meters, Suspilne reported. The 23-year-old high jumper won gold at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games in the women&apos;s high jump event following a jump of 2.00 meters on Aug. 4. Mahuchikh, originally from Dnipro, currently holds the world record for women&apos;s high jump at 2.10 meters and was named world champion in the event in August 2023. She also took home the title of Europe&#x2019;s women&apos;s Athlete of the Year at the 2024 European Athletics Golden Tracks Awards ceremony. On March 8, 23-year-old Oleh Doroshchuk also won gold in the men&#x2019;s high jump division of the same competition, by clearing 2.32 meters.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-high-jumper-yaroslava-mahuchikh-wins-gold-at-european-athletics-indoor-championships/	2025-03-09T14:51:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164919585.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Trump won't resume Ukraine military aid after signing minerals deal; Kursk situation 'difficult but under control'	Key developments on March 8-9: U.S. President Donald Trump has privately made it clear to his aides that he will not resume providing military aid and intelligence to Ukraine even if Kyiv and Washington sign a minerals deal, NBC News reported on March 9, citing an unnamed Trump administration official and another American official. U.S. and Ukrainian delegations are planning to meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 to discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. Trump wants to see a change in President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s stance toward peace talks with Russia and a willingness to make concessions such as giving up occupied territories to Russia, the sources told NBC News. The U.S. president also reportedly wants Zelensky to make some steps toward elections in Ukraine and possibly step down. The news comes amid rising tensions between Ukraine and the U.S., as Trump escalates pressure on Zelensky to expedite a peace process. The tensions culminated in a confrontation during a meeting in the White House Oval Office on Feb. 28 after Zelensky had flown to the U.S. to sign a minerals agreement with the U.S. After being insulted by Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, Zelensky returned to Ukraine without signing the deal. Since that meeting, Washington has halted its military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. Previously, Trump called Zelensky a &quot;dictator,&quot; echoing Russian narratives about the democratically elected Ukrainian leader&apos;s legitimacy. Elections are banned in Ukraine during martial law, which has been in force since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Politico reported that Trump&apos;s team has been leading secret talks with former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko and another opposition leader, Yuliia Tymoshenko. The two opposition leaders reportedly tried to position themselves as more flexible partners for the U.S. than Zelensky. Following the Oval Office clash, Zelensky&apos;s approval rating has risen to 68%, according to a poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology published on March 7. Ukrainian troops had repelled an attack by Russian sabotage and assault groups that used a gas pipeline to gain a foothold on the outskirts of Sudzha in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on March 8, releasing footage of the engagement. The announcement came amid reports that Russian forces had made a breakthrough south of the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha and tried to breach the Russia-Ukraine border in Sumy Oblast earlier this week. Ukrainian troops fighting in Kurks Oblast told the Kyiv Independent on March 7 that Russia had destroyed their supply chains for ammunition and food, and they faced encirclement. After Ukrainian airborne assault troops spotted the Russian forces, they launched missile, artillery, and drones to stop the assault, the General Staff said. &quot;At the moment, Russian special forces are being detected, blocked and destroyed. Enemy losses in the Sudzha area are very heavy,&quot; the military claimed on the evening of March 8. 0:00/1:301&#xD7;The footage shared on March 8, 2025, purporting to show Ukrainian forces repelling a Russian attack in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast (Ukraine&apos;s Air Assault Forces/Telegram) Ukrainian troops repelled 44 Russian attacks in Kursk Oblast over the past day, the General Staff said in its latest update on March 9. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The press service for Kursk military command told the Kyiv Independent on March 8 that &quot;the most large-scale&quot; Russian assault operations have occurred in the direction from the settlement of Korenevo toward Sudzha, as well as in the areas of Novoivanovka, Malaya Loknya, and south of Sudzha. The Ukrainian military described the situation as &quot;difficult&quot; but under control, saying that Russia involved North Korean soldiers in the attack. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, the Russian military claimed. Kyiv has sought to maintain its position in the Russian border region as leverage for possible peace talks. A Ukrainian drone attacked an oil depot in Cheboksary in Russia&apos;s Chuvashia Republic on the morning of March 9, Governor Oleg Nikolaev reported. Russian Telegram channels claimed that this is the first drone attack on Chuvashia since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. The Burevestnik oil depot lies over 900 kilometers (559 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Nikolaev said that the oil depot was under reconstruction. No casualties were reported. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, overnight, Russian air defense shot down 52 drones over Belgorod Oblast, 13 over Lipetsk Oblast, nine over Rostov Oblast, eight over Voronezh Oblast, three over Astrakhan Oblast, one over Ryazan Oblast, one over Kursk Oblast and one over Krashodar Krai. The Russian Telegram channel Astra reported that Ukrainian drones also targeted oil refineries in Lipetsk and Ryazan oblasts. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The Ukrainian military has not commented on Russian reports. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones since 2022. France will provide Ukraine with 195 million euros ($211 million) in military aid using the interest accrued from frozen Russian assets, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu told La Tribune in an interview published March 8. The additional aid &quot;will enable the delivery of 155-mm shells as well as AASM gliding bombs which arm the Ukrainian Mirage 2000s ,&quot; Lecornu said. Lecornu added that France is accelerating the transfer of older equipment to Ukraine, including tanks and armoured vehicles. In October 2024, Group of Seven (G7) countries came to an agreement that pledged to provide Ukraine with almost $50 billion loan backed by the revenue from foreign Russian assets. The announcement from France comes just days after the United Kingdom signed an agreement with Kyiv on March 1 to provide Ukraine with a loan worth 2.26 billion pounds ($2.84 billion) backed by frozen Russian assets. The loan will go towards &quot;purchasing defense equipment according to Ukraine&apos;s needs,&quot; the U.K. Finance Ministry said. While Western countries have frozen $300 billion in Russian assets, they can only access the annual income generated by these funds, approximately $3.2 billion. These profits will back the $50-billion loan to Kyiv, while the vast majority of the assets are frozen in European countries. France, one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters, has taken steps alongside the U.K. in recent months to provide European leadership in supporting Ukraine, amid Kyiv&apos;s tumultuous relationship with the Trump administration. Trump has repeatedly called for European countries to step up to support Ukraine, including providing additional aid funding, lambasting the previous Biden administration for sending too much aid funding to the embattled nation. On March 4, Trump halted military aid shipments to Ukraine following a heated exchange with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on March 2 that a number of European nations, including the U.K. and France, are developing a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; that will include &quot;planes in the air and boots on the ground&quot; in an effort to negotiate a successful ceasefire in Ukraine. Reuters reported on March 6, citing diplomatic sources, that France and the U.K. aim to finalize a peace plan with Ukraine &quot;in days&quot; to present to the United States. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced his delegation to represent Ukraine in upcoming talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia on March 8. Along with Andriy Yermak, Zelensky&apos;s chief of staff, Zelensky wrote on X that Ukraine will also be sending Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Deputy Head of the Presidential Office Pavlo Palisa. Zelensky wrote that he would travel to Saudi Arabia on March 10 and would meet with the Crown Prince, while the Ukrainian military and political delegation would stay for a meeting with the American team the following day. The U.S. delegation will reportedly include U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. The scheduled talks come amid rising tensions between Ukraine and the United States, as U.S. President Donald Trump escalates pressure on Zelensky to expedite a peace process. The tensions culminated in a confrontation during a meeting in the White House Oval Office on Feb. 28 after Zelensky had flown to the U.S. to sign a mineral and natural resources agreement with the U.S. After being insulted by Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, Zelensky returned to Ukraine without signing the deal. Since that meeting, the United States has ended its military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, resulting in significant troop losses on the frontlines. The losses have been particularly sharp in the Kursk region that Ukraine has occupied since August 2024, where ten thousand troops are now facing encirclement. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz suggested on March 5 that Trump may lift the pause on military aid once peace negotiations are arranged and confidence-building measures are taken, Reuters reported. The U.S. continues to share some intelligence with Ukraine to assist with defense operations, but not for attacks on Russian troops, CNN reported on March 7, citing two anonymous defense officials. According to the sources, Washington aims to avoid being seen as directly supporting strikes on Russia. However, the U.S. is not withholding information that could enhance Ukraine&apos;s defensive capabilities. The significant cutting back on U.S. intelligence sharing to Ukraine is part of the Trump administration&#x2019;s position to pressure Kyiv into quick negotiations with Russia. The sources also confirmed that Starlink, which the Ukrainian military relies on, is still operating in Ukraine as before. Starlink is owned by SpaceX, a company belonging to billionaire Elon Musk. Musk, a key ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, has drawn scrutiny at home and abroad over his repeated inflammatory comments regarding Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-62/	2025-03-09T13:12:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/Kurskaja.jpg
Romanian far-right candidate Calin Georgescu barred from running in presidential election	Romania&apos;s electoral bureau has disqualified far-right candidate Calin Georgescu from running in the presidential election re-run, multiple Romanian channels announced on March 9. The bureau noted that the reasoning behind their decision would be posted to their website shortly. The repeat elections are set for May 8 and 22 after the first round in November was annulled due to allegations of Russian interference favoring Georgescu. The Romanian foreign intelligence agency (SIE) reported that &quot;aggressive Russian hybrid attacks, including cyberattacks, information leaks, and sabotage&quot; contributed to Georgescu&apos;s unexpected victory. Georgescu was detained by police on Feb. 26 and charged by prosecutors for alleged crimes related to the country&apos;s recent elections. He filed his candidacy on March 7 in Bucharest, after which the bureau had 48 hours to either approve or deny it. Georgescu&#x2019;s supporters condemned the disqualification move as politically motivated, and several dozen people gathered outside the election bureau, chanting &quot;Freedom&quot;, while briefly attempting to break through the security barrier. The right-wing leader spoke out on X about the bureau&apos;s decision, accusing Romania of being under tyranny. &quot;Europe is now a dictatorship, Romania is under tyranny!&quot; he wrote. Tech billionaire Elon Musk shared multiple posts that were critical about the decision, and commented on it too. &#x201C;This is crazy!&#x201D; Musk wrote. The disqualification can be challenged in court if Georgescu chooses to do so. Georgescu, a pro-Russian candidate has previously referred to Ukraine as a &quot;fictional state.&quot; He has said that if elected president, he would ban Ukrainian grain exports through Romania and halt further military aid to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/romanian-far-right-candidate-calin-georgescu-barred-from-running-in-presidential-election/	2025-03-09T12:15:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2191257472.jpg
Rubio, Musk clash with Polish FM over Starlink in Ukraine, accuse him of 'just making things up'	Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Elon Musk sharply responded to Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski on March 9, dismissing Sikorski&#x2019;s concerns about Starlink being cut off in the future, and urging him to be thankful for the assistance thus far. Earlier on March 9, Sikorski stated that Poland will look for alternative suppliers if SpaceX turns out to be an unreliable provider of Starlink satellite internet for Ukraine. Rubio responded and claimed that Sikorski was &quot;just making things up.&#x201D; &#x201C;No one has made any threats about cutting Ukraine off from Starlink,&#x201D; Rubio said. &#x201C;And say thank you because without Starlink, Ukraine would have lost this war long ago and Russians would be on the border with Poland right now.&quot; Musk responded as well, claiming that Poland only pays a &#x201C;small fraction&#x201D; of the cost for Ukraine&#x2019;s Starlink access, even though Warsaw provides half of the total of Ukraine&#x2019;s 42,000 terminals, at about $50 million per year, according to Sikorski. &#x201C;Be quiet, small man. You pay a tiny fraction of the cost,&#x201D; Musk said. &#x201C;And there is no substitute for Starlink.&#x201D; Previously on March 9, Musk claimed that the entire front line in Ukraine would collapse if he shut off Starlink services. Both Musk and Rubio have made remarks against Ukrainian officials and Kyiv&#x2019;s position in recent weeks. On March 5, Rubio said that Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine is a &quot;proxy war&quot; between Moscow and Washington. He then blamed President Volodymyr Zelensky for &quot;undermining&quot; Trump&apos;s plan in the peace negotiations thus far, following the heated exchange that took place at the White House in late February. Musk has also made similar statements, and he has amplified Russian disinformation, criticizing Zelensky&#x2019;s position frequently, and calling for &#x201C;immediate peace,&#x201D; while refraining from criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin for starting the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/rubio-musk-clash-with-polish-fm-over-starlink-in-ukraine-accuse-him-of-just-making-things-up/	2025-03-09T10:55:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1813800965.jpeg
Poland will seek alternatives if Musk cuts Ukraine's Starlink access, Sikorski says	Poland will look for alternative suppliers if SpaceX turns out to be an unreliable provider of Starlink satellite internet for Ukraine, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said on March 9 in response to tech billionaire Elon Musk&apos;s remarks. Warsaw helps Ukraine maintain its Starlink access, having provided half of the total of the country&apos;s 42,000 terminals. Starlink has played a crucial role in securing communications in wartime Ukraine. Earlier on March 9, Musk claimed that the entire front line in Ukraine would collapse if he shut off Starlink services. Sikorski said that Starlink services for Ukraine are paid for by the Polish Digitization Ministry at the cost of about $50 million per year. &quot;The ethics of threatening the victim of aggression apart, if SpaceX proves to be an unreliable provider we will be forced to look for other suppliers,&quot; he wrote on X. Polish Deputy Prime Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski said on March 5 that cutting Starlink access for Ukraine would lead to an international crisis between Poland and the U.S. If Musk cuts off Ukraine&apos;s Starlink access, Gawkowski said, he would be effectively terminating a corporate contract with a European Union nation. The U.S. has threatened to cut off Ukraine&#x2019;s access to Starlink if Kyiv doesn&#x2019;t agree to a critical minerals deal, Reuters wrote in late February, citing sources. Musk denied these reports back then. The planned signing of the agreement was disrupted after a clash between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. In early March, Washington halted U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing for Ukraine in an attempt to push Kyiv to peace talks with Moscow. As concerns about Starlink&apos;s availability have grown, Ukrainian officials said Kyiv was working on alternatives to the U.S. service. French satellite operator Eutelsat Communications is in talks with the EU to possibly replace Starlink in Ukraine. Musk, who Trump has tasked with eliminating &quot;fraud&quot; and &quot;waste&quot; from the government budget, has called for shutting down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), an organization that provides vital humanitarian aid to Ukraine. He has also amplified Russian disinformation and mocked Zelensky for calling Ukraine an independent country.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-will-seek-alternatives-if-musk-cuts-ukraines-starlink-access-sikorski-says/	2025-03-09T08:43:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202862123.jpg
US Secret Service shoots armed man near White House	U.S. Secret Service officers opened fire on an armed man near the White House in Washington on March 9, the Secret Service reported. At the time of the incident, U.S. President Donald Trump was at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, according to CBS News. Local police shared they received information about a &quot;suicidal individual&quot; possibly traveling from Indiana, in the northeast of the country. The Secret Service members spotted a man and his car not far from the White House around midnight. As the officers approached, he brandished a firearm. An &quot;armed confrontation&quot; followed, with the suspect being shot by Secret Service. He was taken to a local hospital and his condition is unknown. No casualties among the Secret Service employees were reported. Trump was previously targeted in an assassination attempt on July 13 during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. Later in the fall, the U.S. Secret Service opened fire after seeing an armed individual at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, while Trump was playing golf. Trump was unharmed, and the FBI launched the investigation into the incident as another assassination attempt against him.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-secret-service-shoots-armed-man-near-white-house/	2025-03-09T07:50:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204146985.jpg
Trump won't resume Ukraine military aid after signing minerals deal, NBC News reports	U.S. President Donald Trump has privately made it clear to his aides that he will not resume providing military aid and intelligence to Ukraine even if Kyiv and Washington sign a minerals deal, NBC News reported on March 9, citing an unnamed Trump administration official and another American official. U.S. and Ukrainian delegations are planning to meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 to discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. Trump wants to see a change in President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s stance toward peace talks with Russia and a willingness to make concessions such as giving up occupied territories to Russia, the sources told NBC News. The U.S. president also reportedly wants Zelensky to make some steps toward elections in Ukraine and possibly step down. The news comes amid rising tensions between Ukraine and the U.S., as Trump escalates pressure on Zelensky to expedite a peace process. The tensions culminated in a confrontation during a meeting in the White House Oval Office on Feb. 28 after Zelensky had flown to the U.S. to sign a minerals agreement with the U.S. After being insulted by Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, Zelensky returned to Ukraine without signing the deal. Since that meeting, Washington has halted its military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. Previously, Trump called Zelensky a &quot;dictator,&quot; echoing Russian narratives about the democratically elected Ukrainian leader&apos;s legitimacy. &#xA0; Elections are banned in Ukraine during martial law, which has been in force since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Politico reported that Trump&apos;s team has been leading secret talks with former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko and another opposition leader, Yuliia Tymoshenko. The two opposition leaders reportedly tried to position themselves as more flexible partners for the U.S. than Zelensky. Following the Oval Office clash, Zelensky&apos;s approval rating has risen to 68%, according to a poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology published on March 7.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-wont-resume-ukraine-military-aid-after-signing-of-minerals-deal-nbc-news-reports/	2025-03-09T07:12:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201830448.jpg
Russia, China, Iran to hold joint naval drills in Gulf of Oman	China, Russia, and Iran will hold the Security Belt 2025 joint maritime exercises in the Gulf of Oman this month, the Chinese Defense Ministry announced on March 9. Both China and Iran have supported Russia during its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, helping it sustain its war effort despite the West&apos;s sanctions. The cooperation between these authoritarian regimes appears to continue to deepen as the West is growing more divided due to U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s U-turn in foreign policy. The new drills will start on March 11 in the port of Chabahar, located in southeast Iran, the Tasnim news agency reported. The three countries are planning to practice countering maritime targets, rescue operations, and maneuvering. The exercises are aimed at deepening &quot;the mutual trust and pragmatic cooperation between the participating countries&apos; armies,&quot; the Chinese ministry said. The three countries conducted similar joint naval exercises in the past, including in 2023 and 2024. Beijing has remained a key ally of Moscow throughout the invasion, deepening economic ties and becoming Russia&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods &#x2014; components that are used for manufacturing weapons. Russia has also strengthened its ties with Iran, in particular deepening the level of military cooperation between Moscow and Tehran. Iran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed attack drones used in attacks against Ukrainian cities.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-china-iran-to-hold-joint-naval-drills-in-gulf-of-oman/	2025-03-09T06:42:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1248343324.jpeg

Russia launched nearly 1,200 bombs, 870 drones, over 80 missiles against Ukraine this week, Zelensky says	Russian forces launched nearly 1,200 aerial bombs, nearly 870 attack drones, and more than 80 missiles of various types against Ukraine this week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 9. The weapons that Russia used against Ukraine this week contained more than 82,000 foreign components, Zelensky said. &quot;Every day, we work with our partners to ensure that decisions are made to provide life-saving support: air defense systems, investments in our defense production, and the strengthening of sanctions against Russia,&quot; he added. Russia carried out a large-scale aerial attack overnight on March 7, launching 67 missiles of various types and 194 drones against gas and energy infrastructure across Ukraine. Also this week, Russia struck a hotel in Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, killing six people and injuring over 30 others, including children. Multiple attacks on Dobropillia in Donetsk Oblast late on March 7 killed 11 people and injured almost 50, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. The attacks took place shortly after the U.S. halted its military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv. Experts who spoke to The Kyiv Independent earlier this week said that the main burden of the U.S. intelligence cutoff will be felt by Ukrainian civilians, as it threatens Ukraine&apos;s ability to detect on time Russian aerial strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Ukrainian officials said they are working on alternatives with foreign partners.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launched-nearly-1-200-bombs-870-drones-over-80-missiles-against-ukraine-this-week-zelensky-says/	2025-03-09T05:09:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203966472.jpg
Ukraine releases video of Russian attack via gas pipeline in Kursk Oblast	Ukrainian troops had repelled an attack by Russian sabotage and assault groups that used a gas pipeline to gain a foothold on the outskirts of Sudzha in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on March 8, releasing footage of the engagement. The announcement came amid reports that Russian forces had made a breakthrough south of the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha and tried to breach the Russia-Ukraine border in Sumy Oblast earlier this week. Ukrainian troops fighting in Kurks Oblast told the Kyiv Independent on March 7 that Russia had destroyed their supply chains for ammunition and food, and they faced encirclement. After Ukrainian airborne assault troops spotted the Russian forces, they launched missile, artillery, and drones to stop the assault, the General Staff said. &quot;At the moment, Russian special forces are being detected, blocked and destroyed. Enemy losses in the Sudzha area are very heavy,&quot; the military claimed on the evening of March 8. 0:00/1&#xD7;The footage shared on March 8, 2025, purporting to show Ukrainian forces repelling a Russian attack in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast (Ukraine&apos;s Air Assault Forces/Telegram)Ukrainian troops repelled 44 Russian attacks in Kursk Oblast over the past day, the General Staff said in its latest update on March 9. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The press service for Kursk military command told the Kyiv Independent on March 8 that &quot;the most large-scale&quot; Russian assault operations have occurred in the direction from the settlement of Korenevo toward Sudzha, as well as in the areas of Novoivanovka, Malaya Loknya, and south of Sudzha. The Ukrainian military described the situation as &quot;difficult&quot; but under control, saying that Russia involved North Korean soldiers in the attack. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, the Russian military claimed. Kyiv has sought to maintain its position in the Russian border region as leverage for possible peace talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-military-releases-video-of-russian-gas-pipeline-attack-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-03-09T04:24:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/--------------2025-03-09-123726.png
Ukrainian front line 'would collapse' if Starlink is turned off, Musk claims	U.S. tech billionaire Elon Musk claimed on March 9 that the entire front line in Ukraine would collapse if he shut off Starlink satellite internet services. Starlink internet terminals have played a crucial role in securing communications in the war in Ukraine. Last year, Ukraine said that approximately 42,000 terminals were in operation across the military, hospitals, businesses, and aid organizations. The U.S. has threatened to cut off Ukraine&#x2019;s access to Starlink if Kyiv doesn&#x2019;t agree to a critical minerals deal, Reuters wrote in late February, citing sources. Musk denied these reports back then. The planned signing of the agreement was disrupted after a clash between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. In early March, Washington halted U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing for Ukraine in an attempt to push Kyiv to peace talks with Moscow. In a post on X, Musk, a close ally of Trump, proposed to impose sanctions &quot;on the top 10 Ukrainian oligarchs, especially the ones with mansions in Monaco.&quot; This was in reaction to a post by Republican Senator Mike Lee, who called for cutting funding for Ukraine. One social media user wrote that Musk ignores the fact that Russia is an aggressor and Ukraine is a victim in the all-out war. &quot;I literally challenged (Russian President Vladimir) Putin to one on one physical combat over Ukraine, and my Starlink system is the backbone of the Ukrainian army. Their entire front line would collapse if I turned it off,&quot; Musk replied. Musk described Russia&apos;s full-scale war as &quot;years of slaughter in a stalemate,&quot; adding that Ukraine would &quot;inevitably lose.&quot; &quot;Anyone who really cares, really thinks, and really understands, wants the meat grinder to stop. Peace now!&quot; he wrote. As concerns about Starlink&apos;s availability escalated, Ukrainian officials said the country was working on alternatives to the U.S. service. French satellite operator Eutelsat Communications is in talks with the European Union to possibly replace Starlink in Ukraine.

Ukrainian drone reportedly attacks oil depot in Russia's Chuvashia for first time	A Ukrainian drone attacked an oil depot in Cheboksary in Russia&apos;s Chuvashia Republic on the morning of March 9, Governor Oleg Nikolaev reported. Russian Telegram channels claimed that this is the first drone attack on Chuvashia since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. The Burevestnik oil depot lies over 900 kilometers (559 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Nikolaev said that the oil depot was under reconstruction. No casualties were reported. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, overnight, Russian air defense shot down 52 drones over Belgorod Oblast, 13 over Lipetsk Oblast, nine over Rostov Oblast, eight over Voronezh Oblast, three over Astrakhan Oblast, one over Ryazan Oblast, one over Kursk Oblast and one over Krashodar Krai. The Russian Telegram channel Astra reported that Ukrainian drones also targeted oil refineries in Lipetsk and Ryazan oblasts. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The Ukrainian military has not commented on Russian reports. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones since 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drone-reportedly-attacks-oil-depot-in-russias-chuvashia-for-first-time/	2025-03-09T01:12:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Cheboksary__View_of_downtown.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 6, injure 34 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed six people and injured 34 others over the past day, regional authorities said on March 9. Ukrainian forces downed 73 out of the 119 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Thirty-seven drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are usually decoys. Russia launches them alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. Two people were killed in the cities of Pokrovsk and Siversk in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Another 23 people were injured in the region over the past day. A 41-year-old man was killed as a result of Russian shelling of the Kivsharivka village in Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. A Russian first-person view (FPV) drone attacked a car near the town of Bohokhudiv, injuring a 36-year-old man. Another drone strike injured a 46-year-old man in Kupiansk, Syniehubov said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 40 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Three people were killed, and nine others injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-6-injure-39-over-past-day/	2025-03-09T00:13:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-08_17-17-07.jpg

Ukrainian partisans sabotage railway line in occupied Crimea, group claims	The Atesh partisan group sabotaged a railway line linking parts of occupied Crimea with the front line in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, disrupting Russian supply lines, the group claimed via Telegram on March 9. An operative burned down a relay cabinet near the village of Stolbove in occupied Crimea, Atesh said, posting undated video footage of the alleged sabotage. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the group&apos;s claims. The operation aimed to disrupt Russian military logistics, Atesh reported.

The Atesh movement regularly commits sabotage attacks on Russian territory and in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. The group reported a similar action against a railway in occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast on Nov. 16. In October 2024, Russian troops reportedly renewed their attack in the Zaporizhzhia sector. Kyiv previously warned of a potential Russian push in the southern region, just as Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-partisans-sabotage-railway-line-in-occupied-crimea-group-claims/	2025-03-08T21:27:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-08_14-52-05.jpg
US vetos G7 proposal to establish task force on Russia's 'shadow fleet,' Bloomberg reports	The United States vetoed a Group of Seven (G7) proposal to establish a joint task force that would tackle sanctions evasion related to Russia&apos;s &apos;shadow fleet,&apos; Bloomberg reported on March 8. The move aligns with the Trump administration&apos;s efforts to soften its stance on Russia in international institutions as well as in joint statements. Trump, who has called on both Russia and Ukraine to make concessions to end the war, has repeated Kremlin narratives ahead of formalized peace negotiations. The shadow fleet refers to aging and largely uninsured oil tankers that Russia uses to transport oil above the $60 per barrel price cap that the EU, the U.S., and G7 countries imposed in December 2022 as part of the effort to cut Moscow&apos;s fossil fuels revenue. In recent months, shadow fleet vessels have been suspected of sabotage operations in the Baltic Sea, causing major damage to undersea cables. In addition to vetoing the task force, the United States has sought to ease rhetoric used towards Russia, pushing, in a joint G7 draft statement, to remove the word &quot;sanctions,&quot; as well as citing Russia&#x2019;s &quot;ability to maintain its war&quot; in Ukraine by replacing it with &quot;earn revenue,&quot; Bloomberg reported. The final joint statement has not been finalized ahead of next week&apos;s G7 meeting in Canada and is subject to change. The wording in the G7 statement aligns with previous moves by the U.S. at international institutions. On Feb. 24, the day of the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, the U.S. voted against a resolution at the UN General Assembly condemning Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, with 93 countries voting in favor and 18 against. The General Assembly later passed a separate U.S. resolution marking the third anniversary of the invasion. That resolution also received 93 votes in favor but avoided directly calling Russia the aggressor. A few days later, the United States abstained from signing a statement by members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) condemning Russian aggression on Feb. 26, breaking from its Western allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-vetos-proposal-to-establish-g7-task-force-on-russias-shadow-fleet-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-08T20:27:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182537136.jpg
Australia considering joining 'coalition of the willing' for Ukraine amid talks with Starmer	Australia is considering joining the European-led coalition of the willing to support a lasting ceasefire in Ukraine, a statement issued by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Stamer&apos;s office read on March 8. Starmer announced on March 2 that a number of European nations, including the U.K. and France, are developing a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; that will include &quot;planes in the air and boots on the ground&quot; in an effort to secure a successful ceasefire in Ukraine. Following a phone call with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Starmer&apos;s office said that the U.K. prime minister &quot;welcomed Prime Minister Albanese&#x2019;s commitment to consider contributing to a coalition of the willing for Ukraine.&quot; Responding to reporters questions on March 3, Albanese said Australia was &quot;ready to assist&quot; with &quot;proposals going forward&quot; on Ukraine, hinting that his government would be open to contributing to a joint force. The U.K. and France have spearheaded the idea of deploying European peacekeepers in Ukraine to monitor a potential ceasefire. Despite the progress on talks, Starmer warned that for any coalition to succeed, Europe must &quot;have strong U.S. backing.&quot; Starmer did not specify which other countries would participate in the coalition, but added that &quot;a number of countries have indicated they want to be part of the plan we&apos;re developing.&quot; A U.K. official confirmed on March 6 that talks were being held with about 20 countries consisting of &quot;largely European and Commonwealth partners&quot; &#x2014; without specifying the participants. Thus far, a number of countries have expressed openness to joining the coalition, including Canada, Ireland, and Turkey, among others. The Kremlin has consistently maintained that it will not accept Western troops on the ground in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/australia-considering-joining-coalition-of-the-willing-for-ukraine-following-talks-with-starmer/	2025-03-08T19:07:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1257670533.jpeg
France to provide $211 million in military aid to Ukraine backed by frozen Russian assets	France will provide Ukraine with 195 million euros ($211 million) in military aid using the interest accrued from frozen Russian assets, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu told La Tribune in an interview published March 8. The additional aid &quot;will enable the delivery of 155-mm shells as well as AASM gliding bombs which arm the Ukrainian Mirage 2000s ,&quot; Lecornu said. Lecornu added that France is accelerating the transfer of older equipment to Ukraine, including tanks and armoured vehicles. In October 2024, Group of Seven (G7) countries came to an agreement that pledged to provide Ukraine with almost $50 billion loan backed by the revenue from foreign Russian assets. The announcement from France comes just days after the United Kingdom signed an agreement with Kyiv on March 1 to provide Ukraine with a loan worth 2.26 billion pounds ($2.84 billion) backed by frozen Russian assets. The loan will go towards &quot;purchasing defense equipment according to Ukraine&apos;s needs,&quot; the U.K. Finance Ministry said. While Western countries have frozen $300 billion in Russian assets, they can only access the annual income generated by these funds, approximately $3.2 billion. These profits will back the $50-billion loan to Kyiv, while the vast majority of the assets are frozen in European countries. France, one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters, has taken steps alongside the U.K. in recent months to provide European leadership in supporting Ukraine, amid Kyiv&apos;s tumultuous relationship with the Trump administration. Trump has repeatedly called for European countries to step up to support Ukraine, including providing additional aid funding, lambasting the previous Biden administration for sending too much aid funding to the embattled nation. On March 4, Trump halted military aid shipments to Ukraine following a heated exchange with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on March 2 that a number of European nations, including the U.K. and France, are developing a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; that will include &quot;planes in the air and boots on the ground&quot; in an effort to negotiate a successful ceasefire in Ukraine. Reuters reported on March 6, citing diplomatic sources, that France and the U.K. aim to finalize a peace plan with Ukraine &quot;in days&quot; to present to the United States.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-to-provide-211-million-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-using-interest-from-frozen-russian-assets/	2025-03-08T17:18:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/03/GettyImages-1243421817.jpeg
Dagestan, Chechnya block Telegram messaging app	Authorities in Russia&#x2019;s Dagestan and Chechnya have blocked the Telegram messaging app, Russian state media TASS reported on March 8. The ban was implemented in response to &#x201C;security concerns,&#x201D; as authorities warned that groups could use the app to coordinate unrest. Dagestan&apos;s Minister of Digitalisation, Yuri Gamzatov, pointed to the October 2023 antisemitic riot at Makhachkala airport as an example of Telegram being used to organize violence. Anton Nemkin, a member of Russia&#x2019;s State Duma, argued that Telegram&#x2019;s content moderation is weak, allowing extremist material to spread unchecked. The Russian government has been escalating attempts to control online communications, blocking the messaging app Signal, reportedly planning to block WhatsApp, and curbing access to YouTube. &quot;Telegram needs to reconsider its approach to content moderation,&#x201D; he said. Gamzatov suggested that the app could be unblocked in the future, but encouraged users to switch to other platforms. Dagestan and Chechnya have seen a number of terrorist attacks by members of the Islamic State as well as clashes with security forces over the past years.

He faces 12 charges from the French authorities, including crimes related to child pornography, drug trafficking, money laundering, and withholding crucial information from investigators.	https://kyivindependent.com/dagestan-and-chechnya-block-telegram-messaging-app/	2025-03-08T15:36:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168240257.jpg
Large fire affecting critical infrastructure reported in Zaporizhzhia Oblast following Russian drone attack	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A large fire erupted at a critical infrastructure facility in Zaporizhzhia Oblast following a Russian drone attack, regional Governor Ivan Federov said on March 8. As a result of the strike, gas supplies have been limited in the region, Federov added. Russia has regularly launched missiles targeting various regions of the country. Russian forces have continuously targeted Ukraine&apos;s critical infrastructure as Russia continues to test Ukrainian resolve in the harsh winter months. Amid the U.S. pause on sharing intelligence with Kyiv, the New York Times reported on March 5, citing undisclosed U.S. and Ukrainian officials, that the pause affects warnings against Russian drones and missiles striking Ukrainian military and civilian targets. 0:00/1&#xD7;A fire is shown burning at a critical infrastructure facility in Zaporizhzhia Oblast on March 8, 2025 following a Russian drone attack on the region. (Zaporizhzhia Oblast Military Administration)No information was immediately available on the full extent of the damage, or whether any casualties were sustained in the attack. No details were provided on the location of the facility. Multiple explosions were heard between 10:30 p.m. and 11 p.m. local time, amid the reported threat of Russian drone attacks. Russian forces separately launched missiles towards eastern regions of the country on the evening of March 8. The attack on Zaporizhzhia Oblast comes just one day after Russia launched a mass strike against various regions of Ukraine targeting energy and gas infrastructure across the country. In the attack, Russian missiles struck critical infrastructure in Ternopil, Poltava, and Ivano-Frankivsk oblasts. Zaporizhzhia Oblast, situated on Ukraine&apos;s front line, is the target of near daily Russian drone, missile, and glide bomb attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/large-fire-affecting-critical-infrastructure-reported-in-zaporizhzhia-oblast-following-russian-drone-attack/	2025-03-08T14:27:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-08_17-13-15.jpg
Sweden to allocate $2.2 million in support of Ukrainian women	Sweden will provide over $2 million (22.5 million Swedish kronor) to support Ukrainian women, the Swedish Embassy in Ukraine announced on March 8. According to the embassy&#x2019;s post on X, the funding aims to &#x201C;empower women in Ukraine&#x201D; and support their contributions to the country&#x2019;s defense and recovery. &#x201C;On March 8, we pay tribute to the Ukrainian women who bravely defend their country, and all of Europe, as military and humanitarian workers, entrepreneurs and political leaders,&#x201D; the post said. The funding initiative will be through UN-Women, the embassy added. This comes soon after Sweden announced a military aid package to Ukraine worth over $1.2 billion, on Jan. 30. It was Sweden&apos;s largest tranche of military assistance since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/sweden-to-allocate-2-2-million-in-support-of-ukrainian-women/	2025-03-08T11:27:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2156168873.jpg
Russian troops reportedly attack Sudzha in Kursk Oblast as Ukraine's logistical routes are cut off	Russian and North Korean troops have launched an attack on the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the Ukrainian battlefield monitoring group DeepState and Yury Butusov, chief editor of the news site censor.net, reported on March 8. Multiple Russian pro-war Telegram channels claimed on March 8 that Russian troops have launched a large-scale offensive in Kursk Oblast and are storming Sudzha. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims, and the Ukrainian authorities have not commented on them. Russian forces have recently intensified efforts to break through to Sumy Oblast and cut off logistical routes of the Ukrainian salient in bordering Kursk Oblast. Russian forces have destroyed Ukrainian troops&apos; logistics in Kursk Oblast, and Ukrainian soldiers face the risk of encirclement, a Ukrainian soldier and a medic deployed in the region told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity on March 7. Butusov wrote on Facebook on March 8 that Russian troops had used a gas pipeline to approach Ukrainian positions in Sudzha in Kursk Oblast. He added that the troops are being &quot;liquidated.&quot; DeepState confirmed that Russian troops had tried to attack Sudzha through a pipeline but reported that the results of the operation are unknown. According to DeepState, North Korean troops are rapidly advancing near Sudzha, acting as the main offensive force and also bearing the heaviest casualties. &#x201C;The situation in the buffer zone in Kursk Oblast continues to intensify and requires immediate decisions from the (Ukrainian) command,&#x201D;Butusov said. Kyiv has sought to maintain its position in the Russian border region as leverage for possible peace talks. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, the Russian military claimed.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-soldiers-use-gas-pipeline-to-advance-closer-to-ukrainian-positions-in-sudzha-deepstate-reports/	2025-03-08T09:57:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/Kurskaja.jpg
British MP: ‘Trump could be a Russian asset’	Earlier this week, British lawmaker Graham Stuart raised the possibility that the president of the United States, Donald Trump, had been groomed by the Kremlin&#x2019;s security services over a period of decades. In this interview Stuart explains what prompted him to make such an extraordinary public statement, and what it means both for the future of Ukraine, and the continent as a whole.	https://kyivindependent.com/british-mp-trump-could-be-a-russian-asset/	2025-03-08T08:08:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_0414.jpg
Zelensky names delegation for meeting with US in Saudi Arabia	President Volodymyr Zelensky announced his delegation to represent Ukraine in upcoming talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia on March 8. Along with Andriy Yermak, Zelensky&apos;s chief of staff, Zelensky wrote on X that Ukraine will also be sending Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Deputy Head of the Presidential Office Pavlo Palisa. Zelensky wrote that he would travel to Saudi Arabia on March 10 and would meet with the Crown Prince, while the Ukrainian military and political delegation would stay for a meeting with the American team the following day. The U.S. delegation will reportedly include U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. The scheduled talks come amid rising tensions between Ukraine and the United States, as U.S. President Donald Trump escalates pressure on Zelensky to expedite a peace process. The tensions culminated in a confrontation during a meeting in the White House Oval Office on Feb. 28 after Zelensky had flown to the U.S. to sign an mineral and natural resources agreement with the U.S. After being insulted by Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, Zelensky returned to Ukraine without signing the deal. Since that meeting, the United States has ended its military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, resulting in significant troop losses on the frontlines. The losses have been particularly sharp in the Kursk region that Ukraine has occupied since August 2024, where ten thousand troops are now facing encirclement. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz suggested on March 5 that Trump may lift the pause on military aid once peace negotiations are arranged and confidence-building measures are taken, Reuters reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-names-delegation-for-meeting-with-u-s-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-03-08T06:46:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164821112.jpg
US to stop participating in future military exercises in Europe, Swedish media reports	The United States has notified its allies that it does not plan to participate in military exercises held in Europe beyond those already scheduled in 2025, Swedish media outlet Expressen reported on March 7. Sources told Expressen that this will affect several exercises currently in the &quot;drawing board&quot; phase that will be held in Sweden. &#xA0; Since his inauguration in January, U.S. President Donald Trump has signaled that he wants to pivot American security priorities away from Europe and focus on China and the Indo-Pacific Region. He shocked allies with recent moves including ending military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, excluding European allies from peace talks held with Russia in Saudia Arabia, and has repeatedly pressuring NATO allies to increase their defense spending. In response, a rattled Europe has begun preparing itself for a world order in which the United States cannot be relied on. EU member states agreed to free up what could amount to an unprecedented 800 billion euros ($867 billion) for defense spending. The United States regularly carries out joint operations with European allies each year to increase cooperation and test troop readiness.	https://kyivindependent.com/u-s-to-stop-participating-in-future-military-exercises-in-europe-swedish-media-reports/	2025-03-08T05:57:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1241165969.jpg
Miniature universes:' The personal spaces of women at war (Photos)	War has long been framed as the domain of men, reinforced by language, imagery, and tradition. But after Russia invaded Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in 2014, Ukrainian women took up arms, proving that in the fight for national sovereignty, it is not gender but loyalty to one&#x2019;s country that defines a soldier. Photographer Marisya Myanovska&#x2019;s series &#x201C;Zone of Seismic Activity&#x201D; captures the role of women in Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces &#x2014; where over 70,000 women now serve today &#x2014; not only through the stark symbols of war, such as unexploded shells and combat uniforms, but also through intimate moments of daily life on the front lines. Her images challenge traditional narratives, revealing the unseen, the overlooked, and the undeniable presence of women in war. On International Women&#x2019;s Day, the Kyiv Independent presents excerpts from Myanovska&#x2019;s photo series to show that Ukrainian women defending their country against Russian aggression are not only counted but seen. A person&#x2019;s personal space is a miniature universe &#x2014; fragile in war, always on the brink of disappearing. Just like the universe itself. - In August 2024, I traveled to the combat zone to document how war reshapes women&apos;s lives. &#xA0; I followed three female service members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kharkiv and Donetsk areas: Oksana &quot;Ksena&quot; Rubanyak, an unmanned aerial vehicles platoon commander; Andriana &quot;Malysh&quot; Arekhta, a weapons operator in a Special Operations Forces unit; and Yulia &quot;Kuba&quot; Sidorova, a combat medic with the 92nd Separate Mechanized Brigade. I slept beside them, brushed my teeth next to them, accompanied them to positions, and shared conversations over coffee. Yet, they rarely spoke of combat, focusing instead on moments when they could simply be themselves. &#xA0; In war, personal space is unstable. Solitude is rare. Boundaries shrink &#x2014; to a car, a sleeping bag, or, if lucky, a restroom, a shower, or a clearing in the forest. The closer to the &quot;zero line,&quot; the more space collapses inward, leaving only the refuge of one&#x2019;s own body. &#xA0; My project explores the fragile personal space of women in war &#x2014; its boundaries, its instability, and its connection to the ever-changing front lines. - Marysia Myanovska	https://kyivindependent.com/beyond-the-battlefield-exploring-womens-personal-spaces-in-ukraines-war-photos/	2025-03-08T05:44:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/updDSCF7439.jpg
Ukrainian drones attacked Russian oil refinery in Leningrad Oblast, military intelligence source says	Drones attacked an oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Leningrad Oblast overnight on March 8 in an operation carried out by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR), a HUR source told the Kyiv Independent. According to the HUR source, the drones attacked the Kirishinefteorgsintez enterprise in the Kirishsky district of Russia&apos;s Leningrad Oblast. Alexander Drozdenko, governor of Leningrad Oblast, said on Telegram that Russian air defense shot down one drone as it was approaching and the other was shot down overhead. &quot;When the debris fell, the external structure of one of the tanks was damaged,&quot; he said, adding that there were no victims. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify either party&apos;s claim. The oil refinery is located more than 800 kilometers from the border of Ukraine and is one of the largest oil refineries in Russia. Ukraine&apos;s ability to strike deep in Russian territory has been threatened by the recent end to military intelligence sharing from the United States. The United States stopped its intelligence sharing on March 5 as U.S. President Donald Trump escalates his pressure on Ukraine ahead of expected peace talks. CNN reported that while some information sharing has continued for defense operations, Washington does not want to be seen as supporting strikes on Russian troops. Ukraine has regularly used long-range drone strikes to target Russia&apos;s oil refinery facilities, as energy exports have been a key source of funding for Russia&apos;s invasion. The attacks have caused some facilities to significantly scale back production.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-attacked-russian-oil-refining-complex-in-leningrad-region-military-intelligence-source-says/	2025-03-08T04:47:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2069256477.jpg
‘Transformations after victory would be too late’ — An interview with Ukraine’s social policy minister	Since Russia began its full-scale invasion more than three years ago, the demands on social services have multiplied. Millions are internally displaced, the number of people with disabilities has risen by 10%, and more than 13,000 children have been orphaned. Populations who were already vulnerable are often hit harder by the burdens of war. At the same time, it has become difficult to provide services in large swathes of the country because of Russian strikes and fighting. The government is facing a budget deficit in the tens of billions as the country covers mounting defense costs to pay for its survival, leaving most social services &#x2014; like other non-defense expenditures &#x2014; to be paid for by international donors. Oksana Zholnovych was appointed Ukraine&#x2019;s social policy minister in July 2022, shortly after the full-scale invasion began. The Kyiv Independent recently spoke with her about how the war has affected her work, what she predicts will be the biggest challenges for the ministry after the war ends, and disability services in Ukraine today. Oksana Zholnovych, Ukraine&#x2019;s social policy minister. (Courtesy)Editor&#x2019;s note: This interview has been translated from Ukrainian and edited for length and clarity. The Kyiv Independent: Can you tell us about how the war changed the work of the Social Policy Ministry? What have been the biggest challenges? Zholnovych: Obviously, the challenges have changed significantly. But the group of people who need support has stayed with us. At the same time, there&#x2019;s a huge number of internally displaced people &#x2014; almost 4 million &#x2014; and the number of people with disabilities has risen by 300,000. We immediately realized that we had to transform almost all of our tools. To expect transformations after victory would be too late; the entire social system would fall to pieces. Everything we are doing now is aimed at radically improving the system and creating new stable mechanisms that will work efficiently and more effectively after the war. The Kyiv Independent: When you think about the future, what do you see as the main post-war focuses that your ministry should be preparing for? Zholnovych: The very first focus is to help people balance their mental health. Each of us is under a lot of stress. Some are fighting, some are waiting for relatives to return from the war, and some have already lost them and live in grief. Some went abroad to protect their family, and they&#x2019;ll return and will need to be reintegrated. Some lost their homes and have been forced to completely rebuild their lives from scratch in a new place. We&#x2019;ve already formed 200 &#x201C;Resilience Centers.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s important for us that in each community, there is this center where people will feel they&#x2019;re not alone. They&#x2019;ll understand how to cope with their pain and will form new support circles. In this way, we strengthen societal cohesion. The second is to work with people with disabilities. Today, unfortunately, only 16% of people (in Ukraine) with disabilities are employed, while in the European Union, it&#x2019;s 50%. More young people have disabilities now. Young, active people who don&#x2019;t want to just receive some small financial support and stay at home. We need to provide them with socialization, work, and employment so that they continue to feel socially engaged. The third focus is demographic strategy. To rebuild, we will need a large number of human hands and resources. We need them now for defense, too. We&#x2019;ve approved a demographic strategy and will implement it step by step in terms of returning Ukrainians, stimulating the birth rate, and improving the lives of our people. The fourth focus is undoubtedly older adults, one of the largest groups. We are an aging nation, and we need to help them have decent lives in retirement. The Kyiv Independent: Have you noticed any changes in the attitudes of Ukrainians towards those with disabilities? Zholnovych: It&apos;s a really complicated process. The most difficult thing is changing stereotypes. On the one hand, we see that people have begun to talk much more about a barrier-free environment, that public institutions should be equipped so that people with disabilities can enter, and that public transport should be available for people with disabilities. But we still see cases when, for example, neighbors oppose building a ramp to a building. There is still a lot of stigma against people with mental disorders. We still have a lot of work to do in this area. But I see very positive trends. For the military, the issue of accessibility and barrier-free environments is critical. They understand that they or their brothers may find themselves in such a situation.

(Chris McGrath/Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Ukraine has come under criticism by human rights groups for placing orphans and children and adults with disabilities in institutions. One of the requirements for Ukraine&#x2019;s integration into the EU is ending this practice. How is your office handling this issue? Zholnovych: We adopted a resolution (in Nov. 2024) in which we very clearly stated that every child should grow up in a family environment, and that has prompted big changes. It&apos;s not just looking at children who are already in boarding schools and finding them adoptive parents or foster families but also understanding why those children end up there. Prevention is important. Looking at poverty, we&#x2019;ve significantly digitized programs aimed at supporting people in poverty, housing and communal subsidies, and rental subsidies for internally displaced people. And now we&#x2019;re working on creating basic social assistance. We&#x2019;re also improving social support because, in many cases, a social worker is needed to help a family escape poverty. We&#x2019;ve (also) offered a whole range of support for families that have a child with a disability. We&#x2019;re introducing an early intervention service from the first days when it is discovered that a child is disabled, we&#x2019;ve launched a pilot program to expand inclusive education for children with complex disorders who aren&#x2019;t yet covered by education, and we&#x2019;ve introduced a supported accommodation service for those with disabilities who are over 18. We&#x2019;re still working on providing mechanisms so parents understand that if their child has a disability, then their path will be secured, and there&#x2019;s no need to send them to a boarding school. The Kyiv Independent: International adoptions are on hold, but domestic adoptions are still ongoing. What trends has your ministry seen? Zholnovych: This past year, we set a record for children adopted by Ukrainians. There&#x2019;s more empathy. People&#x2019;s desire to provide love to a child who has lost their parents is growing. I consider this our small victory. We also strengthened tools so that children, if they&#x2019;re temporarily removed from their family, even for a short time, don&#x2019;t end up in a boarding school but immediately go to a foster family.

(Ozge Elif Kizil/Anadolu via Getty Images)We added a paid assistant for these families, increased their salaries, and gave them the opportunity to rest, because this wasn&apos;t happening before. We&#x2019;ve already increased the number of foster families by a third. We already have positive results from the actions we&#x2019;ve started, but we&#x2019;re at the beginning of the road. The Kyiv Independent: Since the full-scale invasion, the budget for your ministry has been paid for by international donors. How does that affect your operations? Zholnovych: All the funds we earn as a state, they&#x2019;re all directed to support the military and defense. None of our soldiers are paid for with international expenses. But the social services remain uncovered (by Ukrainian funds). Pensions are provided at the expense of domestic taxpayers because we have a pension fund, but the support of people with disabilities, the low-income, children from orphans, other different types of support, these are international resources. It&#x2019;s very important that the people who help us understand that we are grateful for this support. Without it, a large number of people simply would not be able to survive. We understand that international support is not easy now; there are no additional sources of resources, so our budget is at about the same level as last year. We try to use these resources responsibly, not just consuming them but also using them for transformations &#x2013; to break old, ineffective mechanisms and create new ones that are high-quality and will strengthen our social policy after the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/transformations-after-victory-would-be-too-late-an-interview-with-ukraines-social-policy-minister/	2025-03-08T04:15:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/upd_GettyImages-2123709297.jpg
Ukraine considers Kursk withdrawal amid fears of encirclement of 10,000 troops, Telegraph reports	Ukraine&apos;s forces are considering a withdrawal from Kursk, with 10,000 Ukrainian troops at risk of encirclement after Russia broke through key defense lines and disrupted supply chains, The Telegraph reported on March 8. The Telegraph&apos;s report comes as several recent media reports warn that Ukraine&apos;s occupation of Russian territory in Kursk is increasingly at risk of encirclement after Russian breakthroughs. Ukrainian troops speaking on the condition of anonymity told the Kyiv Independent on March 7 that Russia had destroyed their supply chains for ammunition and food and they faced encirclement. One said the breakthrough happened in the last few days. A source in President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s office told Time that operations in the Kursk region have been most affected by the recent halt in intelligence sharing from the United States. The United States stopped its intelligence sharing on March 5 as U.S. President Donald Trump escalates his pressure on Ukraine ahead of expected peace talks. &#xA0; A withdrawal ahead of peace talks would be a severe blow to Ukraine&apos;s bargaining position. Zelensky has said that Ukraine&apos;s occupation of Kursk is likely to play a crucial role in potential future negotiations. According to the Telegraph, North Korean troops played an important role in the offensive that destroyed supply lines in Kursk. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in August 2024. After a January report that North Korean troops had pulled back, they were reportedly redeployed to Kursk last month. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, capturing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) and marking the first foreign invasion of Russia since World War II. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, the Russian military claimed.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-considers-kursk-withdrawal-amid-fears-of-encirclement-of-10-000-troops-telegraph-reports/	2025-03-08T01:45:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/Kurskaja.jpg
Russian drone strike kills 3 civilians, injures 7 in Kharkiv Oblast	A Russian drone strike on a meat processing plant in Kharkiv Oblast killed three civilians and injured seven others, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said on March 8. A fire broke out on the site after four Shahed drones struck the plant around 2 a.m., Syniehubov wrote on Telegram. The three civilians killed were all men, according to the Telegram post. Overnight, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported 145 drones and decoy drones were launched from Russia. Two ballistic missiles and a cruise missile were also launched. Also overnight, a strike on Donetsk Oblast killed 11 and injured 30 people. A halt on intelligence sharing from the United States has raised fears that Ukraine&apos;s ability to issue vital alerts about incoming Russian and drones may be harmed. However, the U.S. continues to share some intelligence with Ukraine to assist with defense operations, but not for attacks on Russian troops, CNN reported on March 7.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-strike-kills-3-civilians-injures-7-in-kharkiv-oblast/	2025-03-08T00:43:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-08-10_22_47.jpeg
Ukraine destroys 2 diesel trains in Russia, military intelligence source say	Two diesel trains were disabled in Russia as a result of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) operations, a military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on March 8. According to the HUR source, a train being used for transporting weapons and military equipment from Russia to occupied Ukraine was destroyed on the night of March 5-6 in the city of Voronezh. Another train was set on fire early on Feb. 19 the Orekhovo-Zuyevsky district of Moscow&apos;s region. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Voronezh is located approximately 465 kilometers (289 miles) south of Moscow and around approximately 279 kilometers (173 miles) northeast of Kharkiv. Ukrainian military intelligence and partisans within Russia have claimed responsibility for destruction of Russia trains multiple times in December, including two trains set ablaze near Moscow and the destruction of a train in Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-destroys-two-trains-in-russia-military-intelligence-source-claims/	2025-03-08T00:14:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1237502911.jpg
US shares intelligence with Ukraine for defense, not for attacks on Russian troops, CNN reports	The U.S. continues to share some intelligence with Ukraine to assist with defense operations, but not for attacks on Russian troops, CNN reported on March 7, citing two anonymous defense officials. According to the sources, Washington aims to avoid being seen as directly supporting strikes on Russia. However, the U.S. is not withholding information that could enhance Ukraine&apos;s defensive capabilities. The significant cutting back on U.S. intelligence sharing to Ukraine is part of the Trump administration&#x2019;s position to pressure Kyiv into quick negotiations with Russia. The sources also confirmed that Starlink, which the Ukrainian military relies on, is still operating in Ukraine as before. Starlink is owned by SpaceX, a company belonging to billionaire Elon Musk. Musk, a key ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, has drawn scrutiny at home and abroad over his repeated inflammatory comments regarding Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-continuing-to-share-some-intelligence-with-ukraine-solely-for-defense-purposes-cnn-reports/	2025-03-07T23:41:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2149305400.jpg

Russian national who killed two Ukrainian soldiers in Germany sentenced to life imprisonment	A 58-year-old Russian national has been sentenced to life imprisonment by a Munich court for murdering two Ukrainian soldiers in Germany last year, German television news channel N-Tv reported on March 7. The court ruled that the severity of the crime makes the man unlikely to qualify for early release. The victims, aged 36 and 23, were being treated for war injuries in Murnau, Bavaria. The Russian man admitted to the killings, which happened after an argument about the war broke out at a bar between him and the two soldiers. Due to the argument, the Russian citizen felt &quot;violated in his national pride,&quot; Deutsche Welle reported, citing the Central Office for Combating Extremism and Terrorism of the Munich Public Prosecutor. &quot;Now, in a sober state, I deeply regret what happened,&quot; the 58-year-old suspect said at the start of his trial. There have been multiple instances of crimes against Ukrainian citizens abroad since the start of the full-scale invasion began in 2022. Two Ukrainian basketball players, aged 17 and 18, were killed in Germany on Feb. 2024 after being attacked with knives. In another incident also in early 2024, a 15-year-old Ukrainian boy received severe head injuries and was taken to the hospital after his attacker allegedly made xenophobic remarks before the attack. The boy survived the attack.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-national-who-killed-two-ukrainian-soldiers-in-germany-sentenced-to-life-imprisonment/	2025-03-07T21:22:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1703764954.jpg
Slovakia is Europe' — thousands of protestors take to the streets against Fico's pro-Kremlin agenda	Thousands of protestors gathered on March 7 in more than 40 cities across Slovakia targeting the government of Prime Minister Robert Fico, Slovak media Aktuality reported. In Bratislava&#x2019;s Freedom Square, protesters chanted &#x201C;shame&#x201D; and called Fico a traitor, declaring that &#x201C;Slovakia is Europe.&#x201D; Fico&apos;s government has faced criticism for its perceived alignment with Russian interests, and his administration has repeatedly criticized Western aid to Ukraine. Demonstrators accused Fico of distancing from the European Union, and for strengthening ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. &quot;Robert Fico chose Putin, Slovakia chooses Europe,&quot; the protest organizers said. Protesters also condemned remarks by Fico&#x2019;s chief advisor, Erik Kalinak, who recently suggested that Russia&#x2019;s defeat of Ukraine would give Slovakia a &#x201C;reliable neighbor.&#x201D; Numerous large-scale protests have occurred in Slovakia in the past few months following Fico&#x2019;s remarks and visit in Dec. 2024 with Putin in Moscow. In Jan. 2025 hundreds of thousands of protestors took to the streets, chanting similar slogans including &#x201C;Enough of Fico.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/slovakia-is-europe-thousands-of-protestors-take-to-the-streets-against-ficos-pro-kremlin-agenda/	2025-03-07T19:29:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/slovakia-protest.jpg
Poland to introduce large-scale military training for all adult males, PM Tusk announces	Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced plans on March 7 to implement large-scale military training for all adult men to strengthen the country&#x2019;s reserve forces. In a speech to the Sejm, Poland&#x2019;s parliament, he noted that this initiative was in response to growing security threats from Russia. &#x201C;If Ukraine loses the war or if it accepts the terms of peace, armistice, or capitulation in such a way that weakens its sovereignty and makes it easier for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin to gain control over Ukraine, then, without a doubt &#x2014; and we can all agree on that &#x2014; Poland will find itself in a much more difficult geopolitical situation,&#x201D; Tusk said. He also said that he would like to increase the size of the Polish army from the current amount of 200,000 soldiers to 500,000, noting that Russia&#x2019;s army has around 1.3 million soldiers and Ukraine&#x2019;s has around 800,000. &quot;We will try to have a model ready by the end of this year so that every adult male in Poland is trained in the event of war, so that this reserve is comparable and adequate to the potential threats.&quot; Poland has been a key ally of Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, providing extensive military aid, including tanks, heavy equipment, and ammunition.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-to-introduce-large-scale-military-training-for-all-adult-males-pm-tusk-announces/	2025-03-07T18:44:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202961314.jpg
Drones target Bryansk Oblast in overnight attack	Drones have reportedly struck the town of Starodub in Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast in an overnight attack on March 7. Starodub is located about 130 kilometers (80 miles) from the regional capital of Bryansk and about 32 kilometers (20 miles) from the border with Ukraine. Six drones attacked the industrial facility in Starodub, according to local governor Alexander Bogomaz. A military food ration factory was targeted in the overnight attack, local officials claimed. Ukraine&apos;s &quot;Peklo&quot; drones hit the factory, local media reported. Seven explosions were heard and a fire broke out in the military factory following the strikes, locals claimed. &quot;A production facility is on fire on the territory of one of the processing plants. Residents have been evacuated from the nearest houses to ensure safety,&quot; Bogomaz said. Ukraine regularly strikes military targets on Russian territory in an effort to reduce Russia&apos;s fighting power in its war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-target-bryansk-oblast-in-overnight-attack/	2025-03-07T17:44:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1247673607.jpg
Russian attack on Dobropillia in Donetsk Oblast kills 4, injures 18	Russian forces launched multiple strikes on Dobropillia, a city in Donetsk Oblast, late on March 7, resulting in casualties and injuries, according to the head of the Donetsk Regional Military Administration. At least 4 people have been killed and 18 were injured, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin reported, noting that more people could be trapped under the rubble. Some four apartment buildings have been damaged, the official statement said. Dobropillia is located 94 kilometres north west from Russian-occupied Donetsk, the administrative center of the oblast. First responders have been dispatched to the site of the attack and search and rescue operation continues. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s decision to halt intelligence sharing with Kyiv has sparked concerns in Ukraine that Russian missile strikes could now strike the cities without prior warning. The New York Times reported on March 6 that the freeze on intelligence sharing could hinder vital alerts about incoming Russian drones and missiles. Trump made the announcement amidst a sharp decline in relations between Kyiv and Washington, as he pressures Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to agree to his proposed peace talks with Russia. Shortly after the freeze on March 5, a Russian Iskander ballistic missile struck a hotel in Kryvyi Rih, killing four people and injuring at least 30, hammering home what&apos;s at stake when Russian missiles are not intercepted.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-dobropillia-in-donetsk-oblast-kills-4-injures-18/	2025-03-07T17:02:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1407293310.jpg
Discussions with Trump team currently 'most intensive work to date,' Zelensky says	Work is underway with U.S. officials to &quot;accelerate peace,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an evening address on March 7. Ukrainian and U.S. delegations are preparing to meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days following a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Zelensky that ended in a heated argument on Feb. 28. &quot;The agenda is clear &#x2013; peace as soon as possible, security as reliable as possible. Ukraine is committed to the most constructive approach,&quot; Zelensky said. A minerals deal that was poised to be signed on Feb. 28 is likely among the topics both sides are discussing. &quot;Next week there will be a lot of work here in Europe, with (the U.S.) in Saudi Arabia &#x2013; we are preparing a meeting to accelerate peace and strengthen the foundations of security,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine continues to work with its allies who want to see peace in the embattled nation, the leader added. &quot;Today, throughout the day, the most intensive work to date has been ongoing with President Trump&apos;s team at various levels &#x2013; with many phone calls,&quot; Zelensky said. A White House official on March 3 announced a &#x201C;pause&#x201D; on U.S. weapons aid to Ukraine following the Feb. 28 meeting between Trump and Zelensky. Critics have argued an extended pause in military aid to Ukraine could have a devastating effect on Ukraine&apos;s fight against Russian aggression. &quot;I do not think we should be pausing our efforts. It&#x2019;s the Ukrainians who are shedding blood,&quot; Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee Susan Collins said.	https://kyivindependent.com/discussions-with-trump-team-currently-most-intensive-work-to-date-zelensky-says/	2025-03-07T16:30:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/photo_2024-01-29_14-15-42.jpg
Putin might consider conditional truce in Ukraine, Bloomberg reports	Russian President Vladimir Putin is reportedly considering a truce in Ukraine if certain conditions are respected, Bloomberg reported on March 7. Russian and U.S. officials met in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 for preliminary talks regarding ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine and restoring bilateral relations. Russian officials have repeatedly offered ultimatums to Ukraine rather than concessions for negotiations. Russia is open to a temporary peace settlement in Ukraine if progress will be made towards a final peace plan, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter. The Kremlin insists on organizing the framework of a pottential peacekeeping mission in Ukraine. This includes deciding what countries would take part in a peacekeeping force, a person familiar with the topic told Bloomberg. Russia first voiced its openness to a conditional truce at the Saudi Arabia summit on Feb. 18 between top U.S. and Russian officials, various people told Bloomberg asking not to be named. For armed fighting to stop there needs to be a clear understanding of a final peace plan, it&apos;s structure, and its principles, two people with an understanding of the matter said to Blooomberg. On March 4, President Volodymyr Zelensky proposed a truce in the sky and sea as well as prisoner of war (POWs) releases as a first step to establishing peace. U.S. and Ukrainian officials are due to meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days following a White House meeting between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 28 that ended with a heated arguement between the two leaders. On March 7 Trump said he is considering implementing sweeping sanctions and tariffs against Russia until a ceasefire and peace plan is reached. The U.S. leader also accused Ukraine of being more difficult to deal with than Russia, despite acknowledging &quot;Russia is bombing the hell out of Ukraine.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/conditional-truce-being-considered-by-putin-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-07T15:10:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2161636677.jpg
Voice of America correspondent Ostap Yarysh fired in DOGE crackdown	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Ukrainian correspondent Ostap Yarysh was dismissed from his role at Voice of America (VoA) on March 7 reportedly following a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) inspection. U.S. billionaire Elon Musk has previously called for the shutdown of U.S.-funded media outlets Radio Free Europe and Voice of America. Yarysh joined the VOA&apos;s Ukrainian service in 2019, covering Donald Trump&apos;s impeachment, the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 presidential election, and its aftermath. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, he has reported on U.S. military aid to Ukraine. &quot;Word gets around quickly. My friends and family found out before I could even tell them,&quot; Yarysh wrote on social media on March 7. &quot;In short, yes&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve ended (my) cooperation with Voice of America. I&#x2019;ll share more details later,&quot; he added. Yarysh was dismissed from the Voice of America during a DOGE inspection, Head of Detector Media Nataliia Ligachova said. On Feb. 9 Musk called for publically funded media to be &quot;shut down.&quot; &quot;It&#x2019;s just radical left crazy people talking to themselves while torching $1B/year of U.S. taxpayer money,&quot; Musk said. The New York Times reported on Feb. 28 that the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees VoA, launched an investigation into journalists who had spoken out against President Donald Trump&#x2019;s policies. As part of the probe, senior VoA journalist Steve Herman was placed on extended leave. He told the New York Times that he had received a letter saying the investigation was examining whether his &quot;social media activity has undermined VoA&#x2019;s audiences&#x2019; perceptions of the objectivity and/or credibility of VoA and its news operations.&quot; Additionally, anonymous sources told the New York Times that in recent months, VoA had either toned down or entirely withheld coverage that was critical of Trump and his administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/voice-of-america-correspondent-ostap-yarysh-fired-in-doge-crackdown/	2025-03-07T13:31:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/YARYSH-1.jpg
Russia’s history of violating ceasefire agreements in Ukraine	As U.S. President Donald Trump continues to push for a swift end to the war in Ukraine, fears are mounting that Kyiv could be forced to accept a peace deal on unfavorable terms, and that will leave it vulnerable to future Russian attacks. The fears aren&apos;t unfounded. After Russia invaded Ukraine&apos;s east with the use of proxies and annexed Crimea in 2014, Moscow violated multiple ceasefire deals 25 times, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a meeting with Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. &quot;We will not agree to a ceasefire without security guarantees. A document is not enough. We need a strong army. Russian soldiers fear ours, but if we have empty stockpiles, we won&apos;t have anything to defend ourselves with,&quot; Zelensky said. The Trump administration has ramped up the pressure on Ukraine to quickly negotiate an end to the war. But given Russia&apos;s history of violating ceasefire agreements, Zelensky has continued to look for firm guarantees from both the U.S. and European partners to protect against any renewed Russian aggression. &#xA0; &quot;If (Trump) can at least get a ceasefire, then he can claim credit, even if Russia violates it every day and no peace deal is ever agreed,&quot; Jenny Mathers, senior lecturer in the department of international politics at Aberystwyth University, told the Kyiv Independent.But Russia is likely uninterested in a ceasefire, said Stephen Hall, assistant Professor in Russian and post-Soviet politics at the University of Bath. &quot;(It) wants Ukrainian neutrality, &apos;denazification,&apos; and &apos;demilitarization,&apos; and all of these things that they&apos;ve been saying for the last three years.&quot;If it were to agree to any ceasefire in Ukraine through negotiations with Trump, &quot;it will only be to build up their forces and then carry the war on,&quot; Hall said. By launching the war in eastern Ukraine in 2014, Russia first and foremost violated the 1997 Russian-Ukrainian Treaty of Friendship, that &quot;confirmed the inviolability of borders&quot; between the two countries, and according to which Russia was obliged to respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine. After the start of the war in 2014, the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine, which included representatives of Ukraine, Russia, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, was formed. The Normandy Format, which Ukraine, Germany, Russia, and France chaired, was also created at this time. Following the signing of the Minsk Protocol, also known as Minsk-1, a ceasefire began at 6 p.m. on Sept. 5, 2014. The next day, Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council announced that Russian troops had fired at Ukrainian positions at least 10 times after the ceasefire was declared.

(Vasily Maximov/AFP via Getty Images)In February 2015, a document on the implementation of the Minsk agreements, also known as Minsk-2, was signed, which included a ceasefire starting Feb. 15. The agreement lasted only a few minutes, as Russian units fired on a Ukrainian checkpoint near Zolote in Luhansk Oblast, according to Ukraine&apos;s military. Since the signing of the Minsk Agreements, Russia violated the ceasefire several times a year from 2016 to 2022. The two sides tried to conclude truces on more than one Christmas and New Year holidays, the start of the school year, or the harvest. None of them lasted. On July 21, 2019, a &quot;harvest&quot; truce came into effect. Following the start of the ceasefire, one violation occurred when Ukrainian positions were shelled. A year later, a &quot;full and comprehensive ceasefire&quot; was declared in eastern Ukraine on July 27, 2020. Within 30 minutes, Russian forces attacked the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, according to Ukrainian military reports. In October 2020, the number of Russian attacks increased, and an extraordinary meeting of the Trilateral Contact Group was convened. It agreed to extend the &quot;full and comprehensive ceasefire.&quot; The agreement again did not last long. &quot;I will be absolutely flabbergasted if the Russians (conclude a ceasefire) and they actually uphold it,&quot; Hall told the Kyiv Independent. Trump has repeatedly claimed that he wants a swift end to the war between Ukraine and Russia. In the meantime, he has suspended military aid and U.S. intelligence to Ukraine, putting the war-torn country under even greater threat. &quot;The U.S. is taking steps to reduce Ukraine&apos;s capacity to wage war in an effort to persuade Ukraine&apos;s political and military leadership that they have no hope of victory &#x2014; however that might be defined by Kyiv &#x2014; and must instead agree to whatever terms are offered by Russia via Washington,&quot; Mathers said. According to Mathers, Trump is &quot;showing blatant favoritism&quot; to Russia by ruling out Ukraine&apos;s ability to join NATO or revealing his eagerness to restore economic and diplomatic relations with Moscow. &quot;It is pretty clear that if Trump gets his way, Kyiv will feel that it has no choice except to agree to a ceasefire that would, in fact, be a surrender,&quot; Mathers said. Given the uncertainty over further U.S. assistance and potential security guarantees, the Ukrainian government has increasingly called on its European partners to invest in their defense and help Ukraine.

(Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images)The Trump administration&apos;s actions have also forced Europe to review its approach to defense funding. Ursula von der Leyen on March 4 presented the ReArm Europe plan to strengthen Europe&apos;s defense capabilities. The EU agreed to mobilize up to 800 billion euros ($867 billion) for defense spending on March 7. Mark Temnycky, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council&apos;s Eurasia Center, believes that sending European troops to Ukraine could provide the necessary defense against any future Russian attacks. International support for Ukraine&apos;s defense innovation and manufacturing capabilities would also act as a future deterrent, according to Temnycky.	https://kyivindependent.com/neglecting-security-guarantees-trump-fast-tracking-efforts-to-persuade-ukraine-to-ceasefire-with-russia/	2025-03-07T13:25:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1187447613.jpg
‘We will adapt’ — Ukraine’s soldiers say after US intel cut	Days after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a pause in sharing U.S. intelligence, the Ukrainian military has reported little effect from that decision on the front. The pause is likely to have a higher toll on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, experts and military officials say. The U.S. stopped sharing intelligence with Ukraine on March 5, soon after freezing all military assistance in an effort to pressure Kyiv into quick negotiations with Russia. Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, said the Ukrainians had &quot;brought this on themselves,&quot; for not cooperating in peace talks. U.S. aerospace company Maxar Technologies has also reportedly restricted Ukraine&apos;s access to its satellite imagery, according to the Ukrainian media outlet Militarnyi. Ukrainian officials said they are working on alternatives with foreign partners. French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu confirmed that France is continuing to provide its intelligence to Ukraine. &#x201C;There is nothing unique about the United States&#x2019; intelligence capabilities. It is possible to replace them,&#x201D; Mykhailo Samus, military expert and director of the New Geopolitics Research Network, told the Kyiv Independent. A satellite image shows a convoy of Russian troops near Ivankiv, Ukraine, heading toward Kyiv on Feb. 28, 2022. (2022 Maxar Technologies)Effects on battlefieldSeveral soldiers and commanders fighting across the front said that the intelligence cutoff has little to no effect on their battlefield operations. At the tactical level, the Ukrainian army has a range of means to get its own intelligence, mostly from drone surveillance. Other sources include the Ukrainian-made situational awareness system Delta, praised by NATO after testing in 2024, and regular reconnaissance operations. &#x201C;My drones give me the intelligence,&#x201D; said &#x2018;Spys,&#x2019; an artilleryman fighting in Kursk Oblast who is being identified by callsign only for security reasons. According to Samus, American intelligence may have had only a sporadic impact on the frontline. &#x201C;I am convinced that the frontline will cope without intelligence from our U.S. partners,&#x201D; said Yurii Fedorenko, commander of the elite unmanned systems regiment &#x201C;Achilles&#x201D; fighting in Kharkiv Oblast. Yaroslav &quot;Strilok,&quot; a soldier of the Achilles Strike Drone Battalion, carries a first-person view drone at positions near Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, on Dec. 8, 2025. (Aria Shahrokhshahi/The Kyiv Independent)However, both military and experts agree that &#x201C;there&#x2019;s never too much intel&#x201D; when it comes to battlefield operations. &#x201C;Ukraine has managed to develop the production of intelligence tools that allow us to cover a certain operational depth,&#x201D; Fedorenko said. &#x201C;But in war, it is important to control the enemy at all stages, from production and logistics to the areas of concentration, and then to the front line,&#x201D; he added. Since early 2024, Ukraine has regularly conducted drone strikes deep within Russia and Russian-controlled territories, hitting military and strategic targets such as oil refineries. The strikes have helped to slow down Russia&#x2019;s frontline logistics and reduce Moscow&apos;s gas and oil exports that fuel its war effort. The U.S. intelligence cutoff is unlikely to threaten the planning of those operations by restricting Ukraine&#x2019;s access to satellite images, as &#x201C;Ukraine has its own satellites,&#x201D; Samus said. Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR) confirmed that Ukraine&#x2019;s crowdfunded satellite had taken over 4,000 images of Russian facilities, used to cause &quot;billions of dollars&quot; in losses to Russia. &#x201C;We still have good intel from our own means,&#x201D; Samus said, &#x201C;And we have (Ukrainian-made) drones that can &#x201C;see&#x201D; at least a couple hundred kilometers deep (into Russia).&#x201D; A soldier who asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive matters told the Kyiv Independent that his unit sometimes seeks intel from HUR, which is consistently better and more up-to-date than the intel available within the Ukrainian Armed Forces. As of this publication, HUR hasn&apos;t responded to a request for comment. The main burn of the intelligence cutoff will be felt by Ukrainian civilians, experts said, as it threatens Ukraine&apos;s ability to detect on time Russian aerial strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. &#x201C;The air defense system does not rely on satellite information, but on information from long-range radars,&#x201C; Viktor Kevliuk, a retired military officer and defense expert, told the Kyiv Independent. Radars are usually turned off to avoid detection by the enemy, he said. But they are turned on to monitor the air situation at long distances when satellites warn of enemy launches of cruise missile carriers or ground- and sea-based ballistic missiles. &#x201C;The U.S. actions deprive the Ukrainian Defense Forces of knowing in advance about the beginning of an air attack,&#x201D; Kevliuk added. The U.S. Airborne Warning &amp; Control System (AWACS) planes used radars that worked 400-500 kilometers deep within Russia, Samus said. He underscored that Ukraine&#x2019;s European partners have the same electronic reconnaissance capabilities and might share this information.

(Vlada Liberova/Libkos via Getty Images)As an alternative, Ukraine can fill up the gap in this intelligence with two Swedish-provided ASC 890 aircraft that were included in a Swedish military aid package for Ukraine last May. &#x201C;They would detect (enemy activity) 300 kilometers into Russian territory, including the activity of Iskander (ballistic missile systems), strategic aviation, and so on,&#x201D; Samus added. A Swedish official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Kyiv Independent that the planes are scheduled to arrive in Ukraine later this year. It leaves concerns about the harm to civilians that Russian attacks could inflict until then. &#x201C;Take the Oreshnik, for example,&#x201D; said Myroslav Hai, an officer in the Ukrainian army. Russia launched its nuclear-capable &#x2018;Oreshnik&#x2019; missile against Ukraine on Nov. 21. &#x201C;U.S. intelligence knows when Russia is planning something very bad for our cities. And if they were to withhold this information, it just means that more Ukrainian civilians will die,&#x201D; Hai told The Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;This is not the first time that the U.S. have taken such steps,&#x201D; Fedorenko said, citing months-long delays in military aid and selective provision of intelligence about Russia in the past. During the full-scale war, Ukraine has managed to overcome many changes and difficulties, and it will adapt to the U.S. intelligence cutoff, soldiers said. &#x201C;We will endure,&#x201D; &#x2018;Bart,&#x2019; a special forces sniper fighting in the Pokrovsk direction who is being identified by callsign only, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Russia is running out of breath here.&#x201D; Ukrainian soldiers of the 93rd Brigade take part in combat drills outside Pokrovsk, Ukraine, on Feb. 13, 2025. (Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu via Getty Images)The pause in intelligence sharing is just the latest of a series of striking measures taken by the the U.S. administration that are working in Russia&#x2019;s favor, filling Ukrainians with disappointment about its once-ally. &#x201C;It will not surprise me if (Trump) starts giving intelligence to (the Russians),&#x201D; &#x2018;Bart&#x2019; added. &#x201C;(The U.S.) has sided with Russia and are allowing it to use its weapons more effectively,&#x201D; Samus said. &#x201C;They used to be called the leader of the democratic world, but not anymore. Now they are people who make decisions that facilitate war crimes,&#x201D; he added. &#x201D;This is a catastrophe for the United States, not for us.&#x201D; Toma Istomina contributed reporting.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-will-adapt-ukraines-soldiers-say-after-us-intel-cut/	2025-03-07T12:55:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202285720.jpg
Ukraine’s DTEK gas production facilities shut down after Russian attack	Ukrainian energy company DTEK&apos;s gas production facilities in Poltava Oblast were attacked by Russia on the morning of March 7, forcing them to halt operations due to the damage, the company reported. DTEK is Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy company, and its facilities have been repeatedly targeted since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion as Moscow looks to destroy Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure. Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least two people and injured 24 others over the past day, regional officials said on March 7. In Poltava Oblast, debris from a downed aerial target hit a house, injuring two people, including a child, Governor Filip Pronin said. Ukraine&apos;s main gas production facilities are in front-line regions like Kharkiv and Poltava, making them vulnerable to Russian attacks. Strikes on gas infrastructure have repeatedly reduced production, at times by 40%. Before the full-scale war, Ukraine produced 52 million cubic meters of gas daily but needed 110&#x2013;140 million cubic meters in winter, covering the gap from storage. Russian strikes have reduced domestic production, forcing Ukraine to increase imports. In February, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said the country would need at least 1 billion cubic meters of imported gas by the end of 2025. Ukraine imported 560 million cubic meters of gas from Europe in February, nearly matching the total of 700 million cubic meters for the previous heating season. Bloomberg reported on March 4 that Ukraine plans to import 3.5 billion cubic meters for the next winter. Ukraine&apos;s gas import plans come as Europe faces high competition and rising prices while working to replenish low gas reserves. At the start of 2025, Ukraine halted its transit agreement to transport Russian gas to European customers through its pipelines, as the deal expired at the end of 2024 and was not renewed.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-dtek-gas-production-facilities-shut-down-after-russian-attack/	2025-03-07T12:41:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2147953046.jpg
Ukraine signs LNG deal with Poland’s Orlen amid Russian attacks	Ukraine&apos;s largest state-owned energy company, Naftogaz, and Poland&apos;s petroleum refineries company, Orlen, have signed a contract for the supply of approximately 100 million cubic meters (mcm) of liquefied natural gas (LNG), Naftogaz announced on March 7. As Russia continues targeting Ukraine&#x2019;s energy grid&#x2014;specifically its gas infrastructure&#x2014;domestic gas production has declined due to Russian strikes, forcing Ukraine to increase imports. The gas supply agreement was formalized alongside a strategic cooperation document on LNG supply, Naftogaz said. &quot;Partnering with ORLEN strengthens energy security, diversifies supply routes, and accelerates Ukraine&apos;s integration into the European gas market,&quot; said Roman Chumak, CEO of Naftogaz. The gas will come from an LNG shipment delivered to a terminal in Klaipeda, Lithuania. From there, it will be transported through Lithuania and Poland before reaching Ukraine via the Drozdovychi interconnector, where Naftogaz will receive it. Robert Soszynski, vice president of Polish ORLEN, described the cooperation agreement as &quot;mutually beneficial.&quot; &quot;Our relationship will be based on commercial terms, but securing an additional gas source is also crucial for Ukraine&#x2019;s security,&quot; he said. On Feb. 11, Russia launched a combined missile and drone attack on Ukraine, primarily targeting Poltava Oblast and damaging Naftogaz production facilities in the region. Before the full-scale invasion, Ukraine produced 52 million cubic meters (mcm) of gas per day but required 110-140 million mcm in winter, covering the shortfall from storage. Russian attacks have since reduced Ukraine&#x2019;s domestic gas output, increasing its reliance on foreign purchases. Ukraine plans to import about 3.5 billion cubic meters of gas for the upcoming heating season due to ongoing Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure, Bloomberg reported on March 4. At the start of 2025, Ukraine halted its agreement with Russia to transport Russian gas to European customers via Ukrainian pipelines. The deal expired at the end of 2024 and was not renewed.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-signs-lng-deal-with-polands-orlen-amid-russian-attacks/	2025-03-07T12:25:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2147892507.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukrainian troops' logistics in Kursk Oblast destroyed, they face risk of encirclement, sources say	Key developments on March 7: Russian forces have destroyed Ukrainian troops&apos; logistics in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, and Ukrainian soldiers face the risk of encirclement, a Ukrainian soldier and a medic deployed in the region told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity on March 7. The confirmation came after several media reported that Russian forces had made a breakthrough south of the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast. The Ukrainian battlefield monitoring group DeepState has confirmed a push deep into Ukrainian positions toward the Ukrainian state border in Sumy Oblast. A Ukrainian soldier fighting in Kursk Oblast described the situation in the Russian region as &quot;critical,&quot; warning that Ukrainian troops in the region face the threat of encirclement. He added that Ukrainian soldiers based in the region would like to withdraw. According to the source, all bridges in the vicinity of Sudzha have been destroyed, and Ukrainian troops are cut off from ammunition and fuel supplies. The Ukrainian medic stationed in Kursk Oblast told the Kyiv Independent that Russia&apos;s breakthrough happened about three days ago, and Russian troops control all the roads. According to DeepState, &quot;the most critical situation&quot; is on the border of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast and Ukraine&apos;s Sumy Oblast. Russian troops are trying to push on Ukrainian positions near the villages of Zhuravka and Novenke in Sumy Oblast, DeepState reported. Russia has also intensified its attacks near the village of Kurilovka near the border with Sumy Oblast, some 5 kilometers (3 miles) south of Sudzha, DeepState said in its latest update on March 7. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Earlier in the day, the spokesperson of the Ukrainian group of forces in Kursk Oblast declined to comment on the situation in the Russian region. Russian forces have recently intensified efforts to break through to Sumy Oblast and cut off logistical routes of the Ukrainian salient in bordering Kursk Oblast. Kyiv has sought to maintain its position in the Russian border region as leverage for possible peace talks. Moscow&apos;s troops have almost reached the Ukrainian border south of Ukrainian positions in Sudzha, meaning that at least some areas have been cut off from the main salient, the independent Russian outlet Agentstvo reported on March 7, citing an expert from the Conflict Intelligence Team. &quot;Difficult battles continue in the border area of Sumy Oblast; Russian assault units are attempting to break through and move toward a highway from Yunakivka (in Sumy Oblast) to Sudzha in Kursk Oblast,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &quot;(Ukraine&apos;s) Defense Forces are fighting and dealing significant casualties to Russian troops,&quot; Kovalenko claimed, without confirming a Russian breakthrough. The prominent Russian pro-war channel Two Majors also reported on the advance, claiming that Moscow&apos;s troops have penetrated up to 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) deep into Ukrainian positions. U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 7 that he is considering imposing sweeping banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until there is a ceasefire and peace agreement. According to Trump, his statement is based on the fact that Russia &quot;is absolutely &#x2018;pounding&#x2019; Ukraine on the battlefield&quot; - a possible reference to Russia&apos;s recent advances in Kursk Oblast or Russia&apos;s large-scale missile and drone attack on Ukraine on March 7. &quot;Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely &apos;pounding&apos; Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large-scale banking sanctions, sanctions, and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and final settlement agreement on peace is reached,&quot; Trump wrote on the Truth Social media platform. &quot;To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. Thank you!&quot; Shortly after his inauguration, Trump threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions on Russia to force their hand in negotiations, saying &quot;we can do it the easy way or the hard way.&quot; In the following weeks, Trump instead lashed out at Ukraine, claiming President Volodymyr Zelensky was &quot;not ready for peace&quot; and halting military aid to Ukraine and intelligence sharing with Kyiv. U.S. President Donald Trump said at a press briefing on March 7 that he finds it more difficult to deal with Kyiv than with Moscow but admitted that &quot;Russia is bombing the hell out of Ukraine.&quot; When asked during the press briefing why the U.S. wouldn&apos;t provide more air defense to Ukraine instead of halting military aid, Trump replied that he has to know &quot;they want to settle.&quot; &quot;If (the Ukrainians) don&apos;t want to settle, we&apos;re out of there,&quot; he said. &quot;I think he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) is doing what anybody else would do. I think he wants to get (the war) ended, but he&apos;s hitting them harder than ever, which is what anybody would be doing in his place,&quot; Trump added. The U.S. president also said he wants Russia&apos;s full-scale war to end before making any security guarantees to Ukraine. On the contrary, Kyiv insists on security guarantees before reaching a peace deal with Russia. Ukraine&apos;s French-provided Mirage 2000 fighter jets took part in repelling a Russian air attack on Ukraine for the first time on March 7, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Russia launched a large-scale aerial assault overnight, firing 67 missiles of various types and deploying 194 drones. Ukraine&apos;s air defenses intercepted 34 missiles and 100 drones, with anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare systems, and mobile fire groups contributing to the effort. Fighter jets, including F-16s and French Mirage 2000s, were also deployed. Russia targeted energy and gas infrastructure across the country, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said. At least two people were injured as a result of the attacks after a Russian missile damaged two residential buildings in Poltava Oblast, injuring one adult and one child. No information was immediately available as to the status of their injuries. Russia initially launched a series of missiles around 4 a.m. local time, targeting various regions in the country&apos;s far west. A second series of missiles entered Ukrainian airspace around 6 a.m. The aftermath of a Russian attack on Ukraine overnight on March 7, 2025. (State Emergency Service)Explosions were reported in the western city of Ternopil around 5 a.m. local time, following the first series of attacks, Suspilne reported. Later in the morning, explosions were heard in the front line city of Kharkiv around 6:30 a.m. Ternopil Oblast Regional Governor Viacheslav Nehoda reported that a critical infrastructure facility in the region had been struck with a Russian missile. Although no injuries were reported, Nehoda added that gas supplies may be interrupted as a result of the attack. Critical infrastructure facilities were also targeted in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, though no damage or casualties were reported, according to Governor Svitlana Onyshchuk. Russia struck already the sixth facility of the DTEK energy company in Odesa Oblast in the past two and a half weeks, the company said. Critical infrastructure facilities were also targeted in Chernihiv Oblast, with at least one of them suffering damage, according to Governor Viacheslav Chaus. Several EU members have pledged to provide up to 15 billion euros ($16.3 billion) in additional aid for Ukraine, European Council President Antonio Costa said at a summit on March 6. EU leaders met in Brussels to discuss plans for boosting Europe&apos;s defense capabilities and support for Ukraine amid the seismic foreign policy shifts in the U.S. Ukraine&apos;s President Volodmyr Zelensky also took part in the meeting. The summit concluded without additional EU aid packages for Ukraine as the discussed 20-billion-euro tranche ($22 billion) was dropped from the final declaration. Kyiv needs more support now than ever, as the Trump administration has frozen all military assistance flowing to the country. As any EU-wide assistance package is under threat of being blocked by Hungary&apos;s Moscow-friendly leader, Viktor Orban, top EU officials suggested that further aid should be provided through a &quot;coalition of the willing.&quot; &quot;Immediately, member states can increase their support thanks to the increased fiscal space,&quot; Costa said at a press conference in Brussels. During the summit, EU leaders unanimously agreed on a new defense initiative that could mobilize up to 800 billion euros ($867 billion) through loans and loosening fiscal rules for government spending. &quot;Several member states have already announced their pledges up to 15 billion euros. Today, we have also tasked the Council to work urgently on further initiatives to address Ukraine&#x2019;s pressing military and defense needs,&quot; Costa said, without naming the countries. &quot;This is a tipping point for Europe. And today, we have shown that the European Union is rising to the challenge,&quot; the European Council president said.

Republicans urge Trump to resume military, intelligence assistance to Ukraine	Republican lawmakers are calling on President Donald Trump to resume U.S. military and intelligence assistance to Ukraine, the Hill reported on March 7. The Trump administration halted U.S. military aid to Ukraine and intelligence sharing with Kyiv earlier this week following a heated exchange between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28. The decision is intended to put pressure on Zelensky in peace talks with Russia. Shortly after U.S. halted intelligence-sharing, Russia launched another large-scale aerial attack on Ukraine overnight on March 7, launching 67 missiles of various types and 194 drones. Ukraine&apos;s air defenses intercepted 34 missiles and 100 drones, the Air Force said. Republicans say that Trump had the right to temporarily suspend weapons supplies to Kyiv in order to assess the war, put pressure on NATO allies, and to create a window for peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, according to the Hill. But some warned that an excessively long pause in military aid could have a devastating effect on Ukraine&apos;s combat capabilities and undermine its leverage in talks with Moscow. &quot;I do not think we should be pausing our efforts. It&#x2019;s the Ukrainians who are shedding blood,&quot; said Susan Collins, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee. She called the suspension of U.S. military aid a &quot;critical time for Ukraine.&quot; Some Republicans also urged Trump to immediately resume intelligence sharing with Ukraine. John Cornyn, a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that the intelligence that Ukrainians received from the U.S. &quot;has been essential for them to be able to stay in the fight.&quot; Senator Thom Tillis warned that a pause in aid to Ukraine &quot;could be helpful to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,&quot; but he didn&apos;t oppose the stoppage if it was a short-term &quot;negotiating tactic.&quot; Senate Majority Leader John Thune also suggested that a pause in U.S. military aid would be temporary and could be part of talks. The halt in military aid leaves over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition undelivered to Kyiv, while the pause in intelligence sharing affects warnings against Russian drones and missiles striking Ukrainian military and civilian targets, Ukrainian and U.S. officials told the New York Times.	https://kyivindependent.com/republicans-call-on-trump-to/	2025-03-07T11:36:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202741274.jpg
In Kyiv, Trump's intel freeze raises fears of Russian missiles striking without warning	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s decision to pause sharing intelligence with Kyiv has raised fears in major Ukrainian cities that Russian missile attacks could now occur without any warning. &quot;It will be a catastrophe,&quot; Oleh Yeremenov, a fourth-year film directing student, told the Kyiv Independent on the streets of Kyiv on March 6. &quot;If missiles just start hitting out of nowhere&#x2026; people will panic.&quot; According to the New York Times (NYT) on March 6, the intelligence-sharing freeze could affect crucial warnings about incoming Russian drones and missiles. Trump announced the move amid sharply deteriorating relations between Kyiv and Washington, as he strong-arms Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into acquiescing to his plans for peace talks with Russia. Compounding the problem, the U.S. has also frozen military aid to Ukraine, meaning crucial air defense interceptor missiles could be in short supply until it resumes. Oleh Yeremenov, a fourth-year film directing student in Kyiv, Ukraine on March 6, 2025. (The Kyiv Independent) Shortly after the freeze on March 5, a Russian Iskander ballistic missile struck a hotel in Kryvyi Rih, killing four people and injuring at least 30, hammering home what&apos;s at stake when Russian missiles are not intercepted. &quot;They don&apos;t think about the consequences this will have,&quot; &#xA0;Stanislav Khmel, a Kyiv resident who is currently unemployed, said. &quot;I think this will result in more casualties for us, for our people.&quot; In the early hours of March 7, Russia launched a mass aerial attack at civilian energy infrastructure in cities across the country, firing cruise missiles from bomber aircraft, ballistic missiles, as well as nearly 200 kamikaze drones. Ukraine&apos;s air raid alert system, as well as Telegram monitoring channels that the public rely on to know what has been launched and where it is headed, all worked as normal, suggesting Kyiv still has access to intelligence on missiles launched from Russian aircraft. But several successful hits were recorded, with explosions reported in Poltava, Kharkiv, Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Odesa oblasts. With both the military and intelligence freezes still in place, concerns are rising that the death and destruction caused by Russian strikes could worsen significantly. People interviewed by the Kyiv Independent said their lives &#x201C;hinge on&#x201D; accurate air raid threat data, and the timely sounding of alerts. &quot;Maybe I will be the one who won&apos;t have time to react, and a drone will hit me, my building, or the building of my family or friends,&quot; barista Andrii Horbulia &#xA0;said. Despite Zelensky calling the now infamous Oval Office clash with Trump &quot;regrettable&quot; on March 4, and talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials scheduled for next week, there have been no clear signals from the White House about when the intelligence and aid freezes will be lifted. Those who spoke to the Kyiv Independent questioned why the U.S. has made a move that potentially harms civilians so much. Yan Nikuliak, student at Taras Shevchenko University, in Kyiv, Ukraine on March 6, 2025. (The Kyiv Independent) &quot;We just are saving civilian lives (with this intelligence). And if we lose that, then we lose more lives,&quot; Yan Nikuliak, a student at Taras Shevchenko University, said. &quot;Peace will not be attained this way. Never.&quot; Nikuliak&apos;s comments reflect a widespread dismay in Ukraine currently, that they are being punished and bullied into a peace process while nothing is being asked of Moscow. &#x201C;In such a difficult time, this is an incredibly terrible decision that will only lead to a greater genocide of the Ukrainian people,&quot; Daria Pravdyva, a student, said. Daria Pravdyva, a student in Kyiv, Ukraine on March 6, 2025. (The Kyiv Independent) Nikuliak addressed Trump directly, saying he thought the U.S. president had made &quot;a big mistake.&quot; &quot;You should reconsider. You will not attain any semblance of peace in such a way,&quot; he said, adding: &quot; You need to change your ways now, or there will be no people left to actually enjoy the peace you want in Ukraine.&quot; Some of those interviewed expressed hope that European allies would step up in the short term. Khalida Bakhtiyarova, a professor at the National Transport University in Kyiv, Ukraine on March 6, 2025. (The Kyiv Independent) &quot;I hope maybe our friends in the European Union will help us, maybe they will offer alternative ways to replace these capabilities,&quot; Khalida Bakhtiyarova, a professor at the National Transport University, said. But others interviewed were more fatalistic about the threat. &quot;It has been a long time since I came to live with the thought that I might die at any moment. It&apos;s just a thought that is always in the back of my mind,&quot; student Yan Nikuliak said.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-intel-freeze-trump/	2025-03-07T11:32:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2185247530.jpg

Trump accuses Ukraine of being 'more difficult to deal with' than Russia	U.S. President Donald Trump said at a press briefing on March 7 that he finds it more difficult to deal with Kyiv than with Moscow but admitted that &quot;Russia is bombing the hell out of Ukraine.&quot; Earlier in the day, Trump said that he is considering imposing sweeping banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until there is a ceasefire and peace agreement. He added that &quot;Russia is absolutely &apos;pounding&apos; Ukraine on the battlefield right now.&quot; When asked during the press briefing why the U.S. wouldn&apos;t provide more air defense to Ukraine instead of halting military aid, Trump replied that he has to know &quot;they want to settle.&quot; &quot;If (the Ukrainians) don&apos;t want to settle, we&apos;re out of there,&quot; he said. &quot;I think he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) is doing what anybody else would do. I think he wants to get (the war) ended, but he&apos;s hitting them harder than ever, which is what anybody would be doing in his place,&quot; Trump added. The U.S. president also said he wants Russia&apos;s full-scale war to end before making any security guarantees to Ukraine. On the contrary, Kyiv insists on security guarantees before reaching a peace deal with Russia. Trump has long promised to bring about a swift end to Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, though progress towards such a deal was disrupted after he ejected President Volodymyr Zelensky from the White House on Feb. 28 and claimed Ukraine was &quot;not ready for peace.&quot; Following the clash, Trump halted military aid to Ukraine, including intelligence sharing with Kyiv, as part of an effort to pressure Kyiv into quick negotiations with Moscow. U.S. and Ukrainian delegations are planning to meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 to discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement. Meanwhile, Zelensky has proposed a &quot;truce in the sky&quot; banning missiles, long-range drones, and bombs targeting civilian infrastructure, as well as a &quot;truce at sea&quot; as the first steps towards the de-escalation. Trump&apos;s March 7 threat to impose sanctions on Moscow and his statement on Russia &quot;pounding&quot; Ukraine comes amid Russian aerial attacks against Ukraine in recent days. As Russia kept launching drones and missiles at Ukraine, &quot;Trump&apos;s rage has been intensifying,&quot; Axios reported on March 7, citing an unnamed White House official. Russia launched another large-scale aerial attack on Ukraine overnight on March 7, launching 67 missiles of various types and 194 drones. Ukraine&apos;s air defenses intercepted 34 missiles and 100 drones, the Air Force said.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-accuses-kyiv-of-being-more-difficult-to-deal-with-says-russia-bombing-the-hell-out-of-ukraine/	2025-03-07T10:34:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203345473.jpg
How Europe is gearing up for a new world order	In a city usually synonymous with bloated bureaucracy, not all official gatherings are worth the fuss. The emergency EU summit on March 6, however, was one to remember. EU member states agreed to unlock what could amount to an unprecedented 800 billion euros ($867 billion) for defense spending amid mounting signs the U.S. is no longer a reliable ally, and the defense of Ukraine is falling squarely on their shoulders. &quot;Europe is finally waking up and hearing the alarm bells,&quot; one senior European diplomat with knowledge of the discussions told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;These kinds of discussions wouldn&apos;t have happened two or three weeks ago, let alone two or three months ago.&quot; The impetus for the emergency summit were the recent actions of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has become increasingly hostile toward Ukraine and Europe, as he seeks what appears to be a rapprochement with a newly-emboldened Kremlin. Speaking at the summit, European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen summed up the crisis facing Europe, describing it as a &quot;watershed moment&quot; where Europe faces a &quot;clear and present danger.&quot; While the EU is trying to step up to meet the moment, another alliance of nations from Europe and beyond is also taking shape. With the U.S. receding from its role as a guarantor of European security and pulling vital intelligence and military support from Ukraine, Europe is preparing to fend for itself. &quot;It&apos;s like a nightmare we want to wake up from,&quot; an EU official told the Kyiv Independent at the Brussels summit. The Trump administration&apos;s about-turn away from more than eighty years of U.S. global leadership has prompted the outline for a new alliance of nations to secure peace for Ukraine and Europe. Led by France and the U.K., the so-called &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; could be made up of a mix of EU states, other European countries, and like-minded partners including Canada and Australia. &quot;The wider the better&quot; said the EU official, &quot;if we can count on Norway and the U.K., why not?&quot; they added, in a sign that Brexit now appears to be a distant memory. French President Emmanuel Macron and President Volodymyr Zelensky attend an EU emergency summit in Brussels, Belgium, on March 6, 2025.

(Nicolas Tucat/AFP via Getty Images)Paris has proposed a path to peace that would start with a one-month truce in the air and at sea. French President Emmanuel Macron said this would give Russia a chance to prove it is serious about peace. Crucially, this plan also received support from President Volodymyr Zelensky at the meeting of EU leaders on March 6 &#x2014; paving the way for a wider plan to be formulated with the help from U.K. and Ukraine which will then be presented to the U.S. and, eventually, Russia. But how any peace deal might be enforced remains a topic of debate among coalition leaders. &quot;There is no problem finding willing countries, the problem is figuring out what and how to enforce,&quot; another senior EU diplomat told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Discussions won&apos;t be concrete until we know what there is to enforce.&quot; Coalition countries have so far pledged varying levels of support to a future peacekeeping force for Ukraine. Speaking at a press conference alongside U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 27, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that together, the countries were &quot;ready to support Ukraine with troops on the ground and planes in the air.&quot; The U.K. and France have clearly said they would send troops to Ukraine to uphold a peace deal. Around ten other countries, including Spain, Portugal, Australia, Denmark, Canada, and Turkey, said they could be open to sending peacekeepers, while others, including the Netherlands and Ireland, committed logistical and technological support to the plan. New steps to support Ukraine have already been taken in the short term &#x2014; Norway announced it would more than double its support this year, the U.K. will give Ukraine an additional $2 billion for air defense, and Franco-British Starlink competitor Eutelsat is in discussions with Ukraine on reducing its dependence on Elon Musk&apos;s technology. The next step will be a meeting next week, convened in Paris by President Macron, of military chiefs from countries willing to commit troops to enforce peace in Ukraine in an effort to coordinate and draw up a potential peacekeeping mission. The EU, for its part, does not have authority or responsibility over defense, but it can provide financial assistance. EU leaders&apos; meeting in Brussels on March 6 took steps towards a dramatic long-term transformation of European defense, pledging to &quot;substantially increase expenditure on Europe&apos;s security and defense&quot; and tasking the European Commission to find more money and more financial tools to help member states quickly ramp up military spending. &quot;Russia is leading a hybrid war against our democracies. It seeks to uproot the world we have, a world of peace which we built since the end of the Cold War,&quot; French Europe Minister Benjamin Haddad told the Kyiv Independent at the meeting. &quot;We will define the areas in which we&apos;re lacking, be it ammunition, drones, or cyber, and then figure out common European financing to support member states in making those investments,&quot; he added. One of the ways it plans to support this surge in defense spending is through a 150 billion euro ($162 billion) fund from which member states can borrow money to spend on collective European defense, or to support Ukraine. The leaders also endorsed another crucial step for the EU &#x2014; getting out of the way. The bloc will loosen its debt rules, allowing member states to dramatically increase their defense spending by borrowing more. Should all EU states decide to ramp up defense spending by 1.5% of GDP on average, these new rules could mean an additional 650 billion euros ($705 billion) spent on defense in the EU over four years. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk didn&apos;t mince his words on the sense of urgency. &quot;There is no doubt that the war in Ukraine, the new approach of the American administration to Europe, and the arms race started by Russia pose completely new challenges to us,&quot; Tusk told reporters at the meeting. &quot;Europe must join this arms race and win it.&quot; EU leaders also made another significant move highlighting this new sense of urgency &#x2014; ignoring Hungary. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban chose not to support the bloc&apos;s statement of intent on continued support for Ukraine on the battlefield, in peace talks, and beyond. Rather than trying to convince Orban, the 26 other EU leaders decided to crack on without him. &quot;Hungary has always made things difficult; it&apos;s good that the rest said, &apos;We don&apos;t buy it; you go your own way.&apos; It&apos;s just more pragmatic to ignore Prime Minister Orban,&quot; the EU diplomat said. That sentiment was echoed by European Council President Antonio Costa. &quot;Hungary is isolated,&quot; he said at the end of the meeting. &quot;We respect Hungary&apos;s position, but it&apos;s one of 27. And 26 are more than one.&quot; (L-R) Cyprus&apos; President Nikos Christodoulides speaks with Hungary&apos;s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, EU Commission Vice-President Kaja Kallas, and Poland&apos;s Prime Minister Donald Tusk before an EU summit in Brussels, Belgium, on March 6, 2025. (Thierry Monasse/Getty Images)The Hungarian leader lashed out after the meeting, aligning himself with Trump and accusing other EU leaders of wanting to &quot;continue the war (in Ukraine) as long as it takes.&quot; This sets up another clash between Budapest and the 26 other member states in the coming weeks. Not having Hungary on board at this meeting made little practical difference, but upcoming debates about renewing sanctions against Russia, continuing to freeze Russian assets, or new support packages for Ukraine could still see Hungary grinding the EU to a halt. That, and the fact the EU is fundamentally not designed to tackle defense issues, means the future of European military rearmament, and Ukrainian survival, will rely on the commitment of individual EU countries, and allies further afield. In a clear sign of the importance of these new partnerships, the presidents of the European Commission and European Council, as well as the EU&apos;s top diplomat Kaja Kallas, convened a video call with the leaders of the U.K., Turkey, Canada, Norway, and Iceland to debrief them on the EU&apos;s new plans. As Europe gears up for this new reality, EU officials speaking to the Kyiv Independent were stoic, &quot;The spirit of our discussions is that Europe will have to go it alone. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/how-europe-is-gearing-up-for-a-new-world-order/	2025-03-07T10:15:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202965061.jpg
Belarus Weekly: Belarus, Russia ratify security pact, expanding nuclear umbrella, military integration	Belarus and Russia ratified the Union State Security Pact, expanding the nuclear umbrella and military integration. Belarusian dictator Aleksandr Lukashenko invites U.S President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and Russian President Vladimir Putin to Minsk for peace talks. Belarus criminalizes sharing information on military movements and expands in absentia prosecution of exiled opponents. Local media reported that a stray drone crashed into power lines in Belarus, causing outages in Mazyr. Belarus hits record low in the Freedom House report, ranking 192-194 out of 207 globally. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko have concluded the ratification of the Union State security guarantees, expanding Russia&#x2019;s nuclear umbrella over Belarus and deepening the military integration of the two countries. The Union State security pact was signed on Dec. 6, stipulating that Russian nuclear weapons can be used against an aggressor state &#x2014; even ones that don&#x2019;t have nuclear weapons themselves. Putin signed the law ratifying the agreement on Feb. 28, after speedy consideration in Russia&#x2019;s State Duma in February. Belarus&#x2019;s Lukashenko signed the ratification law on March 4, his press office reported. The pact will enter into force after the sides exchange ratification documents. The security pact signing comes on the same day the Russian parliament ratified another agreement postponing Belarus&#x2019;s repayment of about $800 million in Russian state loans. Opposition politician Pavel Latushka, formerly an official in the Belarusian foreign ministry, linked the two ratifications. &#x201C;Lukashenko got himself into debt with Russia, and now he&#x2019;s paying with the country&#x2019;s national sovereignty,&#x201D; Latushka said. Beyond expanding the Russian &#x201C;nuclear umbrella&#x201D; to cover Belarus, Article 5 of the agreement provides for the establishment of Russian military bases and stationing of Russian troops on the territory of Belarus &#x201C;to prevent and repel acts of aggression.&#x201D; However, the implementation of this provision would require a separate agreement between Minsk and Moscow. Russia has been pushing to establish an air base in Belarus since 2015. The treaty also obliges the parties to &#x201C;support&#x201D; each other in the event of a threat to their constitutional orders &#x2014; allowing each to potentially intervene to suppress public protests in either of the two countries. The Union State security agreement lasts for ten years and is automatically extended, unless one of the parties declares its intention to withdraw six months in advance. According to NATO estimates, Belarus hosted up to 30,000 Russian troops in the buildup to the Russian attack on Kyiv in February-March 2022, in the pretense that they were taking part in the &#x201C;Union Determination-2022&#x201D; military drills. Following Russian forces&#x2019; withdrawal from the northern front, the number of Russian troops in Belarus gradually fell, with just about 2,000 soldiers now being left, according to the Belarusian Hajun monitoring project. In September 2025, Belarus is to host up to 13,000 troops for the Zapad-2025 (West-2025) exercises. The Russian-Belarusian plans to hold the exercises have sparked concern among Ukrainian officials. Minsk is prepared to host the leaders of the United States, Ukraine, and Russia for talks on ending Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, Lukashenko, a staunch Moscow ally, said in an interview on March 4. Lukashenko&#x2019;s remarks came shortly after the United States imposed an immediate freeze on military aid to Ukraine, in a move the White House claimed was meant to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into entering peace negotiations. In an interview with U.S. Internet media personality Mario Nawfal, Lukashenko reiterated his praise for U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he was willing to help achieve his goal of brokering peace between Kyiv and Moscow. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s only 200 kilometers from the Belarusian border to Kyiv &#x2013; half an hour by plane,&#x201D; Lukashenko told Nawfal. &quot;You are welcome to come. We will sit down here. We&#x2019;ll come to an agreement quietly, without noise, without shouting. So tell Trump: I&#x2019;m waiting for him here, along with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and Zelensky. We&#x2019;ll sit down and calmly negotiate. If you want to make a deal.&#x201D; The Kremlin has already backed the proposal. &#x201C;This issue has not been raised or discussed in any way. But, of course, Minsk is the best place for us. It is our main ally, so it is the best place for negotiations,&#x201D; Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. In the early days of Russia&#x2019;s all-out invasion, negotiations between Ukraine and Russia were held in Belarus but were later moved to Istanbul. Minsk has repeatedly attempted to get a seat at the negotiating table, at the same time requiring &#x201C;security guarantees&#x201D; for itself. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhiy Tykhyi said, &#x201C;Belarusian officials have the right to claim a fair hearing in the process of bringing the aggressor and his accomplices to international legal responsibility for the crime of aggression against Ukraine.&#x201D; Belarus previously hosted talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 2014 and 2015, which led to the signing of the Minsk Agreements. The agreements were meant to stop Russia&#x2019;s war in eastern Ukraine, but both of the documents were ultimately violated by Russia. Two days before launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Putin declared that the Minsk Agreements &#x201C;no longer existed.&#x201D; Lukashenko has been trying to make himself noticed by Trump, rushing to congratulate him on winning the U.S. presidential elections even before the results were confirmed, and promising to nominate President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Following the failure of the rare earth metals deal with Ukraine on Feb. 28, Lukashenko ordered his ministers to look into the issue of mining rare earth metals in Belarus. Updates to the criminal code in Belarus have introduced prison sentences of up to three years for the &#x201C;unauthorized sharing of information&#x201D; about the deployment of military units and their movement within the country, Human Rights watchdog Viasna reported on Feb. 28. The changes to the code also broaden the category of offenses that can be subject to in absentia prosecution. Since Russia unleashed its all-out invasion of Ukraine, Belarusians have been reporting the movement of Russian troops, and sharing footage and information on Russian troop locations with independent media and open-source intelligence projects. Ninety-three Belarusians have been sentenced on &#x201C;extremism&#x201D; charges for doing so. The updated criminal code, which entered into effect on March 2, essentially outlaws sharing any form of content featuring the military in Belarus during wartime, emergencies, or counter-terrorist operations &#x2014; unless the authorities have already shared such information. Violations are punishable by up to three years of imprisonment, or six years, if premeditated and committed by a group, and causing significant damage, the amended code reads. The updated criminal code also introduces the new status of &#x201C;a president who ceased to fulfill his duties&#x201D; and criminalizes violence, threats, and libel against him. According to the current constitution, the incumbent, Alexander Lukashenko, can be &#x201C;re-elected&#x201D; once more and rule until 2035. Although there are no apparent signs of an impending transition of power, the Belarusian authorities have established an extra-governmental body &#x2014; the All-Belarus People&#x2019;s Assembly, which is headed by Lukashenko &#x2014; to which the dictator could &#x201C;retire&#x201D; after leaving the presidency, while still wielding considerable influence. A stray Russian attack drone crashed into high-voltage power grid lines at a thermal power plant on Feb. 27, causing the most significant damage by a drone in Belarus so far, Flagshtok, a local news outlet in the Homiel region, has reported. Russian drone incursions into the Belarusian airspace have risen sharply since July 2024. At least 395 drones were recorded flying over the country in the second half of the year, and this year 94 were spotted in January alone. The Belarusian authorities don&#x2019;t comment on the incidents, and never publicly objected to them with their ally &#x2013; Moscow. On the morning of Feb. 27, residents of Mazyr, Homiel Oblast, about 45 kilometers from the border with Ukraine, were cut off from heating and hot water supplies. Local state energy company Homielenergo attributed the problem to a breakdown in the rather old heat supply system, without elaborating on the cause. Heating and hot water supplies were restored after a full day of repair work. According to Flagshtok&#x2019;s sources, the drone crashed into the high-voltage lines of a thermal power plant, triggering its automatic protection system, which led to a full shutdown of the plant, which is located south of the Mazyr Oil Refinery &#x2014; a strategic object reportedly protected by Belarusian air defenses. Restarting the plant caused a fault in the piping system. On the same night, another drone crashed and set fire to a farm building in Ziabrauka, a village next to a military airfield in the Homiel Oblast. Residents reported the sound of gunfire and a blast at around 4 a.m. Belarus ranked 192-194th out of 207 countries and territories worldwide on the level of political and civil liberties, according to global human rights watchdog Freedom House&#x2019;s Freedom in the World report, which was published on Feb. 26. The Freedom in the World report, first published in 1973, tracks the condition of political rights and civil liberties around the globe. According to its authors, global freedom declined in 2024 for the 19th consecutive year, and Belarus received some of the &#x201C;worst aggregate scores&#x201D; for political rights and civil liberties. The country scored just seven points out of 100, sharing its position with Azerbaijan and Myanmar. Hundreds of Belarus opposition supporters take part in a march in Warsaw, Poland on Jan. 25, 2025.

According to the recent estimates by Belarusian opposition People&#x2019;s Anti-Crisis Management initiative, up to 3,500 Ukrainian children from Russia-occupied Ukrainian territories were transported to Belarus. Belarus is also one of the most repressive countries for lawyers. Over the past four years, up to 27% of Belarusian lawyers were disbarred or lost their licenses after representing political prisoners in courts, U.S. government-funded broadcaster RFE/RL reported, citing the International Observatory of Lawyers.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-belarus-russia-ratify-security-pact-expanding-nuclear-umbrella-military-integration/	2025-03-07T09:36:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2190761497.jpg
Ukrainian troops' logistics in Kursk Oblast destroyed, they face risk of encirclement, sources say	Russian forces have destroyed Ukrainian troops&apos; logistics in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, and Ukrainian soldiers face the risk of encirclement, a Ukrainian soldier and a medic deployed in the region told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity on March 7. The confirmation came after several media reported that Russian forces had made a breakthrough south of the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast. The Ukrainian battlefield monitoring group DeepState has confirmed a push deep into Ukrainian positions toward the Ukrainian state border in Sumy Oblast. A Ukrainian soldier fighting in Kursk Oblast described the situation in the Russian region as &quot;critical,&quot; warning that Ukrainian troops in the region face the threat of encirclement. He added that Ukrainian soldiers based in the region would like to withdraw. According to the source, all bridges in the vicinity of Sudzha have been destroyed, and Ukrainian troops are cut off from ammunition and fuel supplies. The Ukrainian medic stationed in Kursk Oblast told the Kyiv Independent that Russia&apos;s breakthrough happened about three days ago, and Russian troops control all the roads. According to DeepState, &quot;the most critical situation&quot; is on the border of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast and Ukraine&apos;s Sumy Oblast. Russian troops are trying to push on Ukrainian positions near the villages of Zhuravka and Novenke in Sumy Oblast, DeepState reported. Russia has also intensified its attacks near the village of Kurilovka near the border with Sumy Oblast, some 5 kilometers (3 miles) south of Sudzha, DeepState said in its latest update on March 7. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Earlier in the day, the spokesperson of the Ukrainian group of forces in Kursk Oblast declined to comment on the situation in the Russian region. Russian forces have recently intensified efforts to break through to Sumy Oblast and cut off logistical routes of the Ukrainian salient in bordering Kursk Oblast. Kyiv has sought to maintain its position in the Russian border region as leverage for possible peace talks. Moscow&apos;s troops have almost reached the Ukrainian border south of Ukrainian positions in Sudzha, meaning that at least some areas have been cut off from the main salient, the independent Russian outlet Agentstvo reported on March 7, citing an expert from the Conflict Intelligence Team. &quot;Difficult battles continue in the border area of Sumy Oblast; Russian assault units are attempting to break through and move toward a highway from Yunakivka (in Sumy Oblast) to Sudzha in Kursk Oblast,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &quot;(Ukraine&apos;s) Defense Forces are fighting and dealing significant casualties to Russian troops,&quot; Kovalenko claimed, without confirming a Russian breakthrough. The prominent Russian pro-war channel Two Majors also reported on the advance, claiming that Moscow&apos;s troops have penetrated up to 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) deep into Ukrainian positions. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, the Russian military claimed.	https://kyivindependent.com/logistics-is-gone-russia-breaches-ukrainian-positions-in-kursk-oblast-sources-confirm/	2025-03-07T09:30:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166312696.jpg
Trump's increasing support for Russia leaves Zelensky with fewer options to secure U.S. backing	As Washington continues to pressure Kyiv intro submission, President Volodymyr Zelensky stands at a painful crossroads &#x2014; agree to U.S. demands or chart a course without Washington, pinning Ukraine&apos;s hopes for survival on Europe alone. Neither option seems reassuring for Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s constant verbal attacks against Zelensky and Ukraine and the halt in U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv have brought U.S.-Ukrainian relations to a record low. In the most recent blow, U.S. aerospace company Maxar Technologies has allegedly restricted Ukraine&apos;s access to its satellite imagery. Kyiv has relied on high-resolution satellite images for defense and strategic planning, tracking Russian troop movements, assessing battlefield conditions, and monitoring Russian infrastructure damage. With the U.S. actively obstructing Kyiv&apos;s ability to defend against Russia, European leaders have promised to fill the gap and step up their support for Ukraine. Despite that, analysts say Washington&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s war effort remains crucial, and Europe cannot fully replace the U.S. in the near future. Zelensky has attempted to slow down the U.S. pivot toward Russia, praising Trump&apos;s leadership and reiterating Ukraine&apos;s commitment to peace in a March 4 statement. The U.S. and Ukraine have scheduled a round of talks on ending the war with Russia in Saudi Arabia for next week. Yet, the U.S. has not resumed its military aid or intelligence cooperation, and U.S. officials have continued to verbally attack Ukraine. &quot;It is impossible to know Trump&apos;s mind, which in any event often changes,&quot; Roland Paris, a professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We can only judge his actions. To date, he has brought U.S. policy on Ukraine into alignment with that of Russia. Unless there is genuine pushback in the United States against this remarkable turnabout in U.S. policy, I would expect Trump to continue on the path he has already been following.&quot; As Trump is increasingly siding with Russia on all major issues, Zelensky may be tempted to break relations with the U.S. and rely exclusively on Europe. Following an emergency summit on March 6, the EU agreed to mobilize up to 800 billion euros ($867 billion) for defense spending amid fears that the U.S. might scale down its presence on the continent. The ReArm Europe initiative, proposed by the European Commission, includes a 150-billion-euro loan ($162 billion) covered by unused budget funds and a step to loosen fiscal rules and free up 600 billion euros ($650 billion) in government spending. But analysts say that relying only on Europe would be a very risky option. &quot;This would be a real disaster,&quot; Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We need Europe in the negotiation process for balance, but severing relations with the U.S. is dangerous for us.&quot; He said that Ukraine still depends on U.S. military aid, including Patriot air defense systems, reconnaissance satellites, and intelligence data, none of which Ukraine is receiving at the moment. &quot;If we go into conflict with the Americans, we will be pushing them toward closer ties with Russia,&quot; Fesenko added.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)If there is a conflict with the U.S., Washington may block not only free-of-charge aid but also the sale of U.S. weapons to Ukraine, as well as exert economic pressure and impose sanctions on Kyiv, Fesenko said. William Wohlforth, a professor focusing on international relations at Dartmouth College, also said that &quot;repairing relations with the Trump administration is a priority because, even if Washington does not provide direct assistance to Ukraine in the near term, its indirect help is needed even if European states take the lead.&quot; &quot;If it has the political will, Europe is probably capable of providing a multinational military force to help secure Ukraine in event of a ceasefire,&quot; he added. &quot;But I doubt very much that is possible without all sorts of U.S. indirect assistance: intelligence, logistics, organization. It makes sense for Ukraine to push for this European role but not in a way that suggests antagonism to the U.S.&quot; Charly Salonius-Pasternak, lead researcher at the Center on U.S. Politics and Power at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, said that it might be possible for Ukraine to rely exclusively on Europe&apos;s support in the long term. But it&apos;s impossible in the short run, he added. Experts say that, to improve relations with the U.S., Zelensky should be more subtle in his relations with Trump and focus on practical issues rather than rhetoric. &quot;What Zelensky and Ukrainian officials should not do is carry out a war of words with Donald Trump,&quot; Daniel Hamilton, a foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It is pointless. (Trump&apos;s) tactic is disorientation and distraction. Don&apos;t be distracted by his words or insults. Focus on your own interests and the role the United States may still be able to play to advance those interests. Stick to the specifics of the issues.&quot; Michael O&apos;Hanlon, a foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution, also said that Zelensky should &quot;avoid getting into verbal spats with the American president and vice president because to some extent it&apos;s what they thrive on&quot; but should not &quot;hesitate to express differences of opinion clearly and calmly.&quot; Several top U.S. officials, including U.S. State Secretary Marco Rubio, urged Zelensky to apologize to Trump after their clash during a meeting in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. Zelensky was berated by Trump and Vice President JD Vance and was told to leave the White House soon after. Analysts say that Zelensky should try to mend relations with Trump, but an outright apology or unilateral concessions would be seen as weakness. &quot;If (Zelensky) apologizes in a humiliating way, it will only lead to negative consequences,&quot; Fesenko said. &quot;Then, we will simply be crushed, oppressed, and forced to comply with whatever they dictate. We will lose the remnants of our independence.&quot; (Collage) US President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky meet in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, U.S. on Feb. 28, 2025. (Saul Loeb / AFP / Getty Images)He argued that the &quot;right tone must be found, and we must act extremely carefully &#x2014; as if walking through a minefield.&quot; Volodymyr Dubovyk, head of Odesa National University&apos;s Center for International Studies, also said that an outright apology from Zelensky &quot;would mean that Ukraine&apos;s position is weakening and softening.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s exactly what they want,&quot; he added. Fesenko and Dubovyk said that Zelensky should not seek a new personal meeting with Trump because it is unlikely to be productive. &quot;I think the very optics of (such meetings) is already negative, and so there&apos;s no need for them to meet physically again,&quot; Dubovyk said. Instead of a direct meeting between Zelensky and Trump, future contacts with the U.S. should be handled by professional negotiators, experts say. &quot;I think we already have enough experience to know that personal meetings with Trump don&apos;t work out,&quot; Mykhailo Minakov, head of the Ukrainian Research Program at the Kennan Institute, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Right now, we need to take a bit of a pause on direct personal contacts (between Zelensky and Trump) and focus on rebuilding at least some level of trust between the teams and restoring communication between the two camps.&quot; One of the stumbling blocks in U.S.-Ukrainian relations has been the issue of security guarantees. Zelensky has urged the U.S. to provide security guarantees to Ukraine before any ceasefire deal could be reached. The U.S. has been reluctant to provide them and insisted that a ceasefire deal should precede any discussion on security guarantees. O&apos;Hanlon said that Zelensky should &quot;recognize that Ukraine will likely get some outside security backstop, and continue to express hope that the United States will be part of any such arrangement, but recognize too that Kyiv is not in a position to &apos;demand&apos; it.&quot; Fesenko argued that, if Zelensky keeps insisting on security guarantees as a precondition for a ceasefire, relations with the U.S. are unlikely to improve. He said that &quot;this specific demand triggered a highly negative reaction from both Trump and Vance.&quot; &quot;They have no intention of providing us with any direct or official security guarantees,&quot; he added. &quot;Therefore, in my opinion, there is no sense in banging our heads against a locked door, only to end up with more bruises and an even deeper conflict with the U.S.&quot; On March 4, Zelensky attempted to mend relations with the U.S. Without apologizing directly, he wrote a conciliatory post on X (Twitter) expressing his gratitude to Trump and &quot;reiterating Ukraine&apos;s commitment to peace.&quot; He also proposed &quot;the release of prisoners and truce in the sky &#x2014; ban on missiles, long-range drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure &#x2014; and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same.&quot; Zelensky also said that Ukraine was ready to sign a mineral resources deal with the U.S. at any time and that he saw it as &quot;a step toward greater security and solid security guarantees.&quot; The deal would open the way for the U.S. to gain a cut of Ukrainian natural resources through a joint investment fund as payback for the country&apos;s support for Kyiv. The agreement was to be signed in Washington on Feb. 28 but the clash between Zelensky and Trump derailed the process. Two days after Zelensky proposed a bilateral ban on the use of missiles, Russia launched a massive missile attack against Ukraine, targeting the country&apos;s energy system and killing civilians. Wohlforth argued that Zelensky&apos;s statement is &quot;an effort to move beyond (the White House clash with Trump) and position Ukraine as ready to make moves toward a ceasefire agreement even if the security guarantee issue is not yet resolved.&quot; &quot;Zelensky did say the (White House) incident was &apos;regrettable,&apos; so essentially saying &apos;let&apos;s move on,&apos;&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;His proposal for limiting some elements of the conflict is an attempt to show he is not blocking explorations for peace.&quot; Peter Rough, a senior fellow at Hudson Institute, told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;Zelensky&apos;s post was a smart move&quot; that &quot;lowered the temperature ahead of Trump&apos;s address to Congress and removed some of the poison from the relationship.&quot; During his speech in Congress on March 4, Trump indicated that he had read Zelensky&apos;s post and said that he &quot;appreciated&quot; it. O&apos;Hanlon argued that it sounded &quot;like President Trump is ready to move on and that he liked what he heard from President Zelensky.&quot; Hamilton also said that Trump &quot;did respond positively to Zelensky&apos;s statement.&quot; However, analysts argue that Trump&apos;s rhetoric itself does not mean anything, and everything depends on what action he will take. The U.S. halted military aid to Ukraine and intelligence sharing with Kyiv on March 4 and has not resumed either aid or intelligence cooperation since then. Meanwhile, the U.S.-Ukrainian negotiations on the mineral resource deal intensified in recent days, but so far, it has not been signed.

(Andrew Harnik / Getty Images)Fesenko said he believes Ukraine should set the resumption of military aid as a condition for signing the mineral resource deal. Hamilton said that there are &quot;mixed signals&quot; and &quot;with some decisions being overtaken by events, so it&apos;s unclear even within (Trump&apos;s) administration where things are really going.&quot; Bettina Renz, a professor of international security at Nottingham University, said that &quot;considering Trump&apos;s inconsistency and often contradictory approach, I would not read too much into what he said about Ukraine in his Congress speech.&quot; &quot;At this point, it remains uncertain whether President Trump will take a more cooperative approach towards achieving peace in Ukraine that does not almost exclusively favor Russian interests and would come at devastating expense to Ukraine,&quot; she told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;If such a cooperative approach, which will include Ukraine&apos;s full involvement in any negotiations, is not forthcoming, the relationship between the United States and Ukraine &#x2014; and also Europe &#x2014; will not improve anytime soon.&quot; If Trump&apos;s administration remains unwilling to maintain at least some level of support for Ukraine, as things stand, Zelensky will be left with little option but to place his hope in Europe&apos;s faltering efforts to keep Kyiv afloat.	https://kyivindependent.com/what-options-does-zelensky-have-as-relations-with-us-hit-record-low/	2025-03-07T08:55:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202563551.jpg
Von der Leyen seeks to give Ukraine access to EU single market as part of peace deal, Telegraph reports	European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wants to grant Ukraine privileged access to the EU single market as part of a final peace deal, The Telegraph reported on March 7, citing an unnamed senior EU official. Asked whether von der Leyen is ready to stretch EU rules to their limit for Ukraine, the unnamed senior EU official told the Telegraph that &quot;it&#x2019;s already going in that direction.&quot; Such a move could bring a boost to Ukraine&apos;s war-torn economy with the country&apos;s defense industry as a key element of the EU plan, the Telegraph reported. Tariff-free access to Ukrainian weapons will bring Kyiv funds while increasing the arsenals of EU countries, according to the newspaper. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that Ukraine currently produces about a third of the needed weapons, aiming to produce 50%. According to the EU plan, Brussels will choose which sectors to open to Ukraine and which to keep closed, the newspaper reported. Ukraine applied for EU membership at the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. The country has made quick progress, achieving candidate status within months, with the initial negotiations formally launching in June 2024. Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said in 2023 that Kyiv was seeking to ensure full integration into the EU&apos;s single market before joining the bloc. Kyiv will open two or three negotiation clusters in the first six months of 2025 under Poland&apos;s rotating presidency, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in January.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-proposes-to-give-ukraine-access-to-single-market-as-part-of-peace-deal-telegraph-reports/	2025-03-07T08:13:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1246951382.jpg
Russia proposes to build drone factory in Belarus to 'ensure security'	Russia has proposed building a drone factory in neighbouring Belarus, Belarusian state media reported on Mar. 6. Kremlin Deputy Chief of Staff Maxim Oreshkin made the announcement during a trip to Minsk where he met Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko at a drone exhibition. &quot;It&#x2019;s very important that Belarus has its own [drone] production facilities, which would strengthen both its economy and national security,&quot; Oreshkin said. &quot;We are ready to build the plant,&quot; Lukashenko said in response. The plant is expected to produce up to 100,000 units per year but no details were given about the type of drone or if they would be for military use. Oreshkin said that drone production will strengthen the Belarusian economy, including agriculture, logistics, and power generation, and increase GDP. &quot;It is vital for Belarus to have production facilities that will make not only the economy, but also the security sphere of the country truly sovereign,&quot; he added. While at the exhibition, the pair were given a demonstration of &#xA0;an &#x2018;artistic&#x2019; drone which painted a mural. Belarusian state media described it as &quot;the largest art object (ever) created by a drone.&quot; Currently Russia uses around 100 to 200 kamikaze drones per attack against Ukraine which occur on a daily basis, but Russian forces plan to increase their capabilities to 500, Vadym Skibitskyi, the deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), said on March 3. &#xA0; Russia also plans to increase the number of sites from which drones will be launched, he added. Belarus is one of Russia&apos;s staunchest allies and part of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was launched from its territory. Belarus is currently under U.S. and European sanctions for supporting Russia&apos;s invasion and the detention of political prisoners.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-proposes-to-build-drone-factory-in-belarus-to-ensure-security/	2025-03-07T07:32:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2187908233--1-.jpg
Trump says he considers sanctioning Russia because it's 'pounding' Ukrainian troops	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 7 that he is considering imposing sweeping banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until there is a ceasefire and peace agreement. According to Trump, his statement is based on the fact that Russia &quot;is absolutely &#x2018;pounding&#x2019; Ukraine on the battlefield&quot; - a possible reference to Russia&apos;s recent advances in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely &apos;pounding&apos; Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large-scale banking sanctions, sanctions, and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and final settlement agreement on peace is reached,&quot; Trump wrote on the Truth Social media platform. &quot;To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. Thank you!&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-considering-large-scale-banking-sanctions-tariffs-on-russia-until-peace-deal-reached/	2025-03-07T06:55:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182537136.jpg
UK volunteer after surviving Russian strike on Kryvyi Rih — 'Trump, Vance, come see Ukraine for yourselves’	A team of foreign volunteers had just finished dinner at a cozy hotel restaurant in Kryvyi Rih &#x2014; a city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast where they had recently arrived to bring locals humanitarian aid &#x2014; when a notification on their phones suddenly made the atmosphere tense. A Russian ballistic missile was heading toward the city. &quot;We decided to go to the shelter, but we did not have enough time,&quot; British volunteer Karol Swiacki told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We stood up and made a few steps, but then there was a big hit, loud noise, and a huge explosion. And then dust all over. There was so much dust that we couldn&apos;t breathe or see anything.&quot; The powerful blast from the strike, which occurred around 10 p.m. on March 5, heavily damaged the five-story hotel. As a result of the attack, five people were killed and 32 were injured, including two children aged 13 and 17, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Apart from the hotel, the missile strike also damaged 14 apartment buildings, a post office, almost two dozen cars, a cultural center, and 12 shops, the governor said. &quot;We saw the damage that (the missile) had done, not only to the hotel, it was all on fire,&quot; Swiacki recalls. &quot;People were screaming. There were people with blood on their faces, dead people.&quot; &quot;People died in front of our eyes. It was a nightmare. We were in hell.&quot; Sitting roughly 70 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the nearest front line, Kryvyi Rih remains a frequent target of Russian missile attacks. With a population of about 660,000, it is the second-largest city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelensky. &quot;Just before the strike, volunteers from a humanitarian organization checked into the hotel &#x2014; citizens of Ukraine, the U.S., and the U.K.,&quot; Zelensky said after the attack. &quot;They survived because they managed to escape their rooms.&quot; Swiacki, who heads the U.K.-based NGO Ukraine Relief, says that all of the eight people he was with were fortunate enough to escape injury in the deadly attack. &quot;(After the explosion) we tried to get out of the hotel and went through the broken windows. It was so dangerous, we didn&apos;t know if it would collapse,&quot; Swiacki recalls.

(Karol Swiacki / Ukraine Relief NGO)&quot;But when we saw it from outside, oh my God&#x2026; We realized the reason for that big explosion: a missile.&quot; Swiacki says that if they had been in their rooms when the missile struck the hotel, they likely would have been killed. &quot;Everything was smashed. It was just an absolute disaster,&quot; he says. Originally from Poland, Swiacki dropped his career in entertainment shortly after the full-scale invasion started, launching the non-profit: &quot;I remember my grandma&apos;s stories of what Russians were doing to our people in Poland, so I understand what it means.&quot; &quot;I am fully aware of what this war is about. This has nothing to do with peace. They want to destroy Ukraine, take it over, and break the nation completely. This is an absolute disgrace,&quot; Swiacki says. Since Feb. 24, 2022, Swiacki and his team have delivered over five tons of humanitarian aid across Ukraine, as well as power generators, wheelchairs for people with disabilities, medical beds, and other essential supplies. Karol Swiacki (L) and Igor Logvinov (R) in Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine, on March 6, 2025. (Karol Swiacki / Ukraine Relief NGO)During their latest trip to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, they brought sports equipment and other items to support Ukrainian children affected by the war. Swiacki says the attack on Kryvyi Rih destroyed three of their cars parked outside the hotel. His team was able to recover the equipment from the &quot;smashed van&quot; and plan to deliver it to the children soon. &quot;We&apos;re continuing to support Ukraine. Many people would say we should stop, but no, it works the other way around. We will never stop and are stronger than ever,&quot; he says. The attack on Kryvyi Rih took place amid the Trump administration&apos;s decision to freeze military aid and limit intelligence sharing to Ukraine &#x2014; affecting warnings about Russian drones and missiles targeting Ukrainian military and civilian sites. Swiacki says he wishes U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance would come and see the war for themselves. &quot;Please come to Ukraine and see it yourself,&quot; he says. &quot;People are dying here.&quot; Overnight on March 7, just two days after the Kryvyi Rih attack, Russia launched at least 67 missiles of various types and 194 attack and decoy drones against Ukraine, targeting energy and gas infrastructure across the country. &quot;We need air defense all over Ukraine to stop these killings. No one can defend against these rockets without air defense,&quot; Swiacki says. &quot;I hope the West will finally wake up,&quot; he adds. Hi! Daria Shulzhenko here. I wrote this piece for you. Since the first day of Russia&apos;s all-out war, &#xA0;I have been working almost non-stop to tell the stories of those affected by Russia&#x2019;s brutal aggression. By telling all those painful stories, we are helping to keep the world informed about the reality of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine.

US Chamber of Commerce in Russia readies proposals on sanctions relief	The American Chamber of Commerce in Russia (AmCham Russia) is preparing a report for the U.S. government recommending easing certain sanctions against Russia, pro-Kremlin outlet RBC reported on March 7, citing chamber chief Robert Agee. The proposed recommendations focus on lifting restrictions on the aviation and banking industries, investments, and luxury goods shipments. Agee argued that such measures would help American businesses regain &quot;lost market share&quot; and &quot;reduce operational costs in Russia.&quot; AmCham is a business association that represents U.S. companies operating in Russia. It promotes economic engagement despite strained relations between the two countries. This development follows U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s statement on Feb. 25 that sanctions on Russia will be lifted &quot;at some point&quot; but not before a peace deal is reached. His administration has renewed diplomatic contact with Moscow, engaging in direct talks on the war in Ukraine, the reopening of embassies, and economic cooperation. The primary focus of the chamber&apos;s request concerns the aviation sector, particularly the supply of spare parts and aircraft maintenance. Additionally, AmCham Russia seeks to lift the U.S. investment ban imposed in 2022, which currently allows only maintenance operations but prohibits new investments. Another key area of concern is the banking sector, with Agee saying that lifting financial restrictions would facilitate cross-border payments and &quot;ease the cost of doing business.&quot; The chamber also advocates removing restrictions on luxury goods, including cosmetics, perfumes, clothing, and footwear priced above $300 per unit. Despite these discussions, Trump extended some existing sanctions on Russia until March 6, 2026, according to a decree published in the Federal Register on Feb. 28. Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed his Cabinet of Ministers on Feb. 21 to prepare for the return of Western companies, saying Russian firms should have &quot;certain advantages&quot; over those re-entering the market. Sanctions against Russia remain a key tool of international pressure, Ukraine&apos;s Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said on Feb. 19. Stefanishyna expressed uncertainty regarding the U.S. position and its next steps but appeared confident in the EU&apos;s commitment to upholding sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/amcham-russia-to-urge-us-to-ease-sanctions-on-aviation-banking-investments/	2025-03-07T05:49:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1259010576.jpg
Ukraine wasn't officially asked by US to make territorial concessions, Foreign Ministry says	Ukraine has not received any official proposals for territorial concessions as part of potential peace talks with Russia from the U.S. or other partners, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry&apos;s spokesperson said on March 7. &quot;We have not received such proposals,&quot; spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said during a press briefing, downplaying the significance of &quot;certain formulations that could be heard in the media.&quot; The Trump administration has said that both Kyiv and Moscow will have to make concessions for a successful peace deal and called Ukraine&apos;s prospects to return to pre-2014 borders &quot;unrealistic.&quot; Russian forces continue to occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory. The Ukrainian population under Russian occupation has been subjected to systematic repression, torture, and abuse. &quot;We don&apos;t focus on emotions or verbal clashes right now. Diplomacy does its work, mostly quietly, outside the cameras&apos; reach,&quot; Tykhyi said. The comments come ahead of a meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian delegations in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11, which will concern the framework for a potential peace agreement. This would mark the first high-level meeting between the two sides since the heated exchange between President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance in the White House on Feb. 28. The clash soured the relationship between the two countries, leading to Washington freezing military and intelligence support for Ukraine. According to Tykhyi, the meeting in Saudi Arabia will concern bilateral ties, strategic partnership, and a path toward peace. He reiterated that Ukraine is ready to sign a natural resources agreement with the U.S. but did not confirm whether the deal will be signed next week. The deal&apos;s signing has been on hold since the televised quarrel between Zelensky and Trump last week. Bloomberg reported that the U.S. is newly linking the deal&apos;s signing to Ukraine committing itself to a quick truce.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-partners-made-no-official-proposals-on-ukraines-territorial-concessions-foreign-ministry-says/	2025-03-07T05:43:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2166117545.jpg
Zelensky to visit South Africa on April 10 for talks with President Ramaphosa	President Volodymyr Zelensky will visit South Africa on April 10 to meet with the country&apos;s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and discuss efforts to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, Bloomberg reported on March 7. &quot;The visit is a continuation of ongoing engagements held by President Ramaphosa with President Putin and President Zelensky on an inclusive peace process that will provide a path to peace between Russia and Ukraine,&quot; said Ramaphosa&apos;s spokesperson, Vincent Magwenya. South Africa, the continent&apos;s largest economy, has maintained a neutral stance in the war while deepening its economic and political ties with Moscow. The country is a member of the BRICS group alongside Russia and China and conducted joint naval drills with both nations while resisting Western calls to distance itself from the Kremlin. Ramaphosa previously led a peace initiative in 2023 alongside leaders from five other African nations, but the effort failed to yield concrete results. During a visit to Kyiv on June 16, 2023, he presented a 10-point peace plan as part of the African Peace Mission. Zelensky&apos;s rare upcoming visit is part of a diplomatic outreach to Africa as Kyiv seeks broader global support before upcoming peace negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-visit-south-africa-on-april-10-for-talks-with-president-ramaphosa-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-07T05:11:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/rama.jpg
The case against European rearmament	Inducting Ukraine into NATO after forcing Russia back behind its pre-2014 borders has been the only strategic aim EU leaders have allowed themselves to contemplate since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion three years ago. Alas, well before U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s re-election, this aim slipped into the realm of infeasibility. The writing had been on the wall for a while. First, Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s war economy proved a godsend to his regime. Second, even Trump&#x2019;s predecessor, Joe Biden, was terminally unwilling to push for Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership, leading the country down the garden path with vague promises. And, third, there was strong bipartisan opposition in the United States to the idea of NATO troops fighting alongside Ukrainians. So, in a display of breathtaking hypocrisy, the many &#x201C;Putin is the new Hitler&#x201D; speeches never resulted in a commitment to fight alongside the Ukrainians until Putin&#x2019;s army was defeated on the ground. Instead, a cowardly West kept sending weapons to the exhausted Ukrainians so that they could defeat the &#x201C;new Hitler&#x201D; on its behalf &#x2014; but on their own. Inevitably, and despite gallant fighting by increasingly outgunned and outnumbered Ukrainian soldiers, European leaders&#x2019; sole strategic aim turned to dust &#x2014; a reality that would have become undeniable regardless of who won the U.S. presidency last November. Trump merely brought it forward with a brutality reflecting his long-held contempt not just for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but also for the European Union itself. And so, lacking any Plan B, a Europe weakened by a two-decades-long economic slump is now struggling to respond to Trump&#x2019;s Ukraine policy. After the Munich Agreement in 1938, Winston Churchill famously proclaimed that Neville Chamberlain had been &#x201C;given the choice between war and dishonor. You chose dishonor, and you will have war.&#x201D; In their angst not to make the same mistake, EU leaders are about to repeat it, in reverse: their war-until-victory approach will give way to the humiliating peace that Trump will gleefully impose on them, and on Zelensky&#x2019;s government, when they eventually come begging. While it is undoubtedly true that Europe must either rise to the occasion or disintegrate, the question is: Rise how? What&#x2019;s really wrong with Europe? What is the EU missing the most? It beggars belief that Europeans cannot recognize the answer staring us in the face: Europe is missing a proper Treasury, the equivalent of the State Department, and a Parliament with the power to dismiss what passes as its government (the European Council). Even worse, there is still no discussion of how to plug these gaping holes in Europe&#x2019;s institutional architecture. The EU has always dreaded the beginning of any Ukraine peace process precisely because it would expose the bloc&#x2019;s nakedness. Who would represent Europe at the negotiating table, even if Trump invited us to join? Even if the European Commission and Council could wave a magic wand to conjure a large, well-armed EU army into existence, who would have the democratic authority to send it into battle to kill and be killed? Moreover, who can raise enough taxes to ensure the EU army&#x2019;s permanent combat-readiness? The EU&#x2019;s intergovernmental decision-making means that no one has the democratic legitimacy to make such decisions. European leaders pose for a group photo during a summit at Lancaster House in London, U.K., on March 2, 2025. (Justin Tallis/Pool/AFP via Getty Images)When Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, recently announced her new ReArm Europe initiative, sad memories of the incompetent Juncker Plan, Green Deal, and Recovery Plan came flooding back. Large headline figures were again being tossed about, only to be exposed on closer scrutiny as smoke and mirrors. Does anyone seriously expect France to increase its already-unsustainable public-finance deficit to fund weaponry? Absent the institutions to enact military Keynesianism, the only way Europe can rearm is by shifting funds from its crumbling social and physical infrastructure &#x2014; further weakening a Europe already reaping the bitter harvest of popular discontent, which is fueling the rise of far-right forces across the continent. And for what? Does anyone believe that Putin will be deterred by a Europe that may have a few more shells and howitzers but is drifting further away from the prospect of the federal governance needed to decide matters of war and peace? ReArm Europe will do nothing to win the war for Ukraine. It will, however, almost certainly drive the EU deeper into its pre-existing economic slump &#x2014; the underlying cause of Europe&#x2019;s weakness. To keep Europeans safe in the face of the twin challenges posed by Trump and Putin, the EU must embark on its own multi-pronged Peace Now process. First, the EU must reject outright Trump&#x2019;s predatory effort to grab Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources. Then, after floating the prospect of relaxing sanctions and returning $300 billion in frozen assets (which cannot simultaneously be used as a bargaining chip and for Ukraine&#x2019;s reconstruction), the EU should commence negotiations with the Kremlin, offering the prospect of a comprehensive strategic arrangement within which Ukraine becomes what Austria was during the Cold War: sovereign, armed, neutral, and as integrated with Western Europe as its citizens desire. Third, instead of a permanent stand-off between two large armies along the agreed border, the EU should propose a demilitarized zone at least 500 kilometers (310 miles) deep on each side, the right of return of all displaced people, a Good Friday-style agreement for the governance of disputed areas, and a Green New Deal for the war-torn areas, jointly financed by the EU and Russia. All outstanding issues should be addressed in negotiations held under the auspices of the United Nations. Lastly, the EU should use the prospect of relaxing tariffs on Chinese goods (green tech, in particular) and sanctions on technology exports to open negotiations with China with a view to a new security arrangement that reduces tensions and enlists the Chinese to the goal of safeguarding Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty. If we truly want to strengthen Europe, the first step is not to rearm. It is to forge the democratic union without which stagnation will continue to erode Europe&#x2019;s capacities, rendering it unable to rebuild what is left of Ukraine once Putin is finished with it.

Russia reportedly breaks through in Kursk Oblast; military hasn't confirmed	Russian forces have made a breakthrough south of the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha, potentially threatening to cut off some of the Ukrainian positions in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Agentstvo and Ukrainska Pravda reported on March 7. An undisclosed military source deployed in Kursk Oblast told the Ukrainska Pravda outlet that Russian forces have broken through Ukrainian defenses south of Sudzha and that the defenders are trying to stabilize the situation. Ukrainian forces are trying to contain the Russian advance to prevent a partial or complete encirclement, the source claimed. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The spokesperson of the Ukrainian group of forces in Kursk Oblast declined to comment. Russian forces have recently intensified efforts to break through to Sumy Oblast to cut off the Ukrainian salient in bordering Kursk Oblast. Kyiv has sought to maintain its position in the Russian border region as leverage for possible peace talks. Russian forces have almost reached the Ukrainian border south of Ukrainian positions in Sudzha, meaning that at least some areas have been cut off from the main salient, the independent Russian outlet Agentstvo reported, citing an expert from the Conflict Intelligence Team. &quot;Difficult battles continue in the border area of Sumy Oblast; Russian assault units are attempting to break through and move toward a highway from Yunakivka (in Sumy Oblast) to Sudzha in Kursk Oblast,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &quot;The Defense Forces are fighting and dealing significant casualties to Russian troops,&quot; Kovalenko claimed, without confirming a Russian breakthrough. The estimated Russian advance in Kursk Oblast as of March 7, 2025, according to DeepState. Ukrainian positions in Kursk Oblast marked in blue. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Ukrainska Pravda&apos;s source claimed that the breakthrough occurred between March 5 and 6 and was the result of a gradual and systematic Russian campaign in the area. The Ukrainian battlefield monitoring group DeepState seems to confirm a Russian advance, indicating a push deep into Ukrainian positions toward the Ukrainian state border in Sumy Oblast. DeepState marked the village of Kurilovka, lying some 5 kilometers (3 miles) south of Sudzha, as a contested area as of March 6. The monitoring service reported further advances the following day. The prominent Russian pro-war channel Tw Majors also reported on the advance, claiming that Moscow&apos;s troops have penetrated up to 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) deep into Ukrainian positions. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, the Russian military claimed. Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000 in Kursk Oblast, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 6. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said last November that the incursion thwarted Russia&apos;s plans to invade Sumy Oblast in an attempt to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-reportedly-attempting-a-breakthrough-south-of-sudzha-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-03-07T04:30:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2182865870.jpg
Trump's cryptic Russia comment 'probably just bluster,' experts say	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s claim to be the only person who knows why Russia wants to &quot;make a deal&quot; and end the war in Ukraine is &quot;probably just bluster,&quot; experts have told the Kyiv Independent. Speaking to reporters in the White House on March 6, Trump addressed his ongoing &#x2014; and controversial &#x2014; efforts to end the fighting and bring both Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table. &quot;I think what&#x2019;s going to happen is Ukraine wants to make a deal because I don&#x2019;t think they have a choice,&quot; he said. &quot;I also think that Russia wants to make a deal because in a certain different way &#x2014; a different way that only I know, only I know &#x2014; they have no choice,&quot; Trump cryptically added. Trump did not elaborate, and his comments left observers baffled as to what he might be referring to. &quot;No clue,&quot; former U.K. Defense Attache in Moscow, John Foreman, told the Kyiv Independent when asked for his thoughts. &quot;Unless he&#x2019;s referring to intel about discussions in Moscow about how long they can keep at it, the real state of the Russian army or economy, or (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&#x2019;s health,&quot; he added. Jenny Mathers, a Russian political expert and lecturer at the U.K.&apos;s Aberystwyth University, dismissed the comments as &quot;probably just bluster to make Trump look like he is getting something out of his conversations with Putin.&quot; &quot;Trump is always claiming unique abilities, so it is not too surprising that he is claiming some unique knowledge. I seriously doubt that Putin is confiding secret Russian weaknesses or strategy to Trump,&quot; she added. But like Foreman, Mathers did also keep open the possibility that Trump was referring to possible U.S. intelligence reports that &quot;reveal Russian weaknesses.&quot; &quot;But that does not fit well with Trump&#x2019;s eagerness to offer up front concessions to Moscow before peace talks even begin,&quot; she added. The Kremlin is reportedly growing increasingly concerned by the state of Russia&apos;s economy amid Western sanctions and soaring inflation caused by record wartime spending. Moscow has reactivated a special economic commission initially created during the Covid-19 pandemic to monitor struggling industries and implement relief measures, The Moscow Times reported on Feb. 11, citing Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak. Meanwhile on the battlefield, Russian advances have slowed in recent weeks, with Ukraine even making small gains in some areas. The 25th Separate Airborne Brigade reported on Feb. 26 that Ukrainian troops had regained control of the village of Kotlyne, near Pokrovsk. Kotlyne and Pokrovsk are connected by the T 0406 highway, which also leads to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. As for Putin&apos;s health &#x2014; rumors of ill-health have periodically surfaced at various points during Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, but nothing definitive has yet been confirmed.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-cryptic-russia-comment-probably-just-bluster-experts-say/	2025-03-07T04:11:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203672195.jpg
Germany should reduce reliance on US arms amid geopolitical shifts, Airbus Defense and Space CEO says	Germany should reduce its dependence on U.S. defense manufacturers amid shifting political signals from Washington, the CEO of Airbus Defense and Space, Michael Schollhorn, warned in an interview with Augsburger Allgemeine, published on March 7. Schollhorn emphasized that Berlin should prioritize European defense companies, particularly as Germany&apos;s likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has announced plans to raise hundreds of billions of euros for defense and infrastructure. &quot;If we continue to buy off-the-shelf products from the United States with this higher defense spending, we are cementing our dependence on others,&quot; Schollhorn said. The business executive added that Denmark may already realize that purchasing U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets was a questionable decision, mainly &quot;if they actually had to defend Greenland.&quot; Schollhorn&apos;s remarks follow U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s controversial statement on March 4, in which he once again expressed interest in acquiring Greenland through purchase or force. Schollhorn argued that Europe&apos;s defense industries must collaborate more closely instead of competing individually. &quot;We need not only an increase in defense spending at the national level but also a coordinated approach among key European countries,&quot; he said. The comments come amid growing scrutiny of Trump&apos;s foreign policy, as the U.S. president has echoed Kremlin narratives, sidelined Kyiv and Europe in direct talks with Moscow, and accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of prolonging Russia&apos;s war. On March 6, Trump also cast doubt on Washington&apos;s commitment to defending its NATO partners, saying that the U.S. will not protect those that fail to meet defense spending targets. During a meeting with Zelensky on Feb. 28, Trump said that Europe should take responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security and refused to offer U.S. guarantees. Washington has since frozen all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, a move widely seen as an attempt to pressure Kyiv into negotiations with Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-should-lessen-reliance-on-us-weapons-amid-shifting-politics-airbus-defense-chief-says/	2025-03-07T04:09:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1257482771.jpg
Trump’s aid cuts could trap Eastern Europe in a disinformation bubble	Georgia is in a grim state. Once vibrant, welcoming, and hopeful, it has become a country where peaceful protesters are beaten and journalists are branded as traitors. Over the past year, the ruling Georgian Dream party has stifled civil society and media with its foreign agent law, extended its reign for another four years through a rigged election, and announced it would &#x201C;suspend&#x201D; efforts to join the EU. In the Georgia of 2025, war is called peace, and slavery is called freedom. Disinformation is the Georgian government&#x2019;s weapon of choice, including pushing Russian narratives about the brutal, full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Like its anti-democratic counterparts in Hungary, Belarus, and Azerbaijan, the Georgian government has identified the media as the primary obstacle to consolidating authoritarian rule. A long campaign of discreditation, financial strangulation, and intimidation of donors has taken its toll. The voices of independent journalists are fading, and with new legislation poised to de facto outlaw independent outlets, the final blow may be near &#x2014; a kiss of death carried on Russia&#x2019;s breath. The sudden termination of U.S. aid funding came as a shock to an already struggling independent media landscape. I co-founded OC Media in 2017 to inform both local and international readers about the Caucasus &#x2014; from Grozny to Tbilisi, Yerevan to Baku. Providing a progressive voice, where facts matter and showing an alternative to state media narratives, has always been our guiding principle. But it&#x2019;s clear these principles are not shared by the Trump administration, whose cuts cost us $250,000 in expected funding for 2025 &#x2014; 80% of our core operational budget. Nearly every online media outlet in Georgia was affected, and I expect many, or even most of them, to close in the coming weeks and months. This is a pattern repeating across Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia; reports suggest these cuts could devastate Ukraine&#x2019;s media landscape as well. If nothing changes, we risk surrendering the media space to those who can afford it: the oligarchs, authoritarian governments, and, perhaps most concerning of all, Russia. This could leave our region in a disinformation bubble, where Russian-backed narratives, including those that seek to blame Ukraine for being invaded, proliferate. Without independent outlets like OC Media, the overwhelming support Georgian society has for Ukraine may be buried under the weight of pro-government media. Part of this vulnerability in the media is certainly our own fault. For years in Georgia, we in the media have relied too heavily on donor aid, neglecting other potential sources of revenue. But it doesn&#x2019;t have to be this way. People attend an opposition rally against election results outside the parliament in Tbilisi, Georgia, on Oct. 28, 2024. (Mirian Meladze / Anadolu via Getty Images)Last summer, I visited Kyiv for the first time since Russia&#x2019;s brutal full-scale invasion began, to learn from our colleagues at the Kyiv Independent, who have survived revolutions, wars, and the most insidious propaganda &#x2014; the kind that turns victims into aggressors. The Kyiv Independent has pioneered a model many thought impossible in our region: creating a media outlet fully funded by its readers, independent of U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s tantrums or the whims of institutional donors. Their approach has shown that self-sufficiency is not just an ideal &#x2014; it is essential for our survival. We launched our own membership program almost a year ago, as the Georgian government pushed ahead with its Russian-style foreign agent law. But it was only on the brink of collapse that our membership truly gained traction. Today, I am proud to say that 10% of our core budget now comes from reader support &#x2014; something few believed possible in the Caucasus. This is just the beginning. If readers choose to support the media they rely on, then perhaps we can fight back against a world where the president of the most powerful country in the world calls the leader of a defending nation a dictator. I know Georgians deserve better. My government has chosen the path of disinformation and repression, but independent media remains a lifeline &#x2014; for Georgians, for Ukrainians, and for all those who can still tell the victim from the aggressor. During my trip to Kyiv last summer, beyond the usual shock of air raid sirens and the echoes of explosions, what struck me most was the resilience of a people under siege &#x2014; and the crucial role Ukrainian media have had in defying disinformation, both at home and abroad. Now, across Eastern Europe, independent media is in deep crisis. Yet despite our borders, our histories, and our governments, our struggle is the same. The Kyiv Independent is leading the way with its reader-funded model, and OC Media is proud to follow. We have been overwhelmed by the support we have already received in donations and membership sign-ups to help us survive. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m asking you to join the Kyiv Independent, OC Media, and other media outlets across the region in this fight &#x2014; before we lose our ability to resist the authoritarian disinformation tide, as so many already have.

Ukraine receives $970 million from UK under G7 loan covered by Russian assets	Ukraine has received 752 million pounds ($970 million) as the first installment of the U.K.&apos;s contribution to the G7 loan covered by frozen Russian assets, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on March 7. The U.K. has pledged to lend Ukraine 2.26 billion pounds ($2.9 billion) in three equal installments as part of the G7&apos;s Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration scheme, worth $50 billion in total. &quot;The funds will go towards strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities,&quot; Shmyhal said on X. &quot;I am grateful to (British Prime Minister) Keir Starmer, the U.K. government and our G7 partners for the mechanism to make Russian money work for Ukraine.&quot; At the onset of the full-scale war in 2022, the G7 countries immobilized some $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets. The $50 billion loan, shouldered mainly by the U.S. and the EU, will be funneled to Ukraine&apos;s defense needs and recovery and repaid by proceeds from the frozen assets. &quot;We expect all sovereign assets of the Russian Federation to be confiscated and transferred to benefit our country in the future,&quot; Shmyhal noted.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-receives-970-million-from-uk-under-g7-loan-covered-by-russian-assets/	2025-03-07T03:52:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1258928921.jpeg
Zelensky to meet Saudi Crown prince on March 10	President Volodymyr Zelensky said he would travel to Saudi Arabia on March 10 and meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman before talks with U.S. partners. Zelensky initially intended to visit Saudi Arabia as part of a Middle East tour in February but delayed the trip due to bilateral U.S.-Russian talks in Riyadh on Feb. 18. The Gulf countries have traditionally played the role of a mediator between Russia and Ukraine, namely in regard to prisoner exchanges. Following Zelensky&apos;s meeting with the Saudi crown prince, the Ukrainian president&apos;s team will remain in the country on March 11 to meet U.S. delegates and discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement. This would mark the first high-level meeting between the two sides since the heated exchange between Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance in the White House on Feb. 28. The televised clash derailed plans for the signing of a natural resources agreement and preceded the U.S. freezing all military and intelligence support for Kyiv amid ongoing hostilities with Russia. &quot;Ukraine is most interested in peace. As we told (President Donald Trump), Ukraine is working and will continue to work constructively for a swift and reliable peace,&quot; Zelensky said on X. Top U.S. officials signaled that Zelensky&apos;s recent statements on a peaceful resolution of the war have been received positively in the White House and might lead to the resumption of military aid. Ukraine has repeatedly voiced readiness for peace but stressed that any ceasefire would be short-lived without clear security guarantees to deter Russian aggression. The Trump administration has refused such commitments and instead called upon Europe to take responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-meet-saudi-crown-prince-on-march-10/	2025-03-07T03:32:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/zelensky_saudi.jpeg
Zelensky's approval rating jumps to 68% after Trump clash, poll shows	President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s approval rating has risen to 68% following his heated exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump, according to a poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology published on March 7. The most significant jump came after the Feb. 28 Oval Office meeting, which ended in a public dispute over security guarantees for Ukraine and the cancellation of the U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement signing. Before the diplomatic spat, a February 2025 survey showed that 57% of Ukrainians trusted Zelensky, while 37% did not, resulting in a trust-distrust balance of +20%. Between Feb. 14 and March 4, trust in Zelensky increased to 68%, with the share of those who do not trust him dropping to 29%, improving his net approval rating to +38%. Tech billionaire Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump, took to X on March 6 to claim that if Ukraine were to hold an election, &quot;Zelensky would lose by a landslide.&quot; Trump had earlier accused Zelensky of being a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; while blaming his administration for prolonging the war. Trump&apos;s claim ignores the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. As a result, Zelensky&apos;s term has been extended, which constitutional lawyers argue is permitted under Ukrainian law. The poll, conducted via telephone interviews, surveyed 1,029 adult Ukrainian citizens residing in government-controlled territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelenskys-approval-rating-jumps-after-trump-clash-poll-shows/	2025-03-07T03:10:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201823899.jpg
Maxar Technologies reportedly restricts Ukraine's access to satellite imagery	U.S. aerospace company Maxar Technologies has restricted Ukraine&apos;s access to its satellite imagery, the Ukrainian media outlet Militarnyi reported on March 7, citing unnamed users of the service. Kyiv has relied on high-resolution satellite images for defense and strategic planning, tracking Russian troop movements, assessing battlefield conditions, and monitoring Russian infrastructure damage. The alleged move follows the U.S. decision to halt intelligence sharing with Ukraine, a shift confirmed by CIA Director John Ratcliffe on March 5. According to Militarnyi, the restriction was imposed under an order from U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration, with the State Department allegedly prohibiting U.S. companies from providing satellite data to Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent was unable to verify the claims and has contacted Maxar Technologies for confirmation but has yet to receive a response. Ukraine&apos;s cyber community Cyberboroshno also reported the restriction, claiming that free access to satellite reconnaissance had been cut off. &quot;According to our information, at least private companies can buy already ordered (satellite) images through the provider,&quot; Cyberboroshno wrote on Telegram. Washington has also frozen military aid to Kyiv as part of a broader effort to pressure President Volodymyr Zelensky into peace talks with Russia. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on March 6 that Kyiv is working on alternatives to counter the loss of U.S. intelligence, including potential cooperation with European partners.	https://kyivindependent.com/maxar-technologies-reportedly-restricts-ukraines-access-to-satellite-imagery/	2025-03-07T02:14:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1245430860-167062044924mwa.jpg
EU members pledge $16 billion in additional support for Ukraine, Costa says	Several EU members have pledged to provide up to 15 billion euros ($16.3 billion) in additional aid for Ukraine, European Council President Antonio Costa said at a summit on March 6. EU leaders met in Brussels to discuss plans for boosting Europe&apos;s defense capabilities and support for Ukraine amid the seismic foreign policy shifts in the U.S. Ukraine&apos;s President Volodmyr Zelensky also took part in the meeting. The summit concluded without additional EU aid packages for Ukraine as the discussed 20-billion-euro tranche ($22 billion) was dropped from the final declaration. Kyiv needs more support now than ever, as the Trump administration has frozen all military assistance flowing to the country. As any EU-wide assistance package is under threat of being blocked by Hungary&apos;s Moscow-friendly leader, Viktor Orban, top EU officials suggested that further aid should be provided through a &quot;coalition of the willing.&quot; &quot;Immediately, member states can increase their support thanks to the increased fiscal space,&quot; Costa said at a press conference in Brussels. During the summit, EU leaders unanimously agreed on a new defense initiative that could mobilize up to 800 billion euros ($867 billion) through loans and loosening fiscal rules for government spending. &quot;Several member states have already announced their pledges up to 15 billion euros. Today, we have also tasked the Council to work urgently on further initiatives to address Ukraine&#x2019;s pressing military and defense needs,&quot; Costa said, without naming the countries. &quot;This is a tipping point for Europe. And today, we have shown that the European Union is rising to the challenge,&quot; the European Council president said.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-members-pledge-16-billion-in-additional-support-for-ukraine-costa-says/	2025-03-07T02:07:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/DSC07805------.jpg
French-made Mirage 2000 jets join Ukraine's defense against Russian strike for the first time	Ukraine&apos;s French-provided Mirage 2000 fighter jets took part in repelling a Russian air attack on Ukraine for the first time on March 7, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Russia launched a large-scale aerial assault overnight, firing 67 missiles of various types and deploying 194 drones. Ukraine&apos;s air defenses intercepted 34 missiles and 100 drones, with anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare systems, and mobile fire groups contributing to the effort. Fighter jets, including F-16s and French Mirage 2000s, were also deployed. French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu confirmed on Feb. 6 that the first Mirage 2000-5s pledged to Kyiv had arrived in Ukraine. The jets were part of a military aid package announced by French President Emmanuel Macron in June 2024, which included pilot training. Macron did not disclose the total number of aircraft France would supply. The Mirage 2000, a fourth-generation supersonic fighter, was first introduced by Dassault Aviation in the 1970s. The Mirage 2000-5 variant, introduced in 1999, features upgraded avionics, improved air-to-air and air-to-ground combat capabilities, and an advanced sensor and control system. The deployment of Mirage 2000 jets marks a significant step in Ukraine&apos;s air defense strategy as it continues to strengthen its capabilities against ongoing Russian attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/frances-mirage-2000-jets-first-join-ukraines-defense-against-russian-air-assault-air-forces-report/	2025-03-07T01:29:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2157350567.jpg
US 'not going to defend' NATO members missing defense spending goals, Trump says	U.S. President Donald Trump cast doubt on Washington&apos;s commitment to defending its NATO partners on March 6, saying that the U.S. will not protect those that fail to meet defense spending targets. &quot;If they don&apos;t pay, I&apos;m not going to defend them. No, I&apos;m not going to defend them,&quot; Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. The statement follows an article from NBC News that Trump is considering reducing U.S. commitments to NATO and recalibrating engagement to favor members that allocate a set percentage of their gross domestic product (GDP) to defense. &quot;They should be paying more,&quot; the U.S. president added. Trump has long demanded that NATO allies increase their military spending. He previously called for the alliance to raise its benchmark from 2% to 5% of the GDP. As of 2024, 24 of NATO&apos;s 32 members meet the current 2% target, with Poland (4.12%), Estonia (3.43%), and the U.S. (3.38%) leading the way. Several nations, including Italy, Canada, and Spain, still fall short. Some NATO members are discussing raising the spending level to 3% by 2030. Trump&apos;s remarks follow his declaration from last year that he would endorse Russia to &quot;do whatever the hell they want&quot; to NATO countries failing to meet defense criteria, a statement widely seen as undermining NATO&apos;s collective-defense principle. The comments come amid heightened scrutiny of Trump&apos;s foreign policy, as he has echoed Kremlin narratives, engaged in direct negotiations with Moscow while sidelining Kyiv, and accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of prolonging the war. Trump has also refused to offer security guarantees to Ukraine, saying during his Feb. 28 meeting with Zelensky that Europe should take responsibility for Kyiv&apos;s security. Washington has since frozen all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, a move widely seen as an attempt to pressure Kyiv into peace talks with Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-not-going-to-defend-nato-members-missing-spending-goals-trump-says/	2025-03-07T01:03:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192427196.jpg
Hungary to hold poll on Ukraine's EU accession, Orban says	Hungary will carry out an opinion survey on Ukraine&apos;s potential accession to the European Union, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced on March 7, according to Politico. &quot;We have the so-called national consultation scheme, which we use regularly to collect the opinion of the people, so we will use the same scheme just now,&quot; Orban told reporters after an emergency summit of EU leaders in Brussels. Orban, widely regarded as the EU&apos;s most pro-Russian leader, has repeatedly opposed military aid for Ukraine and warned that Ukraine&apos;s EU membership would &quot;destroy&quot; Hungary. He has maintained close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin despite Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, amplifying Kremlin narratives in Europe. Since 2010, Orban&apos;s government has held more than a dozen so-called national consultations on issues such as migration and LGBTQ rights. These referendums are non-binding letter campaigns sent to Hungarian voters with questions framed to align with the government&apos;s position. The political opposition and civil society groups have criticized these consultations as propaganda tools, pointing to their leading wording and low participation rates. For instance, a 2023 consultation on EU migration policy asked Hungarians if they supported Brussels&apos;s creation of &quot;migrant ghettos&quot; in Hungary. Less than 20% of voters participated, but 99% of those who did responded &quot;no.&quot; &quot;For the first time, Hungarians have a chance in Europe to decide whether they support Ukraine&apos;s EU membership or not,&quot; Hungary&apos;s government spokesperson Balazs Orban posted on X. Ukraine applied for EU membership in 2022 and was granted candidate status within months. Accession talks began in June 2024, with European leaders setting 2030 as a target for Ukraine&apos;s potential entry. Like all EU members, Hungary holds veto power over further progress, allowing Budapest to delay or block Ukraine&apos;s accession.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-to-hold-national-consultation-on-ukraines-eu-accession-orban-says/	2025-03-07T00:29:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190226673.jpg
2 killed, 24 injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over past day	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least two people and injured 24 others over the past day, regional officials reported on March 7. Russia carried out a mass missile and drone attack overnight, targeting infrastructure facilities in the Ternopil and Ivano-Frankivsk oblasts, according to officials. A Russian ballistic missile attack on Kharkiv injured eight people and damaged more than 30 houses, officials reported. Two of the injured were hospitalized. In Donetsk Oblast, 12 civilians were wounded, including six in Sloviansk, two in Kramatorsk and Bahatyr each, and one in Myrnohrad and Kostiantynivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian airstrikes killed two people and wounded one, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. In Poltava Oblast, debris from a downed aerial target struck a house, injuring two people, including a child, Governor Filip Pronin said. A 66-year-old man was wounded in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where 19 houses and apartments were damaged, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. Russia also carried out a large drone attack on Odesa Oblast, with officials still assessing potential casualties, Governor Oleh Kiper said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-over-past-day/	2025-03-06T23:38:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-07_07-36-52.jpg
EU leaders sideline Hungary as they pledge continued support for Ukraine	Twenty-six EU member states denounced Russian aggression and pledged continued support for Ukraine in a joint resolution issued at an emergency summit on March 6, despite Hungary dissenting. The lack of consensus on the declaration, which stopped short of committing concrete steps in support of Ukraine, underscores the persistent differences between Moscow-friendly Budapest and the rest of the bloc. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban can still block major decisions that require an anonymous vote, such as the six-month extension of sanctions against Russia. Speaking ahead of the summit, the EU&apos;s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, suggested that European countries might seek to push forward new support for Ukraine through a &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; to avoid Hungary&apos;s veto. &quot;The European Council reaffirms its continued and unwavering support for Ukraine&#x2019;s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders,&quot; the statement reads. The 26 EU members committed to several principles in pursuing a just peace in Ukraine, namely, Kyiv and Europe&apos;s participation in any negotiations, no ceasefire without a subsequent comprehensive peace agreement, security guarantees for Ukraine, and respect for Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The U.S.&apos;s outreach to Russia and bilateral talks on Ukraine in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 sparked concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump might seek to cut a deal with the Kremlin while sidelining Kyiv and Europe. &quot;Achieving &#x2018;peace through strength&#x2019; requires Ukraine to be in the strongest possible position, with Ukraine&#x2019;s own robust military and defence capabilities as an essential component,&quot; the statement reads. The declaration came as the EU agreed to mobilize up to 800 billion ($860 billion) for defense spending amid fears that the U.S. might scale back its presence on the continent. The Trump administration&apos;s decision to freeze military aid for Ukraine and intelligence sharing also highlighted Europe&apos;s growing role in sustaining Ukrainian resistance against Russian aggression. Despite this, the proposal to commit a new 20-billion-euro package ($22 billion) was dropped from the text of the declaration. The document reaffirmed that the EU would continue providing Ukraine with already pledged support in 2025, including 12.5 billion euros ($13.5 billion) under the Ukraine Facility and 18.1 billion ($19.6 billion) as part of the G7 loan covered by frozen Russian assets. To ensure the support of Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, the declaration also included calls on the European Commission, Slovakia, and Ukraine to &quot;intensify efforts towards finding workable solutions to the gas transit issue.&quot; Fico, who has adopted increasingly anti-Ukraine rhetoric but avoided blocking steps on the EU level in Orban&apos;s fashion, has repeatedly lambasted Kyiv over ending the transit of Russian gas through its territory to Slovakia and other EU countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-pledges-continued-support-for-ukraine-despite-hungarys-opposition/	2025-03-06T23:27:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203003580--1-.jpg
Russia lashes out against France's nuclear umbrella proposal	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed on March 6 that French President Emmanuel Macron&apos;s recent comments on nuclear deterrence pose a threat to Russia, according to the state news agency TASS. During a televised address on March 5, Macron said he was open to extending France&apos;s nuclear umbrella to protect European allies amid growing uncertainties caused by the U.S.&apos;s foreign policy shifts. France and the U.K. are the only two European nations with nuclear arsenals. Macron made it clear that no decision has been taken so far. Lavrov claimed that Macron is &quot;preparing to use nuclear weapons against Russia,&quot; without providing evidence and despite the French leader not making such a statement directly. &quot;Of course, it&apos;s a threat against Russia,&quot; Lavrov claimed. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov echoed Lavrov&apos;s remarks, calling Macron&apos;s comments &quot;very confrontational&quot; and accusing France of escalating tensions. &quot;Moreover, France is already ready to use its nuclear weapons for security and the like. It&apos;s already such a nuclear rhetoric; it&apos;s a claim to nuclear leadership in Europe,&quot; Peskov said. Macron&apos;s statements come as European leaders push for increased defense spending and military aid to Ukraine amid concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump may not defend Europe if Russia attacks. Polish and Lithuanian leaders welcomed the French leader&apos;s proposal that Paris could extend its nuclear umbrella. Russia has been accused of waging a broader hybrid war against Europe, including acts of sabotage on the continent. Western intelligence agencies have warned that Moscow may seek to launch a large-scale war on Europe within the next five years.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-is-preparing-to-use-nuclear-weapons-against-russia-lavrov-claims/	2025-03-06T22:49:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1485172048.jpg
Ukraine struck Russian command post in Kherson Oblast, stronghold in Kursk Oblast on March 5	Ukrainian forces carried out precision strikes against a Russian command post in the occupied town of Oleshky in Ukraine&apos;s Kherson Oblast and a stronghold in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast on March 5, the Ukrainian military said on March 7. The attacks took place on the same day as the U.S. stopped sharing intelligence with Ukraine, which potentially undermines Kyiv&apos;s ability to carry out precision strikes. The statement did not specify whether the attacks occurred before the intelligence-sharing pause. Ukrainian forces reportedly attacked the command post of the 17th Tank Regiment of the 70th Motorized Rifle Division of the Russian Armed Forces stationed in the Russian-occupied part of Kherson Oblast. Russia was pushed back from the western part of Kherson Oblast during Ukraine&apos;s surprise counteroffensive in the fall of 2022 but continues to hold territory east of the Dnipro River. The March 5 strikes also targeted a stronghold of the 2nd company of Russia&apos;s 177th Separate Naval Infantry Regiment in Plekhovo in Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian forces have been fighting in the Russian border region since launching their incursion in August 2024 to draw Moscow&apos;s troops from Donbas and thwart Russian plans for further offensives. &quot;These strikes are part of an ongoing campaign of fire engagements aimed at reducing the military potential of the Russian Armed Forces on the way to liberating the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine,&quot; the General Staff said in its statement. &quot;The Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine remains fully prepared to conduct precision strikes to degrade the capabilities of the Russian Armed Forces in waging an aggressive war against the Ukrainian people.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-struck-russian-command-post-in-kherson-oblast-stronghold-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-03-06T22:26:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1068947954-1667598365khqfs.jpg

This number includes 1,150 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,264 tanks, 21,334 armored fighting vehicles, 39,678 vehicles and fuel tanks, 24,124 artillery systems, 1,306 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,096 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 28,024 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-882-950-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-03-06T22:10:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1239116213-1660056573zl72q.jpg
Defense Secretary Hegseth hails UK for 'stepping up' as European leader on Ukraine amid shifting US foreign policy	During a meeting with his counterpart on March 6, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth hailed the United Kingdom for &quot;stepping up&quot; in taking a lead among European allies to support Ukraine. &quot;We are in the middle of a dynamic security environment, where on (the European) continent, President (Donald) Trump is calling on our European allies to take the lead, and you have done just that, sir,&quot; Hegseth told U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey during a press briefing in Washington. Hegseth further commended the U.K. for chairing the latest meeting of the Ukraine defense contact group: &quot;And that&apos;s, again, the United Kingdom stepping up,&quot; Hegseth added. Hegseth&apos;s comments come amid shifting political dynamics within the United States as the Trump administration has ruled out sending its own troops to Ukraine as a security guarantee for the embattled nation &#x2014; instead encouraging European allies to take the lead in securing Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability. &quot;You challenged us to step up on Ukraine, on defense spending, on European security. And I say to you that we have, we are, and we will further,&quot; Healey responded to Hegseth during the press briefing. Healey&apos;s comments come during the U.K. Defense Secretary&apos;s visit to the United States to discuss plans for peace in Ukraine. The meeting occurred as EU leaders were meeting in Brussels to discuss additional support for Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on March 2 that a number of European nations, including the U.K. and France, are developing a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; that will include &quot;planes in the air and boots on the ground&quot; in an effort to negotiate a successful ceasefire in Ukraine. Reuters reported on March 6, citing diplomatic sources familiar with the matter, that France and the U.K. aim to finalize a peace plan with Ukraine &quot;in days&quot; to present to the United States. The comments from Hegseth come amid a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy, with Trump echoing Kremlin narratives and accusing President Volodymyr Zelensky of prolonging the war. In recent days, the United States has significantly distanced itself from Ukraine by halting military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv. The move follows a heated exchange in the Oval Office on Feb. 28 in which Zelensky and Trump got into an argument in front of reporters. Following the tense exchange, European leaders reaffirmed their support for Zelensky and Ukraine on Feb. 28 with EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas stating that &quot;Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It&apos;s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-defense-secretary-hegseth-hails-uk-for-stepping-up-on-ukraine/	2025-03-06T21:15:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/gettyimages-2203022644-612x612.jpg
Russia launches missile attack targeting critical infrastructure in various regions of Ukraine	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russian forces launched missiles at various regions of Ukraine overnight on March 7, targeting energy and gas infrastructure across the country, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said. Halushchenko did not immediately say where critical infrastructure has been hit but noted &quot;rescuers and energy workers&quot; are on-scene to provide emergency restoration work. Russia initially launched a series of missiles around 4 a.m. local time targeting various regions in the country&apos;s far-west. A second series of missiles entered Ukrainian airspace around 6 a.m. Explosions were reported in the western city of Ternopil around 5 a.m. local time, following the first series of attacks, Suspilne reported. Later in the morning, explosions were heard in the front line city of Kharkiv around 6:30 a.m. Air defenses were active in all regions of Ukraine amid the missile threats. No information was immediately available as to the extent of the damage or whether there are any casualties. Russia has regularly launched missiles targeting various regions of the country. Russian forces have continuously targeted Ukraine&apos;s critical infrastructure as Russia continues to test Ukrainian resolve in the harsh winter months. Amid the U.S. pause on sharing intelligence with Kyiv, the New York Times reported on March 5, citing undisclosed U.S. and Ukrainian officials that the pause affects warnings against Russian drones and missiles striking Ukrainian military and civilian targets.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-missile-attack/	2025-03-06T20:40:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-76096673.jpg
Ukraine brought halts to military aid, intelligence sharing 'on themselves,' Kellogg says	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, suggested on March 6 that Ukraine was to blame for the U.S. halting military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv, saying that the embattled nation &quot;brought it on themselves.&quot; The Trump administration halted U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing for Ukraine this week following a heated exchange between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28. The decision are likely intended to put pressure on Zelensky in peace talks The halt in military aid leaves over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition undelivered to Kyiv, while the pause in intelligence sharing affects warnings against Russian drones and missiles striking Ukrainian military and civilian targets, Ukrainian and U.S. officials told the New York Times. &quot;The best way I can describe it is sort of like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across the nose,&quot; Kellogg said during a panel at the Council on Foreign Relations. &quot;You got their attention.&quot; Zelensky issued a statement on March 4 in which he called the Oval Office clash &quot;regrettable&quot; and affirmed commitment to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s leadership, after the White House questioned Zelensky&apos;s commitment to peace. &#x201C;Trump had a real question about whether President Zelensky was committed to the peace process, and he said let&#x2019;s pause,&#x201D; CIA Director John Ratcliffe said on March 5. Kellogg&apos;s comments come following his visit Kyiv on Feb. 20 where he lauded the &quot;positive discussions&quot; he held with Zelensky. &quot;Extensive and positive discussions with (Zelensky), the embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war, and his talented national security team,&quot; Kellogg wrote on X following the meeting. Earlier in the day on March 6, Kellogg said that the Istanbul talks can&apos;t serve as the basis for a Ukraine-Russia peace deal. The Istanbul agreements refer to negotiations between Ukraine and Russia held in Turkey in late March 2022, which outlined potential terms for a peace deal.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-brought-halts-to-aid-freeze-intelligence-sharing-on-themselves-kellogg-says/	2025-03-06T19:50:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1247741520.jpg
Norway to increase aid for Ukraine to $7.8 billion in 2025	Norway&apos;s parliamentary leaders agreed on March 6 to increase aid for Ukraine by 50 billion Norwegian krone ($4.6 billion) to a total of 85 billion Norwegian krone ($7.8 billion) in 2025. &quot;We are increasing support because there is a need for it, and it is a solid contribution to peace and stability in Europe,&quot; Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St&#xF8;re said following the agreement. &quot;It is a very, very high amount. It is needed in the defense struggle that Ukraine is in.&quot; Norway initially planned to allocate $2.1 billion for military aid to Ukraine in 2025 Although it was not immediately clear as to where the additional funds would be disbursed, Norwegian media outlet NRK reported that where the aid will be dictated by Ukraine&apos;s need. Norway has been one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters in Europe. Previously, St&#xF8;re announced on in December 2024 that the Nordic country will provide 2.7 billion Norwegian kroner ($242 million) to bolster Ukraine&apos;s navy and help it deter Russian threats in the Black Sea. Speaking to reporters about the new aid on March 6, St&#xF8;re also criticized actions taken by the Trump administration over the last week, including halting U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing for Ukraine. &quot;Ukraine is in a dramatic defensive battle against a sustained Russian attack. The changes in the United States have weakened support for Ukraine,&quot; St&#xF8;re said, adding that the situation was &quot;very sad.&quot; As the Nordic country&apos;s support for Ukraine continue, Norway previously pledged a new funding mechanism for Ukraine, the &quot;Norwegian model,&quot; meant to complement an existing &quot;Danish model&quot; of defense spending. The Danish model aims to purchase arms from Ukrainian manufacturers rather than providing materiel shipments.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway-to-increase-aid-to-ukraine-to-8-billion-in-2025/	2025-03-06T18:38:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1623063883.jpg
NATO could extend Article 5 protection to Ukraine without membership, Italian PM says	Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni suggested on March 6 that NATO could extend Article 5 protections to Ukraine without granting Kyiv membership in the alliance. The collective defense principle enshrined in NATO&apos;s Article 5 commits member nations to come to the defense of any other member state in the event of an attack. &quot;We need to think about more durable solutions&quot; than just sending European peacekeepers to Ukraine, Meloni said on the sidelines of the EU leaders&apos; meeting in Brussels. &quot;It&#x2019;s a different thing than entering NATO, but it implies extending the coverage that NATO countries have also to Ukraine,&quot; she added. European countries, led mainly by the U.K. and France, are developing a coalition of the willing to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Various countries outside the EU including Canada, Australia, and Ireland have voiced their openness to partake in such a mission. NATO allies reaffirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible&quot; path toward NATO membership in July 2024, although member states have yet to provide Ukraine with a formal invitiation, despite numerous calls to do so. Meloni&apos;s comments come as the clearest indication of her position on Ukraine&apos;s potential security guarantees. The Italian prime minister, who has served potential conduit between European allies and the Trump administration, will not likely find support for the proposal in the United States. The U.S. has thus far welcomed the idea of European peacekeeping troops monitoring a potential ceasefire in Ukraine but has fallen short of offering concrete security guarantees. Meloni&apos;s comments in Brussels comes as European leaders have failed to say how Europe would provide lasting security guarantees without U.S. backing, amid steps taken by the U.S. to distance itself from Ukraine. When asked how Europe might provide security guarantees to Ukraine without a U.S. backstop, both European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen dodged specifics and pivoted to praising the Ukrainian military. &quot;The best security guarantee are the Ukrainians themselves,&quot; Costa said, highlighting the fact that Ukraine has been fighting Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion for over three years.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-could-extend-article-5-protection-to-ukraine-without-membership-italian-pm-says/	2025-03-06T17:43:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/DSC07739------.jpg
Best security guarantee is the Ukrainian army' — EU leaders dodge specifics on long-term peace plan	The European Union reaffirmed its &quot;continued and unwavering support&quot; for Ukraine at a special summit in Brussels on March 6, but failed to say how Europe would provide lasting security guarantees without U.S. backing. EU leaders convened in Brussels to discuss European and Ukrainian defense amid U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s decision to halt military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv. When asked how Europe might provide security guarantees to Ukraine without a U.S. backstop, both European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen dodged specifics and pivoted to praising the Ukrainian military. &quot;The best security guarantee are the Ukrainians themselves,&quot; Costa said, highlighting the fact that Ukraine has been fighting Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion for over three years. &quot;We stand for Ukraine since day one, and we will continue, and we will continue even after the war,&quot; he said. The EU plans to &quot;explore our capabilities in the treaty framework to contribute for security guarantees,&quot; Costa said, without describing any specific proposals. He reiterated that security guarantees are not only essential for peace in Ukraine, but for the security of all Europe and the restoration of the &quot;international rules-based order.&quot; Von der Leyen backed up Costa&apos;s remarks regarding Ukraine being its own best security assurance. &quot;(T)he best security guarantee is the Ukrainian army,&quot; she said. President Volodymyr Zelensky attended the special European Council, addressing EU leaders and meeting with Costa and von der Leyen. In his address, he said Ukraine needs &quot;a comprehensive agreement on security guarantees&quot; in order to accept a peace deal with Russia. In a statement released at the conclusion of the summit, the EU pledged to provide &quot;enhanced political, financial, economic, humanitarian, military, and diplomatic support to Ukraine&quot; while &quot;stepping up pressure on Russia.&quot; The statement also emphasizes the EU&apos;s commitment to deepening cooperation with Ukraine&apos;s defense industry and Armed Forces. &quot;A Ukraine capable of defending itself effectively is an integral part of any future security guarantees,&quot; it reads. In their remarks at the close of the summit, both von der Leyen and Costa were measured in their remarks regarding the U.S. shifts in foreign policy under the Trump administration. When asked how Europe might respond to increasing U.S. hostility, von der Leyen reiterated that a &quot;peace through strength&quot; was in everyone&apos;s best interests, including Trump&apos;s.	https://kyivindependent.com/best-security-guarantee-is-the-ukrainian-army-eu-leaders-dodge-specifics-on-long-term-peace-plan/	2025-03-06T15:58:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202554405.jpg
We've made a lot of progress' — Trump says US on track to peace deal with Ukraine, Russia	The United States has &quot;made a lot of progress&quot; with both Ukraine and Russia in recent days, U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 6. Trump has long promised to bring about a swift end to Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, though progress towards such a deal was disrupted after he ejected President Volodymyr Zelensky from the White House on Feb. 28 and claimed Ukraine was &quot;not ready for peace.&quot; Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House, Trump was once again optimistic about ending the war, saying his team had made progress over the past couple days. &quot;I will say that we&apos;ve made a lot of progress with Ukraine and a lot of progress with Russia over the last couple of days and it&apos;d be great to bring (the war) to an end,&quot; he said. Trump said that a quick end to the war would mean &quot;we don&apos;t have to talk that way, about nuclear&quot; &#x2014;&#xA0;a reference to French President Emmanuel Macron&apos;s recent statement about potentially extending nuclear protection to France&apos;s allies in Europe. &quot;It&apos;d be great if everybody would get rid of our nuclear weapons,&quot; Trump added. Trump also claimed that during his first term as U.S. president he got &quot;very far along a process with Russia&quot; towards a nuclear disarmament agreeement, despite the difficulties of what he called &quot;the Russia Russia Russia hoax.&quot; The Trump team came under investigation during his first term in office for potentially illegal ties with Russia. The special counsel report found evidence of &quot;extensive criminal activity,&quot; though it did not find evidence that Trump was directly working for, or had ever been recruited by, Russian security services. While Trump did not share details on the type of &quot;progress&quot; made with Russia and Ukraine, his remarks coincide with Zelensky&apos;s announcement that U.S and Ukrainian officials would meet for talks next week. Trump&apos;s envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said the delegates would discuss a framework for a potential peace agreement in Saudi Arabia. The resumed cooperation comes after Zelensky issued a conciliatory statement calling the White House confrontation &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirming his willingness to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Trump read Zelensky&apos;s words aloud during his address to Congress on March 4, saying he appreciated the statement and had received &quot;strong signals&quot; that Russia was also ready to make a peace deal. Trump did not directly discuss the decision to freeze military aid to Kyiv in the address.	https://kyivindependent.com/weve-made-a-lot-of-progress-trump-says-us-on-track-to-peace-deal-with-ukraine-russia/	2025-03-06T14:17:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201360456.jpg
No decision yet on revoking legal status of Ukrainian refugees in US, Trump says	The White House has not come to a decision yet regarding the legal status of 240,000 Ukrainian refugees currently living in the United States, U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on March 6. Earlier in the day, Reuters reported that the administration is planning to revoke the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) of these Ukrainians, potentially paving the way for their deportation. Trump said he had not made a decision on the matter yet, but planned to do so &quot;pretty soon.&quot; He also claimed that his administration did not want to hurt refugees from Ukraine. &quot;We&apos;re not looking to hurt anybody and we&apos;re certainly not looking to hurt them,&quot; Trump said. &quot;And I&apos;m looking at that, and there were some people that think that&apos;s appropriate and some people don&apos;t, and I&apos;ll be making a decision pretty soon. But we&apos;re not looking to hurt them. Especially Ukrainians. They&apos;ve gone through a lot.&quot; According to four undisclosed sources who spoke to Reuters, the plan to revoke TPS predates Trump&apos;s public argument with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28 and is part of the administration&apos;s broader crackdown on the more than 1.8 million people staying in the U.S. on humanitarian grounds. Later in the day, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed the report as &quot;fake news,&quot; claiming that no decision had been made. Trump, who campaigned intensively on promises to deport millions of migrants, began rolling back protections for Ukrainian and other refugees mere days after returning to the White House. In late January, the administration suspended the Uniting for Ukraine program, which allowed Ukrainians to stay in the U.S. for up to two years. The program also granted refugees the right to work and receive health insurance. Over 6 million Ukrainian citizens fled their homes in the wake of Russia&apos;s all-out invasion in 2022. Around 5.2 million remain abroad, with the vast majority receiving protection in EU countries. Trump&apos;s decision on TPS could affect 240,000 Ukrainian refugees in the U.S. The administration has come under scrutiny for its treatment of Ukraine, a longstanding ally, in contrast to its increasing warmth towards Russia. In recent days, the White House has frozen all military aid shipments and stopped intelligence sharing with Kyiv. Zelensky said on March 6 that the U.S. and Ukraine have resumed cooperation and that delegations will meet for talks next week.	https://kyivindependent.com/no-decision-yet-on-revoking-legal-status-of-ukrainian-refugees-in-us-trump-says/	2025-03-06T13:25:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194444069.jpg
US ready to go 'all in' on sanctions against Russia, treasury secretary says	The United States is prepared to go &quot;all in&quot; on sanctions against Russia in order to pressure Moscow to the negotiating table, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on March 6. Bessent&apos;s remarks come shortly after Reuters reported that the White House is considering a plan to ease sanctions against Russia as part of a deal to end the war in Ukraine. Speaking at the Economic Club of New York, Bessent criticized former U.S. President Joe Biden for imposing &quot;egregiously weak sanctions&quot; on Russia and said the current administration was prepared to enact harsher restrictions to gain leverage in upcoming talks. &quot;A major factor that has enabled the Russian war machine&apos;s continued financing was the Biden administration&apos;s egregiously weak sanctions on Russian energy, stemming from worries about upward pressure on U.S. energy prices,&quot; Bessent said. While Biden did impose sweeping restrictions on Russia&apos;s oil sector in the last month of his term, Bessent criticized the former president for taking such belated action. He said the increased sanctions would remain in effect and that U.S. President Donald Trump was willing to threaten more severe penalties. &quot;This administration has kept the enhanced sanctions in place and will not hesitate to go &apos;all in&apos; should it provide leverage in peace negotiations,&quot; he said. The Trump administration has faced outcry for its abrupt policy shift on Ukraine and its apparent friendliness towards the Kremlin. The reported plan to lift sanctions comes as the White House has canceled military aid to Ukraine and stopped intelligence sharing with Kyiv. Bessent&apos;s remarks seemed tailored to deflect some of this criticism, portraying the Biden administration as soft on Russia and emphasizing Trump&apos;s willingness to take a hard line. Sanctions on Moscow &quot;will be used explicitly and aggressively for immediate maximum impact,&quot; Bessent said. The treasury secretary also said the U.S. planned to intensify sanctions against Iran, which has supplied Russia with Shahed drones and short-range ballistic missiles, used in attacks on Ukrainian cities. &quot;We are going to shutdown Iran&apos;s oil sector and drone manufacturing capabilities,&quot; Bessent said. Shortly after his inauguration, Trump threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions on Russia to force their hand in negotiations, saying &quot;we can do it the easy way or the hard way.&quot; In the following weeks, Trump instead lashed out at Ukraine, claiming President Volodymyr Zelensky was &quot;not ready for peace&quot; and withholding critical U.S. support. Zelensky announced on March 6 that U.S. and Ukrainian delegations have resumed cooperation and will hold talks next week.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-ready-to-go-all-in-on-sanctions-against-russia-treasury-secretary-says/	2025-03-06T12:49:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203649352.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine, US delegations to meet next week, Zelensky announces	Key developments on March 6: Ukraine and U.S. delegations have resumed work and are scheduled to meet next week, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced at the Special European Council on March 6. &quot;Ukraine is not only ready to take the necessary steps for peace, but we are also proposing what those steps are,&quot; Zelensky said, expressing hope for a &quot;meaningful&quot; dialogue with U.S. officials. Senior White House Fox News Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich wrote on X that the talks are set for March 11 and will involve Andriy Yermak, Zelensky&apos;s chief of staff. The U.S. delegation will reportedly include U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. &quot;The idea is to get down a framework for a peace agreement and an initial ceasefire as well,&quot; Witkoff later said outside the White House. He added that discussions are ongoing to finalize the meeting&apos;s location, with Riyadh or Jeddah under consideration. According to Axios, the meeting will take place on March 12. The announcement follows rising tensions between Kyiv and Washington after a heated Oval Office exchange between Zelensky, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance on Feb. 28. The dispute derailed a planned bilateral deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources and led to Trump freezing all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. An agreement on Ukraine&apos;s mineral resources remains stalled as Trump seeks a &quot;bigger, better deal,&quot; CBS News reported on March 4. White House officials publicly indicated that Zelensky must issue an apology and demonstrate a commitment to peace talks for discussions to resume. On March 4, Zelensky called the White House clash &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his willingness to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Waltz suggested on March 5 that Trump may lift the pause on military aid once peace negotiations are arranged and confidence-building measures are taken, Reuters reported. The Istanbul talks can&apos;t serve as the basis for a Ukraine-Russia peace deal, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said on March 6. &quot;The Istanbul accords happened 30 days after the invasion, and the demands in Istanbul were fairly significant on a very weakened Ukraine,&quot; Kellogg said at the Council on Foreign Relations discussion. He described the agreements as a starting point for future negotiations but doubted they represented a fair framework for all parties. The Istanbul agreements refer to negotiations between Ukraine and Russia held in Turkey in late March 2022, which outlined potential terms for a peace deal. They included Ukraine adopting a neutral status, abandoning NATO aspirations, imposing military restrictions, and delaying negotiations over Russian-occupied Crimea&apos;s status for 10-15 years. Trump&apos;s envoy emphasized that conditions today differ significantly from those in 2022. He also noted that the Trump administration aims to reset U.S.-Russia relations, criticizing previous U.S. leadership for avoiding direct engagement with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kellogg&apos;s remarks follow U.S.-Russian talks in Istanbul on Feb. 27 and an earlier round in Riyadh on Feb. 18, which are part of Washington&apos;s push for a swift peace settlement. Trump expressed interest in meeting Putin, marking a stark departure from his predecessor, U.S. President Joe Biden, who had refused to engage with the Russian leader since the full-scale invasion began. Earlier, U.S. envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff suggested that the 2022 Istanbul agreements could serve as a foundation for a future Ukraine-Russia peace treaty. Despite his role as Trump&apos;s special envoy, Kellogg has been sidelined in recent peace efforts and excluded from both the Saudi and Turkish negotiations. Analysts suggest this may be due to his perceived pro-Ukraine stance and alleged Russian objections to his involvement. Military experts proposed to deploy European air forces to protect Kyiv and other non-front-line Ukrainian cities from Russian aerial attacks, the Guardian reported on March 6, citing the so-called Sky Shield plan. The plan could potentially work as part of the &quot;truce in the sky&quot; proposed by President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier this week, preventing missiles, long-range drones, and bombs from targeting civilian infrastructure. The project&apos;s supporters said it could be a European-led air defense zone involving 120 fighter jets that will operate separately from NATO. According to the plan, developed by former British Air Force planners in cooperation with Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, the protection zone would cover Ukraine&apos;s three operational nuclear power plants, as well as the cities of Odesa and Lviv in Ukraine&apos;s south and west. The country&apos;s east, where the fierce battles are ongoing in Donetsk Oblast, was not included in the zone. According to the authors, this step can be more tangible than the deployment of ground troops as peacekeepers. In February, the Washington Post reported that up to 30,000 European troops could be deployed in Ukraine after a potential ceasefire. Among those who supported the Sky Shield plan are Philip Breedlove, former NATO supreme commander in Europe, Polish ex-President Aleksander Kwasniewski, and Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania&apos;s former foreign minister. European defense ministries have considered the plan, but their leaders have been reluctant to authorize patrolling Ukrainian skies while Russia&apos;s full-scale war is ongoing, the Guardian wrote. In light of the U.S. policy shift and suspension of military aid to Ukraine, the initiative can be revisited, the news outlet noted. Yet, Western partners still fear an escalation if an aircraft from either side is attacked or shot down. Russian forces regularly launch drones and missiles against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, inflicting heavy civilian casualties. A Russian missile strike against a hotel in Kryvyi Rih late on March 5, carried out shortly after the U.S. paused vital intelligence sharing, killed four people and injured over 30. According to figures released by Kyiv, U.N. statistics, and open-source data published by BBC Russia, the total death toll of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers, as well as Ukrainian civilians, stood at over 148,000 as of mid-February. Ukraine has not yet received detailed information on U.S. intelligence-sharing restrictions but is already exploring alternatives, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on March 6, Interfax-Ukraine reported. &quot;We are already working on alternatives, including requesting (assistance) from Germany if necessary,&quot; Umerov said at a press conference in Berlin, following talks with German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. Washington cut off intelligence-sharing with Kyiv on March 5, following its decision to freeze all military aid to Ukraine as part of an effort to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine on U.S. terms. The intelligence cutoff threatens Ukraine&apos;s ability to track Russian military movements and detect aerial strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Reports suggest the U.S. may have also prohibited allies like the U.K. from passing on intelligence obtained through American sources. U.S. officials have indicated the pause could be temporary and contingent on progress toward peace talks. France has continued to provide military intelligence to Ukraine, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on March 6, according to BFM TV. European leaders are expected to discuss additional support for Ukraine and increased defense spending at an EU summit in Brussels on March 6. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Brussels for the emergency meeting, which was convened to address Europe&apos;s security strategy amid growing concerns over Washington&apos;s shifting foreign policy. The U.S. pause on sharing intelligence with Kyiv affects warnings against Russian drones and missiles striking Ukrainian military and civilian targets, the New York Times reported on March 5, citing undisclosed U.S. and Ukrainian officials. The U.S. stopped sharing intelligence with Ukraine on March 5, shortly after it froze all military assistance as part of an effort to pressure Kyiv into quick negotiations with Russia on U.S. terms. Russian forces regularly launch drones and missiles against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, inflicting heavy civilian casualties. A Russian missile strike against a hotel in Kryvyi Rih late on March 5, carried out shortly after the intelligence sharing pause, killed four people and injured at least 30. According to figures released by Kyiv, U.N. statistics, and open-source data published by BBC Russia, the total death toll of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers, as well as Ukrainian civilians, stood at over 148,000 as of mid-February. A senior Ukrainian official told the NYT that the pause in intelligence sharing would make it more difficult for Ukrainian forces to strike Russian targets. Kyiv still has access to other satellite imagery, they added. Valerii Kondratiuk, the former Ukraine&apos;s spy chief, said that intelligence sharing primarily involves the exchange of satellite images. While European companies have their own satellites, they are not focused on military movements, he added. Some unnamed U.S. officials voiced hope that any pause in intelligence sharing would be short and have little practical impact. A senior Trump administration official told the NYT the original plan was to suspend military and intelligence sharing for a week or two as part of a campaign to put pressure on President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to the NYT, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has a &quot;sizable presence&quot; in Ukraine, with some of its officers deployed in the country to help Ukraine with targeting. The CIA has also helped set up at least three secret signals intelligence collection bases that Ukraine uses to intercept Russian communications to reduce their reliance on U.S. intelligence, the newspaper reported.

‘He betrayed every one of us’ – US soldiers in Ukraine speak out after Trump’s military aid halt	Editor&#x2019;s note: In accordance with the security protocols of the Ukrainian military, soldiers featured in this story are identified by first names and callsigns only. American volunteer soldiers fighting in Ukraine say that they feel &#x201C;betrayed&#x201D; by their own country after the U.S. halted military aid and stopped sharing intelligence with Kyiv in early March. &#x201C;(U.S. President Donald Trump) betrayed every one of us,&#x201D; a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, who goes by the callsign Goldfish, told the Kyiv Independent. A few days after the heated Oval Office clash during President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s visit to Washington on Feb. 28, Trump froze the delivery of all U.S. military aid to Ukraine, worth billions, in a move to push Kyiv into peace talks with Russia. CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed on March 5 that the U.S. has also halted intelligence sharing with Ukraine, which could affect Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to identify Russian targets, as well as to defend itself from missile strikes. The American soldiers who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said they were &#x201C;horrified&#x201D; by their country&#x2019;s recent decisions and the ensuing consequences on the ground in Ukraine. With many of them fighting in Ukraine since 2022, they say watching their country take a major U-turn in Ukraine policy and soften toward Russia has been hurtful and deeply offensive, especially after losing comrades one after another to the war, including many Americans. &#x201C;Never have I ever thought that I would be listening to any U.S. public figure &#x2013; let alone the president &#x2013; openly declare support for an aggressor,&#x201D; Goldfish, a 33-year-old Alaskan currently serving with the 25th Airborne Brigade, said. &#x201C;If we stand here now on the side of the oppressor, literally telling Ukraine, either submit or cease to exist, that&apos;s not peace &#x2013; that&#x2019;s subjugation.&#x201D; U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office in Washington, D.C., U.S. on Feb. 10, 2025. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)While the exact number of U.S. volunteer soldiers fighting in various units in Ukraine is unknown to the public, at least 50, including about 40 U.S. military veterans, were killed in action as of February 2024, according to the American defense online publication Task &amp; Purpose. A 2025 CNN investigation revealed that more than 20 are missing in action on the front line. Understanding the significance of U.S. military aid and the immense sacrifice that Ukraine has already made to defend its country, some American fighters hoped that Trump wouldn&#x2019;t abandon Ukraine like that, soldier Levi Perez, 36, said. &#x201C;Deep down in our very souls, we knew it was coming,&#x201D; Perez, an Alaskan who goes by his callsign Joker, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Our reputation for the foreseeable future is pretty much gone,&#x201D; he said, noting that other Western countries are losing trust in the U.S. and may turn away from further political and economic ties. Perez and a few other American soldiers in Ukraine are convinced that Trump and his team&#x2019;s hasty moves are making the possibility of World War III inevitable, especially with China likely eyeing the moment to invade another sovereign nation. &#x201C;We are beyond the point of control (where we can avoid World War III) because Russia is not going to retreat completely, they won&apos;t give back the stolen territory, and Ukraine won&apos;t let them keep the territory,&#x201D; Perez said, referring to the roughly 20% of the Ukrainian land that Russia occupies. A surge in the Ukrainian troop losses is expected with the U.S. military aid freeze and the intelligence sharing halt, the American soldiers say. A former police officer from a southern city in the U.S. currently serving in the Ukrainian military says that he&#x2019;s most worried about the bans&#x2019; potential cost especially on the civilian lives. &#x201C;The civilians are going to suffer exponentially, almost more, because now with the lack of intelligence, we don&apos;t have as much information about rocket and drone strikes coming from Russian territory,&#x201D; the police officer-turned-soldier, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to his unit&#x2019;s protocols, told the Kyiv Independent. The most terrifying part is seeing how the U.S.&#x2019; next steps will impact Ukraine and its people, because &#x201C;Ukrainian people are incredible,&#x201D; according to a fellow American soldier, who goes by the callsign Gimli. &#x201C;The nightmare that keeps me up the most is whether my country will ever recover,&#x201D; Gimli, a 33-year-old former U.S. army serviceman from Washington, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Or if Trump and the Kremlin have completely crippled the future of my country.&#x201D; Gimli and other American soldiers said they had a completely different vision of their country&#x2014;a democratic nation they believed had always tried to do the right thing despite setbacks and to help the world as &#x201C;defenders of freedom.&#x201D; Now, they say they feel humiliated. &#x201C;I accepted the fact that I just may not have a country to go back to because I&#x2019;m not going to go back and live under a fascist regime,&#x201D; he said, adding that he hopes that &#x201C;the Ukrainians can forgive my people someday.&#x201D; The American soldiers interviewed said their hopes were now hanging on Europe to step up its support for Ukraine in what could be its darkest months to come. Goldfish, who received a near fatal injury in embattled Donetsk Oblast in the summer of 2023, said that &#x201C;Europe is the sleeping tiger in this war.&#x201D; &#x201C;I always thought it would be Russia that would just poke too far towards Europe or make too many threats. But it wasn&apos;t,&#x201D; Goldfish said. &#x201C;It was America that poked the tiger and woke it up.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-soldiers-in-ukraine-trumps-military-aid-halt/	2025-03-06T11:59:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2197496691.jpg
Eutelsat in talks with EU to possibly replace Starlink in Ukraine, CEO confirms	French satellite operator Eutelsat Communications is in advanced talks with the European Union to possibly replace tech billionaire Elon Musk&apos;s Starlink in Ukraine, Bloomberg reported on March 6. &quot;Everyone is asking us today, &apos;Can you replace the large number of terminals of Starlink in Ukraine,&apos; and we are looking at that,&quot; Eutelsat CEO Eva Berneke told Bloomberg. Eutelsat, which already operates in Ukraine, has thousands of terminals deployed, although not all are connected to the network. Starlink has played a vital role in Ukraine&apos;s battlefield communications, with around 42,000 terminals providing service to the military, medical facilities, businesses, and aid organizations. Berneke said the company is in discussions with suppliers to provide both military-grade and standard terminals and would need &quot;a couple of months&quot; to supply 40,000 units. Concerns over Starlink&apos;s availability escalated after the U.S. paused military aid to Ukraine on March 3. Reuters reported that U.S. officials have raised the possibility of restricting Ukraine&apos;s access to Starlink. Musk, who owns Starlink and has close ties to U.S. President Donald Trump, denied the intention to turn off the terminals. Eutelsat&apos;s proposal combines OneWeb&apos;s low Earth orbit satellites, positioned around 1,200 kilometers (746 miles) above the surface, with its geostationary satellites at 35,000 kilometers (21,748 miles). The dual-constellation approach could provide essential connectivity for Ukraine&apos;s military, including for drone operations that have inflicted significant losses on Russian forces. OneWeb already provides services to Ukraine through a German distributor, but scaling up would require European governments to approve procurement and integration plans. The European Commission is assessing ways to help Ukraine secure satellite communications in case Starlink access is restricted, Politico reported on March 3.	https://kyivindependent.com/eutelsat-in-talks-with-eu-to-possibly-replace-starlink-in-ukraine-ceo-confirms/	2025-03-06T11:37:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1775225270.jpg
Ukrainian, US delegations to discuss peace framework in Saudi Arabia, Witkoff says	Ukrainian and U.S. delegations are set to discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement next week in Saudi Arabia, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, told reporters on March 6. &quot;The idea is to get down a framework for a peace agreement and an initial ceasefire as well,&quot; Witkoff said outside the White House. He added that discussions are ongoing to finalize the meeting&apos;s location, with Riyadh or Jeddah under consideration. President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed on March 6 at the European Council that Ukraine and the U.S. have resumed talks and preparing for a meeting. &quot;Ukraine is not only ready to take the necessary steps for peace, but we are also proposing what those steps are,&quot; he said. Senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich wrote on X that the meeting is scheduled for March 11, with Ukraine&apos;s delegation led by Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff, Andriy Yermak. The U.S. delegation will reportedly include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, and Witkoff. According to Axios, the meeting will take place on March 12. Earlier, on March 5, Yermak wrote on Telegram that he and Waltz had discussed &quot;further steps toward a just and lasting peace. &quot; Tensions between Kyiv and Washington escalated following a heated Oval Office exchange between Zelensky, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance on Feb. 28. The dispute led to the collapse of a bilateral agreement on Ukraine&apos;s mineral resources and prompted Trump to freeze all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. The mineral deal remains stalled, with CBS News reporting on March 4 that Trump is seeking a &quot;bigger, better deal.&quot; White House officials have publicly signaled that Zelensky must issue an apology and commit to peace talks for discussions to resume. On March 4, Zelensky called the White House confrontation &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his willingness to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Waltz suggested on March 5 that Trump may lift the pause on military aid once peace negotiations are arranged and confidence-building measures are taken, Reuters reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-us-delegations-to-discuss-peace-framework-in-saudi-arabia-trump-s-envoy-says/	2025-03-06T11:14:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199709214.jpg
Istanbul talks can't serve as basis for Ukraine-Russia peace deal, Kellogg says	The Istanbul talks can&apos;t serve as the basis for a Ukraine-Russia peace deal, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said on March 6. &quot;The Istanbul accords happened 30 days after the invasion, and the demands in Istanbul were fairly significant on a very weakened Ukraine,&quot; Kellogg said at the Council on Foreign Relations discussion. He described the agreements as a starting point for future negotiations but doubted they represented a fair framework for all parties. The Istanbul agreements refer to negotiations between Ukraine and Russia held in Turkey in late March 2022, which outlined potential terms for a peace deal. They included Ukraine adopting a neutral status, abandoning NATO aspirations, imposing military restrictions, and delaying negotiations over Russian-occupied Crimea&apos;s status for 10-15 years. Trump&apos;s envoy emphasized that conditions today differ significantly from those in 2022. He also noted that the Trump administration aims to reset U.S.-Russia relations, criticizing previous U.S. leadership for avoiding direct engagement with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kellogg&apos;s remarks follow U.S.-Russian talks in Istanbul on Feb. 27 and an earlier round in Riyadh on Feb. 18, which are part of Washington&apos;s push for a swift peace settlement. Trump expressed interest in meeting Putin, marking a stark departure from his predecessor, U.S. President Joe Biden, who had refused to engage with the Russian leader since the full-scale invasion began. Earlier, U.S. envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff suggested that the 2022 Istanbul agreements could serve as a foundation for a future Ukraine-Russia peace treaty. Despite his role as Trump&apos;s special envoy, Kellogg has been sidelined in recent peace efforts and excluded from both the Saudi and Turkish negotiations. Analysts suggest this may be due to his perceived pro-Ukraine stance and alleged Russian objections to his involvement.	https://kyivindependent.com/istanbul-agreements-not-basis-for-ukraine-russia-peace-deal-trumps-kellogg-says/	2025-03-06T11:03:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1228656063.jpg
As protests engulf Serbia, President Vucic looks for support East and West	Editor&apos;s Note: Following a number of attacks against peaceful protestors in Serbia, the Kyiv Independent agreed to not publish the last names of people who gave comments for this story. BELGRADE, Serbia &#x2014; Thousands of protestors walked 300 kilometers on March 1 from Belgrade to the southern city of Nis to rally support for an anti-corruption protest that took aim at the ruling party. Serbia&apos;s Russia-friendly President Aleksandar Vucic has often used a Kremlin playbook to discredit the protests that occasionally rise in a country balancing between Russia and the West. Such a balancing act has been increasingly difficult to maintain. Nis, the country&apos;s third largest city home to 250,000, has long been President Vucic&apos;s core voting stronghold along other cities and towns further away from the capital. Yet, residents who greeted the arriving protesters said they were tired of their ruling party and wanted to listen to what young people have to say. The Serbian protests began in November after a train station roof in the town of Novi Sad collapsed, killing 15 people. This roof had been hastily reconstructed in 2024 with Chinese and state funds and a procurement procedure widely viewed as corrupt. Students took to the streets, demanding accountability and justice for the victims. They used a bloody hand symbol to highlight how corruption in Serbia cost lives. Vucic had been actively blaming the upheaval on the West, saying that foreign forces have been attempting to spark a &quot;Ukrainian-style revolution in Serbia.&quot; The protestors, however, aren&apos;t pro-Ukrainian or anti-Russian, and are united primarily by their opposition to the current government rather than broader ideological takes. Protests in Serbia have gone on for over 100 days in 60 different settlements. Students, farmers and businesses continue to strike in support. Universities, some of which are now closed, are used as base-camps for democratic decision-making among the students. Alexander, a student who took part in daily marches, said the protesters remain hopeful. &quot;We really feel like we can change something this time,&quot; he said.

(Andrej Isakovic / AFP via Getty Images)The movement follows a pattern. Students announce a mass rally in a Serbian city, then walk to that location for days. Along the way they talk to locals to gather support for the movement. A taxi driver in Nis on March 1 said his views had changed since seeing the protestors in the flesh, rather than on state TV where they are routinely denigrated. &quot;In the Balkans, children are always taught to listen to their elders. But now we are listening to them. They are teaching us to stand up for our rights,&quot; he said. The pro-democracy movement is changing Serbia&apos;s image. Protesters seek respect for the rule of law, a free press and, fair elections, and an end to widespread corruption. So far, the protests have prompted Vucic to publicly oust Prime Minister Milos Vucevic and Transport Minister Darko Glisic, both of whom remain in their place as they await a vote in parliament. Arrests of several company heads and policemen in what Vucic has called a &quot;fierce fight against corruption&quot; had also taken place. Protestors, however, show a deep skepticism towards Vucic&apos;s proposed anti-corruption measures which are widely seen to be a last ditch attempt to cling to power. Students interviewed by the Kyiv Independent expressed deep frustration with the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), blaming it for the country&apos;s lack of media freedom, rigged elections, and neglect of public services and civil liberties. Andjela, 22, a student protestor, said, &quot;The whole ruling party should resign. They&apos;ve shown they are unfit to run the country. We haven&apos;t had free elections in my lifetime. It&apos;s unsafe here, incomes are low, prices are high, and criminals go unpunished, including the thugs who beat up students.&quot; A woman holds a placard reading &quot;Smells like corruption spirit&quot; during a demonstration in Belgrade, Serbia, on Jan. 24, 2025. (Andrej Isakovic / AFP / Getty Images)People gather during a demonstration in Nis, Serbia, on March 1, 2025, during a national rally organized by students. (Andrej Isakovic / AFP / Getty Images)The latest election, in 2023, was seen as being widely rigged, with 50,000 voters from the Republika Srpska, a ethnic Serbian enclave of Bosnia, were bussed to Belgrade to sway the vote. Mass protests followed, but they led to no change. A year later, a new protest movement was built on years of unresolved discontent. In the aftermath of the Kosovo War of 1999, a mass student-led movement called OTPOR brought down the country&apos;s autocrat, Slobodan Milosevic. Srecko Mihailovi&#x107;, a veteran protester of the OTPOR movement, said that he&apos;s been on marches for 30 years and hopes he won&apos;t be doing it to the grave. &quot;We&apos;ve had the same president for 10 years, this is not normal,&quot; he said. &quot;But we need to show that Serbia isn&apos;t Vucic.&quot; Vucic&apos;s response to the protests has been chaotic. The president claimed, without evidence, that outside forces are behind the protests and has accused the West of trying to incite a revolution. At the same time, Vucic had told EU leaders that &quot;Putinists&quot; are trying to stir up trouble to deepen the country&apos;s ties with Russia. On Jan. 20, Serbian police detained 14 foreign nationals at an NGO summit in Belgrade. Such tactics have been used by the ruling party since 2012. State tabloids bully critics of the government, illegally publish their personal data online, and incite violence against those who oppose the government. Authorities have also been linked to hooligan groups that stir up trouble during protests to justify police action. A similar tactic was used during the 2013-14 EuroMaidan Revolution in Ukraine, when the pro-Kremlin government employed thugs to fight with protesters, coining the term Titushky.

(Tadija Anastasjevic / AFP / Getty Images)Andjela, who took part in protests, noted that this year&apos;s protesters are alert for provocateurs. A protester was beaten up, while other students were rammed with cars and hospitalized, she said. &quot;We are careful in case it escalates and more of our students end up in the hospital,&quot; Andjela added. At present, there doesn&apos;t seem to be a solution to the political crisis. Student protesters know their government&apos;s playbook well, so they tread carefully. They appeal to patriotism and wave only Serbian flags to avoid appearing influenced by outsiders. So far, the careful approach has united support across societal sectors, including the rural population, who were once Vucic&apos;s core base. Farmers brought tractors to protect students, blocking key Belgrade bridges. The rallies have also gained international support from students in the U.S., Austria, Croatia, and vocal celebrity support from tennis superstar Novak Djokovic and Madonna. The countrywide solidarity has reduced citizens&apos; fears of government-sponsored attacks, threats to family members, and job losses, which previously weakened protests in 2012, 2020, and 2023. Boris, an engineering student taking part in protests, said, &quot;This time we don&apos;t fear the government. They should fear us.&quot; The question remains what would follow were the government to call a snap election to ease the crisis. Boris said that he would like to see an interim government of &quot;democracy experts and professionals&quot; in place who could create the conditions for fair, free elections. At present, students do not have a plan to back a political candidate. They have distanced themselves from opposition parties as they view them as part of the system they are up against. Up until now, the official opposition had been fragmented and cautious. Opposition party members &quot;have nothing to do with the organization&quot; and support the protests &quot;as civilians only,&quot; said lawmaker Borko Stefanovic, deputy president of the Party of Freedom and Justice. &quot;The regime could misuse this, saying the opposition is behind the protests. But the students lead.&quot; A fight broke out between opposition and ruling party members in the Serbian National Assembly over the Novi Sad train station tragedy in Belgrade, Serbia, on Nov. 25, 2024. (Filip Stevanovic / Anadolu / Getty Images)On March 4, some unconventional action was taken in parliament. Lawmaker Radomir Lazovic of the Green-Left front voiced support for the protestors and launched fireworks in the Serbian parliament, which hospitalized three people. A brawl ensued between opposition and ruling party members. &quot;A clear message was sent that we do not accept the institutional violence of the Serbian Progressive Party, which has been carried out for years. The only agenda item at the Serbian parliament sitting can be the fulfillment of students&apos; demands,&quot; Lazovic said. Yet, a new election might not be the solution the protestors are hoping for. &quot;No elections would work under current conditions and without a free press. Vucic would steal and rig another election,&quot; Stefanovic said. The countrywide support for change in Serbia, however, doesn&apos;t mean those on the street agree on policy and their country&apos;s alignment. Though EU leaders expressed admiration and support, the absence of EU flags in the crowd is deliberate. Potestors see their cause as a local concern they must deal with within-country. An IPSOS poll in December 2024 revealed that only 46% of Serbs would support EU membership in a referendum. Many protesters feel the EU and U.S. leaders have emboldened Vucic following years of hostilities in the region. Many also dislike the West for their handling of the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s. The EU has worked with Vucic on ammunition exports, with $800 million in Serbian ammunition ending up in Ukraine through Western intermediaries. In July 2024, the Serbian government granted the EU access to its large lithium reserves. This also sparked thousands of Serbs to come out in protest, citing environmental concerns. Vucic has also gained favor with U.S. President Donald Trump by allowing his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to build a hotel in central Belgrade on top of a war memorial. Residents of Belgrade viewed the proposal with hostility. Anti-Western sentiments have long united Serbia with Russia, even though the Serbian population continues to migrate west for education and work. This connection dates back to the 19th century when the Russian Empire helped secure Serbia&apos;s independence from the Ottoman Empire. It was also bolstered by a common religion and church ties. Today, the bond is fuelled by anger over NATO&apos;s 1999 bombing of Belgrade to end President Milosevic&apos;s war against Kosovo. Serbia, backed by Russia, still claims Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008. Serbia maintains a broad conservative, Orthodox streak with strong anti-LGBTQ+ views. Many Serbs see Western nations as too &quot;liberal.&quot; In contrast, many who came of age during the 1990s view Russian President Vladimir Putin as &quot;a strong leader&quot; pushing back against the West. A 2023 poll by the Henry Jackson Society showed that over 61% of Serbs reported no change in their positive views on Russia since the start of the all-out war in Ukraine, and 21.7% said their support for Russia has increased.

Z t-shirts and Putin mugs are sold in central markets. Serbian and Russian flags and &quot;Zajedno (together)&quot; signs are widespread. Since 2022, mercenaries from far-right groups have been traveling to Russia to fight against Ukraine. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Serbia has welcomed up to 300,000 Russians fleeing the war. When these Russians share anti-Putin views, it can prompt strong reactions from the locals. Nino, who owns a cigar lounge in Belgrade, said, &quot;God has given us the gift of these liberal Russians. We&apos;ll show them the true path and send them back home, more Russian than ever!&quot; But attitudes in the capital, Belgrade, have shifted as an influx of wealthy Russian IT-workers has slowly undermined the imagined &apos;Slavic Orthodox brotherhood.&quot; Many Belgraders now resent recent Russian immigrants for not integrating, driving up housing prices and gentrifying the city with expensive shops and restaurants packed by foreigners. Students protesting in the streets say neither the EU nor Russia will do anything to help them. While many still express emotional ties to Russian culture, they say they do not wish to live in a Putin-style political system.	https://kyivindependent.com/as-protests-engulf-serbia-president-vucic-struggles-to-play-both-sides/	2025-03-06T10:49:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2183585364.jpg
BREAKING: Ukraine, US delegations resume work, to meet next week, Zelensky announces	Ukraine and U.S. delegations have resumed work and are scheduled to meet next week, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced at the Special European Council on March 6. &quot;Ukraine is not only ready to take the necessary steps for peace, but we are also proposing what those steps are,&quot; Zelensky said, expressing hope for a &quot;meaningful&quot; dialogue with U.S. officials.

The war continues because of Russia' – Zelensky's full speech at European Council	Editor&apos;s note: This is the transcript of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s address to the Special European Council released by the President&apos;s Office on March 6. President Costa! President von der Leyen! Dear colleagues, glad to see you all. I&#x2019;ve already spoken to many of you these days and weeks, and I am grateful for your support. Ukrainians really appreciate that in a time of such great emotions in global politics, European integrity is preserved, and Europe is really trying to do the right thing. First. I want to inform all of you that our teams &#x2013; Ukraine and America &#x2013; have resumed work. We hope that next week we will have a meaningful meeting. Ukraine has been seeking peace since the very first second of the war, and we have always said that the only reason why the war continues is because of Russia. Ukraine is not only ready to take the necessary steps for peace, but we are also proposing what those steps are. And I ask you to support us in this &#x2013; support Ukraine and those European leaders who are helping to pave the way for peace. We see several steps now. Everyone needs to make sure that Russia, as the sole source of this war, accepts the need to end it. This can be proved by two forms of silence that are easy to establish and monitor, namely, no attacks on energy and other civilian infrastructure &#x2013; truce for missiles, bombs, and long-range drones, and the second is truce on the water, meaning no military operations in the Black Sea. The next step is basic trust to the circumstances in which the negotiations are taking place. Ukrainians, all Europeans, Americans, every human heart in the world that does not agree with the war &#x2013; we all need to feel that the Russians are not deceiving us. The release of prisoners can be a means of establishing basic trust. And this should be based on the understanding that any truce and any form of trust building measures can only be a prologue to a full and fair settlement, to a comprehensive agreement on security guarantees and an end to the war. Let me emphasize once again that Ukrainians do really want peace, but not at the cost of giving up Ukraine. Is Russia capable of giving up the war &#x2013; this is the question that any negotiations must answer. And please be sure that Ukraine will share all the details of peace plans and talks&#x2019; process to all of Europe, every European nation that helps must be on board on the path to peace. Second. I urge you to continue to support the position that any issues related to Ukraine&#x2019;s security should be resolved with Ukraine&#x2019;s participation, just as any issues related to the security of your nations or any issues related to the security of our entire Europe should be resolved with your participation. Only this can guarantee peace on the continent and respect for the interests of all European states. That is why we are trying to ensure that European interests are represented. Anything that affects the security of Europe should be resolved with the participation of Europe. Third. I thank you for your determination to help us defend Ukraine. Every day and every night we have to protect lives. Russian ballistic missiles continue to strike our cities. The shelling at the front continues. Russian sabotage groups are still trying to enter our territory across the border in Sumy and Kharkiv regions. Moscow is not reducing its investment in death, increasing its army, and making no pauses in trying to overcome sanctions. Russia now has 220 brigades with war experience. In five years, they will bring this number to 300. We need to respond to this by taking care of lives now, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. I welcome the European Commission&#x2019;s efforts to re-arm Europe and the Rearm Europe Plan is the right initiative. The defense funds under this European Plan should strengthen all parts of Europe, and I call for a significant part to be allocated to arms production in Ukraine &#x2013; our industrial capabilities are the fastest and most relevant to the current security threats. I welcome the efforts of my European colleagues &#x2013; and this is not just about the EU, but about Europe in a broad sense &#x2013; to increase national defense spending and modernize national armies. Everyone in Europe needs this. When we agree on the format of the Armed Forces of Europe, this format will rely on the strength of national armies and on the experience of deploying partner contingents in Ukraine, which is what we are now working on. I also welcome the investments of all partners in the defense industry &#x2013; in Ukraine and in your countries, the industrial base of Europe must grow. Europe should become the place where the most technologically advanced and effective weapons in the world are produced, and this is not a fantasy if Europeans really set themselves this goal. And a few more things. I&#x2019;m grateful to you for the 16th EU sanctions package, and we must continue this pressure. We need a 17th sanctions package. The sanctions should work until Russia stops the occupation. I know that a special European financial instrument for Ukraine&#x2019;s resilience is being developed, please speed up this work. In all these circumstances, it is needed to speed up the work of our teams in the negotiations on Ukraine&#x2019;s membership in the EU. As of now, the work on clusters is actually blocked without any rational reason. We need common sense, we need to unblock the work on clusters, and this can be done at the leadership level. Thank you.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelenskys-full-speech-at-european-council/	2025-03-06T09:46:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/5ab191f76b8eff4926200ac7d107cf74_1741277568.jpeg
‘Peace’ with Russia already means a steady stream of hybrid attacks on the US and Europe	With every day of the new White House administration that passes, the chances of Russia being brought in from the cold on the international stage after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine appear to be increasing. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s ongoing Kremlin charm campaign has seen Ukraine and Europe sidelined in peace negotiations, reports that sanctions against Moscow could be lifted, and even accusations from top Democrats that the U.S. is actively siding with Russia. Experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent say the U.S.&apos;s new stance ignores one crucial thing &#x2014; Vladimir Putin&apos;s Russia does not, and never has wanted, truly peaceful relations with the West and has been engaged in a hybrid war with it for decades. Putin&#x2019;s hybrid assaults on the West have included assassinations abroad, the egregious jailing of foreigners in Russia, the funneling of weapons and facilitation of corruption, and, of course, an infamous army of hackers who carry out cyberattacks. Conflict with the West is &quot;the foundation of (Putin&#x2019;s) rule now,&quot; John Foreman, CBE, a former UK defence attach&#xE9; in both Kyiv and Moscow, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;If you&apos;ve got the foreign bogey &#x2014; you know, Anglo-Saxons, the predatory West, fascist Ukrainians, puppet states and all that &#x2014; that&apos;s the justification for why you have to be in power indefinitely, why Russian freedoms are being crushed and why there&apos;s no free media.&quot; Foreman was stationed in Moscow in the immediate aftermath of the poisoning of Soviet defector Sergey Skripal in Salisbury, an event he says sealed U.K. hostility towards the Russian government after a long history of hybrid attacks on NATO members. Regardless of Trump&#x2019;s planned peace deal with Russia, that campaign, he said, &quot;will endure, because the wider conflict with the West and with Ukraine is about dividing us to achieve political goals.&quot; &quot;So why would Putin stop that?&#x201D; Lauri Luht is currently Estonia&#x2019;s cyber attach&#xE9; in Kyiv. He recalled waking up during a 2007 cyber attack to find government websites, including that of the border service for which he worked at the time, shut down and an email inbox choked with junk. Those attacks &#x2014; which struck as Estonia removed a Soviet monument from Tallinn &#x2014; were one of the first times Russian actors had weaponized cyberspace for geopolitical aims. A distributed-denial-of-service attack like the 2007 hit on Estonia is almost quaint today. In subsequent years, Russia&#x2019;s cyber arsenal has &quot;grown so vicious,&#x201D; Luht said. &quot;And the problem, of course, is that the best cyber attacks still remain invisible,&quot; Luht told the Kyiv Independent. Like Foreman, he sees no reason to think Russia will stop. &quot;Ukraine is the primary focus of Russia right now, but that doesn&apos;t mean that they don&apos;t have others in their focus,&quot; Luht said. &quot;The (cyber) attacks which are carried out against Ukraine today might be already happening or might happen tomorrow against others.&quot; Trump&apos;s warming relations with Russia threaten NATO&#x2019;s fundamental protections, said Dr. Jan Kallberg, a research scientist and associate professor at West Point. &quot;I believe the Russians, energized by the internal belief that Trump will save them, will start testing Article 5 in a systematic manner to trigger a slippery slope undermining NATO,&quot; Kallberg told the Kyiv Independent. Kallberg added this could take many forms but used the hypothetical example of false Kremlin claims of Norwegian border guards crossing the border into Russia. In this example, Russian forces could open fire on actual Norwegian guards manning the border, prompting Norway to invoke Article 5. Kallberg said it&apos;s unlikely that NATO would declare war on Russia over such an incident, so faith in NATO as a reliable defensive mechanism would be thrown into question. &quot;Five to ten of these provocations and Article 5 is undermined. Then Russia has succeeded,&quot; he said. Trump&#x2019;s current courting of Putin for a peace deal neglects that Russian agents have obliquely attacked the U.S. and NATO with relative impunity for almost 20 years. Russia has shown little respect for NATO and its Article 5, nor for the borders, security, or interests of any country that is not Russia. Below is an incomplete timeline of Putin-era hybrid attacks on NATO nations. The total number of such attacks will never be known &#x2014; Western computer systems silently fall victim to Russian cyber gangs every day. A Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) agent who investigated organized crime, Litvinenko fled Russia for the U.K. after growing critical of Putin. He was later poisoned by FSB agents in London with polonium-210, leading to a slow and painful death and Putin&#x2019;s first major hybrid incursion into the West. Alexander Litvinenko is pictured in the Intensive Care Unit of University College Hospital in London, U.K., on Nov. 20, 2006, in this image made available on Nov. 25, 2006. The 43-year-old former KGB spy, who died on Nov. 23, 2006, accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of poisoning him. Litvinenko died after radioactive polonium-210 was found in his body. Russia&apos;s foreign intelligence service denied any involvement in the case.

A massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack roiled the country&#x2019;s digital infrastructure for almost a month, an attack that was subsequently connected to pro-Kremlin but formally independent cyber gangs.

(Louai Beshara / AFP via Getty Images)2016-2020: Arms to Taliban; bounty on U.S. soldiers in AfghanistanReports from U.S. intelligence in 2020 revealed evidence of a Russian campaign to pay the Taliban for killing U.S. soldiers. While the CIA at the time said it had &#x201C;low to moderate confidence&#x201D; in that intel, 2025 investigations from Germany&#x2019;s Der Spiegel and Russian dissident outlet the Insider identified individuals involved in a scheme to pay $200,000 per dead soldier. Russian agent Maria Butina used affairs with well-connected conservatives like political operative Paul Erickson and Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne to infiltrate Republican groups like the National Rifle Association. After pleading guilty to acting as an unregistered agent, she served a year and a half in jail. Today, Butina is a member of Russia&#x2019;s parliament. As part of a broader cyber campaign against the West, Russian government actors hacked the Democratic National Convention&#x2019;s servers as well as then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s campaign staff, releasing tens of thousands of emails through WikiLeaks. The hack followed a public statement from then-candidate Donald Trump calling on anyone who could to get a hold of Clinton&#x2019;s emails, which would lead Trump to spend subsequent years denying collusion with Moscow. Montenegro&#x2019;s NATO accession was rife with Russian threats of &quot;active measures&quot; to stop the longtime Balkan ally from joining the block. In 2016, Montenegrin authorities accused 13 Montenegrins, Serbians, and Russians of planning an armed coup, though those charges were dropped in 2024. During the Battle of Khasham, around 500 pro-Assad forces, including Wagner mercenaries, attacked 40 U.S. Special Forces who had turned a derelict oil refinery into an outpost while fighting ISIS. U.S. airstrikes killed 200-300 members of the Syrian coalition, while taking no casualties.

DarkSide, a ransomware gang believed to be based in Russia, hit the networks behind an oil pipeline that paralyzed energy supplies along the U.S. East Coast. An arms channel between Russia and Iran has for years provided Russian weapons to Iran-backed militant groups ranging from Hezbollah in Lebanon to the Houthis in Yemen, which have at various points targeted U.S bases and embassies as well as Western shipping in the Gulf of Aden. Rockets like Russia&#x2019;s Grad have been particular favorites. Iran, in turn, provides Russia with weapons that it uses to attack Ukraine.

The Russian government reportedly planned to assassinate Armin Paperger, CEO of Rheinmetall, one of the largest weapons makers in Europe, over the firm&#x2019;s supply of weapons to Ukraine.

Ukraine working on alternatives to US intelligence, defense minister says	Ukraine has not yet received detailed information on U.S. intelligence-sharing restrictions but is already exploring alternatives, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on March 6, Interfax-Ukraine reported. &quot;We are already working on alternatives, including requesting (assistance) from Germany if necessary,&quot; Umerov said at a press conference in Berlin, following talks with German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. Washington cut off intelligence-sharing with Kyiv on March 5, following its decision to freeze all military aid to Ukraine as part of an effort to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine on U.S. terms. The intelligence cutoff threatens Ukraine&apos;s ability to track Russian military movements and detect aerial strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Reports suggest the U.S. may have also prohibited allies like the U.K. from passing on intelligence obtained through American sources. U.S. officials have indicated the pause could be temporary and contingent on progress toward peace talks. France has continued to provide military intelligence to Ukraine, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on March 6, according to BFM TV. European leaders are expected to discuss additional support for Ukraine and increased defense spending at an EU summit in Brussels on March 6. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Brussels for the emergency meeting, which was convened to address Europe&apos;s security strategy amid growing concerns over Washington&apos;s shifting foreign policy.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-working-on-alternatives-to-us-intelligence-defense-minister-says/	2025-03-06T09:14:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1648100666-1.jpg
China's envoy calls Trump's treatment of Europe 'appalling'	China&apos;s special envoy for European affairs, Lu Shaye, criticized U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s treatment of European allies, calling it &quot;appalling,&quot; the South China Morning Post reported on March 6. &quot;When you look at how the Trump administration has implemented a brazen and domineering policy toward Europe, treating its allies in this way, honestly, from a European perspective, it&apos;s quite appalling,&quot; Shaye said. The Chinese diplomat also stressed that the Ukraine peace deal should not be dictated solely by the U.S. and Russia, adding that &quot;various proposed solutions should be subject to equal discussion, rather than being dictated by a select few.&quot; Shaye&apos;s comments follow U.S.-Russia talks held in Istanbul on Feb. 27 and an earlier round in Riyadh on Feb. 18, as Washington seeks a swift settlement to the war. The negotiations, which excluded Kyiv and Europe, have raised concerns that the U.S. is sidelining key allies. Trump&apos;s shift in U.S. foreign policy has drawn scrutiny, as he has echoed Kremlin narratives and accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of prolonging the war. Trump has aligned his policy with the Kremlin&apos;s agenda and has so far refused to offer any security guarantees to Ukraine. Washington has also frozen all military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv in an effort to pressure Zelensky into negotiations with Moscow. Beijing has remained a key ally of Moscow throughout the invasion, deepening economic ties and becoming Russia&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods &#x2014; equipment the military uses in its war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinas-envoy-says-trumps-treatment-of-europe-appalling/	2025-03-06T08:39:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2159810856.jpg
The Czech weapons giant replacing the Kalashnikov in Ukraine’s army	The Russian-made Kalashnikov still prevails as the main small arm in Ukraine&#x2019;s military. A Czech weapons giant is setting up shop in Ukraine&#x2019;s factories to change that. The Prague-domiciled conglomerate, Colt CZ, has set up assembly of its Bren 2 assault rifles inside Ukraine under the name &#x201C;Sich&#x201D; &#x2014; the center of life for Zaporizhzhian Cossacks, a historical group of Ukrainian semi-nomadic warriors. The goal, as Colt CZ&#x2019;s head of public sector, Ondrej Bohac, put it, is to &#x201C;get rid of Ukrainian dependence on Soviet weapons, like the AK-47, and not only on the weapons themselves but also on the ammunition, which is still produced mainly in Russia and Belarus.&#x201D; Ukraine does not seem close to running through its old stockpiles of ammunition, but as with the conversion from Soviet 122 and 152 mm artillery to NATO-standard 120 and 155 mm, the transition is a long-term Western turn. The Sich offers swappable components for alternating between Soviet and NATO calibers. Tens of thousands of the assault rifles are already in the hands of Ukrainian soldiers, mostly from Czechia, but they have begun assembly inside of Ukraine. Many international arms giants have announced plans to build their wares inside of Ukraine, ranging from Rheinmetall to Northrop Grumman to Bayraktar. Colt CZ is one of the first to set up production, putting the firm in a relative frontier position. Its experience will be a bellwether for NATO-based weapons manufacturers expanding to Ukraine. Colt CZ began its life as Jihoceska Zbrojovka, or the South Czech Armory, shortly after the First World War and the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Renamed to Ceska Zbrojovka, or Czech Armory, it would go on to survive Nazi occupation and Soviet domination and ultimately an invasion by Warsaw Pact soldiers in 1968. In large part thanks to Ceska Zbrojovka, Czechoslovakia would retain an unusually independent military until the fall of the USSR. Recent years have seen the company expand internationally, most conspicuously in buying the Connecticut-originated Colt brand, the unofficial armory of the American Wild West whose name now sits alongside &#x201C;CZ&#x201D; in the company&#x2019;s title. Today, Colt CZ can assemble 400 of their Bren 2 Siches per day in Ukrainian factories, according to Bohac. Ukraine&#x2019;s state-owned defense conglomerate, UkrOboronProm, announced the start of production in December. Colt CZ product manufacturing. (Colt CZ)The assembly lines are owned and staffed by UkrOboronProm, which, for the time being, is getting components shipped from Colt CZ&#x2019;s original factories. Colt CZ is, in turn, training the Ukrainian staff and leasing out their assembly method. It&#x2019;s an arrangement that is becoming standard for international arms makers looking to set up inside of Ukraine. Many have made announcements of doing so over the past three years, but projects by firms like Rheinmetall or Northrop Grumman, primarily to produce 155 mm artillery ammunition, have stalled out. Colt CZ is among the biggest to have started production, at least partially because the guns are themselves small arms rather than, say, ballistic missiles. The speed of set-up is also thanks to the geographical and political proximity of Ukraine and Czechia&#x2019;s own experience under the Soviet heel. &#x201C;It shows our commitment to support the industry and actually do things and not only talk about them,&#x201D; said Bohac. It has been a complicated road to &#x201C;the integration of our defense-industrial complex with the industrial chain of NATO nations,&#x201D; UkrOboronProm&#x2019;s general director, Oleh Hulyak, said in December. Ukrainians fear giving over their home turf to foreign business. Foreign companies are wary of Ukrainian law, particularly historically lax local intellectual property, or IP, protections. In their absence, foreign brands are loath to leave their inventions in Ukraine, where they risk being stolen and counterfeited, in some cases by UkrOboronProm itself. Ukrainian courts are famously unreliable, and their sentences for IP violations often stop at trivial fines. When asked whether Colt CZ would ever end up fighting for its IP rights in a Ukrainian courtroom, Bohac responded, &#x201C;Hopefully not &#x2014; like any other global company, we always prefer that it&apos;s resolved in a third-country courtroom.&#x201D; The Ukrainian production is starting with just assembly of components manufactured in Colt CZ&#x2019;s factories in Czechia, protecting the process while the assembly line for Bren 2 Sich rifles expands. UkrOboronProm gets a stake in the sale, and the Ukrainian government gets to buy from the home team. &#x201C;It has opened the door to the Ukrainian market because every country prefers to procure from domestic producers,&#x201D; said Bohac. Colt CZ product manufacturing. (Colt CZ)It has been a process of diplomacy for Bohac, himself a former Czech diplomat. The Colt CZ deal is not the first time the Ukrainian military has tried to move its main rifles on to NATO calibers. In 2017, a much-touted rollout of a copy of the American M4 called the WAC-47, which UkrOboronProm announced would have replaceable parts to take both NATO and Kalashnikov-standard ammunition, came to nothing. Bohac declined to identify exactly how many Siches had been produced locally, citing UkrOboronProm&#x2019;s rules, but said that something in the &#x201C;upper tens of thousands&#x201D; are already in Ukrainian hands and &#x201C;tens of thousands should be assembled (in Ukraine) this year.&#x201D; Colt CZ also envisions more component manufacturing in Ukraine and expansion into other weapons, including their P10 pistols and CZ Scorpion Evo 3. Among Colt CZ&#x2019;s latest acquisitions is Sellier &amp; Bellot, another Czech company that&#x2019;s made ammunition for almost 200 years. Sellier &amp; Bellot makes its own machining tools, which are essential to more localized component manufacturing within Ukraine. The plan, said Bohac, is to expand from assembly to component production using those machines. &#x201C;We will provide the IP, the machinery, training, and they will take care of all those components and materials, including the powder,&#x201D; he said. The company also has its eyes on greater global output. Post-war, Colt CZ is envisioning selling from Ukraine to other former Soviet states looking to replace their old rifles. But with the war still raging and export controls still fully up, the immediate market will be strictly Ukrainian. &#x201C;I mean, it&apos;s a beautiful story that we are making here. It&apos;s historical. We hope it will be remembered after decades that Czechia, with international donors through our company, was one of the key forces behind the rearmament of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,&#x201D; said Bohac.

Families of Ukrainian POWs rally outside US Embassy, demand 'all-for-all' exchange before peace deal	Relatives of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) and missing persons held a peaceful rally outside of the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv on March 6, urging Washington to help secure the release of all Ukrainian soldiers and civilians held in Russian captivity. The protest comes as U.S. President Donald Trump pushes for a swift peace deal with Russia that foresees concessions from Kyiv, but not the aggressor state that invaded Ukraine in 2014 and escalated the war in 2022, killing tens of thousands of civilians. Protesters demanded an &quot;all-for-all&quot; prisoner exchange before any peace deal with Russia is signed, Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne reported. Russia and Ukraine have conducted multiple swaps throughout the full-scale war, most recently on Feb. 5, when Ukraine secured the return of 150 POWs. Kyiv has pushed for an all-for-all prisoner exchange since 2024, but Moscow has refused the proposal. Ukraine does not disclose the exact number of its soldiers held in Russian captivity. According to Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets, Moscow holds over 16,000 Ukrainian civilians. Additionally, Russia has forcibly deported more than 19,500 Ukrainian children to Russia, Belarus, or occupied territories.

According to Euronews, the demostrators in Washington protested against Trump&apos;s recent statements on Ukraine and his decision to suspend military aid to Kyiv. The protests come amid escalating tensions between Washington and Kyiv following the contentious Feb. 28 Oval Office meeting between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The talks, originally intended to finalize a U.S.-Ukraine mineral deal, ended in a public dispute, leading to the cancellation of the agreement. Since then, &#xA0;Trump has cut U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv, while some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have intensified criticism of Zelensky, with some suggesting he should resign.	https://kyivindependent.com/families-of-ukrainian-pows-rally-outside-us-embassy-demand-all-for-all-exchange-before-peace-deal/	2025-03-06T07:36:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202969930.jpg
Ukraine's central bank raises key policy rate to 15.5%, warns about foreign policy risks	Ukraine&apos;s National Bank (NBU) will raise the key policy rate from 14.5% to 15.5% per annum starting from March 7, chairman Andrii Pyshnyi said on March 6. The move marks the second raise of the key policy rate since the beginning of 2025. In late January, the central bank raised it from 13.5% to 14.5%. The Ukrainian economy was heavily hit by Russia&apos;s full-scale war. At the start of the invasion, inflation skyrocketed to 26.6% in 2022 from 10.0% in 2021. It subsided the following year, but in 2024, inflation again accelerated to 12%, exceeding NBU&apos;s forecast. According to Pyshnyi, the decision aims to maintain the &quot;attractiveness of savings&quot; in the hryvnia currency, the stability of the foreign exchange market, and keeping expectations under control, which will bring inflation to the 5% target. &quot;The NBU will be ready to take additional measures in case of further risks to price dynamics and inflation expectations,&quot; Pyshnyi said. The NBU raised its key policy rate to 10% in January 2022. It had remained unchanged since the beginning of the all-out war, but on June 3, 2022, the rate grew from 10% to 25%. For over a year, it remained at the same level, dropping to 22% in July 2023 and following a gradual decline. In December 2024, the NBU raised the key policy rate from 13% to 13.5% in response to inflationary developments. The central bank said that the risks &quot;of less favorable foreign economic trends&quot; have increased due to &quot;further geopolitical polarization of countries&quot; and &quot;the corresponding fragmentation of global trade.&quot; The comments come amid seismic geopolitical shifts as the U.S. under President Donald Trump has adopted an increasingly hostile stance toward Ukraine, threatened to impose tariffs against other partners, and floated the idea of deepening an economic partnership with Russia. Although the risks to the sufficiency of international financing remain &quot;balanced,&quot; the amount of external support confirmed for 2025 should be &quot;sufficient&quot; to finance the budget deficit without issuing new debt and &quot;to maintain an adequate level of international reserves,&quot; the statement read. &quot;This will allow the NBU to continue to ensure a stable situation in the foreign exchange market and controllability of inflation and exchange rate expectations,&quot; the central bank said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-central-bank-raises-key-policy-rate-warns-about/	2025-03-06T06:00:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2158010341.jpg
European air forces could protect Ukraine from Russian aerial strikes, experts suggest	Military experts proposed to deploy European air forces to protect Kyiv and other non-front-line Ukrainian cities from Russian aerial attacks, the Guardian reported on March 6, citing the so-called Sky Shield plan. The plan could potentially work as part of the &quot;truce in the sky&quot; proposed by President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier this week, preventing missiles, long-range drones, and bombs from targeting civilian infrastructure. The project&apos;s supporters said it could be a European-led air defense zone involving 120 fighter jets that will operate separately from NATO. According to the plan, developed by former British Air Force planners in cooperation with Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, the protection zone would cover Ukraine&apos;s three operational nuclear power plants, as well as the cities of Odesa and Lviv in Ukraine&apos;s south and west. The country&apos;s east, where the fierce battles are ongoing in Donetsk Oblast, were not included in the zone. According to the authors, this step can be more tangible than the deployment of ground troops as peacekeepers. In February, the Washington Post reported that up to 30,000 European troops could be deployed in the country after a potential ceasefire. Among those who supported the Sky Shield plan are Philip Breedlove, former NATO supreme commander in Europe, Polish ex-President Aleksander Kwasniewski, and Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania&apos;s former foreign minister. European defense ministries have considered the plan, but their leaders have been reluctant to authorize patrolling Ukrainian skies while Russia&apos;s full-scale war is ongoing, the Guardian wrote. In light of the U.S. policy shift and suspension of military aid to Ukraine, the initiative can be revisited, the news outlet noted. Yet, Western partners still fear an escalation if an aircraft from either side is attacked or shot down. Russian forces regularly launch drones and missiles against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, inflicting heavy civilian casualties. A Russian missile strike against a hotel in Kryvyi Rih late on March 5, carried out shortly after the U.S. paused vital intelligence sharing, killed four people and injured over 30. According to figures released by Kyiv, U.N. statistics, and open-source data published by BBC Russia, the total death toll of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers, as well as Ukrainian civilians, stood at over 148,000 as of mid-February.	https://kyivindependent.com/sky-shield-plan/	2025-03-06T05:43:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2169510520.jpg
Poland, Lithuania signal openness to French nuclear deterrence for Europe	Polish and Lithuanian leaders spoke in positive terms on March 6 about French President Emmanuel Macron&apos;s suggestion that Paris could extend its nuclear umbrella to protect European allies. Macron proposed to start &quot;strategic discussions&quot; on the subject as he warned Europe against the Russian threat and stressed that European countries should no longer rely on the U.S. for their security. France is the only EU country with nuclear weapons. &quot;This readiness of France, this is something very promising,&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk told reporters in Brussels on the sidelines of an EU summit. &quot;We have to treat this proposal seriously.&quot; Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda called it a &quot;very interesting idea,&quot; adding that a nuclear umbrella would serve as an effective deterrence against potential Russian aggression. Both Poland and Lithuania lie at NATO&apos;s eastern flank and share a border with Moscow&apos;s ally Belarus and the heavily armed exclave of Kaliningrad, putting them on the front line of a potential NATO-Russia clash. The idea of nuclear sharing with France was also previously floated by Friedrich Merz, who is likely to be Germany&apos;s next chancellor after victory in the February elections. The discussion comes amid mounting uncertainty of the U.S.&apos;s commitment to European security under President Donald Trump. The Trump administration has frozen military aid for Ukraine and signaled that its geopolitical focus will no longer be on the European continent. Washington also seeks to renew its relationship with Moscow, supposedly in an effort to drive it away from China. European leaders are gathering in Brussels to discuss the EU&apos;s need to boost defense spending and support for Ukraine. This involves the European Commission&apos;s ReArm Europe plan that could mobilize up to 800 billion euros ($860 billion) to arm Europe and Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-lithuania-open-to-potential-french-nuclear-deterrence-for-europe/	2025-03-06T05:25:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202961314.jpg
Trump admin to revoke legal status of 240,000 Ukrainian refugees, Reuters reports	The Trump administration is preparing to revoke the temporary legal status of 240,000 Ukrainians who fled to the U.S. from Russia&apos;s invasion, potentially paving the way for their deportation, Reuters reported on March 6, citing four undisclosed sources. The plan predates U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s public spat with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28 and is part of broader efforts to revoke the legal status of more than 1.8 million people staying in the U.S. on humanitarian grounds, the news agency noted. The move, which is expected as soon as April, would nevertheless threaten to further widen the rift between Kyiv and Washington after the U.S. paused military assistance and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. U.S. and Ukrainian officials have not confirmed the claims. Around 5.2 million Ukrainian refugees remain abroad, with the vast majority of them receiving protection in EU countries. Migrants stripped of the humanitarian parole, granted as part of the Biden administration&apos;s programs, could be fast-tracked for deportations, Reuters reported, citing an internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) document. Immigration has been one of the key topics of Trump&apos;s electoral campaign as he pledged to bolster border security and tighten immigration rules. His first days in office were followed by announcements of large-scale deportations of undocumented migrants, though data suggests the rate is comparable to Biden&apos;s years. The Trump administration began rolling back the protection of Ukrainian and other refugees mere days after taking office. The Uniting for Ukraine program, which allowed Ukrainians to stay in the U.S. for up to two years, work, and receive health insurance, was suspended by late January.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-admin-to-revoke-legal-status-of-240-000-ukrainian-refugees-reuters-reports/	2025-03-06T04:41:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1246719706.jpg
US set to abandon partners again as history repeats in Ukraine	Paris in January 1973. Doha in February 2000. Saudi Arabia in February 2025 &#x2014; all peacemaking summits with the same aroma and feel. But there are key differences before we assume the stage is simply being set for another American episode of &quot;cut and run.&quot; After years of promising never to abandon its close ally, Washington did just that with South Vietnam in Paris and the government of Afghanistan in Doha. In both wars, the U.S. had spent years of blood and treasure propping up its ally. In both &quot;peace&quot; processes &#x2014; because a just peace was not the outcome &#x2014; the ally was not even present as Washington negotiated the terms and set the pace of its exit, despite its prior investment. The war in Vietnam cost America 58,000 lives and an estimated $1 trillion in today&#x2019;s money. Afghanistan cost $2 trillion over 20 years, or $300 million per day, and resulted in 3,468 coalition military and 3,917 contractor deaths. This pales in comparison to the extent of local casualties: 600,000 excess deaths in Iraq, 170,000 in Afghanistan, and 3.4 million during America&#x2019;s phase of the war in Vietnam &#x2014; if nothing else, an indicator of commitment on both sides. So far, the war in Ukraine has cost, by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s recent admission, 43,000 military deaths and 198,000 wounded. Russian casualties are estimated at over 800,000, with perhaps a quarter of that number killed. International assistance to Ukraine has topped 267 billion euros, or 90 billion euros annually &#x2014; without counting the hundreds of billions in physical destruction and expected reconstruction costs. In Paris and Doha, the American administration agreed to terms and a timetable to leave the country. There were side assurances to their allies &#x2014; a nudge and a wink to stay the course. Biden made a similar pledge to Ukraine. &quot;You remind us that freedom is priceless; it&#x2019;s worth fighting for as long as it takes. And that&#x2019;s how long we&#x2019;re going to be with you, Mr. President: for as long as it takes,&quot; he told Zelensky in Kyiv on the first anniversary of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in February 2023. In a Truth Social post on Feb. 19, President Donald Trump said: &quot;A modestly successful comedian &#x2026; A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left. In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only &apos;TRUMP&apos; and the Trump Administration can do. Biden never tried, Europe has failed to bring Peace, and Zelenskyy probably wants to keep the &apos;gravy train&apos; going. I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died&#x2026;&quot; Some of Sheehan&#x2019;s &quot;bright, shining lies,&quot; employed by four American administrations from Dwight Eisenhower to Richard Nixon &#x2014; including Nixon&#x2019;s &quot;secret&quot; bombing of Cambodia, which was, of course, no secret if you were Cambodian or Vietnamese &#x2014; would be harder to sustain today, given the relative transparency of modern media. But such lies may now be bolstered by &quot;fake news&quot; narratives. As the Afghanistan Papers, published in 2019, showed, the tendency of U.S. presidential administrations to mislead the American people, and of military officers to go along with failing strategies due to a misplaced &quot;can-do&quot; attitude, seems to be an enduring feature. What also has not changed is the marginalization of the real victims of war &#x2014; both foreign and American &#x2014; and the way leaders default to ducking responsibility. Trump may just be crudely (as is his wont) trying to publicly bully Zelensky into compliance. But this is likely to be a difficult journey, and Trump does not have all the keys. Several traps lie ahead. French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky prepare for a plenary meeting at Lancaster House in London, U.K., on March 2, 2025. (Justin Tallis / Pool / AFP / Getty Images)The first is in his mistake of sidelining Europe, particularly Turkey. Ukraine&#x2019;s geographic position and size as the second-largest country on the European mainland (after Russia) put it at the heart of European security. Unlike Vietnam or Afghanistan &#x2014; where support relied on a flaky domino theory &#x2014; Ukraine&apos;s fate has direct implications for the continent. A second mistake is to overstate American power. While the U.S. military remains the steel backbone of NATO, this is not the Western alliance at Munich in 1938, another ominous parallel that has been replayed. Contrary to his arithmetic, European aid to Ukraine now outstrips that of the United States. Moreover, these figures need to be disaggregated to provide perspective beyond social media hyperbole: Around half of donor support goes to military assistance (much of which is spent by the donors themselves), 44% to financial support, and 7% to humanitarian aid. Relative to the likely costs of Ukrainian collapse, the investment is small &#x2014; so far, too small to stop Russia. Germany, the U.K., and the U.S. have mobilized less than 0.2% of their GDP per year to support Ukraine, while countries like France, Italy, and Spain allocated just 0.1%, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy&#x2019;s Ukraine Support Tracker. &quot;Even small domestic policy priorities are many times more expensive than what is being done for Ukraine,&quot; notes Kiel. Germany&#x2019;s tax subsidies for diesel fuel cost taxpayers three times more per year than Germany&#x2019;s military aid for Ukraine. Other calculations have Ukraine itself already covering 55% of the war&apos;s costs, with Europe and other non-U.S. sources contributing 25%, and Washington 20%. If the U.S. pulls back, that 20% will need to be shared among other players&#x2014;and at least doubled. The potential disconnection of Starlink is more problematic, but at least financially, Europe could compensate. The most notable difference between Ukraine and Afghanistan or South Vietnam is the will to fight. America is not fighting in Ukraine as it did in Afghanistan and Vietnam &#x2014; it is enabling defense. There is no doubting the Ukrainian will to fight. This was epitomized early on by Zelensky&#x2019;s now-famous reply &#x2014; starkly contrasting with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani&#x2019;s weakness in Kabul &#x2014; to an offer of evacuation: &quot;I need ammunition, not a ride.&quot; The lesson of Afghanistan&#x2014;for Afghans and the other allies and coalition partners of the United States&#x2014;was the same as for the South Vietnamese in 1975: Don&#x2019;t trust Washington. America is too big and too self-centered, and as a result, it excludes its allies from its innermost strategic discussions. The fact that allies were never privy to the side deals struck by U.S. negotiator Zalmay Khalilzad with the Taliban is a case in point, just as the South Vietnamese were cut out of Henry Kissinger&#x2019;s deal-making with Hanoi. The vagaries of Western support and the population&#x2019;s tendency toward self-regard pose a significant handicap in foreign policy, especially in terms of stamina. The more unreliable Western support becomes, the greater the political pressures within Ukraine. While this may have a galvanizing effect on the military and peace process, it threatens to fracture Ukraine&apos;s domestic political unity &#x2014; the opposite of what Western supporters desire. Western support for Ukraine is not about charity. It&#x2019;s about upholding international law, protecting democracy, and preventing Russian President Vladimir Putin from resurrecting the Soviet system of brutal imperial rule. Trump&#x2019;s exaggerated language about Ukraine will not be without consequences. It will cost the free world&#x2019;s respect. This is precisely the opposite of the goal the president seeks. It will undermine the perception of American reliability and the principles of mutual benefit. As Singapore&#x2019;s defense minister Ng Eng Hen put it at the recent Munich Security Conference, America&#x2019;s &#x201C;image&#x201D; abroad had &#x201C;changed from liberator to great disruptor to a landlord seeking rent.&#x201D; It undermines long-held principles of international relations, such as sovereignty, from which a slew of other conflicts &#x2014; particularly in Africa with its arbitrary and weak borders &#x2014; could well arise. It could also catalyze a new arms race, especially for nuclear weapons, as nonproliferation, another post-1945 tenet, is now under threat. This process can only accelerate if Trump&#x2019;s actions lead to the collapse of the transatlantic relationship, as represented in NATO, which would suit Putin perfectly. It would also contradict efforts to strengthen international systems that hold governments accountable for war crimes by effectively shutting down legal proceedings against Russian forces. Washington&#x2019;s early moves &#x2014; including its refusal to use the term &#x201C;war of aggression&#x201D; in the G7 statement &#x2014; suggest it is intent on closing down the war crimes issue. While Trump likes to believe that he alone can make a deal, Washington may discover that, based on current trends, Putin is as determined to take over Ukraine as the Taliban were in Afghanistan or Hanoi was with South Vietnam. As such, the West might end up, if Ukraine were to implode, with the worst of all worlds: an alienated and emboldened Russia, and a seething, anti-Western Ukraine forced back within a neo-Soviet fold. The war would likely enter a new, unconventional phase. Ukrainians have learned bitter lessons about entrusting their security to Moscow. Whatever Trump may wish to believe in his quest for a deal, the Western way of life &#x2014; democracy, liberal policy, and the freedom of personal choice &#x2014; would be imperiled if Ukraine falls. If that were to happen as a consequence of his actions (or inaction), Trump would have placed himself firmly on the wrong side of history.

US is destroying world order, Ukraine's ex-commander-in-chief says	The U.S. is destroying the world order as Washington is making overtures to the Kremlin, said on March 6 Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K. Speaking at the Chatham House, Zaluzhnyi said that President Donald Trump&apos;s administration has questioned the unity of &quot;the whole Western world.&quot; &quot;Now Washington is trying to delegate the security issues to Europe without participation of the U.S. so we can say that in the near future, NATO likewise can stop existing,&quot; the ambassador said. According to Zaluzhnyi, Europe can be Russia&apos;s next target. He said that fears of Western partners made it possible for Moscow to start forming &quot;an axis.&quot; &#xA0; The two key Russian allies, Iran and North Korea, supply Russia with weapons that are used against Ukraine. Pyongyang has also sent over 10,000 troops to fight alongside Russian forces in the embattled Kursk Oblast. &quot;We see that it&apos;s not just the axis of evil and Russia trying to revise the world order, but the U.S. is finally destroying this order,&quot; Zaluzhnyi said. &quot;And when those countries of the axis conclude a strategic agreement between themselves, we should have thought maybe this is an attempt to revise the existing world order.&quot; The remarks come amid rising tensions between Kyiv and Washington following a clash in the Oval Office exchange on Feb. 28 between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Trump. The dispute led to the collapse of a bilateral deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, after which the U.S. president paused all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. The move to suspend aid to Ukraine came on top of other Kremlin-friendly steps recently taken by the U.S. The Trump administration has also been considering lifting sanctions imposed against Russia for its brutal all-out war against Ukraine that killed hundreds of thousands.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-destroying-worl-order-zaluzhnyi-says/	2025-03-06T03:47:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2201152416.jpg
Zelensky’s Oval Office berating sends a stark warning to the Middle East	In a dramatic confrontation that has reverberated far beyond Washington, the explosive Oval Office exchange on Feb. 28 between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky represents a broader U.S. foreign policy &#x2014; one that many in the Middle East have long viewed with deep skepticism. The confrontation, which was intended to cement a framework minerals deal linking Ukraine&#x2019;s resource wealth to continued U.S. aid, instead degenerated into a public spectacle marked by Trump&#x2019;s patronizing demands and verbal ultimatums. As the U.S. pressed Ukraine to show gratitude and compromise on its security priorities, critics in the Middle East saw confirmation of America&#x2019;s global arrogance, as Washington sacrificed the interests and dignity of smaller states for its own national benefit. For decades, states like Iran and its regional allies have maintained that American grandstanding comes at the expense of genuine partnership. Afghanistan under Ashraf Ghani, Iraq under Saddam Hussein, Libya under Gaddafi, Egypt under General Morsi, and even Iran under Rouhani have negotiated with the U.S. only for Washington to demonstrate its fickleness. Instead of forging a balanced approach to address Ukraine&#x2019;s security needs amid ongoing Russian aggression, the Trump administration&#x2019;s focus on securing economic concessions &#x2014; specifically, a deal that would have transferred 50% of Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resource revenues to an American-controlled fund &#x2014; exposed an approach that treats allies as bargaining chips. This echoes the capitulations British and French empires once imposed on the Ottoman and Persian empires to extract oil and other raw materials. Of course, this was not the first of Trump&#x2019;s coercive and abrasive policies in his second administration. King Abdullah of Jordan was also treated in a non-diplomatic manner during negotiations over hosting people from Gaza. Middle Eastern leaders, including those who rely on strong international partnerships to navigate complex regional security challenges, can draw a sobering lesson from this: that negotiating with a hegemon often means accepting a subordinate role, where loyalty and gratitude are demanded in exchange for minimal security guarantees. During Trump&#x2019;s first term, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe once attempted to deliver a message from Trump to Iran &#x2014; a gesture that the Iranian Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, unequivocally rejected, declaring that a U.S. leader of Trump&#x2019;s ilk did not deserve any form of communication with Iran. At that time, Khamenei&#x2019;s refusal was widely criticized within certain segments of the Iranian government and society, with detractors arguing that his anti-American ideology was an impediment to resolving longstanding issues with the United States. However, in light of Trump&#x2019;s recent humiliating exchanges with Ukraine and Jordan, those very critics have dramatically reversed their stance. Today, many voices in Iran and its regional circles are lauding Khamenei for his steadfast rejection of American overtures, viewing his decision as a robust defense against what they perceive as America&#x2019;s &#x201C;global arrogance.&#x201D; They contend that making further concessions to the U.S. would only serve to exacerbate Iran&#x2019;s vulnerability, reinforcing the belief that genuine problem-solving in international relations must prioritize sovereign dignity over transactional appeasement. This incident also underscores the inherent risks in alliances where power dynamics are unbalanced. In the heated Oval Office, Vice President JD Vance&#x2019;s curt remark &#x2014; &#x201C;Have you said &apos;thank you&apos; once?&#x201D; &#x2014; was not simply an offhand criticism; it symbolized a broader expectation that smaller partners must publicly affirm their indebtedness to the U.S. regardless of their own strategic imperatives. For Middle Eastern states, especially Israel &#x2014; a nation that has long balanced a unique security partnership with Washington &#x2014; this scenario offers a cautionary tale. When a powerful ally imposes its own agenda and demands visible signs of subservience, the smaller partner&#x2019;s strategic autonomy is inevitably compromised. The berating treatment suffered by Zelensky, broadcast live on global media, serves as a warning that in dealings with a country that prioritizes its own interests above all, even a stalwart leader may find himself forced into a position that undermines both national pride and strategic bargaining power. Moreover, the fallout from the meeting has already begun to reshape international diplomatic calculations. European allies, alarmed by Washington&#x2019;s apparent willingness to engage in a high-stakes power play at the expense of a key ally, have expressed concerns that such behavior could destabilize collective security frameworks. Many rockets fired from Iran are seen over Jerusalem from Hebron, West Bank, on Oct. 1, 2024. (Wisam Hashlamoun/Anadolu via Getty Images)For Israel and other Middle Eastern nations, the situation presents an opportunity to reevaluate the dynamics of their own alliances with global powers. It reinforces the need for diversification in diplomatic engagements and a cautious approach toward any bilateral arrangement that might leave them vulnerable to coercive tactics. Instead of relying solely on U.S. backing, regional states might explore strengthening multilateral institutions or forging independent strategic partnerships that allow for more equitable negotiations &#x2014; an approach that has long been advocated by critics of American foreign policy in the region. Finally, this episode raises broader questions about the nature of modern geopolitics and the balance between national interest and alliance solidarity. The public debacle in the Oval Office is not merely a clash of personalities; it is a reflection of an enduring principle in international relations that many in the Middle East have always warned about: powerful nations often view alliances through the prism of transactional benefit rather than mutual respect. For Israel, which has historically benefited from American support yet sometimes chafed under its conditions, the events of Feb. 28 serve as a critical reminder to safeguard its own strategic autonomy. In an era marked by shifting global power balances, regional states must remain vigilant and assertive in defining the terms of their cooperation. The humiliation of a leader like Zelensky should not be taken as a precedent to follow, but rather as an impetus to demand a more balanced, reciprocal form of engagement &#x2014; one that recognizes the intrinsic worth and sovereignty of all partners, regardless of size. Ultimately, this catastrophe exposes a critical flaw in U.S. diplomatic rhetoric that Middle Eastern states, including Israel, must heed. If Washington continues to employ aggressive, self-serving language that reduces alliances to transactional power plays, it risks alienating vital partners in the region &#x2014; partners like Saudi Arabia, Israel, and even Iran, which are increasingly gravitating toward China for a more balanced approach. Such rhetoric not only humiliates key leaders like Zelensky, but also reinforces a dangerous narrative that only military might can prevent the humiliation and destruction of Middle Eastern nations. This perception, in turn, fuels an already volatile arms race and may even accelerate nuclear proliferation in countries like Iran. As a policy imperative, the U.S. must recalibrate its diplomatic tone and adopt a more inclusive, respectful strategy that prioritizes mutual benefit and long-term stability over short-term economic gain. Failing to do so will not only weaken U.S. credibility but also reshape the geopolitical landscape in a manner that could leave American interests increasingly isolated.

Zelensky arrives in Brussels for EU summit	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Brussels on March 6 to attend an emergency EU summit, which was called to discuss further support for Ukraine and Europe&apos;s efforts to boost its own defense capabilities. The meeting comes amid seismic geopolitical shifts as U.S. President Donald Trump cut off military aid for Ukraine while renewing ties with Moscow, casting doubt on his commitment to Kyiv&apos;s and Europe&apos;s security.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-arrives-in-brussels-for-eu-summit/	2025-03-06T02:58:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156503093.jpg
Arsen Zhumadilov officially appointed as new Defense Procurement Agency head	Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry officially appointed Arsen Zhumadilov as the new head of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) on March 6, said the agency responsible for weapons purchases for the military. At the same time, Zhumadilov resigned as chief of the State Rear Operator (DOT), a sister agency overseeing the procurement of non-lethal supplies for the Armed Forces. Andrii Sozanskyi, DOT&apos;s executive director, replaced him as acting director. The defense procurement sector was reshaped in December 2023, aiming to meet NATO standards. The DPA, first established in August 2022, was to focus solely on lethal aid. Meanwhile, the DOT was formed to purchase non-lethal aid such as food and clothing. &quot;The Defense Ministry should work more efficiently. There are very high expectations from everyone involved in the defense sector. Changes are objectively overdue and perhaps overripe. We all have no time to delay any longer,&quot; Zhumadilov said. The official appointment came more than a month after the scandal in procurement agencies. In late January, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov refused to extend the contract with the former DPA director Maryna Bezrukova for another year over supposedly poor performance, defying the DPA Supervisory Board&apos;s decision. According to Bezrukova, Umerov&apos;s move caused a &quot;legal conflict&quot; inside the organization, reportedly blocking its procurement functions. At the same time, the minister appointed Zhumadilov, who also runs the DOT, as interim director-general of the DPA. One of NATO and European partners&apos; requirements for Ukraine was the establishment of two agencies that would be directly responsible for procurement for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, not through the Defense Ministry or contractors. According to Ukrainian law, supervisory boards can hire and fire the heads of state enterprises unilaterally. This means that legally, after the board&apos;s vote, Bezrukova should have taken over the DPA for another year. However, the Defense Ministry, which oversees the DPA, amended the agency&apos;s charter so the ministry can reverse the supervisory board&apos;s decisions. Ukraine&apos;s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) is investigating possible abuses of power by Umerov.	https://kyivindependent.com/arsen-zhumadilov-appointed-as/	2025-03-06T02:51:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1861129611.jpg
Poroshenko, Tymoshenko confirm 'public' contacts with allies but reaffirm opposition to elections during war	Ex-President Petro Poroshenko&apos;s team works &quot;publicly and transparently&quot; with U.S. partners to ensure bipartisan support for Ukraine, Poroshenko said on March 6, reiterating his opposition to elections during the war. His comments came in reaction to Politico&apos;s article, which claimed that U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s team has been leading secret talks with Poroshenko and another opposition leader, Yuliia Tymoshenko, as Washington ramps up pressure against President Volodymyr Zelensky. Tymoshenko also reacted to the story, saying that her party, Batkivshchyna, is negotiating with &quot;our allies who can help secure a just and peaceful solution as soon as possible. &quot; She reaffirmed that elections are possible only after the war ends. Trump&apos;s push for a quick settlement of the Russia-Ukraine war saw him adopt Moscow-aligned positions while pressuring Kyiv by cutting off crucial military aid and intelligence sharing. In recent weeks, the White House has echoed the Kremlin&apos;s false narrative about Zelensky&apos;s illegitimacy, referring to the fact that Ukraine did not hold elections last year. The Ukrainian Constitution does not permit elections under martial law, and critics pointed out difficulties in organizing elections during an all-out war, such as the possibility of voting for front-line soldiers and refugees. According to Ukraine&apos;s former president, his team&apos;s talks with U.S. partners focused on security and a peace through strength approach, including the provision of weapons, intelligence, sanctions, and transatlantic unity. At the same time, Poroshenko criticized the supposed lack of communication between Zelensky&apos;s team and the U.S. government. &quot;Ukraine &#x2014; and President Zelensky said this clearly &#x2014; is ready for talks to end the war under strong leadership of President Trump,&quot; Tymoshenko said on Facebook. According to Politico, senior members of Poroshenko&apos;s European Solidarity party and Tymoshenko have been in contact with four members of Trump&apos;s team. The two opposition leaders reportedly tried to position themselves as more flexible partners for the U.S. than Zelensky. Trump falsely claimed last month that Zelensky&apos;s approval rating has dropped to 4%. While Zelensky&apos;s popularity was steadily declining throughout 2024, the mounting pressure from Washington seemed to have boosted his support. According to a survey by the British pollster Survation, carried out between Feb. 25 and 27, Zelensky leads in the polls with 44%. He is followed by former Commander-in-Chief and Ambassador to the U.K. Valerii Zaluhnyi &#x2014; who has not publicly confirmed presidential ambitions &#x2014; at 21%. Poroshenko came third with 10%, while Tymoshenko scored only 6%, signalling slim chances of beating Zelensky in the election.	https://kyivindependent.com/poroshenko-tymoshenko-reaffirm-opposition-to-elections-under-martial-law-after-claims-of-us-contacts/	2025-03-06T02:42:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1187267913.jpg
Romania expels 2 Russian diplomats in connection to Georgescu's case, media reports	Romania said on March 5 that it had expelled Russian military attache Victor Makovskiy and his deputy, Evgeny Ignatiev, for breaching diplomatic rules of conduct. &quot;It is an exceptional measure... It is not a measure taken easily, and it is taken when the breaches are grave,&quot; Romanian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Andrei Tarnea told Euronews. The decision was communicated to the Russian side, which promised an &quot;appropriate response.&quot; Undisclosed sources told Euronews that the move was connected to the campaign of Romania&apos;s pro-Russian presidential candidate, Calin Georgescu. The far-right politician, who won the first round of a November vote that was later annuled, was detained last month as he faces criminal investigation on suspicions of misreporting his campaign&apos;s finances and promoting war criminals and fascist organisations. Georgesu surged to first place in the November vote with almost 23% despite being seen as a marginal and largely unknown candidate. He was expected to face pro-EU Elena Lasconi in the second round, but Romania&apos;s Constitutional Court annuled the results after a declassified intelligence report pointed to extensive Russian interference in the elections. Georgescu&apos;s surge in popularity was also connected to a massive campaign on the TikTok social media platform shortly before the vote. He remains the front-runner for the rescheduled vote in May. The politician has praised Romania&apos;s World War II fascist leader Ion Antonescu and Russian President Vladimir Putin and proposed a post-war partition of Ukraine. Annulled elections have come to the attention of the Trump administration in the U.S., which has lambasted Romania for the decision as Washington adopts increasingly hostile rhetoric toward its European partners.	https://kyivindependent.com/romania-expels-2-russian-diplomats-in-connection-to-georgescus-case-media-reports/	2025-03-06T02:08:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Romania-Embassy.jpg
US intelligence sharing pause affects Russian aerial strikes warnings, NYT reports	The U.S. pause on sharing intelligence with Kyiv affects warnings against Russian drones and missiles striking Ukrainian military and civilian targets, the New York Times reported on March 5, citing undisclosed U.S. and Ukrainian officials. The U.S. stopped sharing intelligence with Ukraine on March 5, shortly after it froze all military assistance as part of an effort to pressure Kyiv into quick negotiations with Russia. Russian forces regularly launch drones and missiles against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, inflicting heavy civilian casualties. A Russian missile strike against a hotel in Kryvyi Rih late on March 5, carried out shortly after the intelligence sharing pause, killed four people and injured at least 30. According to figures released by Kyiv, U.N. statistics, and open-source data published by BBC Russia, the total death toll of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers, as well as Ukrainian civilians, stood at over 148,000 as of mid-February. A senior Ukrainian official told the NYT that the pause in intelligence sharing would make it more difficult for Ukrainian forces to strike Russian targets. Kyiv still has access to other satellite imagery, they added. Valerii Kondratiuk, the former Ukraine&apos;s spy chief, said that intelligence sharing is concerned primarily with the exchange of satellite images. While European companies have their own satellites, they are not focused on military movements, he added. Some unnamed U.S. officials voiced hope that any pause in intelligence sharing would be short and have little practical impact. A senior Trump administration official told the NYT the original plan was to suspend military and intelligence sharing for a week or two as part of a campaign to put pressure on President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to the NYT, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has a &quot;sizable presence&quot; in Ukraine, with some of its officers deployed in the country to help Ukraine with targeting. The CIA has also helped set up at least three secret signals intelligence collection bases that Ukraine uses to intercept Russian communications to reduce their reliance on U.S. intelligence, the newspaper reported. The conflict between Kyiv and Washington has been simmering for weeks as U.S. President Donald Trump adopted increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Zelensky while intensifying diplomatic outreach to Moscow. The most explosive episode came on Feb. 28, when Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance publicly berated Zelensky in the Oval Office, derailing plans for the signing of a minerals agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/u-s-intelligence-sharing-pause-affects-warnings-russian-strikes-on-ukraine-nyt-reports/	2025-03-06T01:27:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2092457114.jpg
Russia formally appoints new ambassador to US	Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on March 6 appointing Alexander Darchiev as Russia&apos;s new ambassador to Washington. Darchiev, a veteran diplomat with a half-decade of experience in Washington, previously served as Russia&apos;s ambassador to Canada from 2014 to 2021 and later as the director of the North American Department at the Russian Foreign Ministry. The U.S. approved his appointment last month amid renewed diplomatic engagement between the U.S. and Russia. A Russian delegation met U.S. officials in Istanbul on Feb. 27 for a second round of talks, following an initial meeting in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. While the first meeting reportedly focused on Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine, the second round did not include discussions on the war, a U.S. State Department spokesperson confirmed. According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the Istanbul discussions centered on embassy operations. The previous Russian ambassador to the U.S., Anatoly Antonov, was dismissed from his post on Oct. 10, 2024. Under former U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration, the U.S. had largely severed official diplomatic contacts with Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s return to office has shifted U.S. foreign policy. His administration engages more directly with Moscow while adopting a more critical stance toward Ukraine. Trump has also paused military and intelligence sharing with Kyiv to pressure Ukraine to enter peace talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-formally-appoints-new-ambassador-to-us/	2025-03-06T01:03:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2175606823.jpg
France providing intelligence to Ukraine, minister assures after US freeze	France is providing military intelligence to Ukraine, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said after the U.S. halted intelligence sharing with Kyiv, the BFM TV channel reported on March 6. &quot;We have intelligence resources that we are providing to the Ukrainians,&quot; Lecornu said on air on France Inter. The U.S. stopped sharing intelligence with Ukraine on March 5, shortly after it froze all military assistance as part of an effort to pressure Kyiv into quick negotiations with Russia. The decision potentially threatens Ukraine&apos;s ability to strike Russian forces but also detect Russia&apos;s aerial strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Some media suggested that Washington also banned its partners, like the U.K., from sharing U.S.-obtained intelligence with Ukraine. U.S. officials signaled that the pause may be temporary and will depend on progress toward peace talks. Speaking on France Inter, Lecornu also said that French President Emmanuel Macron instructed him to &quot;accelerate the delivery of French aid packages (for Ukraine) to compensate for U.S. aid that no longer arrives.&quot; European countries are expected to step up support amid uncertainties about the Trump administration&apos;s commitment to Ukraine&apos;s and Europe&apos;s security. European assistance for Kyiv and the need for greater defense spending will be discussed during an EU summit in Brussels later on March 6. The conflict between Kyiv and Washington has been simmering for weeks as U.S. President Donald Trump adopted increasingly hostile rhetoric toward President Volodymyr Zelensky while intensifying diplomatic outreach to Moscow. The most explosive episode came on Feb. 28, when Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance publicly berated Zelensky in the Oval Office, derailing plans for the signing of a minerals agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-providing-intelligence-to-ukraine-minister-assures-after-us-freeze/	2025-03-06T00:43:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/France-minister.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill at least 8, injure 39 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed at least eight people and injured 39 others over the past day, regional authorities said on March 6. Ukrainian forces downed 68 out of the 112 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, as well as two ballistic missiles of either the Iskander-M or the North Korean KN-23 model launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Forty-three drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are usually decoys. Russia launches them alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. Russian forces struck a hotel in Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast with a missile overnight, killing four people and injuring at least 30, including a child. A search and rescue operation is ongoing as of 9:40 am local time. The missile strike also damaged 14 apartment buildings, a post office, almost two dozen cars, a cultural center, and 12 shops, the governor said. A Russian drone strike on the city of Sumy killed one person, according to the Sumy regional military administration. Two people suffered injuries as a result of a drone attack on Odesa Oblast, Governor Oleh Kiper said. Russian forces destroyed two houses and targeted an energy facility, he added. One person was killed in the village of Novoolenivka in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Two more people were injured in the region over the past day. A Russian drone attack near the town of Derhachi in Kharkiv Oblast set fire to a house and a car, killing a man and injuring a woman, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 27 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. One person was killed and four others injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-6/	2025-03-06T00:21:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-06_08-24-20.jpg
Lithuania exits Convention on Cluster Munitions	Lithuania formally withdrew on March 6 from the Convention on Cluster Munitions, an international treaty that bans the production and distribution of this controversial weaponry. The Lithuanian parliament voted to exit the treaty last July, leading to Vilnius submitting documents for withdrawal in the autumn of that year. The six-month deadline for leaving the convention expired on March 6. Cluster munitions, weapons that disperse hundreds of smaller &quot;bomblets&quot; in a wide area upon impact, have seen extensive use during Russia&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine. Russian forces have repeatedly deployed this weapon in civilian areas. The U.S. began providing Ukraine with cluster munitions in the summer of 2023, provided they are used outside of populated zones against Russian forces in the occupied territories of Ukraine. Ukraine, Russia, and the U.S. are not parties to the convention, which includes over 110 countries worldwide. The weaponry is seen as posing a risk to civilians as some of the bomblets often fail to explode, presenting danger to local populations for years after the war. Lithuania, which lies at NATO&apos;s eastern flank and borders Russia&apos;s ally Belarus and the heavily armed exclave of Kaliningrad, argued that it requires all possible means to deter potential aggression, especially since Russia uses the weaponry as well, the LRT broadcaster reported. Lithuanian officials pledged to minimize potential risks by implementing algorithms that would prevent the munitions from failing to detonate. The Baltic country is also examining alternatives to cluster munitions but sees the withdrawal from the treaty as a strategic message to potential opponents. Vilnius is also mulling a withdrawal from the Ottawa Treaty banning anti-personnel mines. &quot;I think that we will have the final decision in the spring,&quot; Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene said regarding the treaty on land mines.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-exits-convention-on-cluster-munitions/	2025-03-05T23:36:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/cluster.jpg
Rubio labels Russia's all-out war against Ukraine 'proxy war' between Washington, Moscow	Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine is a &quot;proxy war&quot; between Moscow and Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview with Fox News on March 5. Rubio&apos;s remarks underscore how the Trump administration steadily adopts Kremlin narratives. Previously, Russian President Vladimir Putin falsely claimed the West is fighting Russia &quot;with the hands of Ukrainians.&quot; After Russia failed to take over Ukraine within days and suffered several defeats in 2022, the Kremlin began to push the false claim that Russia was at war with NATO. Western partners have been providing Kyiv with weapons since the beginning of the all-out war but have never sent troops to Ukraine, fearing escalation. The U.S. has now frozen all military assistance to Ukraine as the rift between Kyiv and Washington widens. According to Rubio, U.S. President Donald Trump sees the all-out war against Ukraine as &quot;a protracted, stalemated conflict.&quot; &quot;And frankly, it&#x2019;s a proxy war between nuclear powers &#x2014; the United States, helping Ukraine, and Russia &#x2013; and it needs to come to an end,&quot; Rubio said. The secretary of state said that continuing to give Ukraine weapons &quot;as much as they need for as long as it takes&quot; &#xA0;is &quot;not a strategy.&quot; Speaking about the clash between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Trump in the Oval Office last week, Rubio said that Washington wants to engage both Russia and Ukraine in resolving the war and &quot;we asked the Ukrainians not to sabotage it.&quot; He blamed Ukraine&apos;s president, who answered to U.S. Vice President JD Vance&apos;s comments, for &quot;undermining&quot; Trump&apos;s plan. &quot;(To find a way to end the conflict) is going to require concessions from both sides, but we have to get them both to the table. &#xA0;The Ukrainians have to be there, obviously. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s their country. &#xA0;The Russians have to be at that table,&quot; Rubio said.	https://kyivindependent.com/rubio-labels-russias-all-out-war-against-ukraine-proxy-war-between-washington-moscow/	2025-03-05T23:23:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193483462.jpg
Trump's team leads private talks with Zelensky's political rivals, Politico reports	Four senior members of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s team held secret discussions with political opponents of President Volodymyr Zelensky, Politico reported on March 6, citing three undisclosed Ukrainian lawmakers and a Republican foreign policy expert. Trump&apos;s allies reportedly held talks with Yuliia Tymoshenko, a former prime minister and head of the opposition Batkivshchyna (Fatherland) party, and high-ranking members of the European Solidarity party of ex-President Petro Poroshenko. The news comes after Trump lambasted Zelensky as a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; and publicly berated him in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, underscoring the growing pressure against the Ukrainian president from Washington. Trump&apos;s push for a quick settlement of the Russia-Ukraine war saw him adopt Moscow-aligned positions while pressuring Kyiv by cutting off crucial military aid and intelligence sharing. In recent weeks, the White House has echoed the Kremlin&apos;s false narrative about Zelensky&apos;s illegitimacy, referring to the fact that Ukraine did not hold elections last year. The Ukrainian Constitution does not permit elections under martial law, and critics pointed out difficulties in organizing elections during an all-out war, such as the possibility of voting for front-line soldiers and refugees. Trump also falsely claimed last month that Zelensky&apos;s approval rating has dropped to 4%. While Zelensky&apos;s popularity was steadily declining throughout 2024, the White House fallout and mounting pressure from Washington seem to have boosted his support. According to a survey by the British pollster Survation, carried out between Feb. 25 and 27, Zelensky leads in the polls with 44%. He is followed by former Commander-in-Chief and Ambassador to the U.K. Valerii Zaluhnyi &#x2014; who has not publicly confirmed presidential ambitions &#x2014; at 21%. Poroshenko came third with 10%, while Tymoshenko scored only 6%, signalling slim chances of beating Zelensky in the election. After the televised quarrel last week between Zelensky, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance, several top U.S. officials publicly suggested that Ukraine&apos;s president should step down if he is not &quot;ready for peace.&quot; While Tymoshenko and Poroshenko publicly spoke out against holding elections under martial law, Politico reported that they are positioning themselves as more flexible partners for the U.S. than Zelensky. When approached by the outlet, their parties did not confirm talks with the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-team-leads-private-talks-with-zelenskys-political-rivals-politico-reports/	2025-03-05T22:43:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2182521921.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 881,800 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 881,800 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on March 6. This number includes 1,140 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day.

Polish official warns of international crisis if US cuts Ukraine from Starlink	Canceling Starlink access for Ukraine would lead to an international crisis between Poland and the U.S., Polish Deputy Prime Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski said on March 5. Poland helps Ukraine maintain its Starlink access and has provided half of all its terminals, totaling over 20,000 terminals since 2022. Starlink satellite internet access plays a crucial role in Ukraine&apos;s civilian and military communications infrastructure. Canceling Poland&apos;s Starlink contracts that provide Ukraine with internet access would be &quot;a big international relations crisis,&quot; Gawkowski said. &quot;I cannot imagine a situation in which a business relation between Poland and a U.S. company would be suddenly interrupted,&quot; Gawkowski said. Gawkowski&apos;s comments follow media reports that the U.S. has threatened to cut Ukraine&apos;s Starlink access unless Kyiv agrees to a critical minerals deal with Washington. Starlink is owned by SpaceX, a company belonging to billionaire Elon Musk. Musk has denied these reports. If Musk were to cut off Ukraine&apos;s Starlink access, Gawkowski said, he would be effectively terminating a corporate contract with an EU nation. Poland and the EU are currently trying to diversify satellite internet access provided to Ukraine, Gawkowski continued. The EU is considering the Paris-based satellite communications company &quot;Eutelsat&quot; to provide satellite internet access to Ukraine&apos;s army. &quot;Poland is maintaining it, Poland purchased Starlink and transferred it to Ukraine. Poland ensures security by paying the subscription fees. I cannot imagine any American corporation violating such agreements,&quot; Gawkowski said on Feb. 25. Musk, a key ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, has drawn scrutiny at home and abroad over his ties to Russia and repeated inflammatory comments regarding Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-official-warns-of-international-crisis-between-poland-us-if-ukraine-cut-from-starlink/	2025-03-05T22:06:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2170729615.jpg
Canada ready to join Ukraine peacekeeping mission with US backing, defense minister says	Canada is ready to partake in a potential peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, provided the United States offers security guarantees, Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair said on March 5. European countries, led mainly by the U.K. and France, are developing a coalition of the willing to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Various countries including Ireland have voiced their willingness to partake in such a mission. &quot;Canada is ready and able to make a contribution to that force,&quot; Blair said on March 5 during a defense conference in Ottawa. &quot;But we also believe that there&apos;s important discussions that need to take place with respect to security guarantees for Ukraine and for the forces that would serve in Ukraine.&quot; Blair also said that for a coalition of peacekeepers to be effective, the U.S. must support the initiative with security assurances. &quot;We&apos;ve strongly indicated we&apos;re willing to be a part of that, but I still believe it is going to require security guarantees from the United States,&quot; Blair said. Blair&apos;s comments echo those of other Western leaders, including U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has urged Washington to provide a &quot;backstop&quot; for a European-led peacekeeping force. The U.S. has thus far welcomed the idea of European peacekeeping troops monitoring a potential ceasefire in Ukraine but has fallen short of offering concrete security guarantees. Along with Canada, other non-European countries, including Turkey, have signaled willingness to join a future peacekeeping coalition in Ukraine. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on March 3 that Australia is open to contributing to a joint force. &quot;There is a discussion at the moment about potential peacekeeping, and from my government perspective, we are open to consideration of any proposals going forward ... We want to see peace in Ukraine, but we want to make sure that the illegal, immoral actions of Russia are not rewarded,&quot; Albanese said. The Kremlin has consistently maintained that it will not accept Western troops on the ground in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/canada-voices-willingness-to-partake-in-ukraine-peacekeeping-mission/	2025-03-05T20:54:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2002538371.jpg
EU prepares for new wave of Ukrainian refugees amid Trump uncertainty, Politico reports	EU leaders are discussing how to handle a potential renewed wave of refugees from Ukraine in the face of uncertainty in U.S. policy and Russia&apos;s ongoing offensives, Politico reported on March 5. Following a heated argument between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28 the White House suspended U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. Trump has repeatedly failed to condemn Russia, stirring panic in Europe. Czechia, Germany, and Poland host the most Ukrainian refugees. EU officials are now debating if there should be a more equal distribution among EU member states in the event of a new wave of refugees, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said on March 5. &quot;If (Russian President Vladimir) Putin escalates this war even further and the American support should disappear, and if this should lead to a larger refugee movement ... we need a binding distribution of the Ukraine refugees throughout the EU, according to a fair mechanism,&quot; Faeser said. European officials do not necessarily expect another large influx of refugees from Ukraine. Regardless, geopolitical uncertainty has prompted dialogue among European authorities on how to respond to a potential influx, Faeser told reporters. Germany will stand with Kyiv &quot;(a)s long as Putin&apos;s terrible attack against Ukraine continues,&quot; she said. Around 5.2 million Ukrainian refugees remain abroad and about 4.2 million reside in the EU. The share of Ukrainian refugees who want to return home dropped from 74% in December 2022 to 43% by the end of 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-officials-prepare-for-new-wave-of-ukrainian-refugees-amid-trump-uncertainty-politico-reports/	2025-03-05T19:10:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1239784826.jpg
Stop being Putin's ho' — US congresswoman lambasts Trump speech	U.S. President Donald Trump needs to stop appeasing Russian President Vladimir Putin, Representative Jasmine Crockett said in response to Trump&apos;s congressional address on March 4. Crockett, a Democrat, was asked by the digital media organization Call to Activism to share &#xA0;what she would like to say to Trump following his speech. &quot;I would tell him to grow a spine and stop being Putin&apos;s ho,&quot; she said. Crockett&apos;s remarks come amid a series of disastrous upheavals in U.S.-Ukraine relations, beginning with Trump kicking President Volodymyr Zelensky out of the White House on Feb. 28 and culminating in Washington&apos;s freeze on military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv. The Kremlin has hailed these developments, saying they align with Moscow&apos;s interests. Trump &quot;is out here really doing the bidding of Russia in a way we&apos;ve never seen an American president do,&quot; Crockett said. She went on to denounce Trump&apos;s treatment of Zelensky, calling their White House meeting a &quot;disgrace.&quot; &quot;We need a president that understands what diplomacy looks like, and it doesn&apos;t look like the disgrace that we saw that took place in the Oval Office.&quot; Ahead of Trump&apos;s address, other leading Democrats in the House and Senate issued a statement warning that the administration&apos;s ties with Russia were a threat to U.S. security interests. &quot;Trump has shown more alignment with Vladimir Putin, who threatens the international rules-based order, than with our long-standing partners and allies,&quot; congressmembers serving on military, intelligence, and foreign policy committees wrote. During his speech, Trump was vague about the decision to halt all military aid to Ukraine. He read out a recent statement from Zelensky expressing Ukraine&apos;s readiness for a peace agreement, framing it as a diplomacy win for his administration. He also claimed Russia had sent &quot;strong signals&quot; that they were ready to make a deal. The freeze on military support to Ukraine remains in place despite Zelensky&apos;s statement. U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said on March 5 that Trump may resume aid deliveries once Ukraine makes further steps towards peace talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/stop-being-putins-h-us-congresswoman-lambasts-trump-speech/	2025-03-05T18:51:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202138194.jpg
Netherlands to provide Ukraine with $3.8 billion in support in 2026	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. The Netherlands will provide Ukraine with 3.5 billion euros ($3.8 billion) in combined government support in 2026, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof announced on March 5. Schoof added that $700 million will be earmarked for Kyiv to invest in drone production. The details were provided on exactly where and what supports the additional funding would be disbursed to. Schoof, who spoke to President Volodymyr Zelensky on the phone on March 5, wrote on X that &quot;the Netherlands will keep backing Ukraine in its struggle against Russian aggression,&quot; including &quot;political, military, financial and moral support.&quot; Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, the Netherlands has provided Kyiv with a combined 7.33 billion euros ($7.87 billion) in support, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. In addition to the aid funding, the Dutch government has provided Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets, having committed 24 aircraft in the summer of 2024. President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed on Feb. 22 that Ukraine anticipates continued deliveries of F-16 fighter jets from the Netherlands in the immediate future.	https://kyivindependent.com/netherlands-to-provide-ukraine-with-3-8-billion-in-2026/	2025-03-05T16:00:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/gettyimages-2182692851-612x612.jpg
US Supreme Court rules judge can force Trump administration to un-freeze remaining foreign aid funding	The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on March 5 the Trump administration must adhere to a lower court ruling that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) restart payments worth nearly $2 billion for the remaining USAID projects. The split 5-4 decision did not explain the reasoning for its decision, nor did it provide a timeline as to when the payments must restart, but did note that &quot;feasibility of any compliance timelines&quot; must be considered. U.S. District Judge Amir Ali, who ordered the initial payments, must now provide clarity on the foreign aid&apos;s release. The ruling does not apply to the Trump administration&apos;s decision to terminate over 90% of the USAID foreign aid contracts that cuts $60 billion in foreign assistance. The cuts will include 5,800 of 6,200 USAID contracts, purportedly saving $54 billion, and 4,100 of 9,100 State Department grants, for a cut of $4.4 billion, Politico reported. Multiple global health groups challenged the Trump administration&apos;s cuts to foreign aid for work already completed until Feb. 13. The White House initially appeared as though they would not comply with the court order but eventually appealed the decision. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration initally halted almost all foreign aid for 90 days for a review amid efforts to shutter the aid agency and merge it under the State Department. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support to Kyiv. The agency has funded school reconstruction, bomb shelters, critical energy repairs, and civil society initiatives. The White House has accused the agency of pushing a &quot;liberal agenda&quot; and widespread waste, despite foreign aid making up just 1% of the federal budget. USAID cuts not only marked a significant realignment of U.S. foreign policy but also threatened various Ukrainian organizations and projects across multiple sectors reliant on U.S. funding. Ukraine is in talks with private and EU partners to replace funding sources for key projects in energy infrastructure, veterans&apos; affairs, and more.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-supreme-court-rules-judge-can-force-trump-administration-to-un-freeze-remaining-foreign-aid/	2025-03-05T14:34:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/gettyimages-2202300988-612x612.jpg
Russian missile attack on hotel in Kryvyi Rih kills 2, injures 14	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russian forces struck a hotel in Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast with a missile on March 5, killing two people and injuring 14, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine reported. The missile struck the five-storey hotel around 10 p.m. local time, killing a 53-year-old man, as well as one other victim. No additional information was provided on the identities of the deceased. Seven of the injured victims are currently listed as being in serious condition, while other remain in moderate condition, Suspilne reported.

Macron open to extending France's nuclear protection to European allies amid threat from Russia	During a televised address to his nation on March 5, French President Emmanuel Macron said he was open to extending France&apos;s nuclear umbrella to protect European allies. &quot;I have decided to start strategic discussions on the defense of the entire continent with our nuclear weapons. The decision will depend on the heads and commanders-in-chief of European countries,&quot; Macron said. The remarks come amid ongoing Russian aggression on the European continent that extends beyond Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russia has been accused of waging a proxy war with Europe, having been alleged of numerous incidents of Russian sabotage on the continent. &quot;The threat from Russia extends to the whole of Europe,&quot; Macron said. &quot;This aggressiveness seems far away, but it is very close. Russia is interfering in our elections, spreading propaganda everywhere.&quot; France and the United Kingdom are the only two European nations that possess a nuclear arsenal. Macron added that a final decision on the matter would ultimately rest with the French president. Macron further called for European allies to increase spending on defense, amid concerns that the United States may not come to Europe&apos;s defense if it is attacked by Russia. &quot;I want to believe that the U.S. will stand by our side, but we have to be ready for that not to be the case,&quot; Macron said, emphasizing that Russia continues to amass a larger military presence. &quot;Russia continues to rearm, it spends 40% of its budget on defense. By 2030, Russia wants to mobilize another three million soldiers and add four thousand tanks to its arsenal.&quot; Western leaders and defense officials previously warned about the threat emanating from Russia amid Europe&apos;s current lack of military preparedness. Western intelligence agencies have also warned that Russia may find the opportunity to launch a large-scale war on Europe within five years. &quot;Russia has become a threat for France and Europe,&quot; Macron said. &quot;(T)o watch and do nothing would be madness.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-open-to-extending-frances-nuclear-umbrella-to-european-allies-amid-threats-from-russia/	2025-03-05T13:06:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/gettyimages-2202893246-612x612.jpg
How US right-wing podcasters shape pro-Russia, anti-Ukraine sentiments	Listening to right-leaning alternative media in the U.S., one might come away with the impression &#x2014; albeit without evidence &#x2014; that Ukraine is irredeemably corrupt, President Volodymyr Zelensky is a dictator, and Russia&#x2019;s invasion was somehow justified. On a December episode of comedian Tim Dillon&#x2019;s podcast, podcaster Joe Rogan asserted that &#x201C;most people don&#x2019;t even know about the coup in 2014 in Ukraine,&#x201D; echoing a Russian talking point that casts the country&#x2019;s revolution against a pro-Russian corrupt regime in 2013-2014 as a U.S.-backed plot. &#x201C;Most people don&#x2019;t know that the president of the Ukraine right now, Zelensky, played the president on a television show &#x2014; a comedy show. And the premise of the comedy show was that a comedian becomes the president,&#x201D; Dillon added. While true in part, Dillon misrepresented Zelensky&#x2019;s role in &#x201C;Servant of the People,&#x201D; where he played a schoolteacher turned president, not a comedian. Dillon&#x2019;s use of &#x201C;the Ukraine,&#x201D; a linguistic relic of Soviet-era dominance, underscored how even casual conversations can echo geopolitical biases. After the onset of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war in 2022, negative and misleading narratives about Ukraine have gained momentum in right-leaning U.S. alternative media. As traditional news consumption reaches historic lows, a new frontier of media consumption has taken the lead. Right-wing alternative media has been particularly successful in the U.S. because &#x201C;it fills a void that mainstream media left open. It offers a clear, emotionally compelling, and often conspiratorial narrative that gives its audience easy explanations for complex problems,&#x201D; David Packman, an American talk show host and progressive political commentator, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Progressive media is up against a serious disadvantage which is that the truth is often way less exciting than a lie.&#x201D; During his 2024 election campaign, U.S. President Donald Trump aggressively courted influential right-leaning podcast hosts, harnessing their reach to millions of listeners for his political benefit. Some of these media figures &#x2014; including Rogan, Tucker Carlson, Patrick Bet-David, and Lex Fridman &#x2014; have also repeatedly amplified Russian narratives about Ukraine. With the U.S. suspending military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine in early March and the Trump administration&#x2019;s intensifying attacks on Zelensky, policy debates in the U.S. over the war and Ukraine&#x2019;s future appear to be shaped less by experts and more by Russian propaganda narratives, amplified by U.S. right-wing podcasters. Rogan&#x2019;s podcast, with over 19 million YouTube subscribers and a consistent hold on the top of the charts, dominates the alternative media sphere in the U.S. What began as a casual hangout for comedians has evolved over the past 16 years into a platform featuring high-profile guests like Silicon Valley tech moguls and presidential candidates. While he positions himself as &#x201C;an American first&#x201D; &#x2014; appearing to imply that patriotism is separate from political party allegiance &#x2014; &#xA0;Rogan has, in recent years, slowly embraced right-wing talking points. Rogan officially endorsed Trump during the 2024 presidential election and declared, &#x201C;Why would anyone be against (his desire to make America first)?&#x201D; in a recent episode with businessman Marc Andreessen. &#x201C;There&apos;s always been a very strong isolationist, &#x2018;America First&#x2019; constituency in the U.S. You will always be able to sell commercial media programming by waving the flag and asking why foreign aid is being sent abroad rather than paying for local or state needs,&#x201D; Professor Michael Socolow, an American media historian, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;(President Franklin D.) Roosevelt had to fight (isolationism) when trying to stop the Nazis before the Japanese bombed America into World War II. It seems like the anti-Ukraine discourse has blended into this traditional American political faction.&quot; Rogan has also voiced strong opposition to U.S. aid to Ukraine. In one episode, while talking to record producer and songwriter Scott Storch, Rogan condemned then-U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s authorization of Ukrainian strikes on Russian soil with American weapons, unleashing expletives aimed at Zelensky. &#x201C;How are you allowed to do that when you are on your way out? Like people don&#x2019;t want you to be there anymore, maybe that would be a good thing we would like to avoid from a dying former president. The whole thing is nuts,&#x201D; Rogan said. &quot;Zelensky says Putin is terrified. F**k you, man. You f**king people are about to start World War III.&#x201D; U.S. podcaster Joe Rogan greets then-U.S. President-elect Donald Trump during the UFC 309 event at Madison Square Garden in New York, New York, U.S. on Nov. 16, 2024. (Jeff Bottari / Zuffa LLC)During the heated Feb. 28 meeting in Washington, Trump made a similar point when he warned Zelensky he was &quot;gambling with World War III,&quot; suggesting that Ukraine&#x2019;s resistance to Russian aggression was a greater threat to global stability than Russia&apos;s invasion itself. Rogan later revealed that he turned down Zelensky&#x2019;s offer to appear on the podcast to share the Ukrainian perspective, offering little more than a casual dismissal during an episode with three other comedians: &#x201C;Zelensky tried to come on. They tried to get Zelensky on. I was like, &#x2018;What are you talking about?&#x2019;&#x201D; In the same episode where Rogan rejected the idea of interviewing Zelensky, fellow comedian Ari Shaffir casually mentioned that Former Fox News host and conspiracy theorist Tucker Carlson had told him that former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had &#x201C;prevented&#x201D; a 2022 peace deal &#x2014; a Kremlin narrative that ignores the fact that Russia-Ukraine negotiations stalled shortly after the discovery of the Bucha massacre. Both Johnson and Zelensky have also denied the claim. &#x201C;Where&#x2019;s the evidence (of Johnson intervening)? What&#x2019;s the context? Who are the sources? Doesn&#x2019;t matter &#x2014; once it&#x2019;s said on a massive platform, it becomes the truth,&#x201D; Packman said. &#x201C;And because these hosts are seen as more &#x2018;authentic&#x2019; than traditional news anchors, their words carry weight, even when they&apos;re just speculating or repeating Kremlin talking points without realizing it.&#x201D; Some of the anti-Ukraine messaging pushed by Rogan and other alternative media personalities can often be traced back to their guests, some of whom not only repeat pro-Russian narratives but have also interacted directly with the Kremlin. Among them is U.S. filmmaker Oliver Stone, who conducted over a dozen interviews with Vladimir Putin during the two years of filming a documentary about the Russian leader. Stone&#x2019;s other documentary, &#x201C;Ukraine on Fire,&#x201D; depicts the 2013-2014 EuroMaidan Revolution (or Revolution of Dignity) as &#x201C;the Maidan Massacre&#x201D; that resulted in the overthrow of then-President Viktor Yanukovych rather than a democratic uprising against Yanukovych&#x2019;s push to develop closer ties with Russia over the EU. In a 2022 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, whose YouTube channel has nearly five million subscribers, Stone dismissed those who said that Putin was a &#x201C;madman&#x201D; for his invasion of Ukraine. &#x201C;What people don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201D; Stone argued, &#x201C;is that Ukraine has been a terrorist state since 2014&#x201D; &#x2013; another Kremlin talking point that has nothing to do with reality. Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has appeared on Rogan and Fridman&#x2019;s podcasts, has used X, formerly known as Twitter, to repeatedly amplify Russian talking points. He has also referred to the EuroMaidan Revolution as a coup and called for Ukraine&#x2019;s Crimean Peninsula &#x2013; occupied by Russia since 2014 &#x2013; to remain with Russia, which garnered him praise from former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Carlson, who has also interviewed Putin as well as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, has been a guest on a number of these shows or featured some of the hosts on his own show.

(Gavriil Grigorov / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;I do feel for Zelensky, I do&#x2026;I think Zelensky&#x2019;s been completely misused by the State Department&#x2026;by the policy makers in the U.S. who have used Ukraine as a vessel for their geopolitical ambitions,&#x201D; Carlson told Fridman shortly after his interview with Putin, reinforcing the narrative that Ukraine&#x2019;s push for independence is not truly its own. Additionally, Carlson has repeatedly claimed &#x2014; without evidence &#x2014; that Ukraine is selling U.S.-supplied weapons on the black market, including to Mexican drug cartels. Fellow right-wing commentator Richard Hanania privately asked Carlson for proof behind his claim, to which Carlson responded with a slew of personal insults, Hanania revealed in a March 2 post on X. When pressed on Carlson&#x2019;s pro-Russia rhetoric in an interview with Piers Morgan in early February, Zelensky didn&#x2019;t mince words: &#x201C;He needs to stop working for Putin, to stop kissing his ass, honestly.&#x201D; In addition to those who have traveled to Moscow for sit-downs with Putin, some podcasters have also been accused of receiving money directly from the Kremlin. In September 2024, the U.S. Justice Department alleged that several right-wing podcasters, including Tim Pool and Dave Rubin, were linked to Tenet Media, a company serving as a Russian intelligence services fronta front for Russian intelligence ser after Russia Today&#x2019;s reach was restricted. The podcasters were allegedly unaware of the company&#x2019;s ties to Russia and denied that the Kremlin had any influence over their work. However, some of them continue to push anti-Ukraine talking points to this day. &#x201C;I f**king despise these smarmy hypocrites defending Ukraine and Zelensky,&#x201D; Pool wrote on X on March 4. &#x201C;Ukraine has given us NOTHING. There is no reason to be involved in this war.&#x201D; Given these alternative media figures&#x2019; ties to Trump&#x2019;s political orbit, Zelensky has attempted to navigate &#x2014; and capitalize on &#x2014; this alternative media landscape to his country&#x2019;s benefit. While Zelensky didn&#x2019;t appear on Rogan&#x2019;s podcast and talks of an interview with Carlson never materialized, he sat down in January for a nearly three-hour conversation with Fridman. During the discussion, Zelensky fervently detailed Ukraine&#x2019;s struggles in an existential war and why negotiating with Putin isn&#x2019;t as straightforward as some suggest. While Fridman has publicly praised Zelensky as a hero, likening him to Winston Churchill, he steered their conversation in a different direction during the interview by speaking of the need for compromises and even to forgive Putin, prompting Zelensky to reply that the compromise was that Putin will likely never face the prison sentence he deserves &#x2014; but forgiveness, after everything, is out of the question. Following the interview, Fridman said on Rogan&#x2019;s podcast that he intends to travel to Moscow for an interview with Putin. Some other Ukrainian political figures, for personal gain, have also attempted to exploit the opportunities presented by this right-wing alternative media landscape. Moscow-born U.S. podcaster Lex Fridman during his interview with President Volodymyr Zelensky in a video posted on Jan.5, 2024. (Lex Fridman / YouTube)At the end of December, Oleksiy Arestovych, a controversial former adviser to the President&#x2019;s Office, made an appearance on Iranian-American entrepreneur Patrick Bet-David&#x2019;s podcast. Bet-David hosted Trump and several of his immediate family members on his show during the presidential election. Arestovych cast himself to Bet-David&#x2019;s audience as a &#x201C;phenomenally popular&#x201D; figure forced to leave Ukraine at the warning of an unnamed U.S. official but resolute in his ambition to return when conditions permitted. Arestovych is known for exaggerating and even lying about his role in wartime Ukraine. None of Arestovych&#x2019;s statements were challenged by Bet-David during the three-hour-long interview &#x2014; every claim was presented and, in turn, accepted as fact. &#x201C;There are very few critical or antagonistic interviewers on podcasts,&#x201D; Socolow explained. &#x201C;That&apos;s how Trump used them so effectively during the campaign, for example. He knew he would be treated nicely, and that made it easier to promote his anti-Ukraine (and supposedly &#x2018;pro-America&#x2019;) messages.&#x201D; Amid declining U.S. popular support for Ukraine, Arestovych also sought to undermine confidence in Zelensky&apos;s leadership both domestically and internationally with provocative statements like &#x201C;I trust Putin more than Zelensky.&#x201D; Bet-David, known for frequently discussing alongside his co-hosts how Ukraine is &#x201C;totally corrupt,&#x201D; then pressed Arestovych to answer whether Zelensky had profited financially from the war. &#x201C;This is a very important question for you to answer,&#x201D; Bet-David said. &#x201C;If you answer it, in a way, it&#x2019;s catastrophic for (Zelensky). Do you know the answer, whether money ended up flowing to him through shell accounts or other people?&#x201D; Former President&apos;s Office advisor Oleksiy Arestovych at a forum in Kyiv on Dec. 11, 2020. (Evgen Kotenko/ Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images)&#x201C;I do not have information that he received money from corruption scandals. But I can tell you for sure that the level of corruption is off the charts. It&#x2019;s catastrophic,&#x201D; Arestovych replied vaguely, adding that &#x201C;at a minimum, it benefits the people who are surrounding (Zelensky).&#x201D; Bet-David has increasingly pushed anti-Ukraine rhetoric through conversations with a number of guests that have no apparent expertise on the issue. In a March 4 interview, men&apos;s rights activist and alleged human trafficker Andrew Tate joined Bet-David in accusing Zelensky of the &#x201C;audacity&#x201D; of &quot;disrespecting&quot; Trump during his White House visit. Bet-David and Tate also implied that Zelensky is somehow prolonging the war out of personal interests, despite the Kremlin saying publicly that they have yet to achieve their objectives in Ukraine &#x2014; namely, the destruction of Ukrainian statehood. Polls show that right-wing alternative media&#x2019;s anti-Ukraine rhetoric has resonated among a significant percentage of the American public. As the full-scale war entered its fourth year, that lack of support could prove deadly. Pew Research published a poll in November that showed 43% of Republicans believed that the U.S. was providing too much aid to Ukraine, and only 36% said the country had a responsibility to help defend Ukraine. Likewise, a Gallup poll from December showed that 50% of Americans believe in the need for a swift end to the war even if it means Ukraine doesn&#x2019;t recover all of its territory under Russian occupation. &#x201C;What appears to be happening is that the fringe media is influencing the more-established and respectable conservative media mindset,&#x201D; Socolow said. &#x201C;And this is shaping anti-Ukraine, pro-Putin rhetoric that&apos;s becoming more influential.&quot; Thanks for reading this article. As an American who has lived for a long time in Ukraine, it&#x2019;s important for me to call out those back in my birth country who are spreading harmful disinformation about the country that holds a special place in my heart. During wartime, it is even more important to get facts straight.

Ukraine war latest: US halts intelligence sharing with Ukraine, CIA director confirms	Key developments on March 5: The U.S. has halted intelligence sharing with Kyiv, threatening Ukraine&apos;s ability to strike Russian targets amid the full-scale war, CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed to Fox Business on March 5. &#x201C;Trump had a real question about whether President (Volodymyr) Zelensky was committed to the peace process, and he said let&#x2019;s pause,&#x201D; Ratcliffe said. On March 5, the Financial Times reported, citing undisclosed sources, that the U.S. had halted intelligence sharing with Ukraine. The move follows Washington&apos;s decision to freeze all military aid supplies to Ukraine following a public spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. The decision was likely intended to put pressure on Zelensky in peace talks. Zelensky later issued a statement on March 4 in which he called the Oval Office clash &quot;regrettable&quot; and affirmed commitment to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s leadership. The U.S. president praised Zelensky&#x2019;s statement in his address to Congress but made no direct comment on releasing military aid. &#x201C;I think on the military front and the intelligence front, the pause that allowed that to happen, I think will go away,&#x201D; Ratcliffe added. There had been conflicting claims as to whether the aid freeze also concerned intelligence sharing, a crucial capability that allows Ukraine to strike Russian targets and track military movement. Citing an undisclosed Ukrainian official, Bloomberg originally disputed the Financial Times&apos; article, claiming that intelligence sharing is ongoing. The British tabloid Daily Mail previously reported that the U.S. banned the U.K. from sharing Washington-obtained intelligence with Kyiv. Two officials told the FT that while Washington blocked allies from sharing U.S. intelligence with Ukraine, &quot;recipients with assets inside the country&quot; are likely to continue passing certain information to Ukraine. The restrictions will nevertheless hamper time-sensitive intelligence crucial for conducting precision strikes against moveable Russian targets, according to the outlet. Sky News supported this claim, reporting that the restrictions are &quot;selective&quot; and are aimed at Ukraine&apos;s ability to launch strikes. Since then, the U.S. media has reported that the aid freeze remains in place and that it is unclear whether Zelensky&apos;s statement that the Oval Office clash was &quot;regrettable&quot; was sufficient to lift the freeze. The Oval Office spat on Feb. 28, after which the U.S. leaders berated Zelensky as &quot;ungrateful&quot; and not &quot;ready for peace,&quot; derailed the signing of a much-anticipated natural resources agreement between the two countries. Ukraine&apos;s leader reaffirmed his readiness to sign the deal in his statement on March 4, but CBS News reported that parameters are still unclear as Trump seeks better terms. U.S. President Donald Trump may lift the pause on military support for Ukraine once peace talks are arranged and more confidence-building measures are taken, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said on March 5, according to Reuters. White House officials signaled that Zelensky must issue an apology and demonstrate readiness for peace to get the talks back on track. On March 4, the Ukrainian president made a statement in which he called the quarrel &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his commitment to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Waltz called the statement a &quot;good, positive first step.&quot; Similarly, Trump voiced appreciation for Zelensky&apos;s words and mentioned the statement in his address to Congress. &quot;I think if we can nail down these negotiations and move towards these negotiations, and in fact, put some confidence-building measures on the table, then the president will take a hard look at lifting this pause,&quot; Waltz said on the Fox &amp; Friends program, according to Reuters. According to Trump&apos;s aide, officials are leading talks on a specific date, location, and team for the negotiations. Ukraine has repeatedly stressed that security guarantees that would prevent Russia from resuming its aggression at a later date are a necessary condition for any peace talks. The Trump administration has retorted that the minerals deal is a security commitment of its own and pushed to broker a quick resolution between Kyiv and Moscow. Zelensky reaffirmed his readiness to sign the deal in his statement on March 4, but CBS News reported that parameters are still unclear as Trump seeks better terms. Ukraine and Europe are working on a plan for the first steps toward a just and sustainable peace as Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion enters its fourth year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 5. &quot;We are preparing a plan of first steps to bring about a just and sustainable peace. We are working on it quickly. It will be ready soon,&quot; he wrote on Telegram. Zelensky will participate in a special European Council meeting on March 6, where EU leaders are expected to discuss continued support for Ukraine as well as security guarantees for a lasting peace. The president said in his Telegram post that he had discussed the plan with with Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob, briefing him on the recent leaders&apos; summit in London and joint European efforts. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosted a summit on March 2, gathering key Western leaders, including Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, to coordinate support for Ukraine. Zelensky wrote on Telegram that Europe has a common vision for ending Russia&apos;s war and securing long-term stability. &quot;It should be at the table of future negotiations together with Ukraine and the United States,&quot; he added. The statement comes as U.S. and Russian officials held talks in Istanbul on Feb. 27, following their initial meeting in Riyadh on Feb. 18. The discussions, part of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s push for a swift peace deal, have raised concerns in Kyiv and Europe that Washington is sidelining its allies. Zelensky&apos;s remarks follow a dramatic shift in U.S. foreign policy, with Trump echoing Kremlin narratives and accusing the Ukrainian president of prolonging the war. Washington has frozen all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, a move widely seen as an attempt to pressure Kyiv into talks with Russia. Earlier, the Ukrainian president proposed initial steps toward peace, including releasing prisoners and a ceasefire in the air and sea. Ukrainian and American delegations will meet &quot;soon&quot; for peace talks, President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said on March 5, following discussions with U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. &quot;We discussed further steps towards a just and lasting peace,&quot; he wrote on Telegram. The two sides &quot;also exchanged views on security issues and the coordination of positions within the framework of bilateral relations between Ukraine and the United States,&quot; Yermak said, adding the teams agreed to meet in the near future to &quot;continue this important work.&quot; In his evening address, Zelensky said that the first results of the ongoing negotiations would be announced next week. &quot;Everyone can see how fast diplomatic events are developing. Today, our Ukrainian and U.S. teams have started working on a meeting. There is a positive movement,&quot; Zelensky said. An agreement between Kyiv and Washington on the natural resources remains stalled as Trump seeks a &quot;bigger, better deal,&quot; CBS News reported on March 4. White House officials publicly indicated that Zelensky must issue an apology and demonstrate a commitment to peace talks for discussions to resume. On March 4, Zelensky called the White House clash &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his willingness to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Waltz suggested on March 5 that Trump may lift the pause on military assistance once peace talks are arranged and more confidence-building measures are taken, Reuters reported. The long-debated agreement would establish a fund to which Ukraine would contribute 50% of proceeds from the future monetization of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. Ukraine previously rejected two U.S. proposals due to the absence of security guarantees, but negotiations are continuing amid mounting pressure from Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump said he appreciated President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s statement in support of peace talks but did not directly discuss his decision to halt military aid to Ukraine in his address to a joint session of Congress on March 4. Multiple news outlets reported on March 3 that the Trump administration ordered an immediate freeze on all U.S. military aid to Ukraine. The U.S. president barely referenced the decision in his first major address to lawmakers since returning to the White House, focusing largely on domestic issues. When he mentioned the war and Washington&apos;s role in supporting Ukraine, he avoided any direct mention of the aid freeze. &quot;The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine&apos;s defense,&quot; Trump said. &quot;With no security, with no anything. Do you want to keep it going for another five years?&quot; That question was Trump&apos;s only nod to the suspension of aid, which a White House official said on March 4 is meant to pressure &#xA0;President Volodymyr Zelensky into peace negotiations. Trump said in his address that he &quot;appreciate(s)&quot; Zelensky&apos;s recent statements expressing Ukraine&apos;s readiness for peace, but did not say whether or not the U.S. would resume weapons deliveries. On March 4, Zelensky reiterated Ukraine&apos;s commitment to the peace process in a post on X. &quot;Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians,&quot; &#xA0;he wrote. Zelensky proposed initial steps toward de-escalation with Russia, including prisoner of war (POW) releases, a &quot;truce at sea,&quot; and a &quot;truce in the sky&quot; that would ban missiles, long-range drones, and bombs targeting civilian infrastructure. He also said Ukraine is ready to sign the critical minerals deal &quot;at any time and in any convenient format.&quot; Trump said in his address to Congress that he received that same message in a letter from Zelensky. He read Zelensky&apos;s statement aloud, apparently presenting the message as a sign of successful U.S. pressure on Kyiv. Trump added that his team had held discussions with Russia and received &quot;strong signals&quot; that Moscow is ready to make peace. &quot;Wouldn&apos;t that be beautiful?&quot; he said. While Trump&apos;s remarks on Ukraine and Russia were short on details, his comments indicated that he wants Europe to foot the bill for Ukraine&apos;s defense. &quot;Europe has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending Ukraine,&quot; he said. Trump likened U.S. spending on military aid to Ukraine to &quot;taking candy from a baby&quot; and expressed disbelief at the disparity between European and American aid packages. He repeated his hopes for an end to the war, saying, &quot;It&apos;s time for the madness to stop,&quot; but made no mention of sanctions against Russia or security guarantees for Ukraine. Drones of the Ukrainian Hart Brigade&apos;s Falcon unit destroyed a Russian Murom-M long-range surveillance system near the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces said on March 5. Vovchansk is an embattled town some 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv that has seen heavy battles since Russia launched a new offensive in the area in May 2024. Russian forces &quot;were not saved by the anti-drone net that covered it (Murom-M) from all sides. The first two &apos;birds&apos; of the Falcon pilots punched a hole in it, and the third finally destroyed the system,&quot; the statement read. 0:00/1&#xD7;The Hart Brigade reportedly destroyed the Russian Murom-M long-range surveillance system near the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces said on March 5, 2025. (Khortytsia group of forces/Telegram)Russian troops and a vehicle used to transport infantry and ammunition to their positions came under attack in the same area, the Khortytsia group of forces said. Throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing the way wars are fought.

France, UK to finalize peace plan with Ukraine 'in days,' set to present to US, Reuters reports	France and the U.K. aim to finalize a peace plan with Ukraine &quot;in days&quot; to present to the United States, Reuters reported on March 6, citing diplomatic sources familiar with the matter. The report follows President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s statement that Ukraine and Europe are working on the first steps toward a just and sustainable peace as Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion enters its fourth year. &quot;We&apos;re looking at putting this plan together in days and not weeks,&quot; a senior European diplomat told Reuters. Another diplomatic source told Reuters that the main goal is to align European and Ukrainian positions before presenting the proposal to the U.S. while reinforcing the message that Russia is the aggressor. European leaders met in London on March 2 to discuss pathways to ending the war and restoring dialogue between Ukraine and the U.S. following the heated Feb. 28 exchange between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. Washington has since frozen all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, widely seen as an attempt to pressure Kyiv into talks with Russia. The move comes amid a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy, with Trump echoing Kremlin narratives and accusing Zelensky of prolonging the war. The Daily Mail claimed that Macron, Starmer, and Zelensky were planning a joint visit to Washington to present a &quot;united front&quot; to Trump. Le Figaro later reported that French officials quickly rebuked the speculation, with the Elysee Palace saying that no such visit is planned &quot;at this stage.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/france-uk-to-finalize-peace-plan-with-ukraine-in-days-set-to-present-to-us-reuters-reports/	2025-03-05T11:58:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202214106.jpg
Trump's alignment with Russia derails Europe's push for a peacekeeping force in Ukraine	European countries have intensified talks on sending peacekeepers to Ukraine to monitor and enforce a possible ceasefire. But the potential deployment of European peacekeepers to Ukraine faces a lot of challenges and uncertainties. There is no unity among European countries on the issue, with some of them openly opposing the idea. The number of peacekeepers is also uncertain, and it is not clear if it will be enough to ensure the effective enforcement of a ceasefire. And the rules of engagement may become a major stumbling block. Another concern is that the Kremlin has refused to accept the potential deployment of Western peacekeepers in Ukraine. Without Russia&apos;s approval, the idea is unlikely to be implemented, and there are no indications so far that U.S. President Donald Trump will pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to approve a European peacekeeping mission. European countries have also said peacekeepers would need to have some form of U.S. support. However, it is unclear if Washington will provide it. Trump has aligned his policy closely with the Kremlin&apos;s agenda and has so far refused to offer any security guarantees to Ukraine. &quot;The deployment of a European military force to Ukraine is, in my view, the least likely form of security assistance to Ukraine because of the high risks involved, and notably the requirement that the United States provides security guarantees to the force &#x2014; essentially Washington being ready to fight Russia,&quot; Neil Melvin, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;President Trump and representatives of his administration have repeatedly stated that the US will not provide such commitments.&quot; Jenny Mathers, a lecturer in international politics at the U.K.&apos;s Aberystwyth University, also argued that &quot;Trump and (U.S. Vice President JD) Vance made it clear just how little they are interested in the security of Ukraine or indeed of Europe.&quot; &quot;European leaders &#x2014; and probably societies too &#x2014; are accepting that Europe will need to take the lead when it comes to security guarantees.&quot; Talks on the potential peacekeeping mission have been spearheaded by the U.K. and France. Ireland, Lithuania, and Canada have also stated that they are considering sending their peacekeepers to Ukraine. &quot;The force would be led by the U.K. and France but would be most likely supported by Sweden, possibly also Poland and the Baltic states or Spain, Italy or the Netherlands, and Denmark,&quot; Pavel Havlicek, a research fellow at the Association for International Affairs, told the Kyiv Independent. But several countries, including some of those named by Havlicek, have been opposed to the idea or non-committal.

(Aline Deschamps/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)Germany has taken an ambivalent stance. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said in January that Berlin might consider deploying its troops in a peacekeeping mission to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Chancellor Olaf Scholz from the Social Democratic Party contradicted Pistorius in February, saying that discussions over Germany potentially deploying its peacekeeping troops to Ukraine were &quot;premature and inappropriate.&quot; The CDU/CSU alliance, which won Germany&apos;s Feb. 23 parliamentary election, appears to be more open to the idea. Its leader, Friedrich Merz, who is expected to become the next chancellor, said in December that Germany may consider joining a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine but only with Russia&apos;s consent. &quot;For my country, Germany, it is a test on our reliability in a possible new European security architecture,&quot; Rebecca Harms, a former member of the European Parliament from Germany, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;And if we put its participation in a historical context, I see that for the Germans, it would be the chance to pay off our horrendous historical guilt in Ukraine,&quot; she added in reference to Nazi Germany&apos;s occupation of Ukraine during World War II and the Holocaust. Meanwhile, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in December that Warsaw was not planning to deploy peacekeepers to Ukraine. &quot;(Some countries) are hesitant &#x2014; like Italy, Spain, and Germany &#x2014; as they see that this could be a potentially dangerous mission, especially if the United States continues to refuse to provide a backstop,&quot; James Shea, a defense and security expert at Chatham House, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Others like the Baltic states and Poland are worried that the troops going to Ukraine would come from the NATO battalions currently defending their national territory and leaving them more vulnerable to Russia.&quot; If a peacekeeping force is created, it might include troops from non-EU countries as well. Turkey has indicated its openness to deploying troops in Ukraine as part of a potential peacekeeping force, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 27, citing sources familiar with the matter. Shea said that &quot;Russia will probably advocate this option (of non-European troops) as it would like the force to be &apos;neutral&apos; and similar to a lightly armed UN peacekeeping force, observing the ceasefire rather than with a mandate to enforce it and help Ukraine to defend itself.&quot; &quot;The Europeans need to work hard with the Americans to ensure that they resist Putin&apos;s demands and go for a robust European-led force,&quot; he added. Havlicek said that &quot;from the Western point of view, Turkish soldiers would be preferred, and Chinese or Central Asian ones would be (preferred) from the Russian one.&quot; At least 200,000 peacekeepers would be required on Ukraine&apos;s eastern front for a peace deal to be enforced, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January. Later, he clarified his comments. &quot;By the way, I didn&apos;t say we need 200,000 (peacekeepers)... A journalist asked me, I said, &apos;Maybe more, maybe less,&apos;&quot; Zelensky said.

(Mert Gokhankoc/dia images via Getty Images)The Washington Post reported in February, citing its sources, that participating European nations could send between 25,000 and 30,000 soldiers to Ukraine. &quot;President Zelensky has spoken of the need for a force of hundreds of thousands,&quot; Melvin said. &quot;This is unrealistic. It might just be possible to put together a force of up to 30,000 &#x2013; although whether that could be sustained for long is unclear.&quot; Havlicek said that &quot;around 30,000 to 50,000 troops are often discussed, and they would not be placed at the front line but in several key points where it would be possible to step in if necessary.&quot; It is unclear if such a number will be enough. Harms argued that, given the length of the front line, 100,000 would be needed to effectively monitor the ceasefire. Another problem is that the Kremlin has opposed the potential deployment of Western peacekeepers to Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned in February that Moscow would not accept the deployment of NATO military personnel in Ukraine after any potential peace deal. Melvin said that &quot;this is likely to be a major roadblock to a peace agreement.&quot; But analysts say that the West may try to change the Kremlin&apos;s position. Havlicek argued that &quot;the Kremlin refuses the Western/NATO countries&apos; deployment right now&quot; but &quot;we are only at the beginning of the negotiation process, with many unknowns.&quot; &quot;Economic pressure, including on the energy (sector), could serve as a means to pressure Putin into negotiations,&quot; he added. A European diplomatic source told the Kyiv Independent that, to force Putin to accept a European peacekeeping force, the West should threaten to impose more painful sanctions on Russia&apos;s banking system. The source also said that the West could threaten Russia with sanctions as punishment for violating a ceasefire agreement. The big question is whether Trump will be capable of pressuring Putin or willing to do so. &quot;Trump appears to have no leverage with Putin whatsoever &#x2014; indeed, it looks just the opposite,&quot; Mathers said. &quot;So far, we have seen Trump and his senior officials echoing Kremlin&apos;s talking points and showing how eager they are to re-establish diplomatic and trading relations with Russia without asking Russia to make any concessions at all.&quot; If Russia agrees to a European military presence in Ukraine, the deployment of peacekeepers would still involve considerable risks. &quot;These troops would be under constant risk and potential fire, which is why it is so important to provide U.S. support and guarantees,&quot; Havlicek said. The troops should be there not to fight, but to provide security for the ceasefire and build trust, including ensuring that the conflict does not escalate into a bigger war if Russia resumes military hostilities.&quot; The effectiveness of the potential peacekeeping force also depends on the rules of engagement. &quot;A lot depends on the terms of any deal and the role for peacekeepers that is built in: what their terms of engagement would be,&quot; Mathers said. &quot;We have a situation in the 1990s where UN peacekeepers sent to Bosnia had very limited terms of engagement and ended up being largely ineffectual. We will see if today&apos;s political leaders have learned anything from that experience, or indeed if there is any institutional memory of it.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump chats with Russian President Vladimir Putin during the APEC Economic Leaders&apos; Meeting in Danang, Vietnam, on Nov. 11, 2017. (Mikhail Klimentyev/Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images)Shea argued that &quot;Putin would definitely like the return of the former OSCE observer mission, which proved ineffective at stopping the continuous ceasefire violations in the Donbas.&quot; The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) monitored the front line in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts from 2014 to 2022. Russia violated ceasefire agreements 25 times during the period, according to Zelensky. Shea also said that European peacekeepers would likely &quot;not be on the front line but guarding cities and infrastructure to the rear.&quot; &quot;So, how much fighting ability and deterrent effect they will have on Russia is open to question,&quot; he added. &quot;Especially if Russia doesn&apos;t withdraw its own forces and heavy weapons from forward positions.&quot; European countries have said that they needed a &quot;backstop&quot; from the U.S. for a peacekeeping force in Ukraine. They implied some kind of support or security guarantees but did not elaborate on the issue. Melvin argued that &quot;30,000 (European peacekeepers) would not be able to enforce a ceasefire on their own.&quot; &quot;Without a U.S. security guarantee &#x2014; and here there would be uncertainty about whether President Trump would respond to an attack on the European force even if he had made a previous commitment &#x2014; and given Russia&apos;s comments, there would be considerable risk that these troops would be targeted by Moscow in the future,&quot; he added. Shea said that Europeans could &quot;try to have the U.S. involved in other ways: for instance in supplying air defense assets, logistics and intelligence and allowing the NATO command structure (which depends heavily on U.S. military officers and infrastructure and communications) to provide the planning for the operation.&quot; &quot;Ideally, the U.S. could also provide a reserve or extraction force for the Europeans in a crisis situation, but this will probably be a big ask for Trump and the Pentagon,&quot; he added. &quot;Having the U.S. involved in some way will increase the chances that European countries like Germany, Spain, or Italy, which are currently hesitating to contribute to the force, would do so in the future as U.S. troops on the ground will enhance the overall deterrence capability of the force.&quot; British KFOR soldiers take part in a wreath-laying ceremony for Remembrance Sunday in Pristina, Kosovo, on Nov. 10, 2024. (Armend Nimani/AFP via Getty Images)Mathers said that the Europeans &quot;want the U.S. to commit to retaliating against Russia using American forces (probably air capabilities) if Russia breaks any ceasefire or peace deal.&quot; &quot;They want an Article 5 assurance that an attack by Russia on European troops in Ukraine will be regarded by Washington as an attack on the U.S. and respond accordingly,&quot; she added. &quot;I doubt they will get this, given Trump&apos;s increasingly pro-Russia line, but they might get, for example, an agreement to have U.S. aircraft stationed nearby, patrolling the skies over Ukraine, or something of that nature. Even that, though, would be a stretch for Trump, I suspect.&quot; Kyiv Independent reporter Asami Terajima contributed to this article.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-alignment-with-russia-derails-europes-push-for-a-peacekeeping-force-in-ukraine/	2025-03-05T11:40:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2148296359.jpg
Trump lifting US sanctions on Russia — a ‘huge win’ for Putin, ‘chaos’ for global economy	U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s administration is reportedly ready to lift sanctions on Russia imposed after the start of the full-scale invasion, in a reversal of U.S. policy toward Moscow during its war against Ukraine. The White House is preparing a plan to potentially give Russia sanctions relief for several entities and Russian citizens as part of negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported on March 3. The move is a stark shift from a sanctions policy by former President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration that included the &#x201C;mother of all sanctions,&#x201D; Europe and the G7 nations want to keep sanctions to throttle Russia&#x2019;s economy and continue to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin. They may have no other option than to follow Washington to maintain unity among Ukraine&#x2019;s allies and avoid being a pariah in the global economy. &#x201C;The big revenue raising opportunities for Russia are still linked to business connected with Europe, and Europe can stand fast on that. But very quickly Europe would find itself marginalized,&#x201D; said Tom Keatinge, director of the Center for Finance and Security at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a think tank. Although the effectiveness of sanctions has been debated, they have clearly gotten under the skin of Putin, who has repeatedly called for their end. Sanctions, particularly on the oil and gas industry, have been a headache for Moscow, forcing it to resort to a shadow fleet to sell discounted fuel while incurring higher export costs. So far, Europe has not said if it will keep sanctions in place or not. Kyiv&#x2019;s sanctions commissioner, Vladyslav Vlasiuk, called on European allies to commit to sanctions &#x201C;for as long as necessary.&#x201D; If the U.S. unilaterally lifts sanctions, it would be a huge win for Putin and a further sign that the Western alliance is crumbling amid already heightened tensions, Keatinge told the Kyiv Independent. The idea of sanctions was for Ukraine&#x2019;s allies to work together to hinder Russia&#x2019;s war economy and punish Moscow for its brutal invasion. Trump&#x2019;s administration previously floated sanctions relief to bring Moscow to the negotiation table, shortly after former president Joe Biden worked with London to lay down the most extensive sanctions to date in January before Trump&#x2019;s inauguration. The growing rift between the U.S. and Europe has increased the risk of Trump acting without Europe. He no longer sees the need to coordinate with European allies and seems uninterested in keeping sanctions in place, said Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council&apos;s Transatlantic Security Initiative. The fallout from the U.S. unilaterally easing sanctions would cause chaos in the global economy, she said. Companies would have to navigate the complexities of conforming to one set of rules for the U.S. and another for the remaining G7 and EU economies, leading to mountains of paperwork and uncertainty among businesses. &#x201C;We have never been in a situation before where one Western ally might act in one way in lifting sanctions and others may act in a different way,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Imagine the chaos that would create for companies if within the G7 and the European Union we had essentially contradictory rules when it comes to Russia.&#x201D; The U.S. and Russia were never important trading partners, with pre-war trade totaling $6.4 billion in Russian imports and $29.7 billion in American exports in 2021. In purely economic terms, lifting American sanctions wouldn&#x2019;t lead to massive amounts of cash flowing to Russia&#x2019;s war machine, but the political messaging would be &#x201C;catastrophic,&#x201D; said Jason McCue, senior partner of McCue Jury &amp; Partners LLP, a law firm. Vladimir Putin walks past an honour guard at the Kremlin in Moscow on July 31, 2024. (Maxim Shemetov / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)The disunity among Ukraine&#x2019;s allies would not only be a gift for Russia but would make sanctions harder to sustain. The EU and G7 have already sanctioned &#x201C;everything that is meaningful,&#x201D; and further packages cannot counterbalance the loss of the U.S., said Braw. European countries will face the moral dilemma of easing sanctions to boost Europe&#x2019;s economy and keep up with American companies or sticking to their guns to punish Putin. Brussels and London would find it hard to lift restrictions as they stipulate that Russia should meet requirements such as compensating Kyiv and respecting Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial integrity. But pressure could mount from businesses and pro-Russian leaders like Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban that have long been against sanctions. &#xA0; &#x201C;There will be European corporations that will be trying to take a back channel to get licenses so that they can compete with Americans,&#x201D; said Keatinge. If the EU lifts sanctions, it would be a much bigger boost for Russia&#x2019;s economy. Moscow and Brussels were key trading partners pre-war, with trade reaching 257.5 billion euros in 2021, including over 60% of Russian fuel imports to the EU &#x2014; Russia&#x2019;s biggest cash cow. The question remains if Putin would allow European enterprises to enter Russia again. If the U.S. unilaterally eases sanctions, Putin will have the leverage to turn around and demand more from Europe in return for a place on its market, said Keatinge. &#x201C;That would be a huge victory for Putin because he would essentially be marginalizing Europe and doing business with the Americans,&#x201D; he said. Trump can lift some sanctions with a wave of his hand while others will have to go through Congress. With the U.S. leader embarking on his own negotiations with Russia, sanction relief will likely be a part of a deal cut with Moscow. Following a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov last month, Trump&#x2019;s administration vocally supported economic opportunities with Russia after the war. In particular, Trump has eyed Russia&#x2019;s lucrative mineral deposits, which previously made up a large chunk of Russian exports to the U.S. &#x201C;If sanctions were lifted, I suspect it would be more about making money for the United States, giving Putin something that he can talk about, and further wedging between the U.S. and the EU,&#x201D; said Keatinge. If Trump does negotiate easing sanctions on Russia, he needs to ensure security guarantees for Ukraine, said Yuliya Ziskina, a senior legal fellow at Razom for Ukraine, a nonprofit. Without them, it would be an &#x201C;ill-fated strategy,&#x201D; she said. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he departs the White House in Washington, DC, U.S. on Feb. 28, 2025. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)&#x201C;Lifting sanctions against Russia would allow it to rebuild its economy, strengthen its war machine, and reattack Ukraine,&#x201D; Ziskina told the Kyiv Independent. Trump is also likely to untie sanctions that would benefit U.S. businesses by arguing that they work against the interests of the U.S. population. In turn, that will bolster Russian businesses and allow them to get hold of dollars via the U.S., overcoming the suspension of U.S. dollar exchange trading on the Moscow Exchange, McCue said. While lifting sanctions would legally give American companies carte blanche to jump back into the Russian market, Moscow is still battling an overheated economy that will turn many off. The ruble&#x2019;s value may have bounced back in recent weeks in line with Trump&#x2019;s talks on a peace agreement, but the key interest rate remains sky-high at 21%, and growth is predicted to slow to 1.7% this year, down from 4.1% in 2024. U.S. Companies would also have to battle the lawlessness of Russia, which is dominated by cutthroat oligarchs close to Putin. Nationalization and corporate raids still loom over Western businesses operating in Russia, and that won&apos;t disappear anytime soon, said Ziskina. Many businesses will remain circumspect of the risks and potential global backlash, although some will cautiously wait to see what happens to the first tranche that barrels in, said Braw. &#x201C;But to be honest, the kinds of companies we&apos;re talking about are not worried about reputational risks,&#x201D; said Keatinge.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-lifting-us-sanctions-on-russia-a-huge-win-for-putin-chaos-for-global-economy/	2025-03-05T11:15:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203349192.jpg
Trump’s ‘America First’ strategy with Ukraine could backfire on US long term interests, experts warn	U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s escalating pressure on Ukraine over the past week has shocked the global community as he pushes for a quick end to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. The news on March 3 that the U.S. would suspend all military aid to Ukraine sparked fears in Ukraine and joy inside Russia that the U.S. was abandoning its long-standing ally and siding with Moscow. While a halt in aid could be calamitous for Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to defend itself against a full-scale invasion that has now carried on for more than three years, many experts believe the U.S. policies towards Ukraine may also cause long-term harm to the U.S.&#x2019;s own interests. &#x201C;Clearly, there will be different views on this,&quot; said Ian Lesser, a distinguished fellow of the German Marshall Fund and adviser to the president of the U.S.-based think tank. &quot;The Trump administration feels that it&#x2019;s vigorously pursuing an America First policy, and that as a matter of priority, they are looking to greatly reduce &#x2014; if not disengage from &#x2014; European security and to leave that responsibility to European allies,&quot; Lesser said. In a contentious televised meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, Trump said that Europe should be responsible for any security guarantees negotiated as part of a peace plan. Trump is pushing for Ukraine to sign a deal that would allow U.S. investors to profit from Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources, and has said it&#x2019;s &quot;not fair&quot; that the U.S. hasn&#x2019;t received compensation for the funds it has sent to Ukraine. According to Lesser, however, pivoting away from European defense is an &quot;ill-considered choice&quot; that would likely undermine American interests both in the near term and in the longer term. America&#x2019;s long-standing support for Europe has not been an act of charity, he points out, but a policy decision that the country benefits from. &quot;An insecure Europe has implications for the security of North America,&quot; he said. Additionally, signs of disengagement from the U.S. on international security issues will embolden adversaries beyond Europe, he said, citing the South China Sea as a potential example of where tensions could worsen. One of the immediate effects of Trump&#x2019;s latest moves has been a growing sense in Europe that it can no longer count on the U.S as a reliable ally. After the U.S. backed off on its support for Ukraine, the European Union announced a new plan to mobilize hundreds of billions of dollars and boost defense spending. &#x201C;Europe is ready to assume its responsibilities,&quot; said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on March 4. &quot;This is a moment for Europe and we are ready to step up.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and France&apos;s President Emmanuel Macron meet during a summit at Lancaster House in London, England, on March 2, 2025. (Justin Tallis / WPA Pool / Getty Images)A boost in defense spending is a positive signal for the region&#x2019;s security, and a move that Trump has long pushed for. Nevertheless, Trump&#x2019;s approach has meant it comes at the sharp cost of declining confidence in American leadership, said Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of Isolationism: A History of America&apos;s Efforts to Shield Itself From the World. Kupchan said that Trump&#x2019;s stated objective &#x2014; to end the war &#x2014; is the right goal, but that his strategy has been &quot;disastrous.&quot; In his negotiations, the U.S. president has insulted and sidelined allies, while upending longstanding U.S. policy by demanding severe concessions from Ukraine while appearing to placate Russia. &quot;If you&apos;re not just Ukraine, but if you&apos;re France, Germany, the U.K., South Korea, Japan, you have no choice but to ask yourself: Can I count on the United States? Is the United States now passing through a period of such profound political dysfunction that we have to make other plans?&quot; Kupchan said. &#x201C;I think the damage that is done to perceptions of the United States, to America&apos;s reputation for reliability and steadiness, is very harmful,&quot; he added. &apos;It undermines U.S. influence.&quot; A direct consequence of diminished U.S. influence is the weakening of the Western alliance that has kept America&#x2019;s adversaries in check. &quot;I think (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and (Chinese President) Xi (Jinping) are drinking a lot of champagne these days,&quot; Kupchan said. &quot;They don&#x2019;t have to lift a finger. They just sit back and watch Trump weaken the alliance of like-minded countries that has been the anchor of the international system since Pearl Harbor.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin and China&apos;s President Xi Jinping make a toast during a reception following their talks at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia on March 21, 2023. (Pavel Byrkin/AFP via Getty Images)George Barros, who heads the Russia Team and Geospatial Intelligence Team at the Institute for the Study of War, shared a similar view. &quot;Our adversaries are the ones that benefit the most from all these things,&quot; Barros said, referring to Trump&#x2019;s recent moves including the aid suspension. &quot;They&apos;re salivating at the prospect of the American-European transatlantic relationship imploding.&quot; After the announcement of the suspension of aid to Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov spoke positively of the decision, and Russian officials and propagandists rushed to defend Trump after his clash with Zelensky. Despite a March 4 statement from Zelensky in which he proposed steps toward peace and called the Oval Office exchange &quot;regrettable,&quot; the aid freeze remains in place. According to Barros, however, it is still too early to say whether the U.S. is abandoning its ties with Western allies and its role as a leader on the global stage. While he didn&#x2019;t rule it out, he said there is also a possibility that Trump is pursuing a different strategy that he hasn&#x2019;t articulated. Zelensky himself noted the lack of a &quot;clear position&quot; from U.S. officials after the aid suspension during his evening address on March 4, saying &quot;people should not be kept guessing.&quot; Overall, the aid suspension was a &quot;mistake,&quot; Barros said &#x2014; one he hoped would be reversed soon, though he sounded a note of caution. &quot;I think we&#x2019;re still going to see more gut punches in the coming weeks and months, most likely. It&#x2019;s very bad,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-america-first-strategy-with-ukraine-could-backfire-on-u-s-long-term-interests-experts-warn/	2025-03-05T11:10:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202564066.jpg
Ukraine, US delegations to meet 'soon' for negotiations, Zelensky's top aide says	Ukrainian and American delegations will meet &quot;soon&quot; for peace talks, President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said on March 5, following discussions with U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. &quot;We discussed further steps towards a just and lasting peace,&quot; he wrote on Telegram. The two sides &quot;also exchanged views on security issues and the coordination of positions within the framework of bilateral relations between Ukraine and the United States,&quot; Yermak said, adding the teams agreed to meet in the near future to &quot;continue this important work.&quot; In his evening address, Zelensky said that the first results of ongoing negotiations would be announced next week. &quot;Everyone can see how fast diplomatic events are developing. Today, our Ukrainian and U.S. teams have started working on a meeting. There is a positive movement,&quot; Zelensky said. The statements come amid rising tensions between Kyiv and Washington following a clash in the Oval Office exchange on Feb. 28 between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. The dispute led to the collapse of a bilateral deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, after which the U.S. president paused all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. An agreement between Kyiv and Washington on the natural resources remains stalled as Trump seeks a &quot;bigger, better deal,&quot; CBS News reported on March 4. White House officials publicly indicated that Zelensky must issue an apology and demonstrate a commitment to peace talks for discussions to resume. On March 4, Zelensky called the White House clash &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his willingness to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Waltz suggested on March 5 that Trump may lift the pause on military assistance once peace talks are arranged and more confidence-building measures are taken, Reuters reported. The long-debated agreement would establish a fund to which Ukraine would contribute 50% of proceeds from the future monetization of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. Ukraine previously rejected two U.S. proposals due to the absence of security guarantees, but negotiations are continuing amid mounting pressure from Washington.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-delegations-to-meet-soon-for-negotiations-zelenskys-top-aide-says/	2025-03-05T10:37:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1659182865.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 16	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 16 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Feb. 24&#x2013;March 2, 2025. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Ukraine&#x2019;s Bureau of Economic Security leadership race narrows to 30 candidates The selection process for the next head of the Bureau of Economic Security (BES) has moved to the next stage, with the competition commission reviewing applications from 43 candidates. Following the initial document screening, 30 applicants have been approved to proceed, having met the formal eligibility requirements of the competition. The next phases will include skills assessments, legislative knowledge tests, and integrity checks. Ukraine passes overdue IMF-mandated judicial reform bill Ukraine&#x2019;s Parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, has approved draft law #12368-1, establishing a new judicial framework to replace the controversial Kyiv District Administrative Court (OASK). The bill, which received 234 votes in favor and was welcomed by the G7 Ambassadors, marks the fulfillment of a long-overdue International Monetary Fund structural benchmark, originally due by Dec. 31, 2024. However, the final version deviates from initial IMF recommendations, opting to create two separate courts: The High Qualification Commission of Judges (HQCJ) is required to announce a competition for judicial appointments within one month of the law&#x2019;s enactment, with international experts playing a role in the selection process for the next three years. Ukraine&#x2019;s stock market regulator adopts updated ethics code in line with IMF commitments Ukraine&#x2019;s National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC) has adopted an updated Employee Ethics Code, aligning with recent amendments to the Law on State Regulation of Capital Markets and Organized Commodity Markets. The decision was announced by NSSMC Chairman Ruslan Mahomedov via Telegram on Feb. 28. The revision is part of a structural benchmark under Ukraine&#x2019;s Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies with the IMF, with a deadline set for January 2025. According to Mahomedov, the updated code was developed in consultation with experts from the World Bank and the IMF, ensuring it meets international best practices. Ukrainian government adopts new public investment allocation mechanism On Feb. 28, 2025, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine approved a new framework for allocating public investment, aimed at prioritizing state-funded projects based on their strategic importance. The unified project portfolio will rank investment initiatives according to their relevance to Ukraine&#x2019;s national goals and regional development needs. The government has also established an Interagency Commission to oversee the distribution of state budget funds for investment projects, chaired by the Minister of Finance. The commission will include representatives from key ministries, including the economy, regional development, health, energy, and digital transformation ministries. Ukraine moves forward with $1 billion purchase of Russian-made nuclear reactors Ukraine&#x2019;s Verkhovna Rada has cleared the way for state-owned Energoatom to proceed with its $1 billion acquisition of Russian-made nuclear reactors from Bulgaria, after all blocking resolutions against draft law #11392 were rejected. The deal involves the purchase of two Rosatom reactors originally intended for the Belene Nuclear Power Plant in Bulgaria, to be used for the construction of reactor units No.3 and No. 4 at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant. While the legislation allowing the purchase has been approved, Energoatom still lacks the necessary parliamentary authorization for the actual construction of the new units. Ukrainian law enforcements raid leading pharmaceutical plants amid pricing probe National Police of Ukraine conducted raids on three of the country&#x2019;s largest pharmaceutical manufacturers on Feb. 28, &#x201C;Economichna Pravda&#x201D; reported. According to the National Police statement, raids were a part of ongoing criminal investigations. The searches follow a recent decision by Ukraine&#x2019;s National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) to introduce drug price regulations, cutting the cost of essential medications by 30% from March 1, 2025. The NSDC had also recommended that law enforcement agencies intensify efforts to combat price manipulation and financial abuses in the pharmaceutical sector.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-16/	2025-03-05T09:52:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2197731140.jpg
Ukraine, EU drafting plan for first steps toward lasting peace, Zelensky says	Ukraine and Europe are working on a plan for the first steps toward a just and sustainable peace as Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion enters its fourth year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 5. &quot;We are preparing a plan of first steps to bring about a just and sustainable peace. We are working on it quickly. It will be ready soon,&quot; he wrote on Telegram. Zelensky will participate in a special European Council meeting on March 6, where EU leaders are expected to discuss continued support for Ukraine as well as security guarantees for a lasting peace. The president said in his Telegram post that he had discussed the plan with with Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob, briefing him on the recent leaders&apos; summit in London and joint European efforts. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosted a summit on March 2, gathering key Western leaders, including Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, to coordinate support for Ukraine. Zelensky wrote on Telegram that Europe has a common vision for ending Russia&apos;s war and securing long-term stability. &quot;It should be at the table of future negotiations together with Ukraine and the United States,&quot; he added. The statement comes as U.S. and Russian officials held talks in Istanbul on Feb. 27, following their initial meeting in Riyadh on Feb. 18. The discussions, part of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s push for a swift peace deal, have raised concerns in Kyiv and Europe that Washington is sidelining its allies. Zelensky&apos;s remarks follow a dramatic shift in U.S. foreign policy, with Trump echoing Kremlin narratives and accusing the Ukrainian president of prolonging the war. Washington has frozen all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, a move widely seen as an attempt to pressure Kyiv into talks with Russia. Earlier, the Ukrainian president proposed initial steps toward peace, including releasing prisoners and a ceasefire in the air and sea.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-eu-drafting-plan-for-first-steps-toward-lasting-peace-zelensky-says/	2025-03-05T09:46:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/03/e6616e5fc8719714246c2f23f2404b17_1679921770_extra_large.jpeg
Zelensky to take part in special European Council meeting on March 6	President Volodymyr Zelensky will take part in a special meeting of the European Council on March 6, a senior EU official confirmed to the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We are living in a defining moment for Ukraine and European security,&quot; European Council President Antonio Costa said ahead of the summit. Discussions will focus on strengthening support for Ukraine as Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion enters its fourth year. Participants will also discuss &quot;European contributions to the necessary security guarantees required to ensure a lasting peace in Ukraine,&quot; the European Council said in a statement on its website. EU leaders are also expected to adopt a communique reaffirming that European security cannot be negotiated without European participation, Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne reported. The meeting follows growing concerns in Kyiv and European capitals over U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s diplomatic outreach to Russia, including direct talks between American and Russian officials in Istanbul on Feb. 27 and Riyadh on Feb. 18. Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and other senior Western officials gathered in London on March 2 for a summit hosted by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to coordinate Ukraine policy. Zelensky arrived in London on March 1 following a turbulent visit to Washington, where a planned natural resources agreement with the U.S. collapsed after a tense Oval Office exchange with Trump. The fallout has fueled speculation about the future of U.S.- Ukraine relations. Washington has frozen all military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv, a move widely seen as an attempt to pressure Zelensky into talks with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-take-part-in-special-european-council-meeting-on-march-6/	2025-03-05T09:10:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190701439.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Dark days for Ukraine	The following is the March 4, 2025 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. This week&#x2019;s newsletter was originally going to be about the Trump&#x2013;JD Vance&#x2013;President Volodymyr Zelensky clash in the Oval Office and the subsequent collapse of the minerals deal &#x2014; itself a shocking turn of events after weeks of tense negotiations. But then, apparently as punishment for Zelensky not being &#x201C;grateful enough,&#x201D; as Vance put it, or as Trump and others have said, for &#x201C;not being ready for peace,&#x201D; reports sufaced the U.S. was halting military aid to Ukraine. Understandably, Ukrainians were outraged at the decision &#x2014; we did a piece collecting reactions. Read it here. The freeze reportedly goes into effect immediately, impacting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition and affecting not only future aid but also weapons already in transit. One of the most worrying aspects of the freeze in the immediate future is how Ukraine will replace the U.S.-provided air defense missiles that help protect Ukrainian cities from Russian aerial attacks. Beyond the shock of the U.S. pulling its support for Ukraine at a time like this, the impact of Ukraine being unable to protect its skies could have repercussions that extend for generations. Less protection means more civilian deaths and more damage to infrastructure. A less safe Ukraine means more people will flee abroad, which puts strain on both Europe&apos;s and Ukraine&#x2019;s economies. That&#x2019;s fewer people in Ukraine to help with recovery efforts post-war. Further damage to infrastructure means higher costs to rebuild. But the loss of the U.S. &#x2014; the world&#x2019;s largest military superpower &#x2014; as an ally runs the risk of a Russian victory in Ukraine and, ultimately, the disappearance of Ukraine itself. And what would that mean for the world? Truth be told, it saddens me to have to repeat points I&#x2019;ve made in this newsletter and elsewhere since the start of the full-scale invasion, but apparently, the world needs reminding. Ukraine&#x2019;s grain exports feed millions of people around the world. If those exports stop, even temporarily, people will be left without food, and prices will rise &#x2014; all over the world. It happened at the start of the war and can happen again. Millions &#x2014; yes, millions &#x2014; of Ukrainian refugees would flee across the border into Europe, causing a crisis. I hardly doubt any European country is ready for it. Russia would be in possession of all of Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources, and all those &#x201C;minerals&#x201D; everyone has been talking about would go to benefit Vladimir Putin and his cronies; it would be in control of the military-industrial complex that has been created in Ukraine over the last three years. Russia would be richer and stronger, and the world would be less safe. One thing that can and should be done to counteract the Trump administration&#x2019;s move away from Ukraine and toward Russia &#x2014; Europe must fully seize the some $200 billion of frozen Russian assets and send them to Ukraine. Markets have responded to the Zelensky-Trump-Vance showdown, with Ukraine&apos;s international bonds falling to their lowest point in over a month on March 3 as optimism wanes around a quick end to the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported. According to Tradeweb data cited by Reuters, the 2036 maturity experienced the steepest decline, dropping 4.5 cents to 60.775 cents on the dollar and reaching a one-month low. Bonds tied to economic performance declined the most, with trading activity remaining high, one trader told Reuters. &quot;The new U.S. administration calls for pessimism,&quot; Paul McNamara at GAM told Reuters. &quot;I see no economic reason to invest.&quot; Read more here. Ukraine&apos;s National Police conducts searches at one of the country&apos;s largest pharmaceutical companies on Feb. 28, 2025. (Ukraine&apos;s National Police / Facebook)Storm brewing?Late last week, on Feb. 28, just before Vance and Trump ambushed Zelenksy in the Oval Office, three of Ukraine&#x2019;s major pharmaceutical companies experienced their own unpleasant surprise. Ekonomichna Pravda reported, citing its source, that Ukraine&apos;s National Police had conducted searches at the offices and employee homes of Ukrainian pharmaceutical giants Arterium, Farmak, and Darnytsia. &quot;Those who are conducting searches are requesting information that could be obtained by simply sending a request. Everything is reminiscent of the &#x201C;Mazepa case,&#x201D; the source told EP. The &#x201C;Mazepa case&#x201D; in question refers to Ukrainian investor and businessman Ihor Mazepa, who in early 2024 was yanked out of his car at the border with Poland and searched by the police, while his accounts were frozen. It was widely considered punishment for speaking out against heavy-handed treatment by law enforcement on businesses. Why the raids? It&#x2019;s not exactly clear yet. Zelensky&#x2019;s administration could be putting pressure on the industry after he ordered the government to do something about &#x201C;unreasonably high drug prices&#x201D; in Ukraine. After Zelensky&#x2019;s statement about pricing, the government capped the markup of drug prices at 35% for over-the-counter drugs, and the Health Ministry announced that the price of the 100 most popular drugs would come down by 30% on March 1. KMPG UkraineM&amp;A: Staying the courseIn other news &#x2014; M&amp;A deals in 2024 showed relative stability despite the war, with the total volume of deals, 49, equal to that of 2023 and a disclosed total deal value of around $1.1 billion, KMPG said in a recent report. &#x201C;Despite a 15.7% decline in total overall deal value, adjusted figures that exclude exceptionally large transactions indicate a 40.5% increase,&#x201D; the Kyiv-based accounting firm wrote. Ukrainian capital staying in the country due to wartime currency restrictions, war risk insurance mechanisms, and government-led infrastructure recovery initiatives have all contributed to continued M&amp;A activity. It has also been helped along by Ukraine&#x2019;s privatization efforts, which delivered record revenues of Hr 12 billion ($300 million) in 2024, KMPG said in its report. Read the full report here. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has lowered its 2025 growth forecast for Ukraine&#x2019;s economy, now expecting 3.5% growth instead of the previously projected 4.7%. The downgrade comes as inflation accelerates due to the ongoing war, which reached 12% in December. After the London-based bank announced it had started offering some services in Ukraine on Feb. 11, Ukraine&#x2019;s central bank came out and said Revolut had not obtained the proper licence to do so. Revolut has denied any wrongdoing, saying that it is merely offering EU accounts to Ukrainian residents on a cross-border basis and that it does not plan to open Ukrainian accounts without further authorization. Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy company, DTEK, is in talks with several suppliers for a two-year liquefied natural gas import contract into the country, CEO Maxim Timchenko said in an interview at IE Week in London, Bloomberg reported. In June 2024, DTEK signed the first major deal with U.S. Venture Global to supply LNG to Ukraine for two years. It was the first time Ukraine purchased U.S. LNG directly. This figure includes direct and indirect damage caused by disrupted logistics, increased fertilizer and fuel costs, expenses for land reclamation and demining, and occupied territories, Agriculture Minister Vitalii Koval said on Feb. 25 during a World Bank report presentation. The agricultural sector plays a vital role in Ukraine&apos;s economy, comprising approximately 20% of the country&apos;s GDP.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-business-roundup-dark-days-for-ukraine/	2025-03-05T09:02:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201830448.jpg
How Trump’s Ukraine peace plan could backfire	U.S. President Donald Trump entered the White House promising to bring a swift end to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and his first few weeks in office have proven he&#x2019;s determined to follow through. While his endeavour to fulfil a campaign promise in itself is not too surprising, the way he is approaching the issue has stunned not only Ukraine, but also the U.S.&#x2019;s long-term global allies, who are now scrambling to adjust to a world in which Washington cannot be viewed as a reliable security partner. The Kyiv Independent spoke to George Barros, Russia team lead at the Institute for the Study of War, who explains why America&#x2019;s global adversaries will be &#x201C;salivating&#x201D; at what is currently unfolding on the global stage.	https://kyivindependent.com/how-trumps-ukraine-peace-plan-could-backfire/	2025-03-05T07:58:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_0406.jpg
70% of Americans say Ukraine is not to blame for war with Russia, poll shows	An overwhelming majority of Americans do not believe Ukraine is more to blame for the war waged against it by Russia, according to an Ipsos poll published by Reuters on March 5. The poll follows a dramatic shift in U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump, who has echoed Kremlin narratives, initiated direct talks with Moscow while excluding Kyiv, and accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of prolonging the war. According to the survey, 70% of adults surveyed disagreed with the statement &quot;Ukraine is more to blame for starting the war.&quot; Seven percent agreed. Among Democratic respondents, 81% rejected the idea that Ukraine was to blame, while 62% of Republicans shared that stance. The poll was conducted among 1,174 U.S. adults between March 3-4 and comes amid heightened tensions between Washington and Kyiv following the contentious Feb. 28 Oval Office meeting between Trump, Zelensky, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance. The talks, originally intended to finalize a mineral deal between the two countries, ended in a public dispute, leading to the cancellation of the agreement. Since the meeting, some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have escalated their criticism of Zelensky, with some even suggesting he should resign. Washington has also frozen all military aid to Ukraine, a move widely seen as an attempt to pressure Kyiv into peace talks with Moscow. Additionally, the U.S. has halted intelligence sharing with Ukraine, threatening its ability to strike Russian targets, CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed to Fox Business on March 5.	https://kyivindependent.com/70-of-americans-say-ukraine-is-not-to-blame-for-war-with-russia-poll-shows/	2025-03-05T07:56:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2147987555-1.jpg
Drone coalition mobilizes over $2 billion to boost Ukraine's defense, ministry says	The drone coalition has received over 2 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in assistance from partners in the first year of its operation, the Defense Ministry announced on March 5. The allied initiative, co-headed by the U.K. and Latvia, was launched in January 2024 to bolster Ukraine&apos;s arsenal of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which became a crucial capability on the battlefield. Nearly 20 countries joined the coalition as of late 2024. &quot;The main goal of the coalition is to provide the Ukrainian Defense Forces with drones and strengthen the defense industry of Ukraine and partner countries to create a technological advantage over... (Russia) in the long term,&quot; the statement read.Kyiv employs long-range drones to strike deep into Russian territory, targeting military infrastructure such as airfields, oil refineries, and logistical hubs. On Feb. 9, the Defense Ministry launched the &quot;Drone Line&quot; initiative to accelerate drone deployment on the battlefield. Ukraine has also developed long-range missile-drone hybrids, such as the Palianytsia and Peklo models, featuring turbojet engines as alternatives to cruise missiles. President Volodymyr Zelensky has set a target of producing at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/drone-coalition-receives-over-2-billion-from-partners-to-boost-ukraines-defense-ministry-says/	2025-03-05T05:50:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2152788960.jpg
Trump may resume Ukraine aid after further progress toward peace, White House says	U.S. President Donald Trump may lift the pause on military support for Ukraine once peace talks are arranged and more confidence-building measures are taken, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said on March 5, according to Reuters. Trump paused all military assistance and, reportedly, intelligence sharing earlier this week after his public spat with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, derailing plans to sign a bilateral deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources. White House officials signaled that Zelensky must issue an apology and demonstrate readiness for peace to get the talks back on track. On March 4, the Ukrainian president made a statement in which he called the quarrel &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his commitment to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Waltz called the statement a &quot;good, positive first step.&quot; Similarly, Trump voiced appreciation for Zelensky&apos;s words and mentioned the statement in his address to Congress. &quot;I think if we can nail down these negotiations and move towards these negotiations, and in fact, put some confidence-building measures on the table, then the president will take a hard look at lifting this pause,&quot; Waltz said on the Fox &amp; Friends program, according to Reuters. According to Trump&apos;s aide, officials are leading talks on a specific date, location, and team for the negotiations. Ukraine has repeatedly stressed that security guarantees that would prevent Russia from resuming its aggression at a later date are a necessary condition for any peace talks. The Trump administration has retorted that the minerals deal is a security commitment of its own and pushed to broker a quick resolution between Kyiv and Moscow. Zelensky reaffirmed his readiness to sign the deal in his statement on March 4, but CBS News reported that parameters are still unclear as Trump seeks better terms.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-may-resume-ukraine-aid-after-further-steps-toward-peace-confidence-building-white-house-says/	2025-03-05T05:41:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2200263755.jpg
Russia jails British volunteer fighting for Ukraine for 19 years	A Russian court sentenced James Scott Rhys Anderson, a British volunteer who was fighting for Ukraine in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, to 19 years in prison, independent outlet Mediazona reported on March 5. Footage of Anderson, 22, in Russian captivity emerged in November 2024. Russian authorities later confirmed that the British national was in their custody. The court sentenced Anderson on &quot;terrorism&quot; and &quot;mercenarism&quot; charges. Russia often portrays foreign volunteers fighting for Ukraine as &quot;mercenaries&quot; and claims they are not entitled to protection as prisoners of war. The British volunteer is to spend the first five years in prison and the rest of the term in a high-security penal colony. The court considered Anderson&apos;s case in a closed session. A soldier of the Ukrainian Armed Forces who served in the same unit as the U.K. national was allegedly brought in as a witness. Anderson pleaded guilty, according to the court. It is unclear whether the confession was forced, as Ukrainian officials and human rights groups pointed to widespread cases of abuse and torture of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POW) and captive civilians by Russia. Russia accused Anderson of &quot;illegally crossing the border&quot; into Kursk Oblast in mid-November in 2024 and committing &quot;criminal actions against civilians.&quot; The claims could not be verified, and Moscow has sentenced a number of Ukrainian POWs and volunteer fighters on similar charges without providing evidence. Two other Brits, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, were captured by Russian forces in Mariupol in 2022 and sentenced to death before being released in a prisoner exchange.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-jails-british-volunteer-fighting-for-ukraine-for-19-year/	2025-03-05T05:23:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-05-14_51_21.jpeg
Ukraine destroys Russian long-range surveillance system, shows combat footage	Drones of the Ukrainian Hart Brigade&apos;s Falcon unit destroyed a Russian Murom-M long-range surveillance system near the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces said on March 5. Vovchansk is an embattled town some 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv that has seen heavy battles since Russia launched a new offensive in the area in May 2024. Russian forces &quot;were not saved by the anti-drone net that covered it (Murom-M) from all sides. The first two &apos;birds&apos; of the Falcon pilots punched a hole in it, and the third finally destroyed the system,&quot; the statement read. 0:00/1&#xD7;The Hart Brigade reportedly destroyed the Russian Murom-M long-range surveillance system near the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces said on March 5, 2025. (Khortytsia group of forces/Telegram)Russian troops and a vehicle used to transport infantry and ammunition to their positions came under attack in the same area, the Khortytsia group of forces said. Throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing the way wars are fought. For outnumbered Ukrainian forces, drones have been one of the key weapons to strike Russian warships, naval bases, oil refineries, and airfields inside occupied territories and deep behind Russia&apos;s lines.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-forces-destroy-russian-long-range-surveillance-system-show-combat-footage/	2025-03-05T05:12:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-05-at-14_17_52.png
Why doesn't Zelensky wear a suit?	When President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived at the White House on Feb. 28 to discuss ending the war that had inflicted tremendous tragedy on his country since its escalation in 2022, he was asked a question he likely least expected to hear at such a critical moment. &quot;Why don&apos;t you wear a suit?&quot; &quot;You&apos;re at the highest level in this country&apos;s office, and you refuse to wear a suit,&quot; Brian Glenn, the chief White House correspondent for the right-wing Real America&apos;s Voice TV channel, asked Zelensky during his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. &quot;Do you own a suit?&quot; Glenn continued. &quot;A lot of Americans have problems with you not respecting the office.&quot; It was no coincidence that Glenn was the one asking this not only inappropriate but also extremely disrespectful question. Glenn is considered to be one of the favorite reporters of Trump and his supporters. He appeared to be merely mirroring Trump&#x2019;s irritation with Zelensky&#x2019;s outfit, which he had made clear just shortly before, while meeting Zelensky outside the White House upon arrival. &quot;You&apos;re all dressed up today,&#x201D; Trump said to a wartime leader. On that day, Zelensky was wearing a simple all-black outfit, in line with his wartime style that he had adopted on Feb. 24, 2022, when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Oval Office meeting between Zelensky and Trump led to a heated argument after an invited interference of U.S. Vice President JD Vance, resulting in the cancellation of a planned mineral deal and Trump&#x2019;s decision to halt all military aid for Ukraine on March 3. But amid a major U.S. foreign policy shift &#x2013; abandoning allies and aligning with a longtime adversary, Russia &#x2013; Glenn&#x2019;s suit question continued to make headlines and receive reactions on social media in the ensuing days. According to Zoya Zvynyatskivska, a Ukrainian fashion historian, comments about clothing are never the cause but rather the result of someone&apos;s prejudice and dislike, and it is impossible to dress in a way that would change that attitude. &#x201C;In Trump&apos;s mind, there is no war. Everything has already ended,&quot; Zvynyatskivska told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;If Zelensky takes off his military-style outfit and puts on a suit, what does that mean? It means he agrees that the war is over.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky meet in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, DC, U.S. on Feb. 28, 2025. (Andrew Harnik / Getty Images)&quot;Yes, Zelensky dresses demonstratively. But the only message he wants to convey with his clothing is: &apos;In my country, there is a war,&apos;&quot; Zvynyatskivska says. &quot;Everyone wants to forget. Everyone wants to move on. But he keeps reminding them.&quot; In response to Glenn&#x2019;s question, Zelensky said, &quot;I will wear a costume after this war will finish.&quot; &quot;Maybe something like yours, yes. Maybe something better, I don&apos;t know,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe something cheaper.&quot; Following the meeting, Axios reported, citing two anonymous sources, that Trump&apos;s advisers told Zelensky&apos;s team multiple times that it would be more respectful for Ukraine&apos;s leader to &quot;ditch his military-style attire&quot; when visiting the White House. &quot;One small but not insignificant factor&quot; that irritated Trump was the fact that Zelensky ultimately did not wear a suit, Axios reported. The last time Zelensky was seen in a suit was in his video address shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the start of the full-scale invasion in the early hours of Feb. 24, 2022. In his next address later that day, Zelensky appeared in a khaki T-shirt. The next morning, he wore a fleece pullover of the same color for his morning address. Since then, he has mostly been wearing military-style attire, only swapping it for a vyshyvanka &#x2014; a traditional Ukrainian embroidered shirt &#x2014; on holidays or special occasions. &quot;We all know that his life was already in danger on the very first day (of the full-scale invasion). Leaders of other countries even offered him evacuation, but he refused,&quot; Zvyniatskovska says. &quot;He was already wearing a bulletproof vest and comfortable clothing underneath it because, at that moment, his life was in danger.&quot; Even when Ukrainian troops liberated Kyiv Oblast in the spring of 2022 and the danger to his life was seemingly not as immediate, Zelensky chose to stick to simple military-style garments &#x201C;in solidarity with the people who are fighting,&#x201D; says Zvyniatskovska. &quot;He&apos;s not wearing military uniform,&quot; she says. &quot;But wearing khaki clothing that is convenient and hints at what is happening in your country &#x2014; I believe this is a beautiful, powerful non-verbal statement that reminds everyone who meets him (about the war in Ukraine).&quot; Left top: Pope Francis meets with President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Studio of Paul VI Hall in Vatican City on May 13, 2023.

(Aaron Chown / Pool / Getty Images)Zelensky has said numerous times that he would wear a suit only after Ukraine wins the war. In the documentary by Ukrainian journalist and TV host Dmytro Komarov called &quot;A Year,&quot; Zelensky even showed the blazer he plans to wear on Ukraine&apos;s victory day. &quot;It&apos;s a symbol. It means that the war will be over soon, we will win soon, and we all will wear suits again,&quot; Zelensky said. During the latest Oval Office meeting, Zelensky wore an all-black ensemble, including a polo shirt by the Ukrainian brand Damirli, adorned with a trident &#x2014; Ukraine&apos;s coat of arms. On Instagram, the brand wrote that the polo Zelensky wore is &quot;not merely a garment &#x2014; it is the uniform of a modern warrior, a symbol of the unbreakable spirit of a nation standing for its freedom.&quot; &quot;History remembers leaders whose choice of clothing became part of their fight and a reflection of their era,&quot; Damirli wrote. &quot;Yes, it&apos;s not a suit, but it&apos;s a kind of intermediate option. I think he really demonstrated respect,&quot; Zvyniatskovska says. &quot;Very modest, beautiful outfit in black, restrained color, no khaki.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s team, including Presidential Office Head Andriy Yermak who was wearing a suit on Feb. 28, adhered to the White House&apos;s formal dress code. &quot;They dressed according to the standard for an international event,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;Everyone on the team was dressed perfectly appropriately.&quot; But Zelensky&apos;s outfit was &quot;symbolic,&quot; it was a statement, according to Zvyniatskovska. Zelensky is not the first wartime leader to disregard official dress code during high-profile visits or meetings. The Ukrainian president is now often compared with U.K. Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who, during World War II, also chose not to wear a suit during his visit to the White House in January 1942.

(Hulton Archive / Getty Images)A photo of him dressed in a &quot;siren suit,&quot; a practical one-piece garment designed for air raids, went viral following the latest Oval Office clash. &quot;Zvyniatskovska says history offers many examples of people &#x2014; like Mother Teresa &#x2014; who chose to wear signature outfits as statements, even at high-profile events.&quot; &quot;He&apos;s not the first person in the 21st century to break standard etiquette rules to convey their message,&quot; Zvyniatskovska says, adding that Zelensky was wearing the same polo during his meeting with King Charles III in the U.K. on March 2. &quot;And everything went fine,&quot; she says. &quot;So it&apos;s not the clothing that is the problem.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s decision to stick to his wartime style during the Oval Office meeting gained significant support in Ukraine. When The Kyiv Independent asked people on the streets of Kyiv whether Zelensky should have worn a suit, the majority of respondents felt he made the right choice not to. &quot;As far as I remember, America supports freedom so, in my opinion, everyone can wear what they want,&quot; Stanislav Rakitin told the Kyiv Independent. Ukrainian soldier Vadym, who is stationed near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, told the Kyiv Independent that he, too, supports Zelensky&#x2019;s symbolic choice.

(Dursun Aydemir / Anadolu Agency / Getty Images)&quot;His position that he&apos;s at war and not into suits seems reasonable to me,&quot; he says. &#xA0; &quot;The fact that they&apos;ve been nitpicking about his clothing only shows their pitifulness. There&apos;s no need to apologize for anything. They&apos;re just nitpicking. They&apos;re looking for a reason. No one in the world said a word about it. (Former U.S. President Joe) Biden didn&apos;t say anything.&quot; &#xA0; Ukrainian journalist and soldier Petro Shuklinov says that Zelensky&apos;s attire not only sends a message to the world but also to his own soldiers, emphasizing: &#x201C;I am here to bring weapons. I am here to bring security. My country is at war, and I represent my country. I cannot do otherwise.&apos;&quot; &quot;I didn&apos;t vote for him, but for me, the president is an institution. And now, wherever he is, he represents me, my country, and all our people. Criticizing him is criticizing me. And if anyone wants to make a remark to me, I invite them to come to Ukraine,&quot; Shuklinov said. Hi, this is Daria Shulzhenko, the author of this story. After watching the now infamous Oval Office meeting multiple times, I can say this: No matter what President Volodymyr Zelensky wore that day, the outcome would have been the same. It was never about his outfit &#x2014; it was about how he was treated. But I hope this piece serves as a reminder that Ukrainian soldiers are the ones fighting the hardest battle for freedom right now. And as you can see, they have no issue with what he wears. While they are on the battlefield, we are making sure their voices are heard around the world. So please consider supporting our reporting.	https://kyivindependent.com/why-doesnt-zelensky-wear-a-suit/	2025-03-05T04:36:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Artboard-1.jpg
US halts intelligence sharing with Ukraine, FT reports	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. The U.S. has halted intelligence sharing with Kyiv, threatening Ukraine&apos;s ability to strike Russian targets amid the full-scale war, the Financial Times (FT) reported on March 5, citing undisclosed sources. The reported move follows Washington&apos;s decision to freeze all military aid supplies to Ukraine following a public spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. There have been conflicting claims as to whether this also concerns intelligence sharing, a crucial capability that allows Ukraine to strike Russian targets. The British tabloid Daily Mail previously reported that the U.S. banned the U.K. from sharing Washington-obtained intelligence with Kyiv. Ukrainian and U.S. officials have not confirmed the claims, which could not be independently verified.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-halts-intelligence-sharing-with-ukraine-ft-reports/	2025-03-05T04:26:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1494251877.jpg
Russia's oil, gas budget revenue in February drops by 18% year-on-year	Russia&apos;s budget revenue from oil and gas trade in February decreased by 18% year-on-year and by 2.3% compared to January, Reuters reported on March 5, citing Russian Finance Ministry data. Oil and gas revenues last month amounted to 771.3 billion rubles ($8.6 billion), a significant drop from 945.6 billion rubles ($10.5 billion) in February 2024 and a moderate decrease in comparison to 789.1 billion rubles ($8.8 billion) in January 2025. The news underscores Russia&apos;s economic woes amid its full-scale war against Ukraine and the heavy Western sanctions imposed since 2022. Oil and gas exports, which have traditionally represented a significant portion of Russia&apos;s federal budget revenue and play a key role in sustaining its war economy, have been particularly targeted by Western economic restrictions. The previous U.S. Biden administration rolled out several waves of sanctions against Russia&apos;s oil and gas industry and its &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of tankers, most recently in January. The EU, which has traditionally been the primary buyer of Russian fossil fuels, sought to pivot away from Russian supplies while Ukraine has launched a campaign of long-range drone strikes against Russia&apos;s energy facilities. In spite of this, fossil fuel exports continue to be crucial in feeding Russia&apos;s war chest, representing about 30% of the country&apos;s federal revenue last year. Moscow has managed to redirect much of its sales to other major markets, such as China and India. A February study also showed that while EU countries spent about $20.3 billion in military support for Ukraine in 2024, they bought Russian fossil fuels worth about $23.5 billion in the same period. The future of sanctions against Russia also remains uncertain as the new Trump administration, which has adopted a more amicable stance toward Moscow, floated the idea of sanctions relief as part of peace efforts. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-oil-gas-revenue-in-february-drops-by-18-year-on-year/	2025-03-05T03:50:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
Minsk could be best place for trilateral talks between Russia, US, Ukraine, Kremlin says	Minsk could be the best place to host potential trilateral talks between the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Russian news agency Interfax on March 5. Peskov&apos;s statement follows a proposal by Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko to host U.S. President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for peace talks. &quot;This issue has not been brought up or discussed in any way. But, of course, Minsk is the best place for us. It is our main ally, so it is the best place for negotiations,&quot; Peskov said. According to Peskov, the Kremlin is &quot;positive&quot; about Zelensky&apos;s stated readiness to &quot;come to the negotiating table.&quot; In a statement on March 4, the Ukrainian president said that he and his team &quot;stand ready to work under President Trump&#x2019;s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts.&quot; He went on to propose the release of prisoners and a partial truce in the air and sea as first steps toward a peace deal. Zelensky&apos;s overture came days after his public clash with Trump in the Oval Office and after the U.S. paused all military aid to pressure Ukraine to talks. &quot;The question is with whom to sit (at the negotiating table). So far, there is still a legal prohibition for the Ukrainian president to negotiate with the Russian side. Therefore, in general, the approach is positive, but the nuances have not yet changed,&quot; Peskov added. Trump&apos;s recent stance on Ukraine, including his public rebuke of Zelensky and reported halt on U.S. military aid to Kyiv, has drawn praise from Russian officials while raising concerns among European allies. Since taking office, Trump has distanced the U.S. from its traditional role as Ukraine&apos;s primary supporter, instead questioning Kyiv&apos;s commitment to peace and implying that Ukraine shares blame for the ongoing war. Trump, echoing Kremlin rhetoric on the war in Ukraine, said at the end of February the country should &quot;forget&quot; about joining NATO, which the country sees as a security guarantee against a future Russian invasion. Russia has repeatedly presented NATO expansion as a &quot;justification&quot; for the war. The U.S. also voted alongside Russia on Feb. 24 against a U.N. resolution that condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/minsk-could-be-best-place-for-trilateral-talks-between-russia-us-ukraine-kremlin-says/	2025-03-05T03:35:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245735181.jpeg
US military aid freeze remains in place so far despite Zelensky's statement, WSJ reports	The pause on U.S. military assistance for Ukraine will remain in place until U.S. President Donald Trump decides that President Volodymyr Zelensky supports peace talks with Russia, the Wall Street Journal reported on March 5, citing undisclosed U.S. official sources. The sources reportedly said it remains unclear whether Zelensky&apos;s recent statement, in which he affirmed commitment to peace and called his public spat with Trump &quot;regrettable,&quot; would be enough to restart the U.S. aid. Relations between Kyiv and Washington have been tense in recent weeks, especially after Zelensky, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance entered into a heated argument in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. The spat, after which the U.S. leaders berated Zelensky as &quot;ungrateful&quot; and not &quot;ready for peace,&quot; derailed the signing of a natural resources agreement and preceded the Trump administration&apos;s decision to freeze all military assistance flowing to Ukraine. Officials from Trump&apos;s team, including his special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, privately stressed to Zelensky the need to mend the rift quickly before Trump&apos;s address to Congress on March 4, CNN reported, citing sources. The U.K. government has also reportedly played a major role in convincing Zelensky. According to the Telegraph, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the Ukrainian president on March 4 to urge him to back Trump&apos;s mineral agreement and relay what the U.S. president wished to hear. After Zelensky published his statement on social media, Trump voiced appreciation for his words but made no direct comment on the aid freeze. The New York Times also reported that the aid freeze remains in place at the moment. While U.S. officials stressed that the signing of the mineral deal is not fully off the table, it remains unclear when and if it will be signed. CBS News reported that Trump is currently seeking a &quot;bigger, better deal&quot; with Ukraine instead.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-military-aid-freeze-remains-in-place-so-far-despite-zelenskys-statement-wsj-reports/	2025-03-05T02:38:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203348355--1-.jpg
Utterly staggered' — Trump's Ukraine military aid freeze threatens the world order, expert says	A decision by the White House to suspend all military aid to Ukraine has stunned Kyiv and its European allies, throwing the very future of the established world order into doubt. &quot;I&apos;m utterly staggered. It&apos;s just extraordinary,&quot; Timothy Ash, associate fellow at the Chatham House&#x2019;s Russia and Eurasia Programme, told the Kyiv Independent on March 4. &quot;It&apos;s almost like the collapse of the Soviet Union if you think of the scale of what we&apos;re seeing now, it&apos;s utterly remarkable.&quot; Ash said the implications of the military aid freeze, as well as U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s hostile rhetoric towards President Volodymyr Zelensky in recent weeks, will have profound implications not only for Ukraine, but the entire world. The Kyiv Independent: What&apos;s your initial reaction to the U.S. freezing military aid to Ukraine? Timothy Ash: Well, it&apos;s very disappointing and sad. I guess one conclusion from the White House meeting on Friday was that clearly the Trump administration is in the (Russian President Vladimir) Putin camp. I mean, NATO is kind of dead. Any idea that the U.S. will provide some kind of security guarantee to NATO and any peacekeeping operation in Ukraine is&#x2026; it&apos;s pretty clear that&apos;s not going to happen. The only positive for Ukraine, I guess, is that it&apos;s clear now where it stands. It&apos;s clear where it stands in respect to the U.S. and it has to make its decisions accordingly. The Kyiv Independent: Can you place all of this historically in terms of how significant these events are that we&apos;re seeing? Timothy Ash: Well, to be honest, it&apos;s utterly shocking. The mainstay of European security since World War II has been NATO. And I think people like (U.S. Vice President) JD Vance forget that the U.S. triggered Article 5 after the 9/11 terror attack &#x2014; NATO allies rallied around the U.S. It&apos;s also interesting that over the last few hours or 24 hours at least, Vance has been criticising some European countries in terms of their military capability. That&apos;s not gone down very well in the U.K. in particular, given that the U.K. and European countries also stood behind the U.S. in Afghanistan and Iraq. I mean, we lost (635) soldiers in both conflicts. So it is simply extraordinary&#x2026; that we need to think of a new security architecture in Europe. We&apos;re seeing huge shifts, tectonic shifts in alliances that I don&apos;t think anyone could quite have imagined. This idea that the Americans and the Russians are going to ally up against the Chinese, Europe left stranded &#x2014; what&apos;s Europe going to do? I mean it&apos;s just utterly extraordinary. The penny seems to have dropped in Europe, finally. They realize that they need to increase their own defense spending and ramp up military production. Obviously, we&apos;ve had announcements this morning from (European Commission President Ursula) Von der Leyen and various European politicians in that regard. But in the end, there is a short-term gap. Years of underinvestment, years of neglect in terms of defense spending have left us dependent on the Americans. Going forward, that can&apos;t endure. We have to change. How we get through the transition period is kind of difficult. The immediate problem is obviously Ukraine &#x2014; how we help Ukraine get through this existential threat to its survival. And longer term, Europe has to see Ukraine as being pretty central to its own defense with the Americans gone. Ukraine is a very capable military force. Almost the only thing standing behind Europe and Russia at the moment is Ukraine. So how do we work better with the Ukrainians to help build our own defense? That&apos;s a huge question mark. How do I put it into perspective? I&apos;m utterly staggered. It&apos;s just extraordinary. It&apos;s almost like the collapse of the Soviet Union if you think of the scale of what we&apos;re seeing now, it&apos;s utterly remarkable. The Kyiv Independent: The collapse of the Soviet Union was a generally positive event for the West &#x2013; is it fair to say that the ramifications of this change are going to be largely negative? Timothy Ash: The collapse of the Soviet Union set in motion many of the problems that we&apos;re dealing with today. Essentially, we spent the peace dividend. We assumed we&apos;d won the Cold War. And now, those chickens are coming home to roost. But we need to move on. It&apos;s the reality. We are where we are. And it&apos;s crystal clear now that the U.S. is not a reliable partner. Europe has some leverage &#x2014; it&apos;s a big economy, $27 trillion. It has buying power. I&apos;m not worried about the finances of stepping up defense production. I&apos;m just worried about the physical challenge of actually producing and buying weapons. In the short term, you&apos;d imagine the Americans would still be willing to sell them to Europe. It would be a huge market. And then eventually, Europe will step up and will be a significant arms producer. And again, I would imagine that would give it leverage also with the Americans. If in the end, this is a hegemonic battle for supremacy between the U.S. and China, I do find it a bit ironic, or a bit strange that the Americans have decided to tag along to the Russian economy, which is a $2 trillion economy. Ultimately, I don&apos;t see Russia giving the U.S. the scale in terms of that hegemonic battle with China. Europe is the economy that can give the Americans scale. So we have leverage. We have leverage in the short term in terms of purchases of weapons, big arms procurement deals that can produce, give jobs to Trump in the U.S. economy. And then longer term, I think it&apos;s very hard for the Americans to ignore the sheer scale of the European economy and its ability to help in terms of that hegemonic battle with the Chinese. And ultimately, if the Americans decide to do something else, then Europe should look for alternatives, right? It should look to improve its relations with China, it should look for better relations with Turkey and the Gulf states &#x2014; it should diversify its own national security. The Kyiv Independent: At least in the short term, is Russia the main winner out of all that&apos;s happening at the moment? Timothy Ash: In respect to Ukraine, you&apos;ve got to think so, yes. It&apos;s extraordinary that Trump went into negotiations with Russia over Ukraine. With a strong negotiating hand &#x2014; he could have ramped up sanctions, ramped up military supplies to Ukraine, there&apos;s lots of stuff to negotiate on territory, NATO membership, and he&apos;s given everything away before there&apos;s even been any negotiations. It&apos;s quite extraordinary. The Russians must think this is manna from heaven &#x2014; they just can&apos;t believe their luck. And we&apos;ve seen that Russia is now going back to its maximalist demands, this idea of the &quot;denazification&quot; of Kyiv, which means regime change, in effect. Ukraine is not a Nazi state, it&apos;s a democracy. But the Russians like to push that kind of angle. And also the demilitarization of Ukraine, which essentially means putting limitations on Ukraine&apos;s conventional military capability and its ability to defend itself, because they want to invade again. Unfortunately, because of Trump&apos;s shenanigans, the start of the negotiations has shifted significantly east &#x2014; we could have started around NATO membership. Ukraine may not likely have been given NATO membership, but it would have given some leverage for the negotiating team from the West. And a lot of this is in the context of negotiations around this mineral deal. And there&apos;s a chance that the freezing of aid is just a temporary thing and it&apos;s all designed to strong arm Zelensky into signing this mineral deal. Russian President Vladimir Putin smiles before the BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia, on Oct. 22, 2024. (Contributor/Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Even if it is a negotiating tactic, it&apos;s causing a lot of damage. Timothy Ash: We&apos;ve already seen the damage to NATO itself. Faith and trust in NATO, trust in the U.S. as an ally has been very badly damaged. The scenes in the White House may have gone down well with some MAGA supporters in the U.S., but I think, from a world perspective, any foreign observer looking at that would say that this is just another U.S. ally that&apos;s been left down. Let down by the Americans like Afghanistan, like Iraq, like Vietnam&#x2026; there&apos;s a very long list of partners that the Americans have not stood by. I think that&apos;s very damaging to the U.S. over the long term. With the minerals deal, it seems to be the case that Trump wants a quick deal, he wants a quick win. He views the mineral deal as that. He views a ceasefire deal as a quick win. And Trump&apos;s not very good on the detail, right? I think the problem most Europeans have with the White House thinking around a ceasefire is, we&apos;ve been there before. We&apos;ve been there before with Minsk I, Minsk II &#x2013; numerous ceasefires have been broken (by the Russians). It&apos;s all pretty worrying for Ukraine. Ukraine has a good long-term outlook. Its economic position could be good with EU accession, recovery, and reconstruction bills, but it needs security. No investor will invest around this minerals deal if they don&apos;t feel Ukraine is secure. And how would you ensure security? That&apos;s the key question. The deal itself is not sufficient enough. The Kyiv Independent: Is there a chance that this could all backfire for the Trump administration? Timothy Ash: It weakens trust and confidence in the Americans. I would think Europe will be looking for alternatives. And if the Americans come asking for European help against China or another 9/11, I think Europe will say, &quot;no thank you. You made your choices on Ukraine.&quot; And mismanaging this peace process could be politically very damaging for (Trump). This could be, in terms of scale, multiple times more damaging than the disastrous U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Any deal that doesn&apos;t leave Ukraine secure could see the military collapse of Ukraine &#x2013; the social, economic, and political collapse of Ukraine &#x2013; and a complete victory of Russia over Ukraine. And I think that would be a devastating blow to European security and political, social instability also, because I think tens of millions of Ukrainians would move west. And that would be Trump&apos;s responsibility. He would have caused that. Does he care? Does he really understand any of this? I have my doubts.	https://kyivindependent.com/utterly-staggered-trumps-ukraine-military-aid-freeze-threatens-the-world-order-expert-says/	2025-03-05T02:27:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2198948272.jpg
Most French support assistance to Ukraine, sending peacekeepers, poll shows	Roughly two-thirds of the French favor maintaining or increasing aid to Ukraine and sending peacekeepers after the end of hostilities, BFM TV reported on March 4, citing a survey by the Elabe Institute. Many European leaders have reiterated their ongoing support for Ukraine amid U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s push for a swift deal to end the war. Still, some allies in Europe fear that they will have to shoulder the economic and security burdens of Ukraine&apos;s post-war recovery as the U.S. and Russia exclude them from talks on ending the war. Some 64% of respondents want France to continue providing assistance to Ukraine. Meanwhile, 20% of respondents believe that the amount of aid must be increased, and 44% think that it should be at the same level as it is now, according to the survey. Another 18% of respondents believe support must be reduced, and 17% say it should be terminated. Voters of the pro-Macron centrist coalition Ensemble, as well as the left-wing New Popular Front, are in favor of continued aid, while voters of the right-wing National Rally (FN) mostly want it reduced or terminated, BFM TV reported. France has allocated around 4.9 billion euros ($5.3 billion) in military assistance to Ukraine as of December 2024, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy said. This included Caesar howitzers, AMX-10RC armored vehicles, and Mirage 2000 jets. While ranking high in overall support, France has allocated a smaller portion of its GDP to support Ukraine than some smaller European nations, like the Netherlands, Denmark, or the Baltic countries. Though the share of those who want to continue supporting Ukraine has been growing since June 2024, three out of four respondents say they are not ready to pay more taxes for this purpose. Only 24% say they are ready to contribute. Around 68% of respondents opposed deploying French soldiers to Ukraine while the hostilities are ongoing. At the same time, 67% support sending peacekeeping troops after the signing of a peace agreement with Moscow to guarantee security and peace in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer have been spearheading the idea of deploying peacekeeping troops to Ukraine to monitor a ceasefire. Regarding NATO, 40% of respondents favored Ukraine&apos;s accession after the war, and 30% now. Some 35% of respondents favored Ukraine joining the European Union after the war, and 31% favored it now. While President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Ukraine&apos;s preferred postwar security guarantee is NATO membership, the U.S. leadership has severely undercut that aim in the past few days. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said during the Ramstein summit on Feb. 12 that Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership was not a &quot;realistic outcome&quot; of peace negotiations. He also said that a return to the country&apos;s pre-2014 borders was &quot;an unrealistic objective.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/most-french-support-continued-assistance-to-ukraine-sending-peacekeepers-media-reports/	2025-03-05T01:57:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2008845928.jpg
Merz seeks to quickly push through $3.2 billion in German aid for Ukraine	Friedrich Merz, Germany&apos;s likely next chancellor, said he wants a defense aid package for Ukraine worth roughly 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion) approved by the current, outgoing parliament, Le Monde and AFP reported on March 4. Speaking at a press conference, Merz said he plans to raise the issue with outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has opposed the package unless funded by additional government borrowing. Germany&apos;s incoming chancellor has presented extensive plans to reform debt break rules to boost defense spending as Europe is expected to take more responsibility for its security and Ukraine during the U.S. presidency of Donald Trump. Merz&apos;s conservative CDU/CSU alliance won the parliamentary elections on Feb. 23 with almost 29% of the vote. The Christian Democrats are in talks with Scholz&apos;s Social Democratic Party (SPD) on forming a new government, though the outgoing chancellor said he would not be personally part of the coalition negotiations. Germany has allocated 4 billion euros ($4.1 billion) in military support for Ukraine this year, and the additional package would raise this to 7 billion ($7.2 billion). The defense articles contained in the new assistance include three IRIS-T air defense systems, three Skyranger air defense systems, 10 howitzers, surface-to-air missiles, 20 protective vehicles, artillery shells, and drones, the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported. According to Merz, the additional aid &quot;can be approved now as off-budget expenditure.&quot; The CDU chairman has also unveiled plans for a massive defense spending boost, establishing a 500-billion-euro ($535 billion) special development and defense fund and exempting defense spending above 1% of GDP from debt break rules. As changes to debt break rules need support from two-thirds of the parliament to pass, Merz hopes to negotiate the bills&apos; passage with pro-Ukraine moderate parties in the current Bundestag as quickly as possible. In the next parliament, which must convene no later than March 25, Merz could expect stronger opposition. Roughly one-third of the seats will be held by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the Left Party (Die Linke), both of which oppose military aid for Ukraine. Germany has been Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. Berlin&apos;s role is especially important now that the Trump administration has frozen defense assistance for Ukraine, seeking to push Kyiv to the negotiating table.	https://kyivindependent.com/merz-seeks-to-quickly-push-through-3-2-billion-in-german-aid-for-ukraine/	2025-03-05T01:35:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/e99dfedf4f71ca1b5c178d4d5f33105c_1733742724_extra_large.jpeg
Ukraine natural resources deal not ready as Trump seeks better terms, CBS News reports	An agreement between Kyiv and Washington on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources is not finalized as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks a &quot;bigger, better deal,&quot; CBS News reported on March 4, citing undisclosed sources. The painstakingly negotiated deal was scheduled to be signed on Feb. 28, but that plan was derailed after a public clash between Trump and Zelensky, leaving the agreement&apos;s fate uncertain. After the U.S. froze military assistance for Kyiv, Zelensky issued a statement in which he called the spat &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his readiness to sign the minerals deal and work toward peace. Reuters reported that the deal was expected to be signed on March 4, but this claim was disputed by U.S. officials, and no agreement was concluded that day. CBS News did not clarify what terms Trump wants to see renegotiated. The long-debated agreement would establish a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the future monetization of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. The U.S. has reportedly put forth three proposals of the mineral deal, but the Ukrainian side has turned down the first two because they did not include security agreements, even as Washington ramped up the pressure. The third version was also free of concrete security commitments but included a line reading that the fund &quot;will be reinvested at least annually in Ukraine to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine.&quot; The Trump administration has been reluctant to commit to Ukraine&apos;s security, arguing that the economic agreement is a security guarantee of itself and that Europe should take responsibility for Kyiv&apos;s defense.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-minerals-deal-not-ready-as-trump-seeks-better-terms-cbs-new-reports/	2025-03-05T00:44:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202607825.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, injure 7 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed at least two civilians and injured at least seven others over the past day, regional authorities reported on March 5. Russian forces launched 181 drones from the Russian cities of Oryol, Kursk, Bryansk, Millerovo, Primorsk-Akhtarsk, and from Cape Chauda in the Russian-occupied Crimea against Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Russia also reportedly launched three Iskander M/KN-23 ballistic missiles from Voronezh Oblast and an S-300 anti-aircraft guided missile from Kursk Oblast. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 115 drones over Kharkiv, Sumy, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Odesa, and Cherkasy oblasts, the Air Force said. Another 55 drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are often decoys that Russia launches alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 29 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, one person was killed and six others were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Russian forces attacked Odesa Oblast and its regional center of Odesa with drones and ballistic missiles, according to Governor Oleh Kiper. During the attack, Russia targeted critical infrastructure in Odesa, causing power, water, and heat supply outages in the city. A Russian strike against the village of Lymanka on Odesa&apos;s outskirts killed a 77-year-old man, according to the statement. Russian aerial strikes also targeted an energy facility of Ukraine&apos;s largest private energy company, DTEK, in Odesa Oblast overnight, the company announced. This was the fourth Russian attack in two weeks on the oblast&apos;s power grid. In Donetsk Oblast, a Russian strike injured a civilian in the town of Pokrovsk, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Kharkiv Oblast, Russian forces attacked the village of Kozacha Lopan with a glide bomb, injuring a 41-year-old man, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-2-injure-7-over-past-day/	2025-03-05T00:31:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-05-09_31_48.jpeg
Zelensky, Macron, Starmer may visit Washington next week, media reports	President Volodymyr Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer might visit Washington as early as next week to present a &quot;united front&quot; on peace in Ukraine, the British tabloid Daily Mail reported on March 5, citing undisclosed diplomatic sources. The meeting would follow Zelensky&apos;s televised clash with U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, which derailed the planned signing of a mineral deal and preceded Washington&apos;s decision to halt military aid for Ukraine. Macron and Starmer, who visited Washington just days before Zelensky to sway Trump toward playing a role in Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability, have since then sought to mend the rift between Kyiv and the White House. &#xA0; On March 4, the same day he held a phone call with Starmer, Zelensky issued a statement in which he called the Oval Office clash &quot;regrettable&quot; while voicing readiness to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Zelensky also proposed initial steps toward peace, including the release of prisoners and a ceasefire in the air and sea, a proposal that was previously mentioned by Macron. During his address to Congress, Trump said he &quot;appreciates&quot; Zelensky&apos;s statement but made no direct comment on the aid freeze or the proposed truce. The leaders of Ukraine, France, and the U.K. are hoping to discuss the plan with Trump during their potential visit to Washington, the Daily Mail wrote. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Officials have not publicly commented on a possible trip of the three leaders to the U.S. The news comes as the Trump administration upends years of Washington&apos;s policy on Ukraine and Russia while casting doubt on its commitment to European security. Starmer and Macron have shaped up to be leading voices in the efforts to boost Europe&apos;s own defense capabilities and assistance for Ukraine, spearheading a plan to deploy thousands of peacekeepers in the country to monitor a potential ceasefire.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-macron-starmer-may-visit-washington-next-week-media-reports/	2025-03-04T23:59:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202256775.jpg
Russia launches counter-terrorist operation in Dagestan, kills 4, authorities claim	Russian authorities killed four militants overnight on March 5 in a counter-terrorist operation in Dagestan aimed against the Islamic State terrorist organization, Russia&apos;s National Anti-Terrorism Committee claimed. The militants &quot;were planning to commit a terrorist act at a facility of the regional administration of the Russian Interior Ministry in the (Dagestani) city of Kaspiysk,&quot; the committee said in a statement. &quot;There were no casualties among the civilian population or losses among law enforcement personnel.&quot; The statement came after reports of an attack by a group of unknown assailants against a police station in Makhachkala, the region&apos;s capital. A counter-terrorist operation was announced at 0:25 a.m. local time. Russia&apos;s predominantly Muslim Republic of Dagestan, lying in the North Caucasus, has seen a number of terrorist attacks by Islamic radicals and clashes with security forces over the past years. During one such attack in June 2024, 17 police officers and five civilians were killed, along with five perpetrators who opened fire against snagoygues and churches in the cities of Derbent and Makhachkala. Following the operation on March 5, Russian authorities claimed they had discovered grenade launchers, improvised explosive devices, grenades, machine guns, a pistol, and ammunition at the site of the skirmish and in a nearby cache. &quot;According to available data, the gang&apos;s activities were coordinated by members of the Islamic State,&quot; the committee said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Russia suffered one of its deadliest terrorist attacks in March 2024 when several assailants linked to the Islamic State opened fire in the Crocus City Hall near Moscow, killing 145 people.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-kills-4-in-counter-terrorist-operation-in-dagestan-authorities-claim/	2025-03-04T23:11:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-167533303.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 880,660 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 880,660 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on March 5. This number includes 1,250 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,256 tanks, 21,304 armored fighting vehicles, 39,512 vehicles and fuel tanks, 24,087 artillery systems, 1,306 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,094 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 27,849 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-880-660-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-03-04T22:42:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2166298605.jpg
Vance denies lack of Trump admin's pressure on Russia	U.S. Vice President JD Vance disputed on March 4 that the Trump administration was not pressuring Moscow to bring it to peace talks, arguing that the existing sanctions are straining Russia&apos;s economy. &quot;Well, I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s right, actually,&quot; Vance replied to a journalist who suggested that Washington is exerting pressure on Kyiv but not on Moscow. &quot;We still have a number of sanctions that are placed on Russians. We do believe the Russians, economically, are struggling because of this conflict.&quot; The comments came the same day that the U.S. froze crucial military assistance for Ukraine in an attempt to pressure Kyiv to the negotiating table. The decision came after a public dispute between President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and Vance in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, &#xA0;after which U.S. leaders berated the Ukrainian president for not being &quot;ready for peace&quot; and supposed lack of gratitude. The aid freeze raised concerns among Kyiv&apos;s other partners and was welcomed by the Kremlin, whose all-out war against Ukraine entered its fourth year. The U.S. has intensified diplomatic outreach to Moscow, holding two rounds of bilateral talks last month. The Trump administration has so far kept the sanctions against Russia imposed by the Biden administration in place, but the U.S. media reported that the White House is considering easing some of them as part of a peace process. &quot;We believe it is in Russia&apos;s best interest, and the United States&apos; and Ukraine&apos;s best interest, to bring this conflict to a close. We believe applying pressure to everybody to stop the killing. That&#x2019;s what the president&#x2019;s policy is,&quot; Vance said. Trump has not proposed any new sanctions against Russia and has praised his contacts with the Kremlin while adopting an increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Ukraine. Vance&apos;s comments came ahead of Trump&apos;s address to a joint session of Congress, during which the U.S. president reiterated the need to end the war as quickly as possible but made no direct mention of the aid freeze. Trump also said he appreciated Zelensky&apos;s statement in support of peace and claimed that both Russia and Ukraine are ready for talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/vance-disputes-lack-of-trump-admins-pressure-on-russia/	2025-03-04T22:36:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203259450.jpg
Lukashenko invites Trump, Zelensky, Putin to hold talks in Minsk	Minsk is prepared to host the leaders of the United States, Ukraine, and Russia for talks on ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko said in an interview on March 4. Lukashenko&apos;s remarks follow shortly after the U.S. imposed an immediate freeze on military aid to Ukraine, in a move the White House claimed was meant to pressure President Volodymyr Zelensky into entering peace negotiations. In an interview with American internet personality Mario Nawfal that aired on Belarusian state media, Lukashenko said he was willing to help U.S. President Donald Trump achieve his goal of brokering peace between Kyiv and Moscow. &quot;If you want, come here,&quot; he said, speaking to Nawfal in Minsk. &quot;It&apos;s only 200 kilometers from the Belarusian border to Kyiv. Half an hour by plane. You are welcome to come. We will sit down here. We&apos;ll come to an agreement quietly, without noise, without shouting. So tell Trump: I&apos;m waiting for him here, along with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and Zelensky. We&apos;ll sit down and calmly negotiate. If you want to make a deal.&quot; Despite the invitation, Lukashenko stressed that he did not want to act as a mediator between other nations. &quot;Most of all, I hate mediation. It means being between someone and pretending that you can do something,&quot; he said. Belarus previously hosted talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 2014 and 2015, leading to the Minsk Agreements. The agreements were meant to stop the Donbas war, triggered by Russia&apos;s invasion of eastern Ukraine in 2014. Russia violated both agreements. Two days before launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Putin declared that the Minsk Agreements &quot;no longer existed.&quot; Zelensky brought up Russia&apos;s violation of prior agreements during his Oval Office meeting with Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance, in an attempt to explain the importance of concrete security guarantees for Ukraine. Trump and Vance responded by berating Zelensky, accusing him of being ungrateful for U.S. assistance. Days later, the U.S. halted military aid to Ukraine. In a joint address to both chambers of the U.S. Congress on March 4, Trump made little mention of the decision, but said he planned to work with &quot;both sides&quot; to stop the war in Ukraine. &#xA0; Belarus remains a staunch ally of the Kremlin. While it has not committed its own troops to the battlefield in Ukraine, it allowed the Russian military to use its territory and infrastructure extensively during the launch of the full-scale invasion. Zelensky claimed on Feb. 14 that Russia is once again building up troops in Belarus, possibly in preparation for large-scale operations against NATO countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-invites-trump-zelensky-putin-to-hold-talks-in-minsk/	2025-03-04T21:14:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1257742097.jpg
Do you want to keep it going for another 5 years?' — Trump on aid to Ukraine	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. President Donald Trump did not directly discuss his decision to halt military aid to Ukraine in his address to a joint session of Congress on March 4. Multiple news outlets on March 3 reported that the Trump administration ordered an immediate freeze on all U.S. military aid to Ukraine. &quot;The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine&apos;s defense,&quot; Trump said. &quot;With no security, with no anything. Do you want to keep it going for another five years?&quot; That question was Trump&apos;s only nod to the suspension of aid, which a White House official said on March 4 is meant to pressure &#xA0;President Volodymyr Zelensky into peace negotiations. Trump said in his address that he &quot;appreciate(s)&quot; Zelensky&apos;s recent statements expressing Ukraine&apos;s readiness for peace, but did not say whether or not the U.S. would resume weapons deliveries. Zelensky on March 4 reiterated Ukraine&apos;s commitment to the peace process in a post on X. &quot;Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians,&quot; &#xA0;he wrote. Zelensky proposed initial steps toward de-escalation with Russia, including prisoner of war (POW) releases, a &quot;truce at sea,&quot; and a &quot;truce in the sky&quot; that would ban missiles, long-range drones, and bombs targeting civilian infrastructure. He also said Ukraine is ready to sign the critical minerals deal &quot;at any time and in any convenient format.&quot; Trump said in his address to Congress that he received that same message in a letter from Zelensky. He added that his team was seeing &quot;strong signals&quot; from Russia indicating that Moscow is ready to make peace. While Trump&apos;s remarks on Ukraine and Russia were short on details, his comments indicated that he wants Europe to foot the bill for Ukraine&apos;s defense. &quot;Europe has spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending Ukraine,&quot; he said. The decision to halt aid came on the heels of a contentious meeting in the Oval Office between Zelensky, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance. The U.S. leaders berated Zelensky for continuing to stress Ukraine&apos;s need for security guarantees, accusing him of being insufficiently grateful for American assistance. Zelensky was ordered to leave the White House, and departed without signing the much-anticipated minerals deal between the U.S. and Ukraine. Trump later claimed that Zelensky &quot;is not ready for peace.&quot; The suspension affects over $1 billion in arms and ammunition deliveries. It halts not only future aid but also weapons already in transit, including shipments on aircraft and ships, as well as equipment awaiting transfer in Poland. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed that the freeze had gone into effect, based on reports from the Ukrainian-Polish border. The White House has not specified what steps Ukraine must take to restore the flow of weapons. Trump&apos;s foreign policy moves in recent weeks signal a seismic shift in U.S. attitudes toward Ukraine, Russia, and Europe. Trump has conceded to Russian demands before negotiations even begin, initiated direct talks with Moscow while excluding Kyiv, and echoed Kremlin talking points &#x2014;&#xA0;including blaming Ukraine for starting the war and calling Zelensky a &quot;dictator.&quot; The Kremlin has applauded Trump&apos;s policy shift, saying it &quot;largely aligns&quot; with Russia&apos;s interests. Trump&apos;s address to Congress comes six weeks after the start of his second term in the White House. In a post to Truth Social late on March 3, Trump said he would use his address to &quot;tell it like it is.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-address-to-congress-aid-ukraine/	2025-03-04T19:55:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203340903.jpg
Top Democrats accuse Trump, Musk of endangering US security by siding with Russia	U.S. President Donald Trump is &quot;threatening the national security of our country,&quot; top Democratic lawmakers said in a statement issued March 4. The statement came hours before Trump is set to deliver a major address to a joint session of Congress, his first since returning to the White House on Jan. 20. &quot;Since taking office a little more than a month ago, the president has alienated nearly every international partner and ally we have, leaving us isolated in an increasingly dangerous world as Russia, North Korea, Iran, and China work together,&quot; the statement reads. &quot;We need partners and allies to effectively address the multitude of national security threats we face &#x2014; or could face. Yet, Trump has shown more alignment with Vladimir Putin, who threatens the international rules-based order, than with our long-standing partners and allies.&quot; The statement was signed by leading congressional Democrats on military, intelligence, and foreign policy committees. Its publication follows Trump&apos;s order to immediately halt all military aid to Ukraine. The statement harshly criticized the aid freeze, which it said &quot;appallingly demonstrated&quot; Trump&apos;s alliance with Moscow over Kyiv. Democrats also condemned billionaire Elon Musk for directing mass terminations of federal workers as the head of the Trump-created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The firings &quot;weakened our ability to respond to international crises,&quot; lawmakers said. The officials called on others to take action to defend U.S. security interests against threats from the administration. &quot;We are speaking out and urging others to join us before it&apos;s too late,&quot; the statement said. &quot;Because make no mistake &#x2014; this is a concerted effort by Trump and Musk to dismantle our system of government and exploit our weakness to consolidate power that benefits the very countries threatening our national security.&quot; The Trump administration&apos;s decision to suspend aid to Ukraine came on top of several recent Kremlin-friendly moves. Trump has undermined President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy, falsely blamed Ukraine for starting the war, refused to label Putin a dictator, and sent delegates to talks with Russian officials without Ukraine&apos;s participation. The White House has also been considering lifting sanctions imposed against Russia for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/top-democrats-accuse-trump-musk-of-endangering-us-security-by-siding-with-russia/	2025-03-04T17:54:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2155468554.jpg
Russia’s airlines face growing crisis as sanctions strangle aircraft maintenance	Russia&#x2019;s civilian aviation sector is facing a severe crisis as Western sanctions block access to essential spare parts and maintenance services. With more aircraft suffering mechanical failures, Russian airlines are resorting to smuggling components from the U.S. and Europe to keep their fleets in the air, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Experts warn that without a steady supply of certified parts, Russia&#x2019;s commercial planes will soon become unsafe to fly. Since December 2024, the number of aviation incidents in Russia has surged. Between Dec. 1 and Jan. 20, Russian aircraft experienced 11 engine failures&#x2014;more than double the number from the previous two months. A growing number of flights have been forced to make emergency landings, with engine and landing gear malfunctions becoming routine. Many of these incidents involve Boeing and Airbus jets, which make up two-thirds of Russia&#x2019;s commercial fleet. Sanctions have made proper maintenance nearly impossible, leaving airlines with few options. Russian carriers can either ground aircraft that require critical safety inspections, take the risk of flying without proper maintenance, or smuggle parts from the West through third countries. U.S. authorities have been cracking down on these illegal supply chains, arresting individuals involved in smuggling schemes. The latest case, announced by the U.S. Department of Justice on Feb. 13, involved three employees of Flighttime Enterprises, an Ohio-based subsidiary of a Russian aircraft parts supplier. They were accused of illegally exporting $2 million worth of aviation components to Russia. Russia has tried to develop its own domestic aircraft, but even its flagship Sukhoi Superjet relies heavily on Western components. The government has ambitious plans to produce over 1,000 aircraft by 2030, including the MC-21 model, but experts say mass production is years behind schedule. Russian manufacturers lack the technology to replace key Western-made components, particularly in engines and avionics. Facing a worsening crisis, Moscow is looking to China for help. Beijing is developing its own aircraft engines and may eventually supply Russia with alternatives. However, experts believe a reliable replacement for Western aviation technology won&#x2019;t be available until at least 2029. Until then, Russian airlines will have to continue operating aging aircraft with limited maintenance&#x2014;raising serious safety concerns for passengers flying within the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-airlines-face-growing-crisis-as-sanctions-strangle-aircraft-maintenance/	2025-03-04T16:24:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Il-Russia.jpeg
Fox News correspondent claims no Trump mineral deal planned for today	U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly told Fox News on March 4 that there are no plans to sign a mineral resources deal with Ukraine following Donald Trump&#x2019;s speech to Congress. His statement comes after earlier reports suggesting Trump intended to announce the agreement during his upcoming address. President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s Feb. 28 visit to the White House was originally intended to finalize the long-debated agreement on jointly developing Ukraine&#x2019;s mineral resources. The meeting instead turned into a public clash, with Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance berating Zelensky. The Ukrainian president later left the White House without signing the deal. Following the talks, Trump accused Zelensky of &quot;disrespecting&quot; the U.S. in the Oval Office and said the Ukrainian president &quot;is not ready for peace.&quot; U.S. President told reporters on March 3 that a proposed economic deal between the U.S. and Ukraine remained on the table, but stressed that Zelensky needed to be more &quot;appreciative&quot; of U.S. support. When asked if the deal was off, Trump replied, &quot;I don&#x2019;t think so,&quot; adding that it would be beneficial for the U.S. and criticizing former President Joe Biden for sending $300 billion to Ukraine without receiving much in return. Trump also said that to restart negotiations, Zelensky must show more gratitude for U.S. assistance. On the same day, U.S. Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick said the U.S. and Ukraine are still making progress on a key mineral agreement that could strengthen long-term economic ties and pave the way for further security assistance. &quot;This mineral deal will be signed in short order, which will lead to a strong long-term economic partnership between the United States and Ukraine, and which will ultimately and naturally lead to security assistance,&quot; Fitzpatrick wrote. He also indicated that European nations would be expected to contribute, adding that they would face mandates to step up their support.	https://kyivindependent.com/fox-news-correspondent-claims-no-trump-mineral-deal-planned-for-today/	2025-03-04T14:59:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2202062036.jpg
Eutelsat in talks to expand satellite services for Ukraine amid Starlink uncertainty, FT reports	Eutelsat, the French satellite operator that owns Starlink rival OneWeb, is negotiating with European governments to expand satellite connectivity in Ukraine. The company announced on March 4 that it is working with European institutions and business partners and has equipment ready for rapid deployment to support critical missions and infrastructure in Ukraine, according to Financial Times. These discussions come as investors speculate that Eutelsat could step in if Ukraine loses access to Elon Musk&#x2019;s Starlink system. Concerns over Starlink&#x2019;s availability escalated after the U.S. paused military aid to Ukraine on March 3. Ukraine has relied heavily on Starlink for battlefield communications, making it a crucial component of its military operations. Last week, Reuters reported that U.S. officials had raised the possibility of restricting Ukraine&#x2019;s access to the system. Musk, who owns Starlink and has influence over U.S. President Donald Trump, denied the claim, calling the report false. Shares in Eutelsat surged as much as 123% to 4.50 euro before settling at a 70% gain, driven by investor confidence that European leaders will increase military support for Ukraine. The European Commission on March 4 proposed a 150 billion euro loan package to help EU member states finance defense procurement, which could facilitate immediate military aid to Kyiv. A spokesperson for the Commission confirmed that alternatives to Starlink were under consideration. Eutelsat&#x2019;s proposal involves combining OneWeb&#x2019;s low Earth orbit satellites, positioned around 1,200 kilometers above the surface, with its geostationary satellites at 35,000 kilometers. This dual-constellation approach could provide essential connectivity for Ukraine&#x2019;s military, including drone operations that have dealt significant blows to Russian forces. OneWeb already provides services to Ukraine through a German distributor, but expanding its role would require European governments to approve procurement and integration plans. Eutelsat acknowledged that the extent of its contribution depends on Ukraine&#x2019;s military requirements, security protocols, and existing communication systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/eutelsat-in-talks-to-expand-satellite-services-for-ukraine-amid-starlink-uncertainty-ft-reports/	2025-03-04T13:56:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/------Starlings.JPG
Ukraine’s DroneUA begins supplying robots to NASA	DroneUA, a Ukrainian distributor of unmanned systems, has started supplying robots to NASA, the company announced on March 4. The first test batch has already been sent to Virginia for trials, where experts will determine the most effective applications. NASA initiated the partnership, and DroneUA hopes it will lead to long-term cooperation. &quot;Testing our solutions in the United States paves the way for lasting collaboration with NASA. This proves that Ukrainian innovations are shaping the future,&quot; said Valerii Iakovenko, DroneUA&#x2019;s co-founder and managing partner. The company sees this partnership as an opportunity to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s economy and expand its presence in global markets. Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov welcomed the development, emphasizing the importance of Ukrainian manufacturers supplying equipment abroad. &quot;Ukrainian technologies are effective everywhere&#x2014;on land, in water, and even in space. I am proud of our most talented developers. You are creating an innovative future,&quot; he wrote. Fedorov noted that Russia&apos;s war has rapidly advanced Ukraine&#x2019;s defense tech sector, accelerating technological innovation at an unprecedented pace. In February, DroneUA officially registered its trademark in the United States. The company supplies drones, robots, and sensors for agriculture, energy, geodesy, and the oil and gas industry. It also develops technological solutions for data processing and unmanned system servicing.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-droneua-begins-supplying-robots-to-nasa/	2025-03-04T12:47:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1592375370.jpg
Ukraine war latest: US suspends Ukraine military aid to pressure Zelensky into talks, Trump adviser says	Key developments on March 4: The U.S. has suspended military aid to Ukraine as part of a pressure campaign to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky toward negotiations with Russia, U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s senior adviser Jason Miller told CNN on March 4. &quot;President Trump is the only person, the only person talking about stopping the killing, and sometimes leaders can use the carrot, sometimes they can use the stick,&quot; Miller said. Several media outlets reported that Trump ordered an immediate halt to all military aid to Ukraine on March 4, affecting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries. Miller claimed that Trump was using strong tactics to reinforce his demand for peace talks and that he expects Zelensky to &quot;get back to the table.&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed that American military aid had indeed been suspended, citing Polish border reports. &quot;This is an emergency,&quot; Tusk said. Polish Foreign Ministry spokesperson Pawel Wronski added that the U.S. had not consulted with any of its NATO allies before suspending the aid. The move follows a heated Oval Office meeting on Feb. 28 between Trump, Zelensky, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance, which ended with the cancelation of a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement. Since the meeting, some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have escalated their criticism of Zelensky, with some even suggesting he should resign. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, the U.S. has provided $119.8 billion in aid to Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, including $67.1 billion in military aid, $49 billion in financial aid, and $3.6 billion in humanitarian support. The U.S. and Ukraine are preparing to sign a mineral deal on March 4, according to Reuters, citing sources familiar with the matter. The sources indicated that U.S. President Donald Trump plans to announce the agreement during his upcoming address to Congress. However, they cautioned that the situation remains fluid and could still change. President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s Feb. 28 visit to the White House was originally intended to finalize the long-debated agreement on jointly developing Ukraine&#x2019;s mineral resources. The meeting instead turned into a public clash, with Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance berating Zelensky. The Ukrainian president later left the White House without signing the deal. Following the talks, Trump accused Zelensky of &quot;disrespecting&quot; the U.S. in the Oval Office and said the Ukrainian president &quot;is not ready for peace.&quot; Zelensky later called the fallout &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed Ukraine&#x2019;s readiness to sign the mineral and security agreement &quot;at any time and in any convenient format.&quot; The report comes after Trump reportedly ordered an immediate halt to more than $1 billion in U.S. military aid to Ukraine on March 4. Since the dispute, some Republican lawmakers have ramped up criticism of Zelensky, with some suggesting he may need to step aside. Zelensky&#x2019;s White House visit was preceded by weeks of tense negotiations as Ukraine rejected the initial two draft proposals, arguing they imposed one-sided obligations on Kyiv without any security commitments from Washington. The final agreement is expected to establish a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of the proceeds from the future monetization of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. Zelensky&#x2019;s refusal to sign the initial draft, presented by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Kyiv on Feb. 12, prompted the U.S. President to lash out publicly. Trump denounced Zelensky as a &quot;dictator,&quot; falsely accusing him of refusing to hold elections and echoing Kremlin disinformation about his legitimacy. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 4 that his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House &quot;did not go the way it was supposed to be,&quot; calling the fallout &quot;regrettable.&quot; The statement follows days of mounting pressure from Washington, with senior U.S. officials signaling that Zelensky should apologize for the heated Feb. 28 Oval Office exchange with Trump and Vice President JD Vance. The meeting ended without a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement being signed. Zelensky reaffirmed that Ukraine is ready to sign the agreement on minerals and security &quot;at any time and in any convenient format.&quot; &quot;We see this agreement as a step toward greater security and solid security guarantees, and I truly hope it will work effectively,&quot; he posted on X. Zelensky also responded to Trump&apos;s latest criticism of his comments on March 2, in which he described peace negotiations as being in the earliest stages and a final deal as &quot;very, very far away.&quot; Trump seized on the remarks as alleged proof that Zelensky does not want peace, posting on Truth Social that &quot;America will not put up with it for much longer.&quot; &quot;Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians,&quot; Zelensky said. He suggested that the initial steps toward de-escalation could include prisoner of war (POWs) releases, a &quot;truce in the sky&quot; banning missiles, long-range drones, and bombs targeting civilian infrastructure, as well as a &quot;truce at sea.&quot; &quot;Then we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the U.S. to agree a strong final deal,&quot; Zelensky added. The remarks come as several media outlets reported that Trump ordered an immediate freeze on all military aid to Ukraine on March 4, halting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries. Trump&apos;s senior adviser, Jason Miller, told CNN that the aid suspension is part of a pressure campaign to push Zelensky into negotiations with Russia. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told Fox News on March 3 that Washington expects Zelensky to show &quot;regret&quot; for the Oval Office dispute and commit to signing the mineral deal. Ukrainian drones attacked an oil refinery in the city of Syzran in Russia&apos;s Samara Oblast overnight on March 4, Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation, said. The first explosions occurred around 3 a.m. local time, according to local residents. A fire broke out at the facility as a result. Samara Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev later said that drones attacked &quot;one of the Syzran industrial enterprises&quot; without providing more details. Russian forces downed drones, and there were no casualties, Fedorishchev claimed. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. Drones attacked Russian Syzran oil refinery in Samara Region, locals report an explosion. A year ago, drones hit the same site, sparking a fire. No official details on the latest incident yet. pic.twitter.com/I0hJs85WW4 The Syzran Oil Refinery, lying around 700 kilometers (430 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border, was opened in 1942 and belongs to the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft. The refinery has a capacity of 8.9 million tons of oil per year. It produces fuel, aviation kerosene, and bitumen, as well as processes crude oil from Western Siberia and Samara Oblast, according to Kovalenko. Drones earlier attacked the Syzran Oil Refinery on Feb. 19. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force struck a military facility near Troitskoye in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast on March 4, destroying dugouts and firing positions and killing up to 30 Russian military personnel, according to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. The facility was reportedly used for planning attacks, including launching first-person-view (FPV) drones at Ukrainian positions. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s Defense Forces remain ready to continue operations targeting Russian military facilities until the Russia ceases its armed aggression against the Ukrainian people,&quot; the statement read. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially capturing about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukrainian forces have lost roughly half that area since, they recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in a new offensive. Over six months of fighting in the region, Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported in February. Ukraine is likely using its foothold in Kursk Oblast as leverage in potential peace talks. President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier that the offensive disrupted Russia&apos;s ability to conduct large-scale operations in northeastern and southern Ukraine. Russian forces in Kursk Oblast have been reinforced by North Korean troops, deployed last fall to counter Ukraine&apos;s cross-border operations. U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s heated Oval Office meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky signals a major shift in U.S. foreign policy, one that a Kremlin spokesman says &quot;largely aligns&quot; with Russia&#x2019;s interests. Trump&#x2019;s recent stance on Ukraine, including his public rebuke of Zelensky and reported halt on U.S. military aid to Kyiv, has drawn praise from Russian officials while raising concerns among European allies. Since taking office, Trump has distanced the U.S. from its traditional role as Ukraine&#x2019;s primary supporter, instead questioning Kyiv&#x2019;s commitment to peace and implying that Ukraine shares blame for the ongoing war. His administration&#x2019;s position has prompted Russian officials to express optimism about a potential thaw in U.S.-Russia relations. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state television on March 3 that &quot;the new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations,&quot; calling the shift a positive development for Moscow. During the Oval Office meeting on Feb. 28, Trump and Vice President JD Vance accused Zelensky of failing to show gratitude for U.S. support and warned that his refusal to negotiate with Putin could escalate into a broader conflict. In response, European leaders reaffirmed their commitment to Ukraine, denouncing Russia&#x2019;s invasion and calling for continued Western military aid. The divergence in approach has raised questions about the future of U.S. support for Kyiv. Russian officials have openly praised Trump&#x2019;s stance, with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov calling him &quot;the first, and so far, the only Western leader&quot; to acknowledge what Moscow considers the true cause of the war. Other Kremlin figures, including the deputy chair of Russia&#x2019;s Security Council, applauded Trump for taking a harsher tone toward Zelensky, even labeling Ukraine&#x2019;s leader a &quot;dictator.&quot; Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that once the war ends, Washington and Moscow could pursue &quot;potentially historic economic partnerships,&quot; including cooperation on Arctic development and rare earth mining.

Trump's pivot toward Moscow met with joy in Russia	It&apos;s a good decision, says Kremlin&apos;s spokesman, following the U.S. pausing of all aid to Ukraine. &quot;The details remain to be seen, but if this is true, it is a decision that could indeed push the &apos;Kyiv regime&apos; towards a peace process,&quot; said Dmitry Peskov. Russia has been open about what it would require to begin peace talks: Ukraine&apos;s Crimea and four Ukrainian oblasts &#x2014; Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson &#x2014; none of which Moscow controls in full. U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered a suspension of all military aid to Ukraine overnight on March 4. The directive reportedly went into effect immediately, impacting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries. &quot;Major!&quot; wrote Kirill Dmitriev, the CEO of Russia&apos;s state-run Direct Investment Fund, who became a vital link between the Kremlin and the White House. Dmitriev was one of the three top Russian officials taking part in the Feb. 18 U.S.-Russia negotiations in Riyadh. The move to suspend aid to Ukraine came on top of other Kremlin-friendly steps recently taken by the U.S. The Trump administration has also been considering lifting sanctions imposed against Russia for its brutal all-out war against Ukraine that killed hundreds of thousands. Meanwhile, Trump has also been aggressively attacking Ukraine and its leadership, which Russian officials and propagandists cheered. They backed Trump after he and Vice President J.D. Vance berated Zelensky in the Oval Office. Peskov said the U.S. policy now &quot;largely aligns&quot; with Russia&apos;s interests. Since President Trump began speaking favorably of Russia, often parroting Kremlin talking points, Russian officials and propaganda have drastically changed their rhetoric. If earlier a common theme on Russian television was an open threat to use nuclear weapons against the U.S., now state-run media outlets are talking more and more positively about the U.S. while continuing to issue xenophobic statements against Ukraine. &quot;Firewall between the U.S. and Russia is abolished. New America starts to reestablish relations with Russia. The new concert of two great powers with very similar anti-globalist illiberal ideologies is quite possible, but not certain,&quot; ultranationalist Alexander Dugin, a fervent supporter of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, wrote prior to Zelensky&apos;s meeting with Trump on Feb. 28. Russian political philosopher Alexander Dugin attends a memorial for his daughter Daria Dugina in Moscow, Russia, on Aug. 23, 2022. (Contributor/Getty Images)Russian officials and propaganda praised the U.S. vote against a Ukrainian resolution at the U.N. General Assembly, calling Russia an aggressor state. They also spoke in favor of Trump&apos;s controversial appointments and continued to spread false claims about Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy, which were picked up by Washington. In most of his recent posts, Russian propaganda mouthpiece Vladimir Solovyov has called Zelensky a &quot;former Ukrainian president, recognized as an illegitimate head of state.&quot; &quot;We were waiting for Trump not because he is pro-Russian but because he is pro-American,&quot; Solovyov said. Peskov welcomed the U.S. policy shift, saying on Feb. 26 that it was &quot;impossible to (even) imagine&quot; and that restoring relations would take a &quot;long way to go.&quot; The shift in Russian reaction became evident following Trump and Zelensky&apos;s altercation at the White House. Following the scuffle, Russian officials and propagandists jumped to Trump&apos;s defense. Their defense was paired with attacks against Zelensky and Europe. Solovyov said that Zelensky was &quot;chastised for rudeness&quot; and &quot;disgraced himself.&quot; Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev praised Trump for telling &quot;the truth,&quot; calling the argument &quot;a livid reprimand&quot; delivered to an &quot;ungrateful&quot; Zelensky.

(Artem Priakhin/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)He reiterated Trump&apos;s claim that Ukraine &quot;is gambling with World War III&quot; and said that military aid to Kyiv should be stopped. It stopped three days later. Medvedev, currently a deputy chairman of Russia&apos;s Security Council, has made numerous inflammatory statements on social media platforms and has openly challenged Ukraine&apos;s right to exist as an independent nation. Overall, Trump is enjoying a wave of support in Russia, which sees the U.S. president as a tool that would help force Ukraine into a peace deal beneficial to the Kremlin. &quot;Whoever in the U.S. attacks Putin and Russia today attacks Donald Trump,&quot; wrote Dugin.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-pivot-toward-moscow-met-with-joy-in-russia/	2025-03-04T12:22:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1245382772.jpg
Trump cuts to US weapons aid likely to hit Ukrainian civilians before front line	President Donald Trump&#x2019;s freeze on weapons is alarming Ukrainians, who look to U.S. air defense to stave off the worst of Russia&apos;s missile attacks. A White House representative on March 3 announced a &#x201C;pause&#x201D; on U.S. weapons aid to Ukraine following an ugly encounter between Trump, his Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last week. The directive is reportedly immediate and affects $1 billion in weapons aid, including what&#x2019;s already in transit, mostly through Poland. The details of what weapons exactly are affected by the decision are not entirely clear. Most U.S. shipments of lethal weapons and artillery to Ukraine have already been delivered. A number of U.S. vehicles remain under repair in Europe, but shipments have already slowed down radically in recent months, and Ukraine has moved on from U.S. dependence. For much of the weaponry that Ukraine needs to continue fighting, Europe could stand in for U.S. weapons, especially given the new political will to rearm the EU. But for air defense that protects Ukrainian cities from deadly Russian aerial attacks, nobody can replace the U.S. &#x201C;I think it will be sorely unpleasant, but that&#x2019;s not to say that this is stuff without which we&#x2019;ll lose the war tomorrow,&#x201D; says Serhiy, a drone pilot stationed in Kharkiv whose last name is not being disclosed for security reasons. &#x201C;But the situation in the rear will be noticeably worse since the big air defense covers the cities.&#x201D; Air defense helps protect Ukraine&#x2019;s local weapons production. It also keeps Russia from hitting power plants and civilian homes at will. &#x201C;It&#x2019;ll be harsh times, but we&#x2019;ll handle it,&#x201D; says another soldier by the callsign of &#x2018;Artem,&#x2019; whose real name is not being disclosed. &#x201C;It means more pressure on the cities and civilians.&#x201D; Civilians leave the site after a Russian ballistic missile hit the city center in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Dec. 20, 2024. (Vlada Liberova/Libkos/Getty Images)Per the State Department, the Biden administration oversaw the delivery of three Patriot and 12 NASAM air defense systems after the start of the full-scale war, along with a slew of other cheaper surface-to-air missiles and anti-drone weaponry. The Patriot system, in particular, is the only viable defense against Russian hypersonic Kinzhal missiles. The U.S. alone makes it, and can stop any deliveries from other countries who already have them. &#x201C;Securing a supply of Patriot missiles is our vulnerable spot,&#x201D; Dmytro Zhmailo, a Ukrainian military analyst, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Our mobile groups are demonstrating high efficiency with our, roughly speaking, small arms&#x201D; in shooting down drones, Zhmailo said. &#x201C;But Russian ballistic missiles, especially those that reach our cities within minutes, are still being intercepted by Patriot systems.&#x201D; Given stockpiling and replacement sourcing, Ukrainian officials are much more confident in their abilities on the front line than in aerial defense. Zelensky took to Twitter on March 4 calling on Trump to make a deal in which &#x201C;the first stages could be the release of prisoners and truce in the sky &#x2014; ban on missiles, long-ranged drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure &#x2014; and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same.&#x201D; Some observers are not so optimistic about Ukraine&apos;s capabilities on the front but still consider the military has months of stock. &#x201C;I would say that the impact of the U.S. suspension of military aid will be noticeable at the front in a month or two at the latest,&#x201D; estimated Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute. &#x201C;A suspension of intelligence cooperation and/or a decision to turn off Starlink services would have much more immediate and serious military effects.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s a threat that has been reported on previously but later denied by Elon Musk, the owner of company SpaceX that makes Starlink satellites. Patriot launcher modules pictured in a open field on Feb. 18, 2023 in Zamosc, Poland. (Omar Marques/Getty Images)U.S. intelligence on Russian movements, including the flow of information on missile launches and targeting of military sites, would also be tough to replicate. A source told CNN that the U.S. will continue to share intelligence with Ukraine despite Trump&apos;s decision, but whether that could change in the future is unclear. Trump&apos;s relationship with intelligence agencies is known to be frosty. The pause has, however, yet to graduate to a full stop. House Speaker Republican Mike Johnson called it &#x201C;temporary&#x201D; while speaking in D.C. on March 4. The pause appears to be mostly political pressure from Trump, who is eager to force Zelensky to make concessions in pursuit of a peace deal. But the Ukrainian president has continued to push for a deal that contains firm security guarantees for Ukraine in the event Russia launches a future attack. Trump is consequently playing off a potential rather than actual impact of a sudden cut in weapons shipment, says Ron Farkas, who runs logistics for weapons systems, including the F-16 through Poland. &#x201C;I would argue there hasn&#x2019;t been equipment coming in for some time. They&#x2019;re talking about cutting things that aren&#x2019;t happening. Everyone&#x2019;s out of stuff,&#x201D; &#xA0;Farkas told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not saying that there&#x2019;s not deliveries coming into Ukraine, I&#x2019;m just saying it&#x2019;s a slow trickle.&#x201D; &#x201C;If things were ending, I&#x2019;d start getting CVs in my inbox. I have not received a single stop work-order,&#x201D; says Farkas, comparing the cuts to USAID last month. The U.S. defense contractors looking to sell their weapons also have more weight over the current administration and Republicans in Congress. &#x201C;I find it very difficult to believe that they&#x2019;ll come in and cut Lockheed Martin contracts or cut Boeing contracts. Or (Musk&#x2019;s) Starlink contracts,&#x201D; Farkas said. Representatives for the U.S. State Department in Ukraine and for Ukrainian air defense declined to comment. The U.S. and Ukrainian Defense Departments did not return requests for comment.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-cuts-to-us-weapons-aid-likely-to-hit-ukrainian-civilians-before-front-line/	2025-03-04T11:31:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202602648.jpg

People should not be guessing' — Zelensky calls for clear dialogue with US on military aid amid freeze	President Volodymyr Zelensky instructed Ukraine&#x2019;s defense minister, intelligence chiefs, and diplomats on March 4 to reach out to the U.S. to clarify the future of American military assistance. &quot;People should not be guessing. Ukraine and America deserve a respectful dialogue and a clear position of each other,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. His call comes after reports that U.S. President Donald Trump ordered an immediate halt to more than $1 billion in U.S. military aid to Ukraine on March 4. Zelensky mentioned that military aid was briefly paused in late January before being restored, referencing a Reuters report from February that tied the pause to policy debates within the White House. &quot;This is not 2022; now our resilience is higher, and we have means of defense, but normal partnership relations with America are important for us to really end the war,&quot; he said. Zelensky also warned that Moscow had not changed its stance, asserting that Russia would demand a reduction of Ukraine&#x2019;s army, a renunciation of territories, and a significant weakening of Ukraine&#x2019;s political structure. House Speaker Mike Johnson said on March 4 that the suspension of aid is a &quot;temporary pause&quot; and linked it to the fallout from Zelensky&apos;s Oval Office exchange with Trump. The meeting on Feb. 28 ended without signing a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement. U.S. officials have increased pressure on Zelensky, with some calling for an apology for the White House dispute. Zelensky earlier called the fallout &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed Ukraine&apos;s readiness to sign the mineral and security agreement &quot;at any time and in any convenient format.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/people-should-not-be-guessing-zelensky-orders-officials-to-clarify-future-of-us-military-aid-to-ukraine/	2025-03-04T11:25:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/98f74e298d34967cffe22f79a708f597_1741111431.jpeg
Russian fighter jet provokes French Reaper drone over Mediterranean, French Defense Minister says	A Russian Su-35 fighter jet engaged in a dangerous provocation against a French Reaper drone over the Mediterranean Sea on March 2, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu reported on March 4. &quot;The Russian Su-35 fighter jet behaved dangerously toward the French Reaper drone...

In December, two Dutch F-35 fighter jets intercepted Russian aircraft over the Baltic Sea, according to the Netherlands Defense Ministry. Russian military aircraft frequently operate without transponders or flight plans over the Baltic and Black Seas, maneuvers often seen as testing NATO&apos;s response capabilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-fighter-jet-confronts-french-reaper-drone-in-mediterranean-france-reports/	2025-03-04T10:48:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1229478705.jpg

Ukraine to boost gas imports due to Russian attacks on energy infrastructure, Bloomberg reports	Ukraine plans to import about 3.5 billion cubic meters of gas for the upcoming heating season due to ongoing Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure, Bloomberg reported on March 4. Recent Russian missile and drone strikes have significantly reduced Ukraine&apos;s gas production capacity, forcing the country to rely more heavily on imports to meet domestic demand. Damage to infrastructure has caused production drops of up to 40% at times. &#x201C;We are waiting for a final approval of the balance, which will define the projected volume of consumption, extraction, and imports of gas,&#x201D; Roman Chumak, acting CEO of Ukraine&apos;s state-owned oil and gas company Naftogaz, told Bloomberg. The country&#x2019;s gas buying plans come amid a volatile market marked by high competition and elevated prices due to Europe&#x2019;s need to replenish low gas inventories. In February, Ukraine imported 560 million cubic meters of gas from Europe, compared to just 700 million cubic meters for the entire previous heating season, Bloomberg reported, citing estimates from Kyiv-based Dragon Capital. Due to Russian strikes and extreme cold in February, Ukraine&#x2019;s gas production sharply declined, leading Naftogaz to urgently purchase significant amounts of natural gas from the European Union to meet critical heating demands. Tensions between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump could potentially weaken Ukraine&apos;s ability to defend against Russian attacks, raising concerns about energy security, according to Bloomberg. Naftogaz and Ukrainian energy company DTEK confirmed to Reuters that Russian forces attacked and damaged their facilities twice in February.

US military aid freeze to Ukraine temporary, linked to Zelensky-Trump clash	The pause in U.S. military aid to Ukraine is temporary and tied to the fallout from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s heated Oval Office exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson said on March 4. &quot;It&apos;s a temporary pause,&quot; Johnson said during a press briefing when asked about the reported freeze on over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries. The move follows a heated Feb. 28 Oval Office meeting between Trump, Zelensky, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance, during which the two American leaders berated Zelensky. The meeting ended without a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement being signed. Since then, senior U.S. officials have repeatedly suggested that Zelensky should express regret for the confrontation. Johnson said Zelensky should &quot;make right what happened last week, the shocking developments in the Oval Office.&quot; &quot;If he does that (signs the minerals deal), I think this is the win-win-win scenario for everybody involved,&quot; he added. Zelensky, in a statement earlier on March 4, called the outcome of the Oval Office meeting &quot;regrettable&quot; and emphasized Ukraine&apos;s readiness to sign the minerals deal &quot;at any time and in any convenient format.&quot; Trump&apos;s senior adviser, Jason Miller, told CNN that the aid freeze is part of a broader pressure campaign to push Zelensky toward peace talks with Russia. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz previously said Washington expects Zelensky to show &quot;regret&quot; for the Oval Office clash and commit to finalizing the deal.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-military-aid-freeze-to-ukraine-is-temporary-linked-to-trump-zelensky-exchange-speaker-johnson-says/	2025-03-04T09:21:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2150335295.jpg
Why Trump’s Ukraine aid freeze upends world order	The U.S. has suspended military aid to Ukraine as part of a pressure campaign to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky toward negotiations with Russia, U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s senior adviser Jason Miller said on March 4. It&#x2019;s just the latest in a series of developments since Trump took office that mark a dramtic shift in the U.S.&#x2019;s relationship with not only Ukraine, but Europe, and the rest of the world. The Kyiv Independent spoke with Timothy Ash, associate fellow at the Chatham House&#x2019;s Russia and Eurasia Programme, who told us that what is unfolding right now amount to &#x201C;teutonic shifts in alliances that I don&#x2019;t think anyone could quite have imagined.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/why-trumps-ukraine-aid-freeze-upends-world-order/	2025-03-04T09:14:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Ash-4.jpg
Zelensky says White House clash 'regrettable,' proposes steps for peace	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 4 that his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House &quot;did not go the way it was supposed to be,&quot; calling the fallout &quot;regrettable.&quot; The statement follows days of mounting pressure from Washington, with senior U.S. officials signaling that Zelensky should apologize for the heated Feb. 28 Oval Office exchange with Trump and Vice President JD Vance. The meeting ended without a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement being signed. Zelensky reaffirmed that Ukraine is ready to sign the agreement on minerals and security &quot;at any time and in any convenient format.&quot; &quot;We see this agreement as a step toward greater security and solid security guarantees, and I truly hope it will work effectively,&quot; he posted on X. Zelensky also responded to Trump&apos;s latest criticism of his comments on March 2, in which he described peace negotiations as being in the earliest stages and a final deal as &quot;very, very far away.&quot; Trump seized on the remarks as alleged proof that Zelensky does not want peace, posting on Truth Social that &quot;America will not put up with it for much longer.&quot; &quot;Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians,&quot; Zelensky said. He suggested that the initial steps toward de-escalation could include prisoner of war (POWs) releases, a &quot;truce in the sky&quot; banning missiles, long-range drones, and bombs targeting civilian infrastructure, as well as a &quot;truce at sea.&quot; &quot;Then we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the U.S. to agree a strong final deal,&quot; Zelensky added. The remarks come as several media outlets reported that Trump ordered an immediate freeze on all military aid to Ukraine on March 4, halting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries. Trump&apos;s senior adviser, Jason Miller, told CNN that the aid suspension is part of a pressure campaign to push Zelensky into negotiations with Russia. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told Fox News on March 3 that Washington expects Zelensky to show &quot;regret&quot; for the Oval Office dispute and commit to signing the mineral deal.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-says-white-house-regrettable-vows/	2025-03-04T08:44:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201830448.jpg
Russian forces in Kharkiv sector suffer more fatalities than wounded, Ukraine says	Russian forces in the Kharkiv sector of the front line have suffered more irrecoverable losses than wounded over the past month, Volodymyr Degtyaryov, spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s &quot;Khartia&quot; brigade, said on March 4. &quot;If you look at the enemy&apos;s losses in February, you can see an interesting trend &#x2014; more dead than wounded. Perhaps this is due to the fact that they have less movement and more (personnel) concentrations,&quot; Degtyaryov told Ukrainian media Suspilne. He noted that Russian forces rarely use vehicles, as Ukrainian troops have established a &quot;dead zone&quot; extending 10 kilometers into Russian-occupied areas, allowing Ukrainian forces to maintain control over the sector from the air. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. &quot;Of course, they have offensive potential, but we are doing everything we can to prevent them from doing so,&quot; Degtyaryov added. The situation in Kharkiv Oblast as of March 4, 2025. The area marked in red is the territory occupied by Russia. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Kharkiv Oblast, which shares a direct border with Russia, remains a major flashpoint in the ongoing war. Moscow launched an offensive in the region on May 10, 2024, advancing up to 10 kilometers (6 miles) before Ukrainian defenders halted the push at the first line of defense. During the first month of the offensive, Russian forces suffered around 4,000 casualties, including both killed and wounded, according to Ukraine&apos;s military. Despite their losses, Russian troops still control several villages on two axes in Kharkiv Oblast &#x2014; one near Lyptsi and the other near the embattled town of Vovchansk.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-in-kharkiv-sector-suffer-more-irrecoverable-losses-than-wounded-brigade-spokesperson-says/	2025-03-04T08:04:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1494251171-1.jpeg
Russian oil deliveries to Czech Republic via Druzhba pipeline suspended, Czech official says	Russian oil deliveries to the Czech Republic via the Druzhba pipeline have been halted, Czech news channel CT24 reported on March 4, citing Industry and Trade Minister Lukas Vlcek. &quot;We control the situation and are prepared for such circumstances. Refineries in the Czech Republic are well prepared, and the state material reserve system is reliable, so I can assure everyone that there are enough oil reserves for both households and businesses,&quot; Vlcek said. No mention was made of the cause for the halt in deliveries. The Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline transports Russian oil to Europe through two main branches: the southern route supplies Central Europe, and the northern route serves Northern Europe. This is not the first disruption to Druzhba&apos;s oil flow. In early December 2024, supplies were temporarily halted but resumed after two days. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala announced in January that Prague intends to completely stop Russian oil imports via Druzhba. The country plans to rely instead on the Transalpine Pipeline, which has been modernized to boost supply volumes. The European Union imposed an embargo on Russian oil and oil products in June 2023, though the southern branch of Druzhba was temporarily exempted. That exemption expires in June 2025, after which recipient countries must find alternative supply routes.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-oil-deliveries-to-czech-republic-via-druzhba-pipeline-halted-czech-minister-says/	2025-03-04T07:36:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-94281707.jpg
US continues intelligence sharing with Ukraine despite military aid freeze, CNN reports	The U.S. continues to share intelligence with Ukraine despite President Donald Trump&#x2019;s suspension of military aid, CNN reported on March 4, citing a source familiar with the matter. Since the start of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion, the U.S. has provided Kyiv with real-time intelligence, including satellite imagery and sensitive information on Russian troop movements. As of the morning of March 4, this support remained unchanged, according to CNN&apos;s source. The report comes as multiple media outlets reported that Trump ordered an immediate halt to all U.S. military aid to Ukraine on March 4, affecting more than $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries. Trump&apos;s senior adviser, Jason Miller, told CNN that the aid freeze is part of a pressure campaign to push President Volodymyr Zelensky toward negotiations with Russia. &quot;Sometimes leaders can use the carrot, sometimes they can use the stick,&quot; Miller said. The decision follows a heated Feb. 28 Oval Office meeting between Trump, Zelensky, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance, during which the two American leaders berated Zelensky. The meeting ended without a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement being signed. Since the confrontation, some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have escalated their criticism of Zelensky, with some even suggesting he should resign. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told Fox News on March 3 that the U.S. administration expects Zelensky to show regret and commit to signing the mineral deal. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, the U.S. has provided Ukraine with $119.8 billion since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, including $67.1 billion in military assistance, $49 billion in financial aid, and $3.6 billion in humanitarian support.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-continues-sharing-intelligence-with-ukraine-despite-trumps-aid-freeze-media-reports/	2025-03-04T07:18:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/--------------2024-03-19-202210.png
US suspends Ukraine military aid to pressure Zelensky into talks, Trump adviser says	The U.S. has suspended military aid to Ukraine as part of a pressure campaign to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky toward negotiations with Russia, U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s senior adviser Jason Miller told CNN on March 4. &quot;President Trump is the only person, the only person talking about stopping the killing, and sometimes leaders can use the carrot, sometimes they can use the stick,&quot; Miller said. Several media outlets reported that Trump ordered an immediate halt to all military aid to Ukraine on March 4, affecting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries. Miller claimed that Trump was using strong tactics to reinforce his demand for peace talks and that he expects Zelensky to &quot;get back to the table.&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed that American military aid had indeed been suspended, citing Polish border reports. &quot;This is an emergency,&quot; Tusk said. Polish Foreign Ministry spokesperson Pawel Wronski added that the U.S. had not consulted with any of its NATO allies before suspending the aid. The move follows a heated Oval Office meeting on Feb. 28 between Trump, Zelensky, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance, which ended with the cancelation of a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement. Since the meeting, some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have escalated their criticism of Zelensky, with some even suggesting he should resign. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, the U.S. has provided $119.8 billion in aid to Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, including $67.1 billion in military aid, $49 billion in financial aid, and $3.6 billion in humanitarian support.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-suspends-ukraine-military-aid-to-pressure-zelensky-into-talks-trump-adviser-says/	2025-03-04T06:35:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201194454.jpg
Russia agrees to help US in negotiations with Iran over nuclear program, Bloomberg reports	Moscow has pledged to help Washington in dealing with Iran over the Islamic Republic&apos;s nuclear program and its support for regional anti-American proxies, Bloomberg reported on March 4, citing its undisclosed sources. Since returning to the White House, Trump has been trying to restore relations with Russia, which were severed under the previous administration when the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Trump voiced his interest in negotiations with Iran to Putin during a phone call in February. A few days later, the U.S. and Russian delegations discussed this issue during talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Bloomberg reported. Moscow has long been partners with Tehran, but their cooperation only intensified after the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022. Iran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed drones used in attacks against Ukrainian cities, as well as short-range ballistic missiles. With Iran&apos;s assistance, Russia has begun producing its own variants of Shahed drones called Geran-2. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier that Russia believes the U.S. and Iran should &quot;resolve all problems through negotiations,&quot; and Moscow is &quot;ready to do everything in its power to achieve this goal.&quot; When asked whether Russia offered to mediate between Tehran and Washington, Esmail Baghai, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said that it was &quot;natural&quot; for countries to offer their assistance. &quot;Given the importance of these issues, it is quite possible that many parties will show goodwill and willingness to help in solving various problems,&quot; Baghai said during a televised press conference in Tehran on March 3. &quot;From this point of view, it is only natural that countries will offer assistance if it is needed,&quot; he added. Since taking office, Trump has distanced the U.S. from its traditional role as Ukraine&apos;s primary supporter, instead questioning Kyiv&apos;s commitment to peace and implying that Ukraine shares the blame for the ongoing war. Russian officials have openly praised Trump&apos;s stance, with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov calling him &quot;the first, and so far, the only Western leader&quot; to acknowledge what Moscow considers the true cause of the war. Other Kremlin figures, including the deputy chair of Russia&apos;s Security Council, applauded Trump for taking a harsher tone toward President Volodymyr Zelensky, even labeling Ukraine&apos;s leader a &quot;dictator.&quot; Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that once the war ends, Washington and Moscow could pursue &quot;potentially historic economic partnerships,&quot; including cooperation on Arctic development and rare earth mining.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-agrees-to-help-us-in-negotiations-with-iran-over-nuclear-program-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-04T05:43:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-872780694.jpg
US military aid to Ukraine suspended according to Polish border reports, Tusk says	The Trump administration halted military aid to Ukraine, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on March 4, citing Polish border reports, Rzeczpospolita reported. Several media outlets reported earlier that U.S. President Donald Trump had ordered the suspension of military aid, including the aid that was already on its way to Ukraine. &quot;Today we have no reason to believe that these are just words. Reports coming from the border, from our center in Jasionka, confirm the statements of the American side,&quot; Tusk said. Tusk called the situation &quot;an emergency&quot; and insisted on full mobilization and concentration of joint efforts to resolve it.&quot;The situation is serious and requires special concentration from the government. We will make decisions that will require the full solidarity of the state and your (Ukrainian) ministries,&quot; Tusk said.&quot;The days and weeks are coming when it is absolutely necessary to stop empty discussions, prestige disputes, coalition disagreements, because we will have to make decisions in a mode that is, in a sense, extraordinary,&quot; he added.According to Pawel Wronski, Polish foreign ministry spokesperson, the U.S. has not consulted with any of its NATO allies about suspending military aid to Ukraine. The suspension of U.S. military aid followed a spat between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Trump in the Oval Office last week. The argument between two leaders also resulted in the failure to sign a minerals deal.Since the meeting, some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have escalated their criticism of Zelensky, with some even suggesting he should resign.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-military-aid-to-ukraine-suspended-according-to-polish-border-reports-tusk-says/	2025-03-04T04:09:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183928589.jpg
I'm full of anger' — Ukraine awakes to a nightmare as US freezes military aid	Even in a country grimly accustomed to negative news, the headlines that Ukraine woke up to on March 4 still came as a shock &#x2014; the U.S. is freezing military aid. &quot;It hurts to watch it unfolding,&quot; Volodymyr Dubovyk, the head of Odesa National University&apos;s Center for International Studies, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We can scrap everything that we previously knew about U.S. foreign policy.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump on March 3 reportedly ordered a suspension of all military aid to Ukraine, with a senior Defense Department official telling Bloomberg it is on hold until Trump determines that Ukrainian leaders are making a genuine effort toward peace. Neither Washington nor Kyiv have officially confirmed the freeze. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that the reports the Polish government gets from the Ukrainian-Polish border confirm the freeze. The move is the latest from the White House as it escalates pressure on President Volodymyr Zelensky, just days after a heated exchange in the Oval Office cast doubt on U.S. support for Kyiv, and ended in the cancelling of a planned mineral deal between the two countries. The Trump administration&apos;s strongarm tactics against Zelesnky are being felt especially painfully in Ukraine as the Kremlin appears to be getting a free ride from a White House which &#x2014; by the Kremlin&apos;s own admission &#x2014; is now largely aligned with Russia&apos;s interests. &quot;It looks as if Trump is trying to cut a deal with Russia at the cost of the weaker party, which is Ukraine,&quot; Oleksandr Merezhko, a lawmaker and chair of the parliament&apos;s foreign affairs policy, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;I don&#x2019;t see that Trump is using leverage against the aggressor, he is using leverage against the victim of the aggression. To stop military aid to Ukraine right now means to help Russia kill Ukrainians with impunity.&quot; Trump has long-promised he could swiftly end the war in Ukraine as soon as he took office, though his original pledge of &quot;24 hours&quot; was amended to &quot;100 days&quot; shortly before his inauguration. During his first week in office, Trump appeared to come out on the side of Ukraine, putting the onus on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and threatening &quot;high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions&quot; if he didn&apos;t &quot;make a deal.&quot; But in the weeks since, and after a phone call between Trump and Putin, the rhetoric coming from the White House towards Ukraine has been increasingly hostile and has, at times, resembled that coming from the Kremlin. Trump has described Zelensky as a &quot;dictator&quot; and questioned his legitimacy, with some Republican lawmakers this week calling for him to resign. Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, lawmaker for the Holos (Voice) party, told the Kyiv Independent that even though the tone has changed, he believes Trump&apos;s more recent actions still align with his original stated goal of ending the war swiftly &#x2014; but regardless of the cost for Ukraine. &quot;I think that it&#x2019;s a continuation of Trump&#x2019;s policy to end the war as soon as possible by effectively giving up on Ukraine&#x2019;s interests,&quot; he said. &quot;Because based on the logic of his and his administration&#x2019;s statements, their goal is peace at any cost. But for Ukraine, such an option is not acceptable.&quot; The directive to freeze U.S. military aid reportedly goes into effect immediately, impacting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition. The pause affects not only future aid but also weapons already in transit, including shipments on aircraft and ships, as well as equipment awaiting transfer in Poland. &quot;I&apos;m full of anger,&quot; &#x2018;Bart,&#x2019; a Special Operations Forces sniper fighting in the hot spot near Pokrovsk, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;America has sided with Russia, North Korea, and Iran, they have chosen the side of darkness. If the U.S. has chosen to play the role of world policeman, it is its duty to protect world democracy.&quot; Yet despite the anger and the future of weapons supplies in doubt, Ukrainian soldiers who spoke to the Kyiv Independent remain confident in their ability to fight back against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;There is no panic in the army,&quot; &quot;Fuko&quot; who serves with Ukraine&apos;s 66th Prince Mstyslav Khorobyi Brigade said, adding: &quot;We are ready to keep going as long as it takes. &quot;Moreover, the weapons supply crisis can be avoided if our European allies respond quickly and help us with the supply of the most important weapons.&quot; Bart acknowledged the aid freeze &quot;will have some impact, but not a critical one.&quot; &quot;Europe is helping us, we will break through &#x2014; Russia is running out of steam, and we need to push on,&quot; he added. As Ukraine increasingly looks to Europe for support, there were signs on March 4 that Brussels was preparing to step up. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the ReArm Europe plan aimed at strengthening the defense capabilities of the EU&#x2019;s countries, which could unlock close to 800 billion euros ($842 billion). &quot;Europe is ready to assume its responsibilities,&quot; von der Leyen said, adding: &quot;This is a moment for Europe and we are ready to step up.&quot; Whether or not Europe can step up in time to fill the potential hole left by the U.S.&apos; withdrawal remains to be seen, and Ukraine will be assessing which areas of its defense could be impacted the most. &quot;Our main challenge is air defense which depends on U.S. support,&quot; Lieutenant Colonel Bohdan Krotevych told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We must urgently find an alternative because civilians will die if we run out of missiles.&quot; Krotevych added that the Trump administration needs to understand this too, otherwise they are &quot;setting themselves up for prison sentences.&quot; &quot;When? Whether it happens after his current term or through impeachment is for the American people to decide,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/im-full-of-anger-ukraine-awakes-to-a-nightmare-as-us-freezes-military-aid/	2025-03-04T04:00:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198359955.jpg
US military aid continue to flow as of evening of March 3, Prime Minister Shmyhal says	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. U.S. military aid continued to flow to Ukraine as of late last night, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on March 4 during his press conference in Kyiv. The statement comes after several media outlets reported that U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered a suspension of all military aid to Ukraine on March 4. The directive reportedly went into effect immediately, impacting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-military-aid-continue-to-flow-as-of-evening-of-march-3-ukraines-prime-minister-shmyhal-says/	2025-03-04T03:41:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168960387.jpg
Oil prices continue to decline amid growing tensions between US, Ukraine, Reuters reports	Oil prices have continued to drop after U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly suspended military aid to Ukraine, Reuters reported on March 4. The news from the U.S. comes after a spat between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last week. Neither Washington nor Kyiv have officially confirmed the freeze. Brent crude oil futures fell 54 cents, or 0.75%, to $71.08 per barrel. In the meantime, futures for U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil decreased by 36 cents, or 0.53%, to $68.01 per barrel, according to the news agency. The market perceived the distancing of the U.S. and Ukraine as a signal of a possible easing of the war, subsequently leading to the loosening of sanctions against Russia and the return of additional volumes of Russian oil for purchase, Reuters reported. Yet Goldman Sachs analysts noted that Russian oil exports are now more limited by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) quotas than by sanctions, so even if sanctions are eased, a significant increase in supplies is not guaranteed. OPEC&apos;s decision to extend the planned increase in production by 138,000 barrels per day, the first increase since 2022, also puts pressure on prices. A day earlier, oil prices fell by about 2%, hitting a 12-week low, amid news about Ukraine and concerns that new U.S. tariffs will hurt global economic growth, according to Reuters. Trump&apos;s 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico will come into effect on March 4, with energy products from Canada subject to a 10% duty, while tariffs on Chinese goods will rise from 10% to 20%.	https://kyivindependent.com/oil-prices-continue-to-decline-amid-growing-tensions-between-us-ukraine-reuters-reports/	2025-03-04T03:23:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/taneco.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, injure 11 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed two civilians and injured 11 others over the past day, regional authorities reported on March 4. Russian forces launched 99 drones from the Russian cities of Orel, Kursk, Bryansk, Millerovo, and Primosk-Akhtarsk at Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 65 drones over Kharkiv, Sumy, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Odesa, Kirovohrad, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, the Air Force said. Another 32 drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are often decoys that Russia launches alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. In Donetsk Oblast, a Russian attack killed a person in the town of Pokrovsk, while another Russian strike injured a person in the village of Nova Poltavka, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian forces attacked the village of Omelnyk with a glide bomb, killing a 49-year-old man. His wife suffered injuries in the strike, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 30 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, five people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Odesa Oblast, four people were injured in the attack against the regional center of Odesa, according to Governor Oleh Kiper. Three people suffered shrapnel wounds and broken limbs, while another person suffered a concussion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-2-injure-11-over-past-day/	2025-03-04T03:05:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2147527243.jpg

Ukrainian drones reportedly strike oil refinery in Russia's Samara Oblast	Ukrainian drones attacked an oil refinery in the city of Syzran in Russia&apos;s Samara Oblast overnight on March 4, Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation, said. The first explosions occurred around 3 a.m. local time, according to local residents. A fire broke out at the facility as a result. Samara Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev later said that drones attacked &quot;one of the Syzran industrial enterprises&quot; without providing more details. Russian forces downed drones, and there were no casualties, Fedorishchev claimed. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. Drones attacked Russian Syzran oil refinery in Samara Region, locals report an explosion. A year ago, drones hit the same site, sparking a fire. No official details on the latest incident yet. pic.twitter.com/I0hJs85WW4 The Syzran Oil Refinery, lying around 700 kilometers (430 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border, was opened in 1942 and belongs to the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft. The refinery has a capacity of 8.9 million tons of oil per year.

Pentagon denies halting cyber operations against Russia, Bloomberg reports	The Pentagon has denied that U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a halt to cyber operations against Russia, Bloomberg reported on March 4, citing an unnamed senior defense official. The Record previously reported that U.S. Cyber Command was ordered to suspend offensive cyber and information operations against Moscow. The news coincided with President Donald Trump&apos;s efforts to negotiate an end to Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine under terms that critics argue favor Moscow. Cybersecurity experts had warned that such a move would benefit one of America&apos;s most persistent cyber adversaries, potentially weakening U.S. leverage in both cyber and conventional military operations. Russian hacker groups have engaged in various forms of cyber warfare throughout the full-scale war, including cyberattacks against Ukraine, hacks of civilian infrastructure in Europe, and interference in foreign elections. But according to a source quoted by Bloomberg, Hegseth did not cancel or suspend cyber operations against Russia. Nor has he issued any orders to reverse this priority, the source said. The U.S. Cyber Command oversees 135 teams of &quot;cyber mission forces.&quot; The units involved in offensive operations are cyber combat mission teams, according to Bloomberg.	https://kyivindependent.com/pentagon-denies-halting-cyber-operations-against-russia-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-03T23:41:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193880159.jpg

Ukraine brings back 7 children from occupied territories, Russia	Seven Ukrainian children have been returned home under the President of Ukraine&#x2019;s initiative, Bring Kids Back UA, according to Daria Zarivna, Director of the initiative and advisor to the Head of the Office of the President. The children had been residing in the Russian-occupied territories and Russia itself. Since February 2022, at least 20,000 Ukrainian children have been abducted from Russian-occupied areas and transferred to other Russian-controlled territories or to Russia, according to the Ukrainian national database, &quot;Children of War.&quot; Among the returned children is a boy who, along with his parents, lived under occupation for an extended period, Zarivna wrote on March 3. &quot;He endured forced passportization, psychological pressure at school, and a constant fear for his future,&quot; she added. &quot;In an effort to provide him with the opportunity for an education in a free country, his parents decided to bring him to Ukrainian-controlled territory.&quot; Ukraine considers the abduction of these children a war crime and argues that these actions meet the U.N.&#x2019;s legal definition of genocide. Russia, however, claims that the children are being relocated for their protection from conflict zones. Ukrainian authorities, including Children&#x2019;s Ombudswoman Daria Herasymchuk, estimate that up to 300,000 children have been unlawfully deported, while the figure put forth by Lubinets, the Ukrainian Human Rights Commissioner, stands at 150,000. The Ukrainian government has managed to return 1,233 children so far, according to the Ministry of Reintegration. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Children&apos;s Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, citing their involvement in the unlawful transfer of Ukrainian children. Russia dismissed the ICC&#x2019;s decision as &quot;outrageous and unacceptable.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-brings-back-7-children-from-russia-occupied-territories/	2025-03-03T21:48:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/dscf6830-1668456828oat5c.jpg
Kremlin welcomes Trump’s policy shift as US moves 'align' with Russia's interests	U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s heated Oval Office meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky signals a major shift in U.S. foreign policy, one that a Kremlin spokesman says &quot;largely aligns&quot; with Russia&#x2019;s interests. Trump&#x2019;s recent stance on Ukraine, including his public rebuke of Zelensky and reported halt on U.S. military aid to Kyiv, has drawn praise from Russian officials while raising concerns among European allies. Since taking office, Trump has distanced the U.S. from its traditional role as Ukraine&#x2019;s primary supporter, instead questioning Kyiv&#x2019;s commitment to peace and implying that Ukraine shares blame for the ongoing war. His administration&#x2019;s position has prompted Russian officials to express optimism about a potential thaw in U.S.-Russia relations. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state television on March 3 that &quot;the new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations,&quot; calling the shift a positive development for Moscow. During the Oval Office meeting on Feb. 28, Trump and Vice President JD Vance accused Zelensky of failing to show gratitude for U.S. support and warned that his refusal to negotiate with Putin could escalate into a broader conflict. In response, European leaders reaffirmed their commitment to Ukraine, denouncing Russia&#x2019;s invasion and calling for continued Western military aid. The divergence in approach has raised questions about the future of U.S. support for Kyiv. Russian officials have openly praised Trump&#x2019;s stance, with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov calling him &quot;the first, and so far, the only Western leader&quot; to acknowledge what Moscow considers the true cause of the war. Other Kremlin figures, including the deputy chair of Russia&#x2019;s Security Council, applauded Trump for taking a harsher tone toward Zelensky, even labeling Ukraine&#x2019;s leader a &quot;dictator.&quot; Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that once the war ends, Washington and Moscow could pursue &quot;potentially historic economic partnerships,&quot; including cooperation on Arctic development and rare earth mining.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-welcomes-trumps-policy-shift-as-us-moves-align-with-russias-interests/	2025-03-03T20:53:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1255667814.jpg
Vance says US door open if Zelensky willing to 'seriously talk peace'	As U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly halted all military aid to Ukraine, Vice President JD Vance once again criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky in a March 3 interview with Fox News, claiming Zelensky has shown a &quot;clear unwillingness to engage in the peace process&quot; &#x2014; a policy Trump insists reflects the will of the American people. During the Oval Office meeting on Feb. 28, Zelensky, Trump and Vance held a 45-minute-long press briefing in the Oval Office which ended in a heated argument about American aid to Ukraine, and canceling of the planned signing of the U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement. Trump and Vance accused Zelensky of failing to express gratitude for U.S. support and warned that his refusal to make concessions to Putin was a dangerous gamble that could escalate into World War III. Following the meeting, Trump said that Zelensky &quot;is not ready for peace.&quot; &quot;He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace,&quot; Trump posted on Truth Social on Feb. 28. Vance told Fox News&apos; Sean Hannity that &quot;what President Trump has said clearly and consistently is of course (that) the door is open so long as Zelensky is willing to seriously talk peace.&quot; &#xA0; &quot;You can&apos;t come into the Oval Office or anywhere else and refuse to even discuss the details of a peace deal,&quot; he said. &quot;This is not going to make anybody happy. The Russians are going to have to give up stuff, the Ukrainians are going to have to give up stuff. You can&apos;t come to the Oval Office and say &apos;give us security guarantees, we won&apos;t even engage with you about what we are willing to give up.&apos; That&apos;s been the Ukrainian posture.&quot; &quot;Hope is not a strategy. Throwing money and ammunition at a terrible conflict &#x2014; that is not a strategy,&quot; Vance said on the Biden adminstration policy on Ukraine. The U.S. has provided assistance worth $119.8 billion since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, including $67.1 billion in military aid, $49 billion in financial aid, and $3.6 billion in humanitarian aid, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Following the tense meeting with Trump, Zelensky told Fox News on Feb. 28 that Ukraine is &quot;ready for peace but we need to be in a good position.&quot; &quot;We want peace... that&apos;s why I visited President Trump,&quot; Zelensky told Fox News, adding that he hopes that Trump would show stronger support for Ukraine rather than positioning himself as a mediator in the war. He emphasized that Russia was the aggressor, having launched the invasion. &quot;I want really him to be more at our side,&quot; Zelensky said. Vance reiterated to Hannity that President Trump will be &quot;the first person to pick up the phone&quot; once Zelensky is ready to talk about peace. &quot;The president is actually taking a much more realistic perspective in saying this can&apos;t go on forever, we can&apos;t fund this thing forever, the Ukrainians can&apos;t fight forever &#x2014; so let&apos;s bring this thing to a peaceful settlement.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/vance-says-us-door-open-if-zelensky-willing-to-seriously-talk-peace/	2025-03-03T18:49:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199662300.jpg

BREAKING: Trump halts military aid to Ukraine, media reports	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered a suspension of all military aid to Ukraine, escalating pressure on President Volodymyr Zelensky mere days after a heated exchange in the Oval Office cast doubt on U.S. support for Kyiv. A senior Defense Department official told Bloomberg that all U.S. military assistance to Ukraine is on hold until Trump determines that Ukrainian leaders are making a genuine effort toward peace. The pause affects not only future aid but also weapons already in transit, including shipments on aircraft and ships, as well as equipment awaiting transfer in Poland. The decision follows a contentious meeting between Trump and Zelensky, where disagreements over military aid and Ukraine&#x2019;s strategic stance fueled tensions. Following the meeting, Trump said that Zelensky &quot;is not ready for peace.&quot; &quot;He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace,&quot; Trump posted on Truth Social on Feb. 28. The White House has not specified what steps Ukraine must take to restore the flow of military aid, leaving uncertainty over the timeline and conditions for its resumption.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-halts-military-aid-to-ukraine-media-reports/	2025-03-03T16:00:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179841418.jpg
Europe’s major powers consider seizing frozen Russian assets in ceasefire talks, FT reports	France, Germany, and the UK are exploring ways to seize over 200 billion euro ($210 billion) in frozen Russian assets as part of efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in Ukraine, officials familiar with the discussions told Financial Times (FT). While Berlin and Paris had previously resisted full asset confiscation, they are now engaging in talks with European and G7 partners about potential mechanisms to use the funds. A proposal discussed by French officials suggests seizing the assets if Moscow violates a future ceasefire agreement, ensuring security guarantees for Kyiv. Diplomatic activity has intensified in recent weeks, with France and the U.K. leading efforts to draft a European peace plan. These discussions gained momentum after U.S. President Donald Trump launched direct negotiations with Russia aimed at ending the war. Since 2022, G7 nations have frozen roughly 300 billion euro ($310 billion) in Russian central bank assets, with the majority&#x2014;around 190 billion euro ($200 billion) &#x2014;held in Belgium&#x2019;s Euroclear. Currently, only the interest generated by these funds is being used to back a $50 billion loan package for Ukraine, while the principal remains untouched. Ukraine, Poland, and the Baltic states have long pushed for the full confiscation of these assets, but major European capitals had resisted over concerns about international legal precedents and financial stability. The European Central Bank had warned that such a move could undermine confidence in the euro as a reserve currency, given that most of the frozen assets are euro-denominated. However, shifting political dynamics appear to be changing the debate. French President Emmanuel Macron recently told Trump that immediate seizure would not align with international law but suggested the assets could be part of post-war negotiations. Meanwhile, Germany&#x2019;s likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has signaled openness to asset seizure and is coordinating with outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz ahead of an EU summit. In the U.K., Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed that London is examining ways to deploy the funds, noting that while profits from Russian sovereign assets are already being used to support Ukraine, the fate of the principal remains complex.	https://kyivindependent.com/europes-major-powers-consider-seizing-frozen-russian-assets-in-ceasefire-talks-ft-reports/	2025-03-03T14:59:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1240065587.jpg
Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick claims US-Ukraine mineral deal to be signed	The United States and Ukraine are making progress on a key mineral agreement that could strengthen long-term economic ties and pave the way for further security assistance, according to U.S. Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick. Fitzpatrick, who represents Pennsylvania and serves as the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Energy, the Environment, and Cyber, announced the development on social media following a conversation with Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to President Volodymyr Zelensky. He described the discussion as &quot;lengthy and productive&quot; and expressed confidence that the deal would be finalized soon. I just had a lengthy and productive one-on-one conversation with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x2019;s Chief-of-Staff, Andrii Yermak. We are 100% getting this train back on the tracks. This mineral deal will be signed in short order, which will lead to a strong long-term economic&#x2026; &quot;This mineral deal will be signed in short order, which will lead to a strong long-term economic partnership between the United States and Ukraine, and which will ultimately and naturally lead to security assistance,&quot; Fitzpatrick wrote. He also indicated that European nations would be expected to contribute, adding that they would face mandates to step up their support. The specifics of the agreement remain unclear, but Ukraine&#x2019;s vast reserves of lithium and other rare earth minerals have drawn increasing interest from Western nations. These resources are critical for modern technologies, including batteries, electronics, and defense applications. Fitzpatrick&apos;s comment follows Zelensky&apos;s early departure from Washington on Feb. 28 without signing a U.S.-Ukraine mineral deal after a tense confrontation with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance at the White House. In the days since, some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have escalated criticism of Zelensky, with some suggesting he should resign.	https://kyivindependent.com/rep-brian-fitzpatrick-claims-us-ukraine-mineral-deal-to-be-signed/	2025-03-03T13:48:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201332404.jpg
Trump administration weighs sanctions relief for Russia, Reuters reports	The United States is preparing a proposal to potentially ease sanctions on Russia as President Donald Trump works to restore diplomatic ties and negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, a U.S. official and another source familiar with the discussions told Reuters. The White House has directed the State and Treasury departments to compile a list of sanctions that could be lifted. U.S. officials plan to use this list in upcoming talks with Russian representatives as part of a broader strategy to improve economic and political relations with Moscow. Sanctions officials are now drafting a proposal that would remove restrictions on specific Russian individuals and entities, including oligarchs, the sources said. While internal government offices routinely prepare such options, the White House&#x2019;s direct request signals a serious consideration of sanctions relief as part of a potential agreement with the Kremlin. The administration has not specified what it expects in return. Trump has moved quickly to shift U.S. policy on Russia. He called Russian President Vladimir Putin on Feb. 12, then sent U.S. representatives to meet with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia and Turkey. In January, Trump had warned that he would increase sanctions if Moscow refused to negotiate an end to the war. However, members of his administration have since acknowledged the possibility of lifting economic restrictions. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in a Feb. 20 interview with Bloomberg Television, suggested that Russia could see sanctions relief depending on its approach to negotiations. Trump himself told reporters on Feb. 26 that easing sanctions remained an option. The White House requested a potential sanctions relief plan before Trump extended a state of emergency last week over the war in Ukraine, the sources said. The state of emergency, first imposed in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea, allows the U.S. government to sanction individuals and organizations involved in the war. Despite Russia&#x2019;s ability to sustain a wartime economy through increased military spending and industrial production, experts say it remains vulnerable and in need of Western relief. The Kremlin has expressed interest in economic cooperation, particularly in rare earth metals. Putin recently suggested potential collaboration with the U.S. in that sector. Trump has also sought a minerals deal with Ukraine, which has significant lithium and rare earth metal reserves, as a way to offset the billions of dollars in American aid. However, his meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28 ended without an agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-administration-weighs-sanctions-relief-for-russia-reuters-reports/	2025-03-03T12:57:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1252236776.jpg
