Trump eyeing Russian minerals after war ends, US official says	The U.S. is open to a minerals deal with Russia, Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s envoy to the Middle East, said in an interview with Fox News on Feb. 27. Witkoff&apos;s remarks come as President Volodymyr Zelensky prepares to sign a critical minerals agreement between Ukraine and the U.S. on Feb. 28. In addition to Ukraine&apos;s mineral resources, the U.S. is interested in exploring Russia&apos;s significant mineral deposits once a peace agreement is reached, Witkoff said. &quot;I think there will be plenty of opportunities for the United States with Russia when this peace deal gets finished,&quot; Witkoff said. Witkoff said he believed there would be &quot;be plenty of economic cooperation opportunities&quot; between the U.S. and Russia once the war ends. Earlier this week, Trump said he was open to striking a deal on critical minerals with Russia, though he denied having spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin about accessing minerals in Russian-occupied Ukrainian lands. &quot;I&apos;d like to buy minerals on Russian land too if we can,&quot; Trump said. &quot;The rare earth, they have very good rare earth ... It&apos;s great for Russia too, because we could do deals there.&quot; Putin said on Feb. 24 that Moscow was open to working with foreign partners on developing rare earth metal deposits, including in occupied regions of Ukraine. In a significant foreign policy shift for the U.S., the Trump administration has been looking to increase cooperation with Russia despite the deterioration of relations between the two countries in recent years. While he is officially Trump&apos;s Middle East envoy, Witkoff has emerged as a key figure in the evolving negotiations between the U.S. and Russia. Witkoff traveled to Moscow earlier in February for the release of imprisoned U.S. teacher Marc Fogel, meeting personally with Putin during his visit. Witkoff also participated in the U.S.-Russia talks in Saudia Arabia on &#xA0;Feb. 18. No Ukrainian officials were present at the Riyadh negotiations. Some experts have suggested that Witkoff&apos;s increased role reflects Russia&apos;s belief that Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, holds stronger pro-Ukrainian views. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-administration-considering-russian-minerals-us-official-says/	2025-02-27T20:08:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2195072233.jpg
Turkish imports of Russian oil drop nearly fourfold after new sanctions	Turkish imports of Russian oil have quietly plummeted since harsher sanctions were imposed earlier this year, the Moscow Times reported on Feb. 27. The U.S. and U.K. passed sweeping sanctions against Russia&apos;s oil sector on Jan. 10, particularly targeting Moscow&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of tankers. Shipments of Russian Urals, the country&apos;s flagship crude oil, have dropped to a low not seen since December 2022. Turkish imports of Russian Urals fell to 0.24 million tons in February, down from 1.56 million tons in January, the Moscow Times reported. Turkey&apos;s top refiner, Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri (Tupras), has stopped accepting shipments of Russian crude, demanding that they comply with the $60 per barrel G7 price cap, Reuters Reuters reported earler this month. The change in policy began after the Jan. 10 sanctions. The drop in Turkish demand for Russian oil has impacted operations at Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz, major Russian oil and gas companies, and has affected over 180 tankers of the so-called &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; a large group of vessels Russia uses to circumvent Western sanctions. Amid sanctions on Russian oil, Turkey has sought to import from other producers. Turkish imports of oil from Africa reached a five-year high in February. Turkish imports of Nigerian Forcados Blend oil reached 0.26 million tons in February, the highest amount the nation has purchased from Nigeria since 2020. The country imported 0.36 million tons of Libyan Es Sider and Amna grade oil in February compared to only 80,000 tons in January &#x2014; a fourfold increase. Turkey has been long singled out as one of the main facilitators of circumventing sanctions imposed on Russia by the West over the invasion of Ukraine. In November 2024, the European Union&apos;s anti-fraud agency opened an investigation into the possible exporting of rebranded Russian oil via Turkey into the EU. Turkey, a member of NATO, has been pursuing a standalone Russia policy since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began, retaining a mediator role between Russia, Ukraine, and the West. Russian and U.S. officials held talks in Istanbul on Feb. 27, their second round of direct discussions this month. Ukraine was not a topic of the discussion, the U.S. State Department said.	https://kyivindependent.com/turkish-imports-of-russian-oil-drop-nearly-fourfold-amid-sanctions/	2025-02-27T18:30:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/taneco.jpg
If it doesn't happen quickly, it may not happen at all' — Trump on peace in Ukraine	A peace deal to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine will happen &quot;quickly&quot; or not at all, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 27 during a joint press conference with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The two leaders met earlier in the day for talks that focused heavily on Western allies&apos; role in securing a lasting peace in Ukraine. Trump said that steps towards a peace deal were &quot;moving along pretty rapidly&quot; and that he expected an agreement to be negotiated &quot;fairly soon,&quot; or not at all. &quot;If it doesn&apos;t happen quickly, it may not happen at all,&quot; he said. Trump has been pushing Ukraine and Russia to quickly negotiate a ceasefire, though no formal peace talks involving both Kyiv and Moscow have taken place. U.S. officials have held direct talks with Russian delegates in recent days, without Ukraine&apos;s participation. The U.S. has also reached an agreement on critical mineral revenues with Ukraine that President Volodymyr Zelensky will sign during a visit to the White House on Feb. 28. The minerals deal does not include ongoing security guarantees for Ukraine. Starmer has pressed Trump to pledge U.S. backing for a European-led peacekeeping force that would deter future Russian aggression in Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. No committments were announced following the meeting, though Starmer said he had &quot;a very productive discussion&quot; with Trump. &quot;The deal has to come first,&quot; Starmer said, adding that their respective teams would continue to talk about ways to make sure a future ceasefire holds. Starmer reiterated the U.K.&apos;s support for Ukraine and its plans to send record amounts of military aid to Kyiv this year. He insisted that a peace deal must be &quot;backed by strength&quot; and fair to Ukraine. &quot;It can&apos;t be peace that rewards the aggressor .... history must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the invader,&quot; he said. The U.S. and U.K. are discussing a peace deal that would be &quot;tough and fair&quot; and shaped directly by Ukraine, Starmer said. Starmer&apos;s visit to Washington comes shortly after French President Emmanuel Macron met with Trump at the White House to discuss European security interests and U.S. support for Ukraine. Starmer and Macron have championed a plan to deploy European peacekeeprs to Ukraine to monitor a ceasefire. The Kremlin has said it would not accept European troops in Ukraine as a condition of a peace agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/if-it-doesnt-happen-quickly-it-may-not-happen-at-all-trump-on-peace-in-ukraine/	2025-02-27T17:18:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201663269.jpg
EU leaders to discuss special envoy for Ukraine peace talks, Bloomberg reports	European Union leaders will consider appointing a special envoy for potential negotiations to end Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine during a meeting next week, sources familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg. The proposal follows growing concerns that the EU has been sidelined from early talks involving the United States and Russia. The discussion gained urgency after Washington engaged in direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, excluding both Ukraine and Europe from the conversation. In mid-February, U.S. and Russian officials held a first round of talks in Saudi Arabia without European or Ukrainian participation. Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s envoy for Ukraine and Russia, has been meeting with European officials and reportedly indicated at the Munich Security Conference that the EU is unlikely to have a role in the negotiations. Ukrainian officials have urged the EU to move quickly in naming a representative for potential peace discussions. European leaders are expected to use the March 6 summit to define a unified stance on defense and security guarantees for Ukraine, according to sources who requested anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the issue. The summit will also serve as a platform to outline the EU&#x2019;s broader vision for Ukraine&#x2019;s future security and potential post-war settlement. Leaders will discuss what peace terms should look like and what commitments the bloc is willing to make to support Kyiv in any negotiations with Moscow and Washington. Additionally, the European Commission is set to present a plan to boost the continent&#x2019;s defense industry with an injection of hundreds of billions of euros. The commission is also expected to propose measures allowing more flexible defense spending while ensuring compliance with EU fiscal rules, according to the sources.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-leaders-to-discuss-special-envoy-for-ukraine-peace-talks/	2025-02-27T15:41:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158001247.jpg
EBRD lowers Ukraine’s 2025 growth forecast amid inflation, war impact	The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has lowered its 2025 growth forecast for Ukraine&#x2019;s economy, now expecting 3.5% growth instead of the previously projected 4.7%, the bank announced in a press release on Feb. 27. The downgrade comes as inflation accelerates due to the ongoing war. In December 2024, inflation reached 12%, driven by rising electricity costs, utility price hikes, wage increases, and the weakening hryvnia against the U.S. dollar. According to the EBRD, Russian attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure and severe labor shortages have slowed economic growth from 5% to just 2% in late 2024. &#x201C;The continuation of the war and massive attacks by Russia on Ukraine&#x2019;s electricity infrastructure have caused both power shortages&#x2014;forcing Ukrainians to pay high prices for imported electricity&#x2014;and acute labor shortages,&#x201D; the EBRD wrote. Despite these challenges, Ukraine&#x2019;s economy still grew by 3% in 2024. The EBRD predicts growth could reach 5% in 2026, but only if the war ends this year. To curb inflation, Ukraine&#x2019;s central bank has raised interest rates from 13% to 14.5% since December and may increase them further. The bank previously projected inflation would peak at 15% by mid-2025 before falling to 8.4% by year-end. Meanwhile, Ukraine&#x2019;s 2025 budget deficit is expected to reach 19.4% of GDP, but the country has secured $38.4 billion in foreign aid to cover the shortfall. This includes $13.7 billion from the EU, $22 billion from G7 countries using frozen Russian assets, and $2.7 billion from the IMF. Despite ongoing wartime challenges, the EBRD sees several factors supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s economy in 2025: resilient businesses, a functioning Black Sea trade corridor, strong government spending, and increased military orders for domestic manufacturers.	https://kyivindependent.com/ebrd-lowers-ukraines-2025-growth-forecast-amid-inflation-war-impact/	2025-02-27T14:58:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1238699802.jpg
General accused of botching Kharkiv defense released from detention facility, lawyer says	The Kyiv Court of Appeal has released Lieutenant General Artur Horbenko from a detention facility and placed him under house arrest until March 20, online newspaper Ukrainian Pravda reported on Feb. 27, citing his lawyer Maksym Tkhorivsky. Horbenko, along with General Yurii Halushkin and Colonel Illia Lapin, was arrested on Jan. 21 on charges of mismanaging Ukraine&apos;s defense in Kharkiv Oblast during Russia&apos;s cross-border offensive in May 2024. Horbenko is suspected of negligence in military service. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) accused the three officers of failing to properly fortify the region and use all available resources to repel Russian forces. Russia&apos;s offensive into northeastern Kharkiv Oblast saw rapid advances of several kilometers, prompting criticism of military and regional leadership for inadequate defensive preparations. Although Ukrainian forces eventually stalled the Russian advance roughly 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Kharkiv, the initial breach raised concerns over strategic failures. Halushkin was accused of assigning inadequate defensive positions to the 125th Territorial Defense Brigade, which was under Horbenko&apos;s command, and failing to provide sufficient artillery and air support. While Horbenko will remain under house arrest, the status of the other detained officers remains unchanged.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-accused-of-mismanaging-kharkiv-defense-granted-house-arrest-ukrainian-pravda-reports/	2025-02-27T14:24:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/474329165_1146672037460027_6619400731941116373_n.jpg
Rutte announces NATO allies will provide Ukraine with billions more in aid	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has announced that alliance members are ramping up their defense investments and preparing additional financial support for Ukraine. His remarks came after a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 27. &quot;Great to talk with Donald Trump. US &amp; NATO are getting stronger. NATO Allies are moving quickly to invest more in defense. Big increases announced &amp; others to follow,&quot; Rutte said in a post on X. He also emphasized NATO&apos;s continued support for Ukraine, adding that &quot;on Ukraine, Allies are preparing billions more in aid and contributions to security guarantees.&quot; Rutte&#x2019;s comments signal a concerted effort by NATO members to bolster collective defense and sustain military assistance to Ukraine as the war with Russia continues. Rutte previously said that Europe is prepared to take the lead in providing security guarantees for Ukraine. His statement, posted on X on Feb. 17, followed a Paris summit hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron, where European leaders gathered ahead of upcoming U.S.-Russia talks on ending the war. &quot;Europe is ready and willing to step up. To lead in providing security guarantees for Ukraine. Ready and willing to invest a lot more in our security. The details will need to be decided, but the commitment is clear,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/rutte-announces-nato-allies-will-provide-ukraine-with-billions-more-in-aid/	2025-02-27T13:39:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2149020115.jpg
Future peacekeeping force may patrol air, sea space, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry says	Ukraine is in talks with Western allies to ensure that any future military contingent monitoring a potential ceasefire also has a role in patrolling air and sea space, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said at a news briefing on Feb. 27. &quot;If our partners and allies are ready to discuss the possible deployment of these contingents to ensure peace and security in Ukraine... then we think it is quite possible to talk about the safety of the sky,&quot; Tykhyi said. The discussion comes as the concept of a multinational peacekeeping force has been raised as a potential security guarantee for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. Tykhyi emphasized the importance of strengthening security in the Black Sea, given Russia&#x2019;s continued threats to the freedom of navigation. &quot;We are already talking about this in the negotiations with them (Western partners) and believe that this is a serious topic that needs to be discussed,&quot; he said, adding that the issue may be further addressed at the EU summit on Mar. 6. Washington has backed the idea of a European-led peacekeeping force, with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth saying on Feb. 12 that such a mission would not include U.S. troops. U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated on Feb. 26 that Europe should take primary responsibility for regional security. France, the U.K., and several other countries have signaled support for deploying peacekeepers, though European nations have yet to reach a consensus. The Washington Post reported on Feb. 17 that up to 30,000 European troops could be sent to Ukraine as part of a ceasefire monitoring mission.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-seeks-expanded-role-for-possible-peacekeeping-forces-in-air-sea-monitoring-foreign-ministry-says/	2025-02-27T13:21:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2166614075.jpg
Is Donald Trump a Russian asset? This US author is 'completely certain' he is	Questions about U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s possibly shady relationship with Russia and the country&apos;s security services have long swirled, even culminating in a special counsel investigation during his first term in office. Though that investigation found evidence of &quot;extensive criminal activity&quot; by Trump, his associates, and some of his family members, it found no evidence that he was working for, or had ever been recruited by, Russia&apos;s security services. Yet despite this, the topic refuses to go away &#x2014; most recently in a viral Facebook post from a former Kazakh security official that claimed Trump was recruited by the Soviet Union&apos;s spy agency, the KGB, in 1987 and given the code name &quot;Krasnov.&quot; Craig Unger, an American journalist and writer who has written two books on Trump&#x2019;s connections to Russia&#x2019;s security services and the Russian mafia stretching all the way back to the 1980s, says he is &quot;absolutely certain&quot; that the U.S. president is a Russian asset. According to Unger, Trump&#x2019;s current actions are benefiting Russian President Vladimir Putin, and destroying relationships with long-time allies. The Kyiv Independent sat down with Unger to hear what makes him so certain. The Kyiv Independent: A lot of the discussion around Trump and his connections to Russia gets dismissed as conspiracy theories based on circumstantial evidence. What would you say to those accusations? Craig Unger: First of all, I want to distinguish between an asset and an agent. An agent is someone who has signed on with the KGB, can be given specific tasks, and is actually paid by them. That&apos;s not the way it works with an asset. The KGB made a point of cultivating powerful businessmen &#x2014; I&apos;m thinking of Armand Hammer. He was an enormously wealthy American oil man, who was very much an asset. And he was sort of aging out when the KGB began cultivating Trump. The Kyiv Independent: How certain are you that Donald Trump is a Russian asset? Craig Unger: Completely certain. I&apos;ve written two books about it. &#x201C;House of Trump, House of Putin,&#x201D; and &#x201C;American Kompromat,&#x201D; and not a single fact has been challenged in my reporting. It really goes back to 1980 when Donald Trump was just starting out and had his first successful real estate adventure. He&apos;s had a lot of failures. This one was actually a success &#x2014; he developed the Grand Hyatt Hotel right near Grand Central Station here in New York. And like every big hotel, he needed a lot of TV sets. And he ended up buying them from the Joy Lud electronics store, which was a front for the KGB. And I got that information from a former agent with the KGB, Yuri Shvets. And it really all started from that. They sent out a spotter agent, someone who&apos;s trying to recruit talent for someone who can help the KGB later on &#x2014; and they came to Donald Trump. And that set off a series of meetings and events, which led to Trump&apos;s first visit to Moscow in 1987. Women walk past a Voentorg military store ad featuring U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in central Moscow, Russia on Jan. 19, 2017. Russian chain of military stores informed of a 10% discount for US citizens and employees of the US embassy. (Vasily Maximov/AFP via Getty Images)&#xA0;The Kyiv Independent: If you had to pick three things that are the biggest pieces of evidence that Trump was, or is a Russian asset, what would you choose? Craig Unger: In 1984, a man named David Bogatin came to Trump Tower, which is a crown jewel among Trump&apos;s buildings, and put down $6 million on the table and bought five condos. What was interesting about that was that according to FBI files, Bogatin was a member of the Russian mafia. And this was the first of many such people who are affiliated with the Russian mafia &#x2014; I found a total of 13 people &#x2014; who lived in Trump Tower or other Trump buildings. Trump was hosting the Russian mafia for many years before he even ran for president. So that&apos;s one thing. Another is when he went to Moscow in 1987. &#xA0;This was a visit that was set up by the KGB, according to Shvets. And when Trump got there, he was sort of groomed by the KGB. He came back and a lot of people have forgotten this, but he made a brief abortive run for president in 1988. He also took out a full page ad in The New York Times (NYT), that was assailing America&apos;s alliance with NATO. People are shocked today that Trump is betraying Ukraine, he&apos;s betraying Europe, he&apos;s siding with Putin. Well, he did it as early as 1987, when he was starting to run for the presidency in 1988. And that is very well documented, it was printed in the NYT. It&apos;s exactly the foreign policy he is acting out today that is so horrifying. This is the end of NATO, it&apos;s the end of the Western alliance. Trump is allying with Vladimir Putin, and against Ukraine and all of Western Europe. The Kyiv Independent: What has happened more recently to make you believe Trump is a Russian asset? Craig Unger: You saw him during his first term as president when he met with Putin in Helsinki &#x2014; he essentially said that he trusted Putin far more than American intelligence (agencies). And what we see happening now is, he is essentially destroying Western intelligence. I can&apos;t imagine Ukraine or any European partners wanting to share intelligence with the U.S., as long as Trump is president, because it&apos;s likely to be passed straight along to Vladimir Putin. The Kyiv Independent: Just last week there was a Facebook post from somebody who professes to have been part of the KGB in Kazakhstan during the 1980s and he said Trump was recruited then. Craig Unger: Yes, I&apos;m aware of that post, I have not been able to corroborate it. If I&apos;m not mistaken, he was talking about the sixth directorate in the KGB. I&apos;m not sure they were recruiting American assets. And the first director and the second director of the KGB were doing that mostly. So I really can&apos;t corroborate it. The Kyiv Independent: As an American citizen, how does all of this make you feel? Craig Unger: I&apos;m petrified, to be honest. When I grew up, the movie that I loved in my childhood was &#x201C;The Manchurian Candidate,&#x201D; the original, 1962 version. It posited that the communists had gotten inside the White House. And that was the whole premise. And it was seen as incredibly conspiratorial. The idea that it could actually happen in some way is just breathtaking. And I think we&apos;re entering a new era in the U.S. And we have to fight back. Because I would very much like to keep an alliance with my friends in Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/is-donald-trump-a-russian-asset-this-us-author-is-completely-certain-he-is/	2025-02-27T12:27:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198674851.jpg
Trump extends some sanctions against Russia until 2026	U.S. President Donald Trump has extended some of the sanctions against Russia until March 6, 2026, according to a decree set to be published in the U.S. Federal Register on Feb. 28. The decree, which is available on the U.S. Federal Register&apos;s site, extends the state of emergency over the situation in Ukraine that was first declared on March 6, 2014 under then-President Barack Obama in response to Russia&apos;s annexation of Crimea. The decree also extends related sanctions imposed by Obama. &quot;The actions and policies addressed in these Executive Orders continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States,&quot; the decree reads. The decision comes amid Trump&apos;s renewed engagement with Russia, including talks on Feb. 18 on ending the war in Ukraine and the potential reopening of embassies in Washington and Moscow. While Trump said on Feb. 25 that sanctions against Russia would be lifted &quot;at some point,&quot; he has also said they would remain in place until a peace deal is reached. Trump suggested on Jan. 21 that additional sanctions would be imposed on Russia if President Vladimir Putin did not reach an agreement with Ukraine. The U.S. has maintained extensive economic restrictions on Russia since the start of its full-scale invasion in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-signs-decree-extending-sanctions-on-russia-emergency-status/	2025-02-27T12:27:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198945928.jpg
Trump, Starmer meet as UK urges continued US support for Ukraine	U.S. President Donald Trump met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House on Feb. 27, as Starmer sought to convince Washington to maintain its role in Ukraine&apos;s security amid ongoing Russian aggression. Starmer reiterated the need for a U.S. &quot;backstop&quot; for a proposed European peacekeeping force in Ukraine, arguing that American support would be necessary for ensuring a lasting peace. Trump emphasized that a peace deal must be reached before any peacekeeping forces are deployed. &quot;I have confidence if we make a deal, it&apos;s going to hold,&quot; he said, adding that securing Ukraine&apos;s long-term stability after an agreement is reached would be &quot;the easy part.&quot; The idea of a multinational peacekeeping force has been floated as a potential security guarantee for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. The meeting came ahead of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s scheduled visit to Washington on Feb. 28, where he is set to sign a critical minerals agreement with the U.S. The deal establishes a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. Zelensky initially rejected the agreement over the absence of security guarantees but later said that discussions on guarantees would take place in future negotiations. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump referenced Zelensky&apos;s upcoming visit, emphasizing America&apos;s need for rare earth minerals. &quot;President Zelensky is coming to see me on Friday morning,&quot; Trump said. &quot;And we&apos;re going to be signing really a very important agreement for both sides because it&apos;s really going to get us into that country, working there.&quot; The past few weeks have seen a shift in U.S. policy, with the Trump administration taking a more confrontational stance toward Ukraine while intensifying diplomatic outreach to Russia in an effort to broker a swift agreement. U.S. and Russian officials have resumed high-level bilateral talks, holding meetings in Riyadh on Feb. 18 and Istanbul on Feb. 27.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-starmer-meet-as-uk-urges-continued-us-support-for-ukraine/	2025-02-27T12:20:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2202329109.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Trump says he 'can't believe' he called Zelensky 'dictator'	Key developments on Feb. 27: U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 27 that he could not believe he had called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator.&quot; Trump made the comment at a briefing with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House. &quot;Did I say that? I can&apos;t believe I would say that,&quot; Trump responded when asked whether he still considers Zelensky a &quot;dictator.&quot; Trump referred to Zelensky as a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; in a Truth Social post on Feb. 19, falsely accusing him of refusing to hold elections and repeating the Kremlin narrative about Zelensky&apos;s alleged illegitimacy. Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. If martial law had not been imposed, Zelensky&apos;s term would have ended on May 20, 2024. Both Russia and some of Zelensky&apos;s domestic critics claim that he ceased to be a legitimate president on May 20. Major Ukrainian constitutional lawyers and legal experts believe the claim is false and unfounded. A Feb. 19 poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) showed that 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky, marking a five-point increase since December. Asked about the potential longevity of a peace agreement with Russia, Trump expressed confidence that any deal his administration reaches would hold. &quot;I have confidence if we make a deal it&apos;s going to hold,&quot; he said, adding that securing Ukraine&apos;s long-term stability after a deal is reached would be &quot;the easy part.&quot; The Trump administration has disrupted years of U.S. foreign policy towards Russia. U.S. and Russian officials have resumed high-level bilateral talks, holding meetings in Riyadh on Feb. 18 and Istanbul on Feb. 27. The U.S. president also said that he does not believe Putin would launch another invasion of Ukraine once a peace deal is reached. When asked on Feb. 24 whether he considers Putin a dictator, Trump avoided the question, saying, &quot;I don&apos;t use those words lightly... I think we&apos;re going to see how it all works out.&quot; Elections have been routinely rigged in Russia, genuine opposition candidates have not been allowed to run, and the Kremlin&apos;s monopoly on television ensured that only government-backed candidates have air time. In 2020, Russia held a rigged vote on constitutional amendments that eliminated limits on Putin&apos;s presidential terms, effectively making him dictator for life. More than 20 opponents of Putin have been killed or died in mysterious circumstances. Moscow and Washington are ready to re-establish cooperation, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Feb. 27 during a meeting of the Federal Security Service&apos;s (FSB) board, praising the Trump administration for its &quot;pragmatism.&quot; In recent days, the Trump administration has upended years of U.S. foreign policy towards Russia and Ukraine. U.S. and Russian officials resumed high-level bilateral contacts, holding meetings in Riyadh on Feb. 18 and Istanbul on Feb. 27. Speaking as the Russian delegates were concluding their talks in Turkey, Putin described the first contacts between Russia and the U.S. as &quot;inspiring certain hopes.&quot; He also claimed that some Western countries are dissatisfied with the restoration of Russian-American relations and want to &quot;create instability in the world.&quot; &quot;These forces will try to disrupt or compromise the dialogue that has begun,&quot; Putin said, without providing any evidence. &quot;We need to take it into account and use all the means of diplomacy and intelligence services to disrupt such attempts.&quot; Ukraine has been excluded from the talks in Saudi Arabia, sparking concerns that the Trump administration seeks to sideline Kyiv. The subsequent talks in Istanbul were allegedly focused on embassy operations and did not concern the Russia-Ukraine war. During the talks in Riyadh, Moscow allegedly demanded that the U.S. withdraw NATO forces from eastern Europe as a condition for &quot;normalizing relations,&quot; the Financial Times reported, citing two officials in the region. The U.S. delegation reportedly rejected the demand, but concerns remain over what concessions President Donald Trump might consider to secure a deal with Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that he wants European allies to be involved in peace negotiations. Kyiv insists that no talks about Ukraine and ending Russia&apos;s war should be held without Ukraine. Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, said that Europe will not be directly involved in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, but its interests will be considered. Russia may lose its chance for world leadership if it does not halt its full-scale war against Ukraine by 2026, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) head Kyrylo Budanov said in an interview with Ukrinform published on Feb. 27. Earlier this month, Budanov said he believes that Ukraine and Russia will reach a ceasefire this year. His comments come as U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed to mediate a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia while using increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Kyiv. Asked whether the Kremlin wants to make a peace deal now to build up its strength, Budanov agreed, saying that Russia needs a break. &quot;According to their (Russia&apos;s) strategy, if they don&apos;t get out of this war by 2026, they lose even a chance for world leadership. They will be left with a maximum level of regional leadership, which they are absolutely not satisfied with,&quot; the spy chief said. According to Budanov, the financial cost of the war is &quot;too high&quot; for Moscow, which prevents it from focusing on development and large-scale projects. Russia has problems with its economy, but it will be able to &quot;balance&quot; it out as long as it has oil, gas, and precious metals, he added. &quot;There is a lack of technologies, technological solutions that are not available in Russia, primarily for the development of the Arctic region, gas production, etc.,&quot; Budanov said. Throughout the three years of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine&apos;s Western partners imposed heavy sanctions on Moscow to undermine its ability to wage war. Initially, Russia has largely weathered the sanctions, circumventing economic restrictions through third-party countries and various loopholes. The situation appears to be shifting as Russia has faced mounting economic challenges over the past months, compounded by labor shortages and military spending-induced inflation that led to record interest rates. In the fall of 2023, Budanov said that Russia likely has the economic and technical capacity to continue its war against Ukraine until 2025 or 2026. In office since 2020, Budanov has at times made radical predictions about the full-scale war that have not always come true. Turkey has indicated its openness to deploying troops in Ukraine as part of a potential peacekeeping force, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 27, citing sources familiar with the matter. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan discussed the possibility with President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov during separate meetings in Ankara earlier in February, according to Bloomberg. Moscow has publicly opposed NATO troops in Ukraine, but Russia has not given Turkey a concrete response on the proposal, Bloomberg reported. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 20 that Russia was concerned about NATO countries discussing a potential deployment of peacekeepers. Sources told Bloomberg that Turkey would not participate unless it is directly involved in all consultations and preparations for such a mission. The idea of a multinational peacekeeping force has been floated as a potential security guarantee for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. While Washington has supported the concept, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Feb. 12 that such a mission would not include U.S. troops and should be led by European and non-European allies. France, the U.K., and several other countries have expressed support for a peacekeeping force, but European nations have yet to reach a consensus. Ukraine has regrouped its troops on the battlefield, slowing down Russian forces&apos; advance in the most &quot;threatening areas,&quot; Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Feb. 27. Russian troops are actively pushing on the Novopavlivka sector in eastern Donetsk Oblast, trying to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense and capture three settlements, according to Syrskyi.He did not specify which settlements he meant.The village of Novopavlivka in Donetsk Oblast lies some 5 kilometers (3 miles) north of the embattled city of Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian troops in the region. The estimated Russian advance near Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, as of Feb. 26, 2025, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)&quot;However, our side has taken a number of measures to improve the interaction of military units and subdivisions, regrouped troops, which slowed down... (Russia&apos;s) advance in most threatening areas,&quot; the general said after visiting the front line.Since the beginning of the day, 110 clashes between Ukrainian and Russian forces have taken place along the front line, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said in its latest update on Feb. 27. According to Syrskyi, Russia continues trying to reach the administrative border of Donetsk Oblast, suffering heavy losses. &quot;The plans remain unfulfilled,&quot; he said.A day before, the 25th Separate Airborne Brigade reported that Ukrainian troops had regained control of the village of Kotlyne, near Pokrovsk. Kotlyne and Pokrovsk are connected by the T 0406 highway, which also leads to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Russian troops recaptured the village of Nikolsky in embattled Kursk Oblast, some 42 kilometers (26 miles) north of the Ukrainian-occupied town of Sudzha, Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Feb. 27. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, senior Russian General Staff officer Sergei Rudsky said earlier in February. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claims that its troops continue to advance and push Ukrainian forces out of the salient. Kyiv has not commented on purportedly lost settlements in Kursk Oblast. According to Rudsky, Ukrainian soldiers control about 500 square kilometers (193 square miles) out of 1,268 square kilometers (490 square miles) initially seized by Kyiv. Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000 in Kursk Oblast, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 6. Another 909 have been reportedly taken as prisoners of war. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Ukraine likely seeks to use its foothold in Kursk Oblast as leverage in potential peace talks. Russia&apos;s forces in Kursk Oblast have been bolstered by North Korean troops, deployed last fall to help counter the Ukrainian incursion. President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that the offensive disrupted Russia&apos;s ability to carry out large-scale operations in northeastern and southern Ukraine.

US Senator Bernie Sanders: ‘Trump likes what Putin does’	As Ukraine enters the fourth year of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, shifting political dynamics in the U.S. threaten to influence the course of the war. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly misrepresented the war&#x2019;s origins, excluded Ukraine from initial negotiations, and advocated for what many see as an exploitative deal that would force Ukraine to surrender national resources as &#x201C;repayment&#x201D; for U.S. aid. Trump&#x2019;s rhetoric raises urgent questions about America&apos;s long-term commitment to aiding Ukraine. In an interview with the Kyiv Independent, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders shares his concerns about Trump&#x2019;s growing alignment with Russia and other authoritarian regimes, what a possible U.S.-Russia alliance would mean for the American people, the role of billionaires like Elon Musk in shaping both domestic and international political discourse, and why defending Ukraine is crucial for the future of global democracy. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. The Kyiv Independent: Recently, a number of Republicans have hesitated to say outright that Russia invaded Ukraine. At the same time, Donald Trump has not only called President Volodymyr Zelensky a dictator &#x2014; he has spoken in increasingly favorable terms about Russian President Vladimir Putin. What is going on with the state of the GOP right now? Bernie Sanders: What is extraordinarily distressing to the majority of the American people is that we now have a president who has very strong authoritarian tendencies, and in many ways, is moving the U.S., the longest-standing democracy on Earth, into an authoritarian-style society. In many ways, Trump likes what Putin does. Putin does not allow freedom of the press. Putin kills his opponents. Putin does not allow dissent &#x2014; and that&apos;s kind of a model that Trump likes. For the first time in modern history, we have a president who is aligning himself with authoritarian governments all over the world, not only Russia but with Iran, with Belarus, rather than with democratic governments in Europe and Ukraine. It is a very distressing moment. As part of that movement toward authoritarianism, you have people like Elon Musk, the richest guy in the world, who says to Republicans that if you don&apos;t do what the U.S. president wants you to do, we&apos;re going to spend unlimited amounts of money to defeat you (in your next election) &#x2014; so you better get in line. Obviously, everybody in America knows that Russia started this war. But you have Republicans who are just too afraid to speak up against Trump. It&apos;s a sad state of affairs. The Kyiv Independent: Let&apos;s imagine the worst-case scenario where American foreign interests align with Russia&apos;s. How would that impact the lives of average Americans? Bernie Sanders: Well, for a start, it would undermine what the U.S. has been about for 250 years. America is the longest-standing democracy on Earth. For so many years, it hasn&#x2019;t been perfect. God knows American democracy is not perfect and that our foreign policy over the years has had many, many flaws. But the truth is that developing nations look to the U.S., to our constitution, to our Declaration of Independence, to our appreciation of human freedom and democracy and say that that makes sense.And now for us to shift into alliances with authoritarian thugs and murderers like Putin or the Saudi Arabian government or other oligarchies is extremely distressing to the vast majority of American people. The Kyiv Independent: Do you think that history will look back favorably upon the past decade of military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine? Bernie Sanders: I think what history will show is that a country was invaded by a large authoritarian nation with a powerful army who thought that they could conquer another country in a few days. But that country, Ukraine, fought back with extraordinary courage and has suffered terribly as a result. Its European allies, democratic nations, have stood up to Putin and come to their aid. And up until now, the U.S. and the people of America have also supported Ukraine. At a time when democracy all over the world is under threat, when we&apos;re seeing increased power for oligarchs and authoritarians, I think defending Ukraine is defending democracy and justice all over the world. Then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump leaves the stage after taking part in a roundtable discussion hosted by Building America&apos;s Future in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania, U.S. on Oct. 29, 2024. (Charly Triballeau/ AFP P/ Pugliano/Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: We see figures like Musk working alongside Trump while also regularly spreading Russian disinformation online. What can the U.S. do to better fight Russian propaganda? Bernie Sanders: That&apos;s an issue that we are thinking about and working on every single day. And I&apos;ll give you another example. It&apos;s not just Musk and his power from owning Twitter, which is extraordinary. He has extraordinary reach. And by the way, don&apos;t think it&apos;s just Ukraine that he is going after. In terms of domestic policies, we passed some important legislation here. Musk lied about that legislation and got Republicans to defeat it a couple of months ago. But it&apos;s not just Musk. The second wealthiest man in the country, Jeff Bezos, decided to convert the Washington Post, one of our major newspapers, from what I would call a centrist moderate paper to a right-wing editorial page. He just made that public yesterday. So this is a difficult moment for my country, for people who believe in democracy and who don&#x2019;t believe in oligarchy. And we are doing our best, not only in terms of Ukraine but in many, many other areas, to take on Musk and his enormous power and Trump. But I do want to say &#x2014; as somebody who has gone around the country &#x2014; &#xA0;I want the people of Ukraine to know that the majority of the American people do not believe Trump. Trump is a pathological liar, and most Americans know that. Most Americans know that Russia started the war, not Ukraine. Most Americans know that Putin is the dictator, not Zelensky. Most Americans know that under terrible conditions, Ukraine has fought back valiantly and is admired and respected by people all over the world. I want you all to know that. The Kyiv Independent: What can the average American do in these uncertain coming weeks and months to show their support for Ukraine? Bernie Sanders: I think we have got to stand up and expose Trump for the liar that he is. The idea that he would, in the middle of a terrible war where you have lost tens and tens of thousands of people &#x2014; (among them) men, women, and children &#x2014; propose extractions of rare minerals from Ukraine when it is struggling so much is quite outrageous. What we are doing (here in the U.S.) is going all over the country. We&apos;re seeing large numbers of people coming out and saying Trumpism, authoritarianism, and oligarchy are not what the U.S. is about. We have reason to be proud that we are the longest-standing democracy on Earth, and we intend to keep it that way. It was a great honor for me to talk to U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, a politician I&apos;ve admired my whole adult life. Hearing people like him speak the truth about the threat of global authoritarianism and the importance of continuing to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia&apos;s war of total annihilation is more important than ever.

Trump says he 'can't believe' he called Zelensky 'dictator'	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 27 that he could not believe he had called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator.&quot; Trump made the comment at a briefing with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House. &quot;Did I say that? I can&apos;t believe I would say that,&quot; Trump responded when asked whether he still considers Zelensky a &quot;dictator.&quot; Trump referred to Zelensky as a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; in a Truth Social post on Feb. 19, falsely accusing him of refusing to hold elections and repeating the Kremlin narrative about Zelensky&apos;s alleged illegitimacy. Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. If martial law had not been imposed, Zelensky&apos;s term would have ended on May 20, 2024. Both Russia and some of Zelensky&apos;s domestic critics claim that he ceased to be a legitimate president on May 20. Major Ukrainian constitutional lawyers and legal experts believe the claim is false and unfounded. A Feb. 19 poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) showed that 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky, marking a five-point increase since December. Asked about the potential longevity of a peace agreement with Russia, Trump expressed confidence that any deal his administration reaches would hold. &quot;I have confidence if we make a deal it&apos;s going to hold,&quot; he said, adding that securing Ukraine&apos;s long-term stability after a deal is reached would be &quot;the easy part.&quot; The Trump administration has disrupted years of U.S. foreign policy towards Russia. U.S. and Russian officials have resumed high-level bilateral talks, holding meetings in Riyadh on Feb. 18 and Istanbul on Feb. 27. The U.S. president also said that he does not believe Putin would launch another invasion of Ukraine once a peace deal is reached. When asked on Feb. 24 whether he considers Putin a dictator, Trump avoided the question, saying, &quot;I don&apos;t use those words lightly... I think we&apos;re going to see how it all works out.&quot; Elections have been routinely rigged in Russia, genuine opposition candidates have not been allowed to run, and the Kremlin&apos;s monopoly on television ensured that only government-backed candidates have air time. In 2020, Russia held a rigged vote on constitutional amendments that eliminated limits on Putin&apos;s presidential terms, effectively making him dictator for life. More than 20 opponents of Putin have been killed or died in mysterious circumstances.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-says-he-cant-believe-he-called-zelensky-a-dictator/	2025-02-27T11:28:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197144376--1-.jpg
63-year-old Russian film critic put under house arrest in Moscow for ‘fake news’ about war in Ukraine	Independent Russian film critic Ekaterina Barabash was placed under house arrest by a Moscow court for posting &#x201C;fake news&#x201D; on her Facebook account about the war in Ukraine, her son Yurii Barabash reported on Facebook on Feb. 26. Detained by the Russian Investigative Committee on Feb. 25, Barabash will remain under house arrest until April 25. The Russian Investigative Committee, which is supposed to probe serious federal crimes, claimed in a Telegram post on Feb. 26 that Barabash &#x201C;admitted her guilt in full&#x201D; during an interrogation. Crackdowns on freedom of expression in Russia have only intensified since the start of Moscow&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine. &#x201C;We do not know who reported her. Given that she is a public figure, it&#x2019;s possible that her social media could have been under digital surveillance by the Russian security services,&#x201D; Yurii, who was born in Russia but has lived and worked in Ukraine for more than 15 years, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;She understood the risks involved (in speaking out). For her, it was impossible to remain silent while witnessing what the country she had lived in all her life was doing to the country where she was born &#x2014; a country she loves and considers her true homeland.&#x201D; Born in Kharkiv, Barabash is the daughter of a famous Ukrainian literary scholar. For speaking out in support of Ukraine fighting against a war of total annihilation, the 63-year-old could face a financial fine of up to five million rubles ($57,500) or up to 10 years in prison. Accusing Russian citizens under Article 207.3, Part 2 of the criminal code of spreading &#x201C;knowingly false&#x201D; information about the military is a common method used by the Russian regime to silence dissent. In 2024 alone, at least 620 people faced politically motivated charges in Russia and the occupied Ukrainian territories, with a 25% surge in imprisonments compared to 2023, according to the independent human rights group OVD-Info. The court documents in Barabash&#x2019;s case cite four specific Facebook posts that were scrutinized by the authorities, but only one of them remains accessible online. &#x201C;Lord, save me, make it so that I don&#x2019;t choke with hatred for these hypocrites, liars, and murders. I won&#x2019;t be able to take it anymore soon &#x2014; my heart is breaking into pieces,&#x201D; the post from early spring 2022 reads. &#x201C;(You) bastards bomb a country, raze entire cities to the ground, kill hundreds of children, shoot at peaceful people for no reason, keep Mariupol under a blockade, deprive millions of people of a normal life, and force them to leave for foreign countries. &#xA0;For what? For the sake of friendship with Ukraine? You are Evil on a planetary scale.&#x201D; Russian authorities arrested Barabash following a search of her home, according to her son. Prior to her arrest, she had returned to Moscow from attending the Berlinale Film Festival as an accredited journalist. Barabash being put under house arrest following her detention is &#x201C;the best scenario we could have hoped for (given the alternatives),&#x201D; Yurii said. However, he remains unable to communicate directly with his mother, as she is prohibited from using any electronic devices. &#x201C;All the information I receive comes through her friends, who are allowed to visit her,&#x201D; he said. In a video released by Russian independent media outlet Sota Vision, Barabash can be seen in more or less good spirits following the court hearing. With a hint of irony, she inquires, &#x201C;Will it be a pretty bracelet?&#x201D; in reference to the surveillance tag authorities are set to impose on her during house arrest.

(Alexander Nemenov/AFP via Getty Images)Strength in Ukrainian heritageAfter Russia&#x2019;s 2014 invasion of Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and its illegal annexation of Crimea, Barabash considered leaving the country. But with elderly parents to care for, she made the difficult choice to stay. &#x201C;Relocating people of such an advanced age is dangerous &#x2014; some do not survive the journey. I understand her in this regard,&#x201D; Ukrainian poet Lyuba Yakimchuk, who is Barabash&#x2019;s daughter-in-law, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;My grandmother, who relocated from Russian occupation (in Luhansk Oblast) at a much younger age, did not endure the move, struggled to adapt, and passed away soon after.&#x201D; Barabash&#x2019;s father, a recipient of Ukraine&#x2019;s prestigious Shevchenko Prize for his work on Ukrainian literature, passed away in November. Barabash&#x2019;s mother marked her 96th birthday just two days before her daughter&#x2019;s arrest. According to Yurii, Barabash&#x2019;s father &#x201C;raised his daughter to think freely and critically,&#x201D; and the Barabash family &#x201C;has always been proud of our Ukrainian heritage.&quot; Yurii was raised in a home where Ukrainian was spoken freely, instilling in him a deep understanding of his heritage &#x2014; one untouched by Russian imperialist narratives. Her deep connection to her Ukrainian heritage gave her the resolve to speak out against Russian aggression and those who support it, according to her family. Her most recent article, published on Feb. 25 in Republic &#x2014; a media outlet designated a &#x201C;foreign agent&#x201D; by the Kremlin in 2022 &#x2014; criticized Russian theater director Konstantin Bogomolov, who had expressed interest in staging a play glorifying Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s &#x201C;successes.&#x201D; Bogomolov is also the husband of Ksenia Sobchak, a socialite who once cast herself as an opposition figure but has long been seen as a Kremlin insider. In the article, Barabash delivered a scathing takedown of Bogomolov and all those who promote Russian state propaganda, suggesting the play be titled &#x201C;Kyiv in Three Days&#x201D; &#x2014; a nod to the Kremlin&#x2019;s boasts back in 2022 of what they thought would be a swift victory in Ukraine. &#x201C;After all, that&#x2019;s the greatest victory of your new object of admiration,&#x201D; Barabash wrote. As U.S. President Donald Trump speaks in increasingly favorable terms about Russia, it&apos;s important not to forget that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a dictator who has held onto power through brutal crackdowns on dissent. We have to admire those in Russia who are brave enough to stand up to the Kremlin despite knowing the terrible risk, especially those who are openly pro-Ukrainian in the midst of their country&apos;s genocidal war.

Trump considered canceling Zelensky's visit, changed his mind after meeting Macron, TV channel reports	U.S. President Donald Trump considered canceling President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s visit to Washington but reversed the decision after speaking with French President Emmanuel Macron, the French TV network BFMTV reported on Feb. 27, citing a French diplomatic source. Zelensky&apos;s visit to the U.S. is scheduled for Feb. 28. According to the report, Kyiv received a message on Feb. 26 from Washington stating that Zelensky&apos;s visit and meeting with Trump would not take place. &#xA0; This development follows weeks of pressure from Trump&apos;s administration on Ukraine to finalize a minerals deal. Trump publicly attacked Zelensky on Feb. 19, calling him a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; and warning that he must &quot;move fast, or he won&apos;t have a country left.&quot; After Zelensky had talked to Macron, the French president allegedly intervened and convinced Trump to proceed with the meeting, BFMTV reported. Macron visited the U.S. president in Washington on Feb. 24 to discuss Ukraine&apos;s postwar security options in the event of a peace deal with Russia. The U.S. president announced on Feb. 26 that Zelensky would visit Washington on Feb. 28. Zelensky&apos;s visit comes as Kyiv and Washington agreed to establish a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. While Zelensky initially rejected the agreement due to the absence of security guarantees, he later said discussions on guarantees would take place in future negotiations. The finalized deal does not include specific security commitments from the U.S., though the agreement references Washington&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s efforts to obtain such guarantees.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-considered-canceling-zelenskys-washington-visit-changed-mind-after-macron-talks-media-reports/	2025-02-27T10:28:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170591813.jpg
Lawmakers fail to summon ministers for explanation of Ukraine-US minerals deal	Ukrainian lawmakers failed to secure enough votes on Feb. 27 to summon ministers for an explanation of the mineral agreement with the U.S. approved by the Cabinet. On Feb. 26, Ukraine&apos;s Cabinet of Ministers approved the decision to sign the deal. The agreement, which is expected to be signed in Washington on Feb. 28, establishes a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the future monetization of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. The final version of the agreement excludes revenue streams already contributing to Ukraine&apos;s budget and drops an earlier U.S. demand for a $500 billion claim over Ukraine&#x2019;s resources. A proposal to summon Shmyhal and Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko for questioning on the deal fell short, with only 138 lawmakers voting to summon the prime minister and 125 supporting a hearing for Svyrydenko. While media have published the agreement&apos;s text, a separate agreement will outline further details, including the structure of the Investment Fund for Recovery. Zelensky confirmed in his evening address on Feb. 26 that he will meet Trump on Feb. 28 to finalize the deal.	https://kyivindependent.com/lawmakers-fail-to-summon-ministers-for-explanation-of-ukraine-us-minerals-deal/	2025-02-27T09:16:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1643784971.jpg
‘As long as Russia is advancing, the war will continue’— military analyst Rob Lee on what awaits Ukraine in 2025	As Ukraine entered its fourth year of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war, it was geopolitics, not the war itself, that dominated headlines, as Kyiv&#x2019;s relationship with new U.S. President Donald Trump nosedived over a proposed minerals deal. In the meantime though, the battlefield continues to rage on multiple fronts, with daily Russian assaults continuing through a period of consistent sub-zero temperatures across eastern Ukraine. The most intense fighting continues to be in southern Donetsk Oblast, where, although Russian territorial gains have slowed to a halt outside the key city of Pokrovsk, Ukraine&#x2019;s defense of the area around Kurakhove buckled over the first months of 2025. Going forward, many unpredictable factors hang over the next year of the war. Ukraine is trying to solidify its defense with new reforms, Russia faces questions over its ability to sustain its current rate of attacks and losses, while looming largest is the future of U.S. aid. To reflect on the key conclusions of the third year of the full-scale war and what to look out for in the fourth, the Kyiv Independent sat down with the U.S.-based military analyst and senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Rob Lee during a working visit to Kyiv. Rob Lee, the U.S.-based military analyst and Senior Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research on Feb. 22, 2025, in Kyiv, Ukraine. (The Kyiv Independent)The interview has been edited for clarity and length. The Kyiv Independent: How would you describe how 2024 went for Ukraine, and what kind of core issues have really defined it? Rob Lee: 2024 was a year in which Russia had a number of advantages. They had scaled the production of ammunition before this &#x2013; the U.S. and Europe were trying to catch up to that. They had already received significant support from North Korea, from Iran, both in terms of ammunition, equipment, and now obviously troops from North Korea. Ukraine began the year in a position of weakness, where they struggled to replace manpower losses from the summer of 2023 offensive. And we know the U.S. delayed passing the aid package for about six months until April 2024. So last winter was a quite difficult time for Ukraine, where there was a lack of fortifications. We know that Ukraine has improved on that since then. There&apos;s a lack of manpower, still a problem, and there was a key lack of ammunition too. I would say on the positive side, it&apos;s obviously been a very difficult year for Ukraine, but the worst-case scenario did not happen. We didn&apos;t see any kind of significant breakthrough, like an operational breakthrough. We&apos;ve seen incremental attritional assaults. Russia has made advances. It is still a very difficult situation on the front line, but there was a possibility that things would have gotten worse. We came here three times in 2024. If I gave a summary of the findings from those trips, the manpower situation progressively got worse each time. The brigades we were meeting at the front line were more and more on their strength each time we came. The average age of Ukrainian infantry was going up each time, so maybe it was 40 at the beginning of the year. It became 45 later on, and we were hearing in October that brigades had an average age of 50-year-olds as infantry. It was very clear that there was a sense of maybe not exhaustion, but just of being fatigued or tired. Obviously, people have been fighting this war for three years now, a high-intensity conventional war. But look, Ukrainians are still fighting. They&apos;re still putting up a very tough defense. The Kyiv Independent: The Russian advance now seems to have really slowed down, is that, from the Russian side, more resembling to you an operational pause or a greater kind of lack of this same ability to attack with expendable infantry at the same rate? Rob Lee: So on both sides, there&apos;s a general sense of weakness. When we look at the forces, both militaries have significant experience now in combat. Three years of experience. But the experience is not evenly distributed across the force. So UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) units, UAV pilots are extremely capable on both sides now. Artillery crews are very capable because many of these people have three years of experience. The attrition of FPV (first-person view drone) pilots and artillery is lower, and so in many cases you have cohesive units that have operated for years. So they&apos;re very, very capable. But the infantry side has become degraded on both sides. Most of the attrition and casualties is suffered by the infantry. And so in many cases, in an infantry squad, many of the people are going to be new, with probably less than a month of experience in many cases. I think Russia made a choice: Instead of trying to develop well-trained, cohesive units, they&apos;ve kind of accepted this attritional fight where we&apos;re going to get a lot of infantry, we&apos;re going to get a lot of manpower, we&apos;re going to throw them into assaults. We&apos;re not going to train them that much. We&apos;re not going to really focus on that. And, of course, the quality is not that great. On both sides, the average age (of the infantry) is quite high. The Russian side is probably lower than Ukraine, but you&apos;re still getting plenty of people in their 40s, 50s, 60s. You&apos;re getting people who are in debt that need the money. If you sign a contract to join the Russian military, you go into an assault unit, the likelihood of being killed or wounded within a month is quite high. And I think it&apos;s a question about how much the Russians know about that. Do they know how dire the situation is? That&apos;s not clear. But it&apos;s certainly an issue where Ukrainian brigades are very understrength. Russia is still struggling to break through them. And that&apos;s partially because Russia has weaknesses. They just don&apos;t have as much equipment as they did before. They don&apos;t have the artillery advantage they had before. Their infantry is not as capable as it was before. So even if their infantry takes a position, they&apos;re not really trying to achieve a breakthrough. It&apos;s kind of trying to take the next tree line, and they&apos;re content doing that. On the Ukrainian side, despite the issues with infantry, we know they&apos;ve significantly scaled the production of FPVs and UAVs. The Defense Ministry said it was 1.6 million produced last year &#x2013; very impressive numbers. Pilots of the &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot; division prepare drones for a combat flight in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine, on May 16, 2024. (Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)The quality of FPVs has gone up tremendously. The best Ukrainian young engineers are all working on these things. And so the innovation is very fast. You have a number of (drone) regiments that are being formed as separate regiments. And those units are just extremely efficient. They are like industrial-size killing machines at the front line. And they&apos;ve really improved the coordination between UAV units, which was a really significant issue early in the war. And so I think there are two factors. On one hand, Ukraine has improved a number of things in terms of UAV use. And out of necessity, Ukraine has to innovate because they don&apos;t have enough manpower. There is a greater political sensitivity to catalysts in Ukraine than there is in Russia, where it&apos;s obviously very low. And they can&apos;t fight the same way that Russia can fight. So on one hand, it&apos;s this innovation that Ukraine is succeeding in. On the other hand, it&apos;s Russia &#x2013; they have resource advantage, but they&apos;re struggling to really capitalize on it as much as they possibly could. The Kyiv Independent: When we talk with experts and commanders, manpower seems to be the biggest issue. And it almost seems like it can only get worse because Ukraine&apos;s overall manpower is limited. It&apos;s not something that foreign aid can replace. What are the most important steps Ukraine can make? Rob Lee: One of the things that&apos;s been announced is an attempt to increase the number of volunteers from the 18 to 24-year-old age bracket. Someone mentioned this week that they&apos;d received 10,000 applications &#x2013; I don&apos;t know all the facts there, we&apos;ll have to wait and see. In the beginning of the war in 2022, Ukraine obviously had a professional military and then there was a massive influx of volunteers. And those volunteers really sustained the war in 2022. You had very motivated people. You had some of the best, most educated, the highest-ranked people in Ukraine fighting in 2022. And as casualties mounted in 2023 and 2024, it went back to being a kind of mobilized military, in which case you get kind of a mix of results. You get some people who are still motivated to fight, some people who are less motivated to fight. And of course, the military in 2025, it&apos;s a mobilized military. In the infantry in particular, you&apos;re not getting volunteers. I think the last group of volunteers for the infantry were the convicts. There are several issues. One of them is trust. It&apos;s about if you were sent to the military and you were given a certain job, to know that you are not going to be sent into infantry. The Kyiv Independent: But the infantry is where you need the new people in the first place.Rob Lee: Right. In all wars, it&apos;s the infantry that has the highest burden by far, that shows the burden. They don&apos;t rotate that often. We should not underestimate how much of a burden these guys are holding. It&apos;s really tremendous. And there&apos;s no end date. There&apos;s no demobilization system. And so it&apos;s very difficult. The U.S. has been pushing for the mobilization age to be reduced to 18. I don&apos;t know, and I&apos;m not Ukrainian. It&apos;s kind of a political decision, so I don&apos;t want to wade into it. There are Ukrainians who believe that&apos;s the right move to do, but I also know many that don&apos;t think it&apos;s the right move to do, including people who are fighting, who think that the age pool from 30 to 50 is still large enough. There are more people who can mobilize to fight. And if you keep reducing the age pool, then men or boys who are in high school are going to be sent out of the country, so more families are going to be broken apart. You&apos;ll get more people who go AWOL to avoid the war. And of course, a lot of the most educated, best engineers are 18 to 24-year-olds, and you want them to be able to sustain the economy. So it&apos;s not fully clear that that&apos;s the solution. But the problem is that we&apos;re three years into the war, and the manpower pool is not what it was at the beginning of the war. And look, Russia has a lot of men, and they clearly have a lot of men who are willing to sign up for contracts to go into fighting. There&apos;s little political sensitivity.

(Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)We know Vladimir Putin has been resisting another mobilization campaign, but he probably can do it. He could probably do an unlimited campaign. I think he has enough control domestically in Russia, where it probably won&apos;t create such significant political turmoil. So this is still a really big issue for 2025 &#x2013; if Ukraine can at least fix or not let the manpower situation worsen &#x2013; because I think Russia could probably sustain this war this year. The Kyiv Independent: Yes, with mobilization, it&apos;s being done here in a democracy, and it is causing tensions. But when people say it will cause real unrest in Russia, I think people forget about what kind of a state Russia is. Rob Lee: And just one thing to add: In Russia, they can execute soldiers. If soldiers turn around, they will be executed. And so they don&apos;t, so they get pushed forward. And we also see all these videos of Russian soldiers committing suicide &#x2013; just kind of can&apos;t imagine a worse situation than basically serving the Russian military. In Ukraine, that&apos;s not going to happen, right? The Ukrainian commanders are not going to execute soldiers who are unwilling to fight, and so you have to deal with it in different ways. It is a democracy, and there&apos;s greater value for the lives of Ukrainian soldiers than there is for the Russian military. The Kyiv Independent: How realistic is, maybe not completely, but to what scale can infantry be truly replaced by unmanned systems on the ground? Rob Lee: Well, we&apos;re going to see this year. One of the key priorities, I think, for Ukraine&apos;s government this year is to scale up the production of unmanned ground vehicles. There are significantly more companies developing new GVs, offering them, than last year. There are some brigades that are very far forward using new GVs. I was told some things I can&apos;t repeat, so I&apos;ll be careful here, but I do think this year we&apos;re going to see a quite significant expansion in use of new GVs. The main priority is probably going to be logistics. So as we know, the most dangerous situation right now is the rotation of infantry. This is not when they&apos;re in the trenches. Once they&apos;ve built good dugouts, they can hold them pretty well. But it&apos;s rotating between the rear area to the front line, which is quite difficult with vehicles because FPVs present this kind of new threat, which often can fly maybe 10 miles or 10 kilometers past the front line. So if you can replace the use of vehicles for logistics, that can really significantly improve the situation. Some of these new GVs are quite large. They can bring logs and other things to build better fortifications. And for some of the brigades, a majority of supplies are being moved by UGVs right now. There are still limitations. So operating UAVs, UGVs is still very manpower intensive. We&apos;re talking about four-man teams. Usually, it requires a lot of coordination. This is how Ukraine has to innovate and adapt to the situation. Russia has more manpower. Ukraine cannot afford to lose more infantry. That is a key issue. And so UGVs are part of this, just as UAVs were for compensating for lack of artillery ammunition or lack of infantry right now. The Kyiv Independent: We&apos;ve heard about plans to change the Ukrainian military into a corps system. How do you assess that decision and how can it be executed in a situation where the military is so overstretched along the front line? Rob Lee: The idea is the right one. A consistent problem throughout the war is that Ukraine is a brigade-style military, and there isn&apos;t really much of a command and control structure above that. You have operational strategic groups, operational tactical groups, but these commands, they&apos;re not really responsible for the units under their command. Units kind of come in and leave, whereas you want them to have long-term responsibility because then you&apos;re going to be more careful about how you use them, you&apos;re not going to have too many casualties. One of the broader problems in the Ukrainian military the last year and a half, because there&apos;s a manpower problem, is that often brigades will be piecemeal deployed across the front line, where a brigade may have two battalions in one direction, a battalion in another direction. Those battalions are attached to other brigades. That other brigade commander, they&apos;re probably going to use the attached units more aggressively than their own units, just out of a sense of survival. This has created a variety of problems. So the move to a corps structure would be useful, and I think the idea that the brigade commanders &#x2013; I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s official &#x2013; but like Khartiia Brigade, Azov, 3rd Assault, 92nd, some of the really famous units, taking the lead &#x2013; it makes sense. One of the problems last year is that Ukraine set up a number of new brigades, the 150 series. Many of them had a variety of problems, which I won&apos;t go into, but if you put those brigades under the command of another brigade that has a good culture, that does training the right way, that does leadership the right way, you can in some ways ameliorate those problems, and that&apos;s kind of an ideal situation. But as you mentioned, forming the corps right now is quite difficult. So it&apos;s going to be a big question about how it&apos;s executed. The Kyiv Independent: Going back to Russia, it almost seems like in the information space, there are two images of the Russian military. One is that Russia has upscaled its recruiting and its production, and is almost a truly unstoppable military machine. But then other people say that all they can do is human wave attacks and, at the rate of their loss, they&apos;ll lose so many million people to take this much of Ukraine. What is the real picture of the Russian military? Rob Lee: So it&apos;s a mix. There are strengths, and there are really serious weaknesses, too. Russia&apos;s certainly not unstoppable. Russia, since October 2023, they&apos;ve been strategically on the offensive, they&apos;ve had the initiative, they&apos;ve advanced in the Avdiivka direction, but other places: In Toretsk, the fight began sometime in the summer, Chasiv Yar, they got there around April, and they&apos;ve almost taken the city, but it&apos;s taken a very long time, heavy casualties. And they&apos;re still struggling to take back Kursk. A lot of this comes back to what Russia&apos;s political objectives and the military means are. So Vladimir Putin last year laid out that the minimum conditions for negotiations is control of all four oblasts that he says are part of Russia, right? Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson. Russia is a very long way from taking all those oblasts, right? So obviously Luhansk, almost all of it is Russia-controlled, although there&apos;s still very heavy fighting for the last part of it. Donetsk, there&apos;s a lot of fighting to go. Russian forces got to Pokrovsk around August, and they still have not been able to encircle it for a long time at heavy costs, and obviously Ukraine has had some counterattacks the last few weeks, retaking some areas. So not only have they not taken Pokrovsk, but trying to get to Kostiantynivka, Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk, Sloviansk &#x2013; at this rate, it could take quite a long time. And of course, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, this is something far, far removed. Russia&apos;s still very far from achieving its minimum objectives in this war. But they have a significant manpower advantage. They recruited a large number of contract soldiers last year. That means they can sustain this war for this year, at least, in terms of manpower. As it later goes on, this could be a more significant issue. Some capabilities Russia has are much more capable now than they were before. They&apos;ve got FPV units, they have far more ISR (intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition) units, although, obviously, Ukraine has had success countering them. They&apos;ve improved and modernized many of the missiles, such as KH-101s and Iskander-Ms. Their long-range missile strikes, they&apos;ve improved the tactics behind it. They do adapt. We shouldn&apos;t say that they don&apos;t. Russian EW (electronic warfare), depending on who you talk to, is still quite effective. And they have some other supporting capabilities that have gotten effective. And Russian air defenses are not as effective as the air defense systems we&apos;ve seen in this war, but they still do shoot down a lot of missiles. They have shot down plenty of Storm Shadows and ATACMS. Obviously, these UAV attacks Ukraine conducts on Russia, most UAVs get shot down, although still, if a few get through, that&apos;s often enough. The Kyiv Independent: There is a prospect of the U.S. really abandoning Ukraine in terms of military aid, and then there are other more political questions like intelligence and Starlink. How bad could it be for Ukraine if that&apos;s cut off? Rob Lee: The short answer is I don&apos;t know. I think there are different scenarios. One is where the U.S. does not pass an aid package, but they are open to Europe purchasing U.S. weapons or ammunition to form military sales for Ukraine, in which case, that could potentially supplant this, and Europe is still a very rich group, they still have plenty of money, and if they tap into Russian currency reserves, that is another option. At the same time, if the U.S. does not pass an aid package, then the artillery expenditure rate for Ukraine is going to go down. Instead of 2 to 1, if it&apos;s 3 to 1, 4 to 1, what that means in the front line is that more Ukrainian soldiers will die, on a very basic level. It doesn&apos;t necessarily mean it will be decisive, but it will become more difficult for Ukraine to fight. There are other systems that I believe only the U.S. produces, like the interceptors for Patriots, munitions for HIMARS, I&apos;m sure there are a variety of other things, too, like Stingers, Javelins. Some of those things will be really critical. HIMARS fills a very critical role in the Ukrainian military for operational-level fire. There&apos;s nothing else that replaces it. And then Patriot interceptors &#x2013; Patriot is the main anti-ballistic missile defense system for Ukraine. And that is what is protecting Kyiv and all other cities from ballistic missile threats. Ukraine has the ability to shoot down cruise missiles pretty effectively. We know they can shoot down Shaheds and other UAVs very effectively. But ballistic missiles, the options aren&apos;t as great. If you lose this kind of ballistic missile defense, then that could be a key issue. Russia might go after defense industrial factories again or go after the energy grid more successfully. And that could pose significant issues. So it won&apos;t be a complete breakdown, but a loss of U.S. aid could have significant effects. Starlink, obviously, plays a really important role in communications, in integrating the UAV systems. If the U.S. not only stops providing aid but also refuses to allow Europe to buy munitions, that could have a really significant effect, particularly because we know Ukraine already has a manpower problem, and that would compound the issues Ukraine faces.

(Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Russia&apos;s going forward and they are advancing, there&apos;s no real reason for them to be interested in stopping the war, and I think that&apos;s always the key question about a negotiated peace. So if we&apos;re looking first and foremost at the battlefield beyond grand geopolitics, what would it take for Russia to feel at this point that they just can&apos;t go any further forward and they&apos;re happy to take what they have? Rob Lee: For this war to end, it begins with Russia not being able to advance on the battlefield. As I said before, the minimum objectives that Russia has are to take control of all four of those oblasts, which Russia only partially controls right now. Russia, at this rate, is quite far from achieving that. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s likely that Russia would take all of Donetsk Oblast this year, unless there&apos;s a kind of catastrophic breakdown of Ukrainian forces. And again, it comes back to the U.S. aid and other factors. And so for Russia, as long as they&apos;re advancing on the battlefield, and they have not achieved taking all of Donetsk Oblast, I think the war is going to continue. Peace negotiations can go on, but the gap there is too significant, and I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any chance that President Zelensky is going to give up territory that Ukraine currently controls. I just don&apos;t think that is politically palatable, and I don&apos;t think Ukrainians would allow it. So right now, we have a gap between the Russian demands and the Ukrainian version of what they would be willing to accept as the end of the war. The other big factor here is that how the war ends is really critical. There&apos;s a reason why Ukraine keeps asking for security guarantees, because &#x2013; people talk that Ukraine is tired of this war, exhausted, and that&apos;s true &#x2013; but I think my sense is that what Ukraine is really tired of is this persistent threat from Russia. This threat has been going on for quite a long time, the war began 11 years ago, and for Ukraine, it&apos;s important that however the war ends, that it ends and does not begin again. There&apos;s a chance that if the Trump administration offers concessions that are outside of Ukraine, such as about the security architecture of Europe, maybe that will allow Russia to end the war on different terms in Ukraine because that would be a significant victory for Russia. This war is in part about changing the security architecture of Europe. It&apos;s not just about Ukraine. We saw the demands that Russia made back in December 2021 about going back to what the NATO borders looked like in 1997 and so on. I think Russia still wants that, and they&apos;re still talking about that publicly. My view is that this war is going to continue. It will likely continue as of this summer. Maybe we&apos;ll see a ceasefire, but not necessarily a permanent ceasefire because Russia has not achieved even its minimum objectives in the war. It has not been a success for Russia, it&apos;s come at a high cost, and even though Putin has very strong control of Russia, can he sell what he&apos;s achieved so far as a victory to the Russian people? I&apos;m not sure he can because he really hasn&apos;t succeeded, and the costs have been quite significant. So, unfortunately, I think the war is probably going to continue. We&apos;ll see how the U.S. responds because I think negotiations are going to be more difficult than maybe some U.S. officials currently imagine. The way to end this war is to prevent Russia from advancing on the battlefield, to get to a point where Russia can&apos;t have success. But as long as Russia advances on the battlefield, it&apos;s going to continue. And for the U.S., the best ability to affect that is to continue providing greater aid because then that will enable Ukraine to stop Russian advances.	https://kyivindependent.com/despite-negotiations-buzz-russias-war-is-likely-to-continue-says-military-analyst-rob-lee/	2025-02-27T09:14:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199653261.jpg
What the US-Ukraine mineral deal actually means	As Kyiv and Washington celebrate agreeing to jointly develop Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources after weeks of tense negotiations, the deal still has a long way to go before the money starts flowing. Officials, experts, and those close to the deal say the current version of the agreement is an improvement to earlier drafts. But they caution this is just the first step to more negotiations rather than a concrete deal. And with no signatures yet on paper, things could change in the coming days. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s definitely much better compared to what we saw before. I don&#x2019;t see any traps, but we need to reach a final conclusion,&#x201D; Oleksandr Merezhko, an MP, told the Kyiv Independent. After weeks of back and forth, Kyiv and Washington agreed on a deal on Feb. 25. A final draft of the agreement dropped Ukraine&#x2019;s major objections, including a demand for Kyiv to fill a $500 billion reconstruction fund and a 2:1 investment clause for Kyiv to double the aid given by the U.S. The agreement would create a reconstruction fund to be jointly managed by Kyiv and Washington. Ukrainian state-owned enterprises involved in mineral deposits, oil, gas, and hydrocarbons, as well as infrastructure like liquified natural gas terminals and ports, would contribute 50% of their future revenue to the fund. The contributions would then be invested in Ukraine at least annually with the goal of encouraging foreign investment into the country&#x2019;s natural resources. Just the publicity around the fund will bring Ukraine to the attention of average U.S. investors, said Serhii Fursa, deputy managing director at investment firm Dragon Capital. The current draft of the agreement reads more like a memorandum of understanding than an international treaty, said Merezhko, meaning it is neither politically binding nor requires ratification by Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament. A second &#x201C;Fund Agreement&#x201D; mentioned in the draft deal that is set to be negotiated next will require parliamentary approval. At this point, the agreement is &#x201C;mainly symbolic&#x201D; to show that Kyiv and Washington remain committed to &#x201C;achieving common goals,&#x201D; said Edward Chow, a non-resident senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But without the most basic elements and clarity on how the fund will work, there is a risk that &#x201C;it sets up expectations that may be dashed,&#x201D; he added. President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump could sign the agreement in Washington on Feb. 28. While the deal doesn&#x2019;t contain the security guarantees Kyiv was hoping for, the very presence of American assets in Ukraine is seen as a way to potentially encourage the U.S. to invest in Ukraine&#x2019;s defense. &#x201C;Americans tend to defend more those countries where they have investments, where they have economic interests,&#x201D; said Merezhko. &#x201C;The more American and European companies we have in Ukraine, the better for our economy and our security.&#x201D; American involvement in state-owned enterprises, of which there are over 3,000 in Ukraine, could lead to better governance, said Andy Hunder, head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine. A terrikon rises near a coal mine in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on Feb. 22, 2025. (Pierre Crom/Getty Images)&#x201C;If you have the right management, you could see many of these state-owned enterprises showing good results,&#x201D; he told the Kyiv Independent. The current agreement says that the revenues will not come from state enterprises that are &#x201C;already part of the general budget revenues,&#x201D; meaning big taxpayers like oil and gas giant Naftogaz are excluded. The agreement also notes that the U.S. and Ukraine want to ensure that adversarial countries &#x201C;do not benefit from the reconstruction&#x201D; process after a peace agreement. With the White House not wanting Ukraine to fall into the orbit of its economic rival, Beijing, Merezhko believes the clause could be a &#x201C;hint at China.&#x201D;The U.S. is trying to peel Russia away from China&#x2019;s grip, with State Secretary Marco Rubio saying Moscow can&#x2019;t become Beiijing&#x2019;s &#x201C;junior partner,&#x201D; in an interview with media outlet Breitbart. During a press briefing on Jan. 26, Zelensky stressed the importance of the fund being &#xA0;Ukrainian-American rather than not simply controlled by the U.S., as in the previous proposal. He added that the absence of debt and the removal of the 2:1 investment clause were &#x201C;particularly important.&#x201D; The Ukrainian government will no longer have to pay two dollars for every dollar given by the White House under the current agreement. &#x201C;The most risky factors are off the table,&#x201D; Fursa told the Kyiv Independent. In his opinion, the current deal is on &#x201C;much more acceptable terms&#x201D; as it removes the demand Ukraine pay back U.S. aid provided to Kyiv. If the reconstruction fund is done right, it could help funnel much-needed capital into Ukraine and open the country up to U.S. investors. The issue now is what exactly will be agreed upon once the two sides get into the weeds of it. The current agreement does not explain how the fund will be managed as this will be established in the subsequent fund agreement. &#x201C;We all pretty much have an understanding of what we want the fund to do. We want this to generate cash to fill the American and Ukrainian state coffers,&#x201D; Hunder said. Yet questions remain about under what jurisdiction the fund will be registered, its size, and its timeframe as there&#x2019;s no set end date. Moreover, Ukraine&#x2019;s tax laws need to be changed to redirect the cash flow from the state budget to the fund. The fund itself may not actually come to fruition, said Fursa. He doesn&#x2019;t see enough revenue from Ukraine to make it work while the U.S. government hasn&#x2019;t agreed to invest into it either.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)Trump likely imagines private American companies will come into Ukraine and get first pick on investment projects. Ukraine initially offered up its critical mineral deposits to Trump, promising to have trillions of dollars worth of raw materials buried in its subsoil. Ukraine&#x2019;s underinvested mining sector was hopeful that a deal could bring American capital, technology, and innovation. With the current agreement encompassing all natural resources, including the more lucrative oil and gas sectors, critical minerals have become less relevant. The agreement&#x2019;s lack of secure investment guarantees into mineral mining concerns George Popov, a research analyst at the National Association of Extractive Industry of Ukraine. &#x201C;As an extractive industries association, we would like to see real guarantees of development in the mineral sector in Ukraine. Like exporting resources, developing infrastructure, or even geological investigations here made by the United States,&#x201D; he said. Focusing on new deposits rather than the current mines would be a positive step, as would privatizing some of the mining companies, said Volodymyr Landa, a senior economist at the Kyiv-based Center for Economic Strategy. &#x201C;A lot of resources that are economically feasible to mine are already mined. There are probably some cases in which we are mining some unfeasible resources,&#x201D; he said.

Turkey considers sending peacekeepers to Ukraine, Bloomberg reports	Turkey has indicated its openness to deploying troops in Ukraine as part of a potential peacekeeping force, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 27, citing sources familiar with the matter. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan discussed the possibility with President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov during separate meetings in Ankara earlier in February, according to Bloomberg. Moscow has publicly opposed NATO troops in Ukraine, but Russia has not given Turkey a concrete response on the proposal, Bloomberg reported. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 20 that Russia was concerned about NATO countries discussing a potential deployment of peacekeepers. Sources told Bloomberg that Turkey would not participate unless it is directly involved in all consultations and preparations for such a mission. The idea of a multinational peacekeeping force has been floated as a potential security guarantee for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. While Washington has supported the concept, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Feb. 12 that such a mission would not include U.S. troops and should be led by European and non-European allies. France, the U.K., and several other countries have expressed support for a peacekeeping force, but European nations have yet to reach a consensus.	https://kyivindependent.com/turkey-considers-sending-troops-to-ukraine-as-part-of-peacekeeping-force-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-27T08:20:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-18-at-4.45.24-PM.png
Russia seized boats, harassed volunteers, concealed gravesites ― Kakhovka Dam explosion investigation	Russian-controlled forces in Kherson Oblast have deliberately made it harder for civilians to evacuate the flood zone following the Russian destruction of the Kakhovka Dam in June 2023. According to an investigation by the Kyiv Independent, the Russian military interfered with the work of locals who were evacuating people from the flooded areas on their own &#x2014; their boats were confiscated, while the volunteers were threatened and forced to stop the efforts. In turn, the local rescue services, working under occupation, did not have enough resources for the evacuation, while the occupation authorities deliberately concealed the magnitude of the disaster. As a result of these actions, civilians on the occupied east bank of Kherson Oblast that could have been rescued have died. The Kyiv Independent&apos;s War Crimes Investigation Unit recorded fifty testimonies from eyewitnesses, relatives of eyewitnesses, and volunteers who stayed in the occupied territories during the flooding following the Kakhovka Dam explosion and were involved in rescuing people. The testimonies laid the basis for the Kyiv Independent&apos;s investigative documentary, When the Water Screams, which premiered on Feb. 27. Following the explosion, the water from the Kakhovka Reservoir began to flood settlements located downstream. On the Ukrainian-controlled part of Kherson Oblast, an immediate evacuation took place, including from the regional capital of Kherson, which saw several neighborhoods being flooded. The Russian-occupied eastern bank of the Dnipro River, however, had been hit the hardest. The witnesses told the Kyiv Independent that they didn&apos;t hear announcements about an evacuation. Boats carrying rescuers from the Russian-controlled emergency services did not appear until several days after the explosion. The evacuation of civilians fell on the shoulders of the locals, who organized and coordinated the rescue themselves, in particular, via a Telegram chat. Yet, Russian soldiers did not allow volunteers to enter all the flooded areas, and confiscated their boats under threat of punishment. The Kyiv Independent identified a man from the east bank involved in the rescue operation, who went missing. Volodymyr Saldo, the Russian-installed head of the occupied part of Kherson Oblast, put Andrey Alekseenko, the so-called head of the government of the occupied eastern bank, in charge of the emergency response. Alekseenko is the former mayor of Krasnodar, a Russian city. At the time of the explosion, the local rescue service was headed by Ivan Pavlienko &#x2014; a Russian Major General. Pavlienko, who had vast experience in dealing with emergency situations in Russia, was in charge of the utility services set to deal with the flooding. However, the resources Russia allocated to combat the disaster were inadequate. In Russia&apos;s Ivanovo Oblast, which is almost the same size as the occupied part of Ukraine&apos;s Kherson Oblast, there were eight times more personnel and 18 times more &quot;special equipment.&quot; A year after the Kakhovka Dam explosion, Russian-controlled official Saldo reported that over 60 people died due to the flooding. According to eyewitnesses and volunteers involved in the evacuation, hundreds of people may have died on the occupied eastern bank of Kherson Oblast, and the authorities attempted to conceal the extent of civilian casualties. When the waters rose, doctors at the Oleshky Polyclinic managed to issue six death certificates, after which they were forbidden from issuing such documents. The bodies of the dead were then taken away. The Kyiv Independent recorded five cases in which the relatives of the victims were not informed about the fate of their deceased, and their burial place remains unknown.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-seized-boats-harassed-volunteers-concealed-gravesites-kakhovka-dam-explosion-investigation/	2025-02-27T07:29:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Desktop--1-.png
As ‘negotiations’ weigh Ukraine’s land, the lives lost under Russian occupation are forgotten	For Viktoriia Hrinienkova, life came to a standstill in June 2023. Three of her family members &#x2014; her mother, father, and grandmother &#x2014; died in their own home in Hola Prystan, a Ukrainian town in the Russian-occupied part of Kherson Oblast. They were killed in the aftermath of Russia&#x2019;s destruction of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant&#x2019;s dam. The Russian forces controlling the plant blew up its engine room from the inside on June 6, 2023. The dam&#x2019;s destruction caused severe flooding across dozens of communities in Kherson Oblast. The occupied east bank suffered the most damage, as it was at a lower elevation. Thousands of people still lived there. Viktoriia learned of the explosion from thousands of kilometers away. She and her family had left the occupied territory a few months after the full-scale invasion, but her parents and grandmother refused to leave. Her father had both legs amputated, and her grandmother was nearly blind. They feared they wouldn&#x2019;t be able to handle the move to another country and adjust to an unfamiliar place. From the day of the explosion onward, Viktoriia clung to her phone, desperate for any updates. She stayed in contact with her mother while frantically searching for someone who could rescue her family. She could hear the water rising inside her parents&#x2019; house &#x2014; but she could do nothing. Rescue services in the occupied territory ignored her pleas for help. &#x201C;My mom called and said, &#x2018;The water has entered the house. It&#x2019;s up to our knees. Now we&#x2019;re sitting on the table. Now we&#x2019;re on chairs on top of the table. The water is up to our waists. We&#x2019;re up to our necks in water,&#x2019;&#x201D; Viktoriia told me. The day after the dam&#x2019;s destruction Viktoriia learned that a boat carrying local residents had reached her family&#x2019;s house. They heard her family shouting for help. But they couldn&#x2019;t take them &#x2014; the boat was already full. After that, Viktoriia&#x2019;s mother stopped answering her phone. Presumably, it was that day they died. I met Viktoriia in her new home in the Czech Republic almost a year and a half after the tragedy. We spoke for nearly an entire day. It was clear how deeply her loss had affected her &#x2014; how raw the wound still was and how unbearable it was for her to accept that her family had died in such a cruel way. Among its many methods of warfare, Russia chooses the most ruthless. As it captures Ukrainian cities and villages, it shows no regard for civilians. Human rights investigators who examined the dam explosion found the same patterns of violations and crimes that the Russian military committed in Mariupol, Bucha, and other occupied cities. People were denied safe evacuation, subjected to filtration procedures, and left without access to drinking water and food. My conversations with witnesses as part of the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s War Crimes Investigation Unit&#x2019;s new documentary confirm this. Over six months of investigation, I spoke with 50 eyewitnesses, relatives of victims, and volunteers who rescued people from the east bank of Kherson Oblast. One question haunted me &#x2014; if Russia planned and carried out the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, why did it do nothing to evacuate civilians from the flooded areas? Under international humanitarian law, the occupying authorities are responsible for ensuring the safety of people under their control. Yet in the first days after the dam&#x2019;s destruction, local occupation officials denied the scale of the disaster, claiming there was no need for evacuations. Witnesses told me they saw Russian emergency services only days after the explosion &#x2014; by then, the water had already peaked. And when locals took it upon themselves to rescue neighbors from rooftops, they faced obstacles. Russian soldiers seized their boats, chased them down, and threatened them. Some families still don&#x2019;t know where their loved ones are buried. There is evidence suggesting that occupation officials deliberately concealed the true death toll. They reportedly forbade local doctors from issuing death certificates, took control of documentation for the deceased, and transported bodies to unknown locations. It is possible that many of the drowned were buried in mass graves. Viktoriia showed me a photo of her parents on her phone &#x2014; a beautiful mother standing among roses, a smiling father, and a grandmother in the backyard of their home. The next photos were of their graves. They are buried in a cemetery in a town 90 kilometers from their home. A relative of Viktoriia&#x2019;s found and identified their bodies there. Viktoriia hopes to one day return to Kherson Oblast to rebury her family. I was conducting my final interviews for this investigation as the U.S. election campaign was heating up and the first reports surfaced about possible negotiations with Russia &#x2014; about the idea of surrendering occupied territories in exchange for peace. The publication of this article comes at one of the most uncertain moments for Ukraine and the world. The aggressor is being given a human face, and justice is slipping further and further away. These days, I can&#x2019;t stop thinking about Viktoriia and her family. Will she ever be able to visit her parents&#x2019; graves? Will those responsible for their brutal deaths ever be held accountable? Peace will not come until evil is punished.

Zelensky meets Irish prime minister ahead of Washington visit	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin on Feb. 27 at Shannon International Airport in County Clare, Ireland. Zelensky&apos;s visit to Ireland comes before his planned talks with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Feb. 28, where he is expected to sign a minerals agreement with the U.S. The president thanked Ireland for its support of Ukrainians who fled Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The country has taken in nearly 100,000 Ukrainian refugees since 2022. &#x2066;@MichealMartinTD&#x2069; meets Pres Zelensky &#x2066;@ShannonAirport&#x2069; he&#x2019;s very happy to land &amp; meet Taoiseach &amp; thank him for his support &amp; Irelands support for Ukrainian citizens here &#x2066;@rtenews&#x2069; pic.twitter.com/ITFDG1x7Lt Speaking after the meeting, Martin said Zelensky was &quot;very thankful to the people of Ireland for our sustained support for the people of Ukraine.&quot; &quot;We discussed how, together with the EU, we can advance a just, sustainable, and durable peace in Ukraine,&quot; Martin added. While Ireland maintains a policy of military neutrality and is not a NATO member, Dublin has provided over 380 million euros ($420 million) in humanitarian, economic, and non-lethal defense support to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-irish-pm-martin-in-shannon-ahead-of-washington-trip/	2025-02-27T07:07:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GkzUJGDWwAAeChO.jpeg
Russian troops 'bogged down' near Pokrovsk, Ukrainian military claims	Russian troops have been bogged down near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, Viktor Trehubov, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on Feb. 27. The embattled town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast is among the most hotly contested areas of the front. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi previously claimed that 7,000 Russian soldiers were killed near Pokrovsk in January alone. Ukrainian forces repelled 33 Russian attacks in the Pokrovsk sector over the past day, the General Staff said in its latest update. According to Trehubov, Russia&apos;s offensive from the south and an attempt to bypass Pokrovsk from the west failed. The spokesperson claimed that Russian forces deployed in the area are becoming exhausted. &quot;I am not saying that Ukrainian forces caught some second, third, or 100th and 500th breath... But Russian troops have indeed begun to show some physical, moral, and material exhaustion,&quot; Trehubov said. The spokesperson attributed the situation&apos;s improvement mainly to Ukrainian drone units, which established &quot;effective defense&quot; and cooperated with the infantry. He said that after the start of U.S.-Russian negotiations, Russian soldiers&apos; motivation to fight decreased in the sector where the Khortytsia group of forces operates. A day before, the 25th Separate Airborne Brigade reported that Ukrainian troops had regained control of the village of Kotlyne, near Pokrovsk. Kotlyne and Pokrovsk are connected by the T 0406 highway, which also leads to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-bogged-down-near-pokrovsk-ukrainian-military-claims/	2025-02-27T06:04:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184404872.jpg
First contacts with Trump administration 'inspire certain hopes,' Putin says	Moscow and Washington are ready to re-establish cooperation, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Feb. 27 during a meeting of the Federal Security Service&apos;s (FSB) board, praising the Trump administration for its &quot;pragmatism.&quot; In recent days, the Trump administration has upended years of U.S. foreign policy towards Russia and Ukraine. U.S. and Russian officials resumed high-level bilateral contacts, holding meetings in Riyadh on Feb. 18 and Istanbul on Feb. 27. Speaking as the Russian delegates were concluding their talks in Turkey, Putin described the first contacts between Russia and the U.S. as &quot;inspiring certain hopes.&quot; He also claimed that some Western countries are dissatisfied with the restoration of Russian-American relations and want to &quot;create instability in the world.&quot; &quot;These forces will try to disrupt or compromise the dialogue that has begun,&quot; Putin said, without providing any evidence. &quot;We need to take it into account and use all the means of diplomacy and intelligence services to disrupt such attempts.&quot; Ukraine has been excluded from the talks in Saudi Arabia, sparking concerns that the Trump administration seeks to sideline Kyiv. The subsequent talks in Istanbul were allegedly focused on embassy operations and did not concern the Russia-Ukraine war. During the talks in Riyadh, Moscow allegedly demanded that the U.S. withdraw NATO forces from eastern Europe as a condition for &quot;normalizing relations,&quot; the Financial Times reported, citing two officials in the region. The U.S. delegation reportedly rejected the demand, but concerns remain over what concessions President Donald Trump might consider to secure a deal with Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that he wants European allies to be involved in peace negotiations. Kyiv insists that no talks about Ukraine and ending Russia&apos;s war should be held without Ukraine. Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, said that Europe will not be directly involved in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, but its interests will be considered.	https://kyivindependent.com/first-contacts-with-trump-administration-inspire-certain-hopes-putin-says/	2025-02-27T05:43:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200258270.jpg
France has led talks on Ukraine's minerals since October 2024, French minister says	France and Ukraine have been discussing the use of Ukrainian minerals for the purposes of the French defense industry since October 2024, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said, as France Info reported on Feb. 27. The comments come as the U.S. and Kyiv reached an initial agreement on a deal on the use of Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including rare earth minerals, oil, and gas. President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to visit Washington on Feb. 28 to discuss the deal and a possible inclusion of security guarantees. Speaking on the 8h30 franceinfo program, Lecornu said that the French leadership has been considering the issue since last fall when Zelensky presented international partnerships on Ukrainian natural resources in his victory plan. &quot;Volodymyr Zelensky and his team saw that this issue of raw materials could be one of the transactional elements with us, to create endurance,&quot; Lecornu said. &quot;So, President Trump did not invent it because it was the Ukrainians themselves who did.&quot; French President Emmanuel Macron instructed Lecornu to enter into bilateral talks with Ukraine on the issue last October to diversify the supply of rare earth minerals for the French defense industry, the minister said. &quot;Our defense industry will need a certain number of key raw materials in our own weapons systems, not for next year, but for the next 30 or 40 years,&quot; Lecornu added. The U.S.-Ukraine deal, finalized on Feb. 25, follows weeks of negotiations that strained relations between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. Washington initially proposed three versions, with Kyiv rejecting the first two over the absence of security guarantees. The latest version of the agreement, which the Kyiv Independent obtained, aims to create a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. While it does not contain concrete security guarantees, the agreement states that the U.S. government &quot;supports Ukraine&apos;s efforts to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace.&quot; The AFP news agency reported earlier this week that the EU had proposed its own version of a deal on minerals that is &quot;mutually beneficial.&quot; Soon after, the European Commission denied any such proposal.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-has-led-talks-with-ukraine-on-minerals-since-october-2024-minister-says/	2025-02-27T05:14:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1695287073.jpg
Russia claims to recapture village north of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast	Russian troops recaptured the village of Nikolsky in embattled Kursk Oblast, some 42 kilometers (26 miles) north of the Ukrainian-occupied town of Sudzha, Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Feb. 27. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, senior Russian General Staff officer Sergei Rudsky said earlier in February. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claims that its troops continue to advance and push Ukrainian forces out of the salient. Kyiv has not commented on purportedly lost settlements in Kursk Oblast. According to Rudsky, Ukrainian soldiers control about 500 square kilometers (193 square miles) out of 1,268 square kilometers (490 square miles) initially seized by Kyiv. Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000 in Kursk Oblast, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 6. Another 909 have been reportedly taken as prisoners of war. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Ukraine likely seeks to use its foothold in Kursk Oblast as leverage in potential peace talks. Russia&apos;s forces in Kursk Oblast have been bolstered by North Korean troops, deployed last fall to help counter the Ukrainian incursion. President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that the offensive disrupted Russia&apos;s ability to carry out large-scale operations in northeastern and southern Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-to-recapture-village-north-of-sudzha-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-02-27T04:42:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2166312567.jpg
Revolut operating illegally in Ukraine without required license, National Bank says	London-based digital bank Revolut has not obtained the required license to conduct banking activities in Ukraine, &#xA0;the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) said in a press release on Feb. 27. According to Ukrainian banking law, a foreign bank can only operate in Ukraine if it opens a local branch or obtains a banking license. This process must first be approved by the NBU, the bank said in the press release. Revolut officially launched its services in Ukraine on Feb. 11, offering Ukrainian residents access to features like instant, free transfers between app users by setting up a European Revolut account. Revolut said its services for Ukrainian residents were provided by Revolut Bank UAB, a Lithuania-based bank supervised by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Lithuania. The NBU argues that while this license allows Revolut to operate in EU countries, the fintech company has not applied for a license to operate in Ukraine as required by law. &quot;We support open competition and financial technology development, but all market players must follow legal and regulatory requirements,&quot; the NBU wrote. The Ukrainian regulator also warned that Revolut customers in Ukraine will not be protected by local laws on financial consumer rights or deposit guarantees. Revolut is a British multinational neobank and fintech company, co-founded by Ukrainian tech entrepreneur Vlad Yatsenko and Russian-born Nikolai Storonsky, who renounced his Russian citizenship after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The company has also stopped all operations in Russia and Belarus.	https://kyivindependent.com/revolut-operating-illegally-in-ukraine-without-required-license-national-bank-says/	2025-02-27T04:31:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-11-at-6_14_44-PM.png
Russia to lose 'chance for world leadership' if it doesn't get out of war by 2026, Budanov says	Russia may lose its chance for world leadership if it does not halt its full-scale war against Ukraine by 2026, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) head Kyrylo Budanov said in an interview with Ukrinform published on Feb. 27. Earlier this month, Budanov said he believes that Ukraine and Russia will reach a ceasefire this year. His comments come as U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed to mediate a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia while using increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Kyiv. Asked whether the Kremlin wants to make a peace deal now to build up its strength, Budanov agreed, saying that Russia needs a break. &quot;According to their (Russia&apos;s) strategy, if they don&apos;t get out of this war by 2026, they lose even a chance for world leadership. They will be left with a maximum level of regional leadership, which they are absolutely not satisfied with,&quot; the spy chief said. According to Budanov, the financial cost of the war is &quot;too high&quot; for Moscow, which prevents it from focusing on development and large-scale projects. Russia has problems with its economy, but it will be able to &quot;balance&quot; it out as long as it has oil, gas, and precious metals, he added. &quot;There is a lack of technologies, technological solutions that are not available in Russia, primarily for the development of the Arctic region, gas production, etc.,&quot; Budanov said. Throughout the three years of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine&apos;s Western partners imposed heavy sanctions on Moscow to undermine its ability to wage war. Initially, Russia has largely weathered the sanctions, circumventing economic restrictions through third-party countries and various loopholes. The situation appears to be shifting as Russia has faced mounting economic challenges over the past months, compounded by labor shortages and military spending-induced inflation that led to record interest rates. In the fall of 2023, Budanov said that Russia likely has the economic and technical capacity to continue its war against Ukraine until 2025 or 2026. In office since 2020, Budanov has at times made radical predictions about the full-scale war that have not always come true.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-to-lose-chance-for-world-leadership-if-it-doesnt-get-out-of-war-by-2026-budanov-says/	2025-02-27T04:24:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201657947.jpg
US-Russia talks in Istanbul meant to 'strengthen trust,' first of many, Moscow says	Russia hopes the meeting with U.S. officials in Istanbul will &quot;strengthen the trust&quot; between the two countries, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Feb. 27. &quot;We expect that today&apos;s meeting will be first in the series of similar expert consultations that will move us closer, together with the U.S., in overcoming disagreements and strengthening trust,&quot; spokesperson Maria Zakharova said during a press briefing. U.S. and Russian delegations began their meeting in Istanbul earlier on Feb. 27, following up on the initial round of talks in Riyadh on Feb. 18. The meetings come amid U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s efforts to broker a swift peace deal with Russia, speaking concerns that Washington&apos;s partners in Kyiv and Europe are being sidelined in the process. The second meeting will not include discussions on Ukraine, a U.S. State Department spokesperson told the media. According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the deliberations will focus on embassy operations. The discussions would concern &quot;systemic problems that have accumulated as a result of the illegal activities of the previous U.S. administration to create artificial obstacles to the activities of the Russian Embassy,&quot; leading Moscow to &quot;respond in kind,&quot; Lavrov said. The Biden administration has cut most official contacts with Russia after the outbreak of the full-scale war in an attempt to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin on the global stage.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-russian-talks-in-istanbul-meant-to-strengthen-trust-moscow-says/	2025-02-27T04:07:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1237721878.jpg
US 'backstop' necessary for peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, Starmer says ahead of Trump meeting	U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Feb. 26 that a U.S. &quot;backstop&quot; for a potential Europeacekeeper contingent in Ukraine would be necessary to ensure a just and lasting peace, Reuters reported. Starmer is heading to Washington to meet U.S. President Donald Trump and convince him to continue playing a role in Ukraine&apos;s security amid Russian aggression. Recent weeks saw major geopolitical shifts as the Trump administration has adopted more antagonistic rhetoric toward Ukraine and other partners while intensifying diplomatic outreach to Russia in an effort to broker a swift agreement. The U.S. president has avoided making any security commitments to Kyiv and made clear he expects Europe to take up responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s defense. &quot;I&apos;m absolutely convinced that we need a lasting peace, not a ceasefire, and for that to happen, we need security guarantees,&quot; Starmer told journalists during his trip to Washington. The Telegraph previously reported that Starmer aims to present Trump with a plan to deploy up to 30,000 European peacekeepers in Ukraine to monitor a ceasefire. While Trump has backed the idea of a European peacekeeping force, there is no consensus among European partners, and Moscow has rejected it outright. The British prime minister reiterated that the U.K. is ready to take part in the mission but added that a U.S. &quot;backstop&quot; would be essential for such a plan, without elaborating on what concrete measures he expects from Washington. Starmer&apos;s visit follows that of French President Emmanuel Macron, who also sought to convince Trump to remain engaged in Ukraine. Macron has reportedly failed to receive any clear commitments about a U.S. backstop, with an undisclosed EU official describing the trip as a &quot;waste of time&quot; in comments for Politico.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-backstop-necessary-for-lasting-peace-in-ukraine-starmer-says-ahead-of-meeting-trump/	2025-02-27T03:36:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2159996904.jpg
Zelensky invited to special EU summit on defense, Ukraine next week	President Volodymyr Zelensky has been invited to a special EU summit on March 6 that will be dedicated to &quot;European defense and Ukraine,&quot; European Council President Antonio Costa said in an open letter dated Feb. 26. The agenda for the meeting aims to make &quot;first decisions for the short-term&quot; that will enable Europe &quot;to become more sovereign, more capable and better equipped,&quot; Costa said. The official added that a &quot;major aim&quot; of the summit is to prepare EU countries for &quot;the possible European contribution to the security guarantees that will be necessary to ensure a lasting peace in Ukraine.&quot; The summit comes amid major shifts in U.S.-European relations, with U.S. President Donald Trump sending clear signals that the U.S. expects the continent to take a larger role in the defense of Ukraine against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The recent mineral deal negotiated between the U.S. and Ukraine does not contain specific security guarantees, with Zelensky on Feb. 26 saying they will be discussed in future negotiations. &quot;The EU and its member states are ready to take more responsibility for Europe&apos;s security,&quot; Costa said. &quot;I have invited President Zelensky to come to Brussels on the occasion of the meeting of the European Council to discuss with us the latest developments.&quot; Zelensky will visit Washington on Feb. 28 to sign a minerals agreement, Trump said on Feb. 26. He is also scheduled to visit the European Security Summit in the U.K. on March 2.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-invited-to-special-eu-summit-on-ukraine-next-week/	2025-02-27T03:04:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201484066.jpg
MH17 victims' relatives want Russian admission of responsibility for crash to be part of peace deal, media reports	Relatives of the MH17 crash victims insist that Russia&apos;s recognition of responsibility for the downing of the plane should be part of a possible peace deal on ending Moscow&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine, European Pravda reported on Feb. 26, citing obtained copies of letters. The letters were sent to U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen earlier this month, according to the media outlet. Flight MH17 departed from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport en-route to Kuala Lumpur International Airport on July 17, 2014. Three hours into the flight, the Boeing-777 was shot down by Russian proxy forces using a Buk surface-to-air missile above Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk Oblast. All 283 passengers and 15 crew members on board, among them 196 Dutch citizens, were killed. Russia never claimed responsibility for the disaster, instead fanning conspiracy theories to shift the blame elsewhere. The District Court of The Hague in November 2022 sentenced in absentia two Russian nationals and one Ukrainian national to life imprisonment for their involvement in the downing of flight MH17. A fourth defendant, also a Russian national, was acquitted on the grounds of insufficient evidence connecting him to the crime. Relatives of the victims have long urged Russia to admit its responsibility and investigate all those involved and the causes of the downing. Now, they want their demands to be included in any potential peace pact. According to the relatives, a credible agreement is difficult without Russia recognizing its responsibility for the downing. &quot;Without this (Russia&apos;s recognition of the downing of MH17), there can be no lasting peace with Russia,&quot; the letter read. Copies of the letters were also reportedly sent to Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof and the EU&apos;s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas.	https://kyivindependent.com/mh17-victims-relatives-demand-russian-admission-of-responsibility-for-crash-to-be-part-of-peace-deal/	2025-02-27T03:00:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1233114049.jpg
EU in talks on mobilizing 'hundreds of billions' for defense after Trump's foreign policy shift, Bloomberg reports	EU officials are discussing ways to mobilize hundreds of billions of euros for defense spending amid the U.S.&apos;s foreign policy shift away from Europe, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 27, citing undisclosed officials. U.S. Donald Trump has said he expects Europe to take responsibility for its own security, leading some to doubt his commitment to NATO and mutual defense. This led to calls for a rapid increase in defense spending across the continent as Russia continues to wage its full-scale war against Ukraine, the largest conflict in Europe since World War II. The EU faces major challenges in this effort, namely an undersized defense industry and empty stocks after delivering billions in arms and ammunition to Ukraine, Bloomberg reported. To address the issue, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proposed a three-step plan to ramp up defense spending, officials told the outlet. This reportedly includes allowing member states to spend more by loosening fiscal rules &#x2013; potentially freeing up at least 160 billion euros ($168 billion) &#x2013; creating a joint EU instrument for defense investment, and loosening investment constraints on the European Investment Bank. Separately, von der Leyen also reportedly proposed redirecting the largely unused 392-billion-euro ($410 billion) Covid recovery fund to finance defense projects, Bloomberg wrote. EU officials are expected to discuss joint security during an emergency meeting on March 6, with the new defense industrial strategy to be unveiled on March 16. Individual European countries are also taking steps to boost defense spending. Germany&apos;s incoming leaders are reportedly in talks on a special defense spending fund of 200 billion euros ($210 billion). Outside the EU, the U.K. has committed to raising defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by April 2027.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-in-talks-for-freeing-up-massive-defense-spending-after-trumps-shift-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-27T02:50:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1997776047.jpg
Culture Ministry to suspend issuing permits for journalists, artists to travel abroad	The Culture Ministry will temporarily halt issuing permits for draft-age male journalists and culture professionals to travel abroad pending a legislative review, the ministry said on Feb. 26. The measure, which will take effect on March 3, comes in response to cases in which men used their permits to stay abroad longer than permitted. Men aged 18-60 are not permitted to travel abroad under martial law, instituted at the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, without special permission. Journalists and culture workers were allowed to travel abroad temporarily for professional purposes, provided they had the necessary documentation and permits. Multiple abuses of this rule were reported throughout the full-scale war, with men staying abroad beyond the permitted period or indefinitely. In response, the Culture Ministry submitted a draft amendment to regulate the requirements for granting permits. The suspension will be in place until the &quot;legal settlement of this issue,&quot; the ministry said. Manpower shortage has been described as a key challenge for the Ukrainian Armed Forces as the full-scale war with Russia entered its fourth year. Thousands of draft-age men have crossed or sought to cross the border illegally to avoid mobilization, deepening the crisis.	https://kyivindependent.com/culture-ministry-to-suspend-issuing-permits-to-journalists-artists-for-travel-abroad/	2025-02-27T02:01:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2190384600.jpg
US, Russia reportedly discuss Arctic cooperation as Trump seeks to pull Moscow from Beijing	American and Russian officials have identified the Arctic as a possible area of economic cooperation, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 26, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. U.S. President Donald Trump said that Washington and Moscow are discussing economic agreements, with his administration adopting a more amicable stance toward Russia than his predecessor, Joe Biden. Moscow is offering the Trump administration a deal on Russian natural resources and access to the Arctic, said Kirill Dmitriev, one of the Russian delegates in recent U.S.-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia. The news comes as U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the Trump administration is seeking to disengage Russia from China. China has remained a key ally of Russia throughout the full-scale invasion, deepening economic ties and becoming Moscow&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods &#x2014; equipment the Russian military uses in its war against Ukraine. In an interview with Breitbart News published on Feb. 26, Rubio said he did not know if it would ever be possible to completely peel Moscow off of relations with Beijing. &quot;I also don&#x2019;t think having China and Russia at each other&#x2019;s neck is good for global stability because they&#x2019;re both nuclear powers,&quot; he added. &quot;But I do think we&#x2019;re in a situation now where the Russians have become increasingly dependent on the Chinese and that&#x2019;s not a good outcome either if you think about it.&quot; Rubio fears that further rapprochement between China and Russia will become a problem for Washington if Moscow turns into Beijing&apos;s &quot;junior partner.&quot; &quot;We could find ourselves in a situation where whether Russia wants to improve its relations with the U.S. or not, they can&#x2019;t because they&#x2019;ve become completely dependent on the Chinese because we have cut them off,&quot; Rubio said. The U.S. secretary of state described the U.S.-China ties as &quot;the big story of the 21st century.&quot; According to him, Washington will have disagreements with Russia and China, but it is important to maintain relations with both. In recent days, the Trump administration has upended years of U.S. foreign policy towards Russia and Ukraine. American and Russian delegations are holding the second round of talks in Istanbul on Feb. 27. The first meeting between the two nations took place in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. No concrete decisions on peace negotiations were announced following the talks in Saudi Arabia, but Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the meeting sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe. In early February, Trump imposed a 10% tariff on goods from China. Referring to the war in Ukraine, he said China has &quot;a great deal of power over that situation&quot; and that he hoped the U.S. could work with Beijing to end the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-aims-to-peel-russia-off-of-china-us-secretary-of-state-says/	2025-02-27T01:49:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194469087.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 15	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 15 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Feb. 17&#x2013;Feb. 23, 2025. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Parliament set to vote on new administrative court reform bill in final reading Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, is scheduled to vote on draft law #12368-1 this week in its second and final reading. The legislation proposes establishing a new administrative court to replace the Kyiv District Administrative Court (OASK). However, the bill deviates from International Monetary Fund commitments, as it suggests creating two separate courts instead of a single high administrative court, as outlined in Ukraine&#x2019;s IMF memorandum. Given these discrepancies, the bill&#x2019;s chances of passage remain uncertain. Ukrainian lawmakers introduce bill to overhaul Financial Monitoring Service Ukrainian lawmakers have introduced Bill No. 13029, which aims to establish a transparent selection process for the head of the State Financial Monitoring Service (SFMS) and implement an independent audit of the agency&#x2019;s operations. The proposed legislation includes: The bill also responds to concerns over recent appointments at the SFMS. Just last week, a new deputy head, Bohdan Korolchuk, was appointed without a competition. Korolchuk previously served as first deputy to the new SFMS head at the Poltava Regional Administration and had prior experience in the National Police and the Interior Ministry. (Technology of Progress and research firm Gradus)Customs reform remains a priority for Ukrainian businesses, ToP&apos;s survey finds Customs reform remains a key priority for Ukrainian businesses, with the selection of a new head of the State Customs Service through a transparent process expected by June 2025, in line with Ukraine&#x2019;s IMF commitments. These findings come from a survey conducted by the NGO Technology of Progress and research firm Gradus, which polled 75 owners, executives, and senior managers of medium and large businesses across Ukraine. According to the results, 39% of respondents said the quality of customs services had remained unchanged in 2024, while 17% noted a deterioration in performance.

Ukraine Business Roundup — US, Ukraine agree on minerals deal	The following is the Feb. 25, 2025 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. After weeks of back-and-forth, during which U.S. President Donald Trump lobbed insults at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy, as well as public outcry over leaked details on the deal, Kyiv and Washington have reportedly agreed to a deal on Ukraine&#x2019;s mineral resources, the Financial Times and Ukrainian media outlet Ekonomichna Pravda reported late on Feb. 25 after obtaining access to the deal. Ukrainian officials told the FT that Kyiv is ready to move forward with a deal to develop Ukraine&#x2019;s mineral resources &#x2014; including oil and gas &#x2014; after the U.S. agreed to drop a demand for $500 billion in rights in potential revenue from developing the resources. The deal does not, however, contain any security guarantees for Ukraine &#x2014; a not-so-minor detail that was reportedly the reason why Zelensky refused to sign the first couple of versions of the agreement. The officials say the terms of the agreement are more favorable than the original versions of the deal, and according to the FT, see the deal as an important way to deepen their country&#x2019;s relationship with the U.S. Here&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s reportedly in the final version of the deal: The agreement will establish a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and related logistics. The fund will invest in projects within Ukraine. Interestingly, the deal excludes resources that already contribute to Ukraine&apos;s state budget, meaning it will not cover operations by Naftogaz and Ukrnafta, the country&apos;s largest oil and gas producers. This piece right here caused a lot of alarm when it became known to the public that a deal could possibly include the state-owned oil and gas giants. The updated agreement also removed a provision that would have given the United States 100% control over the fund. The joint ownership of Ukraine and the U.S. over the fund will be calculated according to the countries&apos; actual contributions to it, according to EP. What&#x2019;s next: The agreement still has to be signed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha. Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament will also have to ratify the deal. Specific details of the agreement will still have to be finalized in future negotiations. Speaking of details, in an op-ed published yesterday, titled &#x201C;Trump&#x2019;s Ukraine rare earths deal: &apos;The art of the steal&#x2019;,&#x201D; Edward C. Chow, non-resident senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, points out that &#x201C;the devil is in the details when assessing how such a deal might work.&#x201D; Firstly, Chow writes, the U.S. doesn&#x2019;t directly invest in mining projects, especially overseas. If the U.S. envisions the American private sector extracting Ukrainian resources, those investments can take five to 10 years to even secure financing. &#x201C;It is difficult to estimate how long this would take in a war-torn country whose territorial integrity is under attack,&#x201D; he writes. (Center for Economic Strategy)Will those who left ever return?The number of refugees who are planning to return to Ukraine after fleeing abroad due to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion continues to decline, according to a new report by the Kyiv-based Center for Economic Strategy. For the first time, the share of refugees planning to come home fell to below half of respondents in a poll conducted by the think tank. &#x201C;Many who previously expressed a definite or likely intention to return have now reconsidered, shifting towards staying abroad,&#x201D; CES wrote in its report. According to CES, the key factors discouraging refugees from returning are ongoing security risks and uncertainty, destroyed housing, low living standards, and challenges in finding employment in Ukraine. If the war does end this year as both President Volodymyr Zelensky and President Donald Trump have said is the goal, attracting Ukrainians back to the country will be crucial to getting Ukraine&#x2019;s economy on stable footing. Himera, the walkie-talkie startup is adding a new encryption layer to protect against future quantum computing threats. Thousands of Ukrainian troops already use Himera, and NATO is taking interest. (Facebook/Himera)Walkie-talkie revolutionOne Ukrainian startup has rebuilt the humble walkie-talkie to weather the waves of modern electronic war with Russia. With thousands of Ukrainian soldiers already using their handheld comms devices, NATO is tuning in, reporter Kollen Post writes in his latest. Himera, the walkie-talkie startup in question, is about to get a new layer of encryption that founder Misha Rudominsky says will guard their devices against the impending arrival of quantum computing on the battlefield &#x2014; a technological threat that is rattling wartime communications experts worldwide. More immediately, $1.2 million in fundraising, active EU manufacturing, U.S. Air Force testing, and a distribution deal with a Canadian firm are putting Himera on the threshold of selling to NATO and the U.S. Defense Department itself. Himera is one of Ukraine&#x2019;s first startups born in response to Russia&#x2019;s 2022 invasion to get a shot with the broader world&#x2019;s biggest armies. Read the full profile here. Ukraine will receive a new tranche of 3.5 billion euros ($3.7 billion) from the European Union in March, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Feb. 24 at the international Support Ukraine summit in Kyiv. In 2025, the EU is expected to provide Ukraine with 35 billion euros ($36 billion) in financial assistance under the G7 Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) credit initiative and the Ukraine Facility program. &quot;Thanks to our Ukraine Facility and the G7 loan, we have closed Ukraine&apos;s budgetary gap for the entire year 2025,&quot; she stressed. Meanwhile, the EU paid more for Russian fossil fuel imports than it gave to Ukraine in financial aid last year. The cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine after three years of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion will be $524 billion over the next decade, the U.N. said on Feb. 25, citing data from Ukraine&apos;s government, the World Bank, the European Commission, and the U.N. The required reconstruction costs are 2.8 times higher than Ukraine&apos;s nominal GDP for 2024. Direct losses in Ukraine reached $176 billion at the end of December 2024 compared to $152 billion in February last year. Educational technology company Headway became the first Ukraine-born business selected to join Endeavor, a global network of entrepreneurs. The membership gives Headway access to Endeavor&apos;s network of 2,800 entrepreneurs and potential funding through Endeavor Catalyst, the organization&apos;s investment fund that can invest up to $2 million in member companies. &quot;This is a powerful signal for Ukrainian startups: Our companies are visible to the whole world and have a great chance of entering global markets,&quot; said Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, noting that Endeavor&apos;s network includes companies like Glovo, Amazon, and Netflix. Ukraine&apos;s State Bureau of Investigation and Justice Ministry are preparing to nationalize Poltava Mining, a subsidiary of London-listed Ferrexpo, which is majority-owned by oligarch Konstantin Zhevago, the SBI announced on Feb. 20. The lawsuit seeks to transfer 49.5% of Poltava Mining and its assets to state ownership, including 541 properties, 172 land plots, and over 2,300 railway cars with tracks. Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) recently announced sanctions and criminal proceedings against a number of Ukrainian businessmen and former high-ranking officials, including Zhevago.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-business-roundup-us-ukraine-agree-on-minerals-deal/	2025-02-27T01:13:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179841418.jpg
Trump admin says it's cutting 90% of USAID foreign aid contracts	The Trump administration said on Feb. 26 that it is terminating over 90% of the U.S. Agency for International Development&apos;s (USAID) foreign aid contracts, cutting $60 billion in foreign assistance, the U.S. media reported. The step comes after U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration halted almost all foreign aid for 90 days for a review amid efforts to shutter the aid agency and merge it under the State Department. The cuts will include 5,800 of 6,200 USAID contracts, purportedly saving $54 billion, and 4,100 of 9,100 State Department grants, for a cut of $4.4 billion, Politico reported. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support to Kyiv. The agency has funded school reconstruction, bomb shelters, critical energy repairs, and civil society initiatives. The fate of the remaining USAID projects is to be determined in ongoing court battles with the administration. The White House has accused the agency of pushing a &quot;liberal agenda&quot; and widespread waste, despite foreign aid making up just 1% of the federal budget. Elon Musk, Trump&apos;s ally who oversees the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has led the charge against USAID, laying off staff and attacking the agency in public, often making baseless or false claims about its work. USAID cuts not only marked a significant realignment of U.S. foreign policy but also threatened various Ukrainian organizations and projects across multiple sectors reliant on U.S. funding. Ukraine is in talks with private and EU partners to replace funding sources for key projects in energy infrastructure, veterans&apos; affairs, and more.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-admin-says-its-cutting-90-of-usaid-foreign-aid-contracts/	2025-02-27T01:09:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2172231465.jpg
Ukraine to receive $730 million for demining equipment from partners by 2034	Western partners are planning to allocate 700 million euros ($732 million) to Kyiv for the purchase of demining equipment by 2034, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry said on Feb. 26. Over 139,300 square kilometers (53,800 square miles) of Ukrainian land are potentially contaminated with explosives as a result of the full-scale war, with clearance efforts expected to take over a decade and cost $35 billion, according to the Economy Ministry. The ministry&apos;s announcement came after the 11th meeting of the demining coalition for Ukraine, which involved 15 countries and was held in Vilnius. The participants prioritized the procurement of equipment and weapons for 2025 with a budget of 130 million euros ($157 million). A total of 51 million euros ($53 million) has already been raised, said Ruslan Berehulia, the head of the mine action department. Ukraine and Lithuania are also planning to set up working groups to study innovations, including the use of drones and artificial intelligence in mine action.Ukraine remains the most mined country in the world. Despite ongoing hostilities, Ukraine has reduced the area considered as potentially hazardous by over 35,000 square kilometers (13,500 square miles). Some 399 civilians have been killed, and 915 have been injured by mines since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, according to U.N. monitors. Multiple countries have been assisting Ukraine with demining efforts and providing training and equipment.	https://kyivindependent.com/demining/	2025-02-27T00:34:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1256100052.jpg
Trump to announce 25% tariffs on EU 'very soon'	U.S. President Donald Trump plans to impose 25% tariffs on imports from the European Union soon, he said during a cabinet meeting on Feb. 26. In early February, Trump placed 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods, albeit postponing their implementation soon after. He also imposed a 10% tariff on goods from China. Trump claimed that the EU was formed &quot;to screw the United States,&quot; criticizing European policies that, according to him, put American food and cars exporters at a disadvantage. &quot;We&apos;ll be announcing it very soon. It&apos;ll be 25% generally speaking, and that will be on cars and all other things,&quot; the U.S. president said. Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order for tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the U.S, prompting the European Commission to threaten retaliatory measures. The tariffs on steel will also affect Ukraine. Steel production is a key sector of Ukraine&apos;s economy, the second-largest source of foreign currency after agriculture. Ukraine&#x2019;s metallurgical products make up 57.9% of Ukraine&apos;s exports to the U.S., or in dollar amounts, $503 million out of $869 million, said Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko. The U.S.-EU dispute over tariffs dates back to Trump&apos;s first term, when his administration imposed duties on nearly $7 billion worth of European steel and aluminum exports in 2018, citing national security concerns. The EU retaliated with tariffs on American goods. A temporary truce was reached in 2021 under the Biden administration, with the U.S. partially lifting the tariffs and replacing them with a quota system. In exchange, the EU froze its countermeasures. Trump&apos;s latest move threatens to reignite the trade dispute. The European Commission argued that such restrictions would disrupt the deeply integrated supply chains between the EU and the U.S., raising costs and harming trade between both regions.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-to-announce-25-tariffs-on-eu-imports-very-soon/	2025-02-27T00:05:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201185317.jpg

Russia's advance slows down in critical areas after Ukraine regrouped, Syrskyi says	Ukraine has regrouped its troops on the battlefield, slowing down Russian forces&apos; advance in the most &quot;threatening areas,&quot; Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Feb. 27. Russian troops are actively pushing on the Novopavlivka sector in eastern Donetsk Oblast, trying to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense and capture three settlements, according to Syrskyi.He did not specify which settlements he meant. The village of Novopavlivka in Donetsk Oblast lies some 5 kilometers (3 miles) north of the embattled city of Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian troops in the region. The estimated Russian advance near Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, as of Feb. 26, 2025, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)&quot;However, our side has taken a number of measures to improve the interaction of military units and subdivisions, regrouped troops, which slowed down... (Russia&apos;s) advance in most threatening areas,&quot; the general said after visiting the front line.Since the beginning of the day, 110 clashes between Ukrainian and Russian forces have taken place along the front line, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said in its latest update on Feb. 27. According to Syrskyi, Russia continues trying to reach the administrative border of Donetsk Oblast, suffering heavy losses. &quot;The plans remain unfulfilled,&quot; he said.A day before, the 25th Separate Airborne Brigade reported that Ukrainian troops had regained control of the village of Kotlyne, near Pokrovsk. Kotlyne and Pokrovsk are connected by the T 0406 highway, which also leads to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-advance-slowed-in-most-threatening-areas-after-ukraines-regrouping/	2025-02-26T23:05:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2180021053.jpg
Australian philanthropists donate $3.15 million to Ukraine, urge governments to step up support	Minderoo Foundation on Feb. 27 donated 5 million Australian dollars ($3.15 million) to support Ukrainian communities impacted by Russian aggression and affirm Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity. The package builds upon 20 million Australian dollars ($12.6 million) that the Australia-based charity, founded by Andrew and Nicola Forrest, has already provided for demining, food and energy security, and the protection of children in Ukraine. Russia&apos;s full-scale war, which recently entered its fourth year, has sparked a deep humanitarian crisis in the country, leaving millions displaced and housing and infrastructure devastated in front-line regions. &quot;The invasion of one country by another is wholly offensive to civilization. Ukraine has every right to protect its borders, and the international community will be extremely shortsighted if it does not stand with Ukraine,&quot; said Andrew Forrest, an Australian billionaire, philanthropist, and founder of the Fortescue mining group. &quot;While philanthropy can play a crucial role, governments across Europe should redouble their efforts to make Russian assets and elite interests pay for the war of aggression they have waged on Ukraine.&quot; The foundation&apos;s latest assistance package focuses on regions in Ukraine&apos;s east, including Dnipro, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, and elsewhere. It targets communities impacted by Russia&apos;s use of cluster munitions in Mykolaiv in 2022 and Russia&apos;s deadly missile strike against an apartment building in Dnipro in January 2023. The donation will further provide support for demining in agricultural areas, households impacted by the war, and peace-building and community cohesion activities in cooperation with civil society organizations. Nicola Forrest noted that one-quarter of Ukraine&apos;s agricultural land remains contaminated by landmines and unexploded ammunition. &quot;Demining is a humanitarian and economic imperative. Recovery, growth and global food security depends on it,&quot; she said in a statement. The foundation said that the latest donation is intended to recognize Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity and reflects Minderoo&apos;s commitment to the Ukrainian leadership in peace efforts. &quot;President (Volodymyr) Zelensky is the democratically elected leader of his people and a man of great character and resilience,&quot; Andrew Forrest said on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. &quot;As I have told the president before, we unequivocally support Ukraine to recover from this atrocious war on the terms acceptable to him and his people.&quot; The statement comes amid U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s diplomatic outreach to Russia in an effort to broker a peace deal, seemingly sidestepping Kyiv and Europe. The U.S. president caused an uproar in Ukraine and elsewhere when he called Zelensky a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; and said the Ukrainian head of state is not vital to the peace process.	https://kyivindependent.com/australian-charity-donates-3-million-to-regional-recovery-in-ukraine/	2025-02-26T22:54:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/1c248f5e630b858e5b896ae3512ede97_1708189465_extra_large.jpeg
General Staff: Russia has lost 871,850 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 871,850 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 27. This number includes 1,150 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,209 tanks, 21,196 armored fighting vehicles, 38,842 vehicles and fuel tanks, 23,755 artillery systems, 1,299 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,086 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 27,102 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-871-850-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-02-26T22:07:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1669833933.jpg
North Korea deploys additional troops to Russia's Kursk Oblast, South Korean intelligence says	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. North Korea has deployed additional troops to Russia, an official for South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Agency (NIS) claimed on Feb. 27. An official from Seoul&apos;s spy agency told AFP that &quot;some additional troop deployments (are) appearing to have taken place,&quot; into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, adding that other troops had been &quot;redeployed&quot; within the region. No information was immediately available as to how many new troops were being sent into Russia, with the official adding that the &quot;exact scale is still being assessed.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims made by the National Intelligence Agency. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in August 2024. The New York Times reported on Jan. 30 that North Korean troops had been pulled from the front, a Special Operations Forces spokesperson confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine&apos;s special forces had not faced Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers for three weeks. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov denied reports that North Korean soldiers have not been seen on the front line for weeks. However, Budanov noted that the number of North Korean troops has decreased, and Ukraine is trying to establish why. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 14 that North Korean troops fighting for Russia against Ukraine have suffered 4,000 casualties, two-thirds of whom have been killed. Zelensky&apos;s claim of the number killed is significantly higher than a Jan. 13 estimate from the NIS which said at least 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and another 2,700 wounded. The heavy losses of the North Korean army may be related to its lack of combat experience and the tactic of human waves attacks with a limited amount of equipment, Budanov said in an interview with The War Zone magazine published on Feb. 4. Amid the gruelling offensive, Ukraine has continued to lose territory initially gained in the surprise Kursk incursion. Russia has claimed to have regained control of about 64% of the territory captured by Ukraine. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-deploys-additional-troops-to-russia-south-korean-intelligence-claims/	2025-02-26T21:06:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157772464.jpg
Finland to provide Ukraine with $691 in military equipment	Finland announced on Feb. 26 that it would provide 660 million euros ($691 million) in military equipment for Ukraine, supplying the embattled country with domestically-produced equipment. The announcement did not provide detail as to what kind of equipment or weaponry the country will provide Ukraine, but will focus &quot;on Ukraine&#x2019;s critical needs,&quot; according to a news release Finland&apos;s Defense Ministry. &quot;The products will be delivered to Ukraine as part of future material aid packages,&quot; the news release added, without specifying a timeline. The announcement marks a shift in how the country delivers weaponry and equipment to Ukraine, having previously donated from the country&apos;s surplus stocks. Under the new framework, Finland will order new military products from domestic defense companies to be sent to Ukraine. &quot;With this new support program, Finnish companies and expertise will play a central role in supporting Ukraine,&quot; the news release read. &quot;These measures will strengthen both Ukraine&apos;s chances for a just peace and the long-term resilience of Finland&#x2019;s security industry and supply chain.&quot; The announcement comes amid new scrutiny surrounding Europe&apos;s role in supporting Ukraine in the wake of shifting U.S. policy towards Russia. European leaders have scrambled to deliver military support to Ukraine as the U.S., under the Trump administration, races to make a peace deal with Moscow. When U.S. and Russian officials met in Riyadh on Feb. 18 for preliminary talks on ending the war, EU officials feared Europe was being shut out of the peace process altogether. U.S. President Donald Trump has said he wants Europe to play a greater role in supporting Ukraine&apos;s financial and defense needs, but his administration has sent mixed signals as to whether Europeans are welcome in the negotiations process. Since the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Finland has provided Ukraine with 2.5 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in defense aid. On Feb. 24, the day marking the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Nordic countries Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, announced additional aid funding for Ukraine &#x2014; with Finland providing 4.5 million euros ($4.7 million) through the Partnership Fund for a Resilient Ukraine (PFRU) for 2025-2027 to support Ukraine&apos;s resilience and stability.	https://kyivindependent.com/finland-to-provide-ukraine-with-691-in-military-equipment/	2025-02-26T20:12:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1250760048.jpg
Bulgarian court orders recount of parliamentary election results amid voting discrepancies	Bulgaria&#x2019;s Constitutional Court ordered a full recount of the country&apos;s October 2024 parliamentary election results on Feb. 26 following an audit that discovered various voting discrepancies. The court-issued recount puts at risk a slim six-seat majority for former Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, the current leader of the coalition government. Multiple parties contested the results of the vote at the local level after they were revealed, citing irregularities. Following a court-ordered audit, voting discrepancies were found in nearly half of the sampled polling stations. Following the recount, adjustments to the total seat counts in Bulgaria&apos;s parliament may be made, the court said, potentially impacting the fragile government coalition. The announcement of the recount comes amid a unstable last few years in the EU country, with a total of seven elections being held since 2021 &#x2014; none of which have been able to produce a stable government. Borissov, current head of the conservative-populist Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) party, resigned from his post in 2021 amid corruption allegations. The recount in the Balkan country comes alongside news on Feb. 26 that Calin Georgescu, presidential candidate and right-wing populist in neighboring Romania, was charged by prosecutors for alleged crimes related to the country&apos;s recent elections. Georgescu, a pro-Russian candidate, emerged as the frontrunner in Romania&apos;s presidential race in the first-round vote on Nov. 24. Romania&apos;s Constitutional Court annulled those results after reviewing evidence of &quot;organized manipulation from abroad.&quot; Bulgaria has provided Ukraine with a variety of aid since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, but the matter has been contentious due to significant pro-Russian sentiment in the country and opposition from President Rumen Radev.	https://kyivindependent.com/bulgarian-court-orders-recount-of-parliamentary-election-results-amid-voting-discrepancies/	2025-02-26T19:07:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2123616394.jpg
US declines to sign WTO statement condemning Russian aggression	The United States abstained from signing a statement by members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) condemning Russian aggression on Feb. 26, breaking from its Western allies. A total of 45 members, including Ukraine, agreed to the WTO statement. &quot;The decision not to co-sponsor was made in keeping with our position in the United Nations Security Council and U.N. General Assembly earlier this week&quot;, a U.S. official told Reuters after the decision. The statement, proposed during Ukraine&#x2019;s Trade Policy Review, emphasized members&apos; concerns surrounding the &quot;consequences of (the war&apos;s) destruction for Ukraine and for global trade,&quot; while explicitly naming Russia as the aggressor. The move aligns with recent U.S. efforts to soften language on Russia in international statements. The WTO agreement comes just days after the U.S. voted against a resolution at the UN General Assembly on Feb. 24 condemning Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, with 93 countries voting in favor and 18 against. The UN resolution, drafted by Kyiv and supported by all EU states except Hungary, reaffirmed Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity. It explicitly named Russia as the aggressor. On the same day, the General Assembly passed a separate U.S. resolution marking the third anniversary of the invasion. That resolution also received 93 votes in favor but avoided directly calling Russia the aggressor. Ukraine abstained from voting on the U.S. version. The shift in U.S. language extends across international institutions. The Financial Times reported that the U.S. opposed referring to Russia as the aggressor in a G7 statement commemorating the invasion&apos;s anniversary. U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia while adopting increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Kyiv. He recently called President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and falsely claimed Ukraine started the war &#x2014; before later conceding that &quot;Russia attacked, but they shouldn&#x2019;t have let him attack.&quot; Despite the developing rift, Kyiv and Washington agreed to a mineral deal agreement, with Zelensky likely headed to Washington for a signing ceremony on Feb. 28.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-declines-wto-statement-condemning-russian-aggression/	2025-02-26T17:58:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2170630663.jpg
Far-right Romanian presidential candidate detained, charged in election probe	Romanian presidential candidate and right-wing populist Calin Georgescu was detained by police on Feb. 26 and charged by prosecutors for alleged crimes related to the country&apos;s recent elections. Georgescu, a pro-Russian candidate who has referred to Ukraine as a &quot;fictional state,&quot; emerged as the frontrunner in Romania&apos;s presidential race in the first-round vote on Nov. 24. Romania&apos;s Constitutional Court annulled those results after reviewing evidence of &quot;organized manipulation from abroad.&quot; The Romanian Prosecutor General&apos;s office has now charged Georgescu with &quot;incitement to actions against the constitutional order&quot; and other crimes in a six-count indictment. Georgescu was allegedly on his way to newly register his candidacy on Feb. 26 when he was detained and called in for questioning at the Prosecutor General&apos;s office, his communications team claimed in a Facebook post. The post included video footage of police stopping Georgescu and serving him documents from state prosecutors. Romanian authorities on Dec. 4 declassified evidence of what they described as a &quot;highly organized&quot; social media campaign backed by a &quot;state actor&quot; to boost Georgescu, a fringe ultranationalist who has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin. A relative unknown, Georgescu won 23% of the votes in the first round, defeating pro-EU reformist Elena Lasconi, who took 19%. The Romanian foreign intelligence agency (SIE) reported that &quot;aggressive Russian hybrid attacks, including cyberattacks, information leaks, and sabotage&quot; contributed to Georgescu&apos;s unexpected victory. The subsequent court decision to annul the Nov. 24 election result triggered criticism from U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who claimed the ruling was the result of &quot;flimsy suspicions ... and enormous pressure&quot; during his speech at the Munich Security Conference. Billionaire Elon Musk, another key ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, responded to news of Georgescu&apos;s arrest with a post on X, the social media platform he owns. &quot;This is messed up,&quot; he wrote. Bloomberg reported on Feb. 18 that the Trump administration has pressured the Romanian government to allow Georgescu&apos;s candidacy to proceed, despite evidence of Russian interference. Georgescu has said that if elected president, he would ban Ukrainian grain exports through Romania and halt further military aid to Ukraine. A new first round of presidential elections in Romania is scheduled for May 4. The current indictment could interfere with Georgescu&apos;s ability to run a second time.	https://kyivindependent.com/far-right-romanian-presidential-candidate-detained-charged-in-election-probe/	2025-02-26T16:50:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2202150445.jpg
Romania approves shooting down drones that violate its airspace	The Romanian parliament passed a law on Feb. 26 that allows the country to shoot down drones that violate its airspace. The move comes after multiple incidents in which Russian drones crashed onto Romanian territory during attacks against neighboring Ukraine. &quot;Unmanned aircraft illegally crossing the Romanian state border and flying in national airspace without authorization may be destroyed, neutralized, or taken control of,&quot; the law says. Following its approval in parliament, the law will now advance to the desk of interim Romanian President Ilie Bolojan, who assumed the duties of the head of state after former President Klaus Iohannis announced his resignation on Feb. 10. &quot;We are strengthening Romania&apos;s defense!&quot; Interim Senate Chair Abrudean Mircea said in a Facebook post announcing the new law. Last month, Romania&apos;s Defense Ministry confirmed that it had found Russian drone fragments in two communities near the Romania-Ukraine border. The drone wreckage was found after Russia launched an overnight aerial attack against Ukraine. It was not the first time that wreckage of Russian drones has been found in Romania, a NATO member state. Romania&apos;s military has scrambled F-16 fighter jets to protect the country&apos;s airspace amid Russian attacks against Ukrainian port infrastructure on the Danube River. In response to Russia&apos;s escalating attacks, Romania&apos;s Defense Ministry in October 2024 published a draft law allowing Romania to shoot down aircraft illegally violating its airspace.	https://kyivindependent.com/romania-approves-shooting-down-drones-that-violate-airspace/	2025-02-26T15:28:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183433232.jpg
Ukraine not on agenda in next US-Russia talks, State Department says	U.S. and Russian officials will not discuss Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine during their meeting in Istanbul on Feb. 27, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said in an email to Reuters. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov announced on Feb. 26 that Washington and Moscow would hold a second round of talks in Turkey, just over a week after delegates from the two countries met in Saudi Arabia for their first direct talks since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The meeting will not include discussions on Ukraine, a State Department spokesperson told Reuters. &quot;To be clear, there are no political or security issues on the agenda. Ukraine is not &#x202F;on the agenda,&quot; the spokesperson said via email. Lavrov said the meeting would focus on the reopening of embassies and diplomatic missions, one of three main objectives named at the conclusion of the Saudi Arabia talks. President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Kyiv will not accept any decisions about Ukraine&apos;s future that arise from negotiations that exclude Ukraine. No Ukrainians were invited to participate in the U.S.-Russia talks in Riyadh. As American officials prepare to meet with a Russian delegation for the second time this month, U.S. President Donald Trump has claimed that a ceasefire deal between Kyiv and Moscow is imminent. Trump said on Feb. 24 &#x2014; the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion &#x2014;&#xA0;that the war could be over &quot;within weeks.&quot; Ahead of official peace negotiations, he has already said that Ukraine &quot;can forget about&quot; joining NATO and that he is interested in signing a deal with Russia on rare earth minerals. The drastic shift in U.S. foreign policy toward Russia has alarmed Ukrainian and European leaders. Zelensky is set to meet with Trump on Feb. 28 to sign a critical minerals agreement and press the U.S. to provide Ukraine with security guarantees. creating a high-level team to facilitate Ukraine peace talks, and exploring ways to strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-not-on-agenda-in-next-us-russia-talks-state-department-says/	2025-02-26T14:04:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193483462.jpg
Zelensky confirms upcoming meeting with Trump	President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 28 to finalize a critical minerals deal between Ukraine and the United States, the president confirmed in his evening address on Feb. 26. Previously, Trump announced that Zelensky would sign the deal at the White House on Feb. 28. &quot;Our teams are working with America, we are preparing for talks this Friday,&quot; Zelensky said in a video posted to his official Telegram channel. &quot;An agreement with America. ... I will meet with President Trump. It is important for me and all of us in the world that America&apos;s assistance is not stopped.&quot; Following a series of intensive negotiations, Washington and Kyiv agreed on a deal to establish a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. Ukraine&apos;s Cabinet of Ministers approved the decision to sign the mineral resources agreement on Feb. 26, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said. The agreement does not lay out any concrete security guarantees in exchange for U.S. access to Ukraine&apos;s mineral resource revenues. Zelensky told reporters that although specific measures are not included in the current agreement, guarantees will be discussed in future negotiations. &quot;Guarantees of peace and security are the key to ensuring that Russia no longer destroys the lives of other nations,&quot; he said in his Feb. 26 address. Zelensky initially rejected a proposed U.S. minerals agreement because it lacked security guarantees for Ukraine, something Kyiv has said is essential to any deal. Zelensky&apos;s rejection triggered backlash from the Trump administration, which put increasing pressure on Ukraine to sign the deal even as it made overtures toward Moscow. The White House has characterized the agreement as a way for the U.S. to &quot;recoup&quot; the financial aid it has directed to Kyiv since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Trump said on Feb. 25 that the deal offers Ukraine &quot;military equipment and the right to fight on.&quot; In his remarks on Feb. 26, Zelensky said the agreement is a sign of U.S. support. &quot;It is important for me and all of us in the world that America&apos;s assistance is not stopped,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-confirms-upcoming-meeting-with-trump/	2025-02-26T12:53:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161013738.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Trump says he will meet Zelensky on Feb. 28 in Washington to sign agreement on minerals	Key developments on Feb. 26: U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will visit Washington on Feb. 28 to sign a minerals agreement between the two countries. &quot;It&apos;s now confirmed, and we&apos;re going to be signing an agreement which will be a very big agreement,&quot; Trump said on Feb. 26 during a White House cabinet meeting. Following weeks of tense negotiations, Washington and Kyiv agreed on a deal to establish a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. It excludes revenue streams already flowing into Ukraine&apos;s budget, meaning it will not impact Naftogaz and Ukrnafta, the country&apos;s largest oil and gas producers. The final version drops earlier U.S. demands for a $500 billion claim over Ukraine&apos;s resources, which had been a major sticking point. Ukraine&apos;s Cabinet of Ministers approved the decision to sign the mineral resources agreement on Feb. 26, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said. Security guarantees, a key issue for Kyiv, are not explicitly included in the agreement but will be discussed in future negotiations, Zelensky told journalists on Feb. 26. Zelensky also said he plans to use the meeting with Trump to ask about continued U.S. support, Washington&apos;s direct talks with Moscow, and the prospect of a broader strategy to end the war. &quot;I have already emphasized that it is unacceptable for us if decisions about us are made without us,&quot; he said. The U.S. and Russia held their first direct negotiations in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, marking the first such meeting since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion began. A second round is set for Feb. 27, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov saying discussions will include the reopening of embassies. Trump, who has repeatedly said he wants to broker a deal to end the war, suggested a ceasefire agreement was within reach. &quot;Most importantly, by far, we&apos;re going to make a deal with Russia and Ukraine to stop killing people,&quot; he said on Feb. 26. Zelensky noted he hopes to get more answers from the meeting about what to expect from the United States in the near future and &quot;what joint plan we can prepare to end this war.&quot; The meeting comes as Trump&apos;s outreach to Moscow fuels concerns in Kyiv and among European allies. He has also escalated rhetoric against Zelensky, calling him a &quot;dictator without elections,&quot; echoing Russian propaganda narratives. His remarks ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia launched its full-scale invasion. Security guarantees Kyiv is seeking are not specified in a mineral deal agreement with Washington, but will be discussed in future rounds of negotiations with the U.S. and other allies, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Feb. 26. The deal, finalized on Feb. 25, follows weeks of negotiations that strained relations between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. Washington initially proposed three versions, with Kyiv rejecting the first two over the absence of security guarantees. The latest version of the agreement, which was obtained by the Kyiv Independent, aims to create a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. While it does not contain concrete security guarantees, the agreement states that the U.S. government &quot;supports Ukraine&apos;s efforts to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace.&quot; &quot;I asked for an understanding that all this is part of the future security guarantees of Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said of the deal, adding that he wanted &quot;at least a sentence about security guarantees for Ukraine to appear in the &#xA0;agreement &#x2014; and it did appear.&quot; Trump also on Feb. 26 said that Europe, rather than the U.S., would be mainly responsible for providing security guarantees to Ukraine. &quot;I&apos;m not going to make security guarantees beyond very much &#x2014; we&apos;re going to have Europe do that because we&apos;re talking about Europe is their next door neighbor,&quot; he said during a cabinet meeting at the White House. Trump added that the U.S. would ensure &quot;everything goes well&quot; and, as anticipated, would collaborate with Ukraine on rare earth minerals. &quot;We very much need rare earth &#x2014; they have great rare earth,&quot; he said. It&apos;s unclear whether Trump&apos;s reference to Ukraine&apos;s &quot;rare earth&quot; was meant to indicate the country&apos;s critical minerals or other resources, as Ukraine possesses only small deposits of rare earths. Earlier versions of the deal reportedly included a controversial clause requiring Ukraine to repay U.S. aid at a two-to-one ratio, meaning for every dollar received, Kyiv would have to return two. &quot;From what I was told, the &apos;two-to-one&apos; provision is not there, and thank God,&quot; Zelensky told reporters at the meeting. The president also emphasized that Ukraine would not assume debt under the agreement. &quot;Despite what is being said in the media, the agreement does not include any $500 billion debt, $350 billion, or $100 billion. Because that would be unfair to us,&quot; he said. The latest draft of the agreement drops earlier U.S. demands for a $500 billion claim over Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, which had been a major sticking point. This agreement will be followed by a more detailed Fund Agreement, which will define the terms of the Reconstruction Investment Fund, jointly managed by Ukraine and the U.S. The Fund Agreement will require ratification by Ukraine&apos;s parliament. U.S. and Russian officials will meet for a second round of Ukraine peace talks on Feb. 27 to discuss the reopening of embassies, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said. &quot;Such a meeting will take place tomorrow in Istanbul. I think that its results will show how quickly and effectively we can move forward,&quot; he said in comments reported by Russian state media. Lavrov also said that Russia will not allow the deployment of European peacekeepers in Ukraine. The first round of talks on Feb. 18 in Saudi Arabia marked the first direct negotiations between the U.S. and Russia since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion began, with Russia&apos;s delegation, led by Lavrov, sitting down with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials. Ukraine was not invited to participate. Following the initial meeting, Rubio outlined three main objectives both sides had agreed to pursue. These include restoring embassy staff in Washington and Moscow, creating a high-level team to facilitate Ukraine peace talks, and exploring ways to strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries. Elsewhere, an agreement between Kyiv and Washington regarding Ukraine&apos;s critical minerals and natural resources will grant Ukraine &quot;military equipment and the right to fight on,&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 25. Speaking to reporters from the Oval Office of the White House, Trump said that the agreement gave Ukraine billions of dollars in aid and &quot;lots of equipment.&quot; Trump denied having spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding U.S. access to critical minerals in Russian-occupied Ukrainian lands. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 26 that Ukraine will not be allowed to join NATO as part of a future peace agreement with Russia and ruled out lifting sanctions on Moscow before a deal is reached. &quot;You can forget about (NATO membership). That&apos;s probably the reason the whole thing started,&quot; Trump said during a White House cabinet meeting when asked what concessions Ukraine should make in a settlement. Trump has repeatedly blamed President Joe Biden for provoking Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion by supporting Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations. Russian propaganda often cites Ukraine&apos;s potential alliance membership as a justification for the war. Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022. While the alliance declared in 2024 that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; no formal invitation has been extended. President Volodymyr Zelensky has called NATO membership the &quot;cheapest&quot; possible security guarantee for Ukraine. Asked whether sanctions relief for Russia would be part of peace negotiations, Trump said, &quot;No. I want to see if we make a deal (to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine) first.&quot; Washington has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion, targeting banks, energy exports, and dual-use goods. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio previously indicated that sanctions relief could be part of negotiations but insisted the U.S. would maintain restrictions at least until an agreement is reached. Trump&apos;s comments come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky prepares to visit Washington on Feb. 28 to sign a minerals agreement with the U.S. Ukrainian drones successfully struck the Tuapse oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai region overnight on Feb. 26, a source in Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;According to intelligence sources, the attack on the facility resulted in at least 40 explosions and a fire, damaging oil refining equipment,&quot; the source said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Earlier on Feb. 26, Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry said 128 Ukrainian drones had been downed over the country, 83 of them in Krasnodar Krai. It did not report any damage or casualties but unverified videos posted to social media showed explosions in the area, including at a nearby seaport. Last night, a large-scale drone attack targeted Russia&#x2019;s Krasnodar Krai as part of an effort to enforce peace. Key sites, including the commercial port in Tuapse and various facilities in the city, were struck. Russia&#x2019;s Ministry of Defense claimed to have intercepted 128 drones&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/8Fh20JC6uy The HUR source said the refinery and port &quot;plays an important role in ensuring the military logistics of the occupying Russian army.&quot; &quot;The oil terminal in Tuapse is one of the largest in the Russian Federation, and the Tuapse port is one of the key Russian cargo ports on the Black Sea,&quot; they added. Rosneft&apos;s Tuapse refinery has been repeatedly targeted by Ukrainian strikes over the past year. Following an earlier strike, the facility underwent an emergency shutdown in May. Ukraine has escalated attacks against Russia&apos;s oil industry, successfully reducing the processing capacities of multiple facilities. Ukrainian troops have regained control of the village of Kotlyne, near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, the 25th Separate Airborne Brigade reported on Feb. 26. The village of Kotlyne is located some 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of Pokrovsk. Kotlyne and Pokrovsk are connected by the T0406 highway, which also leads to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. &quot;Paratroopers of the 25th Separate Airborne Brigade of the Airborne Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces cleared the village of Kotlyne near Pokrovsk during the assault and recovery operations,&quot; the statement read. The estimated Russian advance at Kotlyne, Donetsk Oblast, as of Feb. 26, 2025, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)If Russian troops occupied the settlement, they would have been able to access the Pokrovsk-Dnipro highway, the military said. The embattled city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast is among the most hotly contested areas of the front. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi previously claimed that 7,000 Russian soldiers were killed near Pokrovsk in January alone. The Ukrainian military, which has published daily estimates of Russian losses since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, has reported that 870,700 personnel have been killed or wounded since the start of the all-out war. According to a report from the monitoring group DeepState in late January, Russian forces have been concentrating nearly half of their attacks in the Pokrovsk direction.

Ukraine hits key Russian military sites in Crimea, Krasnodar Krai, General Staff says	Ukraine targeted key Russian military and industrial sites in occupied Crimea and Krasnodar Krai, striking the Saky and Kacha military airfields and the Tuapse oil refinery, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 26. The operation, conducted by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces and military intelligence agency (HUR) in coordination with other units, aimed to degrade Russia&apos;s air operations and logistical capabilities. Saky and Kacha airfields, located in occupied Crimea, are used by Russia to control airspace over the Black Sea and to launch strikes on Ukrainian territory. The Tuapse oil refinery, with an annual processing capacity of 12 million tons, is significant in supplying fuel to the Russian military. At least 40 explosions were reported near the refinery, with claims of damage to infrastructure, according to the General Staff. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its air forces shot down 128 Ukrainian drones overnight on Feb. 26. It reported downing 83 drones over Krasnodar Krai, 30 over occupied Crimea, and several others over the Azov and Black Seas, as well as in Bryansk and Kursk oblasts. &quot;Strikes on military and strategic facilities involved in the Russian armed aggression against Ukraine will continue,&quot; the General Staff said. Kyiv has intensified strikes on Russian fossil fuel infrastructure, aiming to disrupt revenue sources funding Moscow&apos;s war effort. Ukraine regularly conducts deep strikes on military and industrial targets in Russia, predominantly using domestically developed drones.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hits-key-russian-military-sites-in-crimea-krasnodar-krai-general-staff-claims/	2025-02-26T12:09:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2187953056.jpg
No sanctions relief for Russia pre-deal and Ukraine 'can forget about' NATO, Trump says	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 26 that Ukraine will not be allowed to join NATO as part of a future peace agreement with Russia and ruled out lifting sanctions on Moscow before a deal is reached. &quot;You can forget about (NATO membership). That&apos;s probably the reason the whole thing started,&quot; Trump said during a White House cabinet meeting when asked what concessions Ukraine should make in a settlement. Trump has repeatedly blamed President Joe Biden for provoking Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion by supporting Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations. Russian propaganda often cites Ukraine&apos;s potential alliance membership as a justification for the war. Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022. While the alliance declared in 2024 that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; no formal invitation has been extended. President Volodymyr Zelensky has called NATO membership the &quot;cheapest&quot; possible security guarantee for Ukraine. Asked whether sanctions relief for Russia would be part of peace negotiations, Trump said, &quot;No. I want to see if we make a deal (to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine) first.&quot; Washington has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion, targeting banks, energy exports, and dual-use goods. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio previously indicated that sanctions relief could be part of negotiations but insisted the U.S. would maintain restrictions at least until an agreement is reached. Trump&apos;s comments come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky prepares to visit Washington on Feb. 28 to sign a minerals agreement with the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-can-forget-about-nato-no-russia-sanctions-relief-pre-deal-trump-says/	2025-02-26T12:07:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194444069.jpg
Zelensky officially dismisses Joint Forces Commander Andrii Hnatov, now serving in General Staff	President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 26 officially dismissed Brigadier General Andrii Hnatov as commander of the Joint Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, after appointing him deputy chief of the General Staff in January. Hnatov has held the position since June 26, 2024, replacing Yurii Sodol. In late January, Zelensky announced that Hnatov would be sent to the General Staff to serve as a deputy chief, saying, &quot;his task is a new level of training of operational headquarters and a higher quality of interaction between the headquarters and the front.&quot; &quot;We discussed these and some other changes with Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrsky,&quot; add that &quot;tasks have been set at all levels,&quot; the president said at the time. While holding the position of Joint Forces commander, Hnatov also served as the commander of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group. When announcing Hnatov would be moved to the General Staff in January, Zelensky appointed Major General Mykhailo Drapatyi, commander of Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces, to lead the Khortytsia operational-strategic group. Hnatov previously served as the deputy commander of the Southern Operational Command.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-dismisses-joint-forces-commander-hnatov/	2025-02-26T11:56:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/453631283_902313778591342_3007613341411061451_n.jpg
5 killed, 11 injured in Russian airstrike on Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast	Russian airstrikes on Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast killed at least five civilians and injured 11 others on Feb. 26, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. According to Ukraine&apos;s National Police, a 47-year-old woman and four men &#x2014; aged 56, 57, and 75, with one more yet to be identified &#x2014; were killed. The injured include five women and six men, ranging from 33 to 83 years old. Filashkin said Russian forces dropped three guided bombs on the city and its outskirts. The attack damaged or destroyed at least 52 civilian sites, including more than 20 residential buildings. Kostiantynivka, located about 10 kilometers (6 miles) southwest of the front-line city of Chasiv Yar, had a prewar population of around 67,000. Russian forces have regularly targeted settlements in Donetsk Oblast with artillery and airstrikes, often resulting in civilian casualties.	https://kyivindependent.com/5-killed-11-injured-in-russian-attack-on-kostiantynivka/	2025-02-26T10:44:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-26_16-53-10.jpg

No security guarantees in US minerals deal, to be discussed later, Zelensky says	Security guarantees Kyiv is seeking are not specified in a mineral deal agreement with Washington, but will be discussed in future rounds of negotiations with the U.S. and other allies, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Feb. 26. The deal, finalized on Feb. 25, follows weeks of negotiations that strained relations between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. Washington initially proposed three versions, with Kyiv rejecting the first two over the absence of security guarantees. The latest version of the agreement, which was obtained by the Kyiv Independent, aims to create a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. While it does not contain concrete security guarantees, the agreement states that the U.S. government &quot;supports Ukraine&apos;s efforts to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace.&quot; &quot;I asked for an understanding that all this is part of the future security guarantees of Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said of the deal, adding that he wanted &quot;at least a sentence about security guarantees for Ukraine to appear in the &#xA0;agreement &#x2014; and it did appear.&quot; Trump also on Feb. 26 said that Europe, rather than the U.S., would be mainly responsible for providing security guarantees to Ukraine. &quot;I&apos;m not going to make security guarantees beyond very much &#x2014; we&apos;re going to have Europe do that because we&apos;re talking about Europe is their next door neighbor,&quot; he said during a cabinet meeting at the White House. Trump added that the U.S. would ensure &quot;everything goes well&quot; and, as anticipated, would collaborate with Ukraine on rare earth minerals. &quot;We very much need rare earth &#x2014; they have great rare earth,&quot; he said. It&apos;s unclear whether Trump&apos;s reference to Ukraine&apos;s &quot;rare earth&quot; was meant to indicate the country&apos;s critical minerals or other resources, as Ukraine possesses only small deposits of rare earths. Earlier versions of the deal reportedly included a controversial clause requiring Ukraine to repay U.S. aid at a two-to-one ratio, meaning for every dollar received, Kyiv would have to return two. &quot;From what I was told, the &apos;two-to-one&apos; provision is not there, and thank God,&quot; Zelensky told reporters at the meeting. The president also emphasized that Ukraine would not assume debt under the agreement. &quot;Despite what is being said in the media, the agreement does not include any $500 billion debt, $350 billion, or $100 billion. Because that would be unfair to us,&quot; he said. The latest draft of the agreement drops earlier U.S. demands for a $500 billion claim over Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, which had been a major sticking point. This agreement will be followed by a more detailed Fund Agreement, which will define the terms of the Reconstruction Investment Fund, jointly managed by Ukraine and the U.S. The Fund Agreement will require ratification by Ukraine&apos;s parliament. U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that Zelensky will arrive in Washington on Feb. 28 to sign the mineral agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-minerals-deal-references-security-guarantees-without-specifics-zelensky-says/	2025-02-26T10:03:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161013738.jpg
Trump says he will meet Zelensky on Feb. 28 in Washington to sign agreement on minerals	U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will visit Washington on Feb. 28 to sign a minerals agreement between the two countries. &quot;It&apos;s now confirmed, and we&apos;re going to be signing an agreement which will be a very big agreement,&quot; Trump said on Feb. 26 during a White House cabinet meeting. Following weeks of tense negotiations, Washington and Kyiv agreed on a deal to establish a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. It excludes revenue streams already flowing into Ukraine&apos;s budget, meaning it will not impact Naftogaz and Ukrnafta, the country&apos;s largest oil and gas producers. The final version drops earlier U.S. demands for a $500 billion claim over Ukraine&apos;s resources, which had been a major sticking point. Security guarantees, a key issue for Kyiv, are not explicitly included in the agreement but will be discussed in future negotiations, Zelensky told journalists on Feb. 26. Zelensky also said he plans to use the meeting with Trump to ask about continued U.S. support, Washington&apos;s direct talks with Moscow, and the prospect of a broader strategy to end the war. &quot;I have already emphasized that it is unacceptable for us if decisions about us are made without us,&quot; he said. The U.S. and Russia held their first direct negotiations in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, marking the first such meeting since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion began. A second round is set for Feb. 27, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov saying discussions will include the reopening of embassies. Trump, who has repeatedly said he wants to broker a deal to end the war, suggested a ceasefire agreement was within reach. &quot;Most importantly, by far, we&apos;re going to make a deal with Russia and Ukraine to stop killing people,&quot; he said on Feb. 26. Zelensky noted he hopes to get more answers from the meeting about what to expect from the United States in the near future and &quot;what joint plan we can prepare to end this war.&quot; The meeting comes as Trump&apos;s outreach to Moscow fuels concerns in Kyiv and among European allies. He has also escalated rhetoric against Zelensky, calling him a &quot;dictator without elections,&quot; echoing Russian propaganda narratives. His remarks ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia launched its full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-says-to-meet-zelensky-on-feb-28-to-make-a-deal-on-minerals/	2025-02-26T09:55:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197144376--1-.jpg
Ukrainian director of commercials Vitalii Kokoshko killed in Russia's war	Vitalii Kokoshko, a Ukrainian director of commercials and veteran of the Ukrainian advertising industry, was killed in Russia&apos;s war, his daughter Olha Kokoshko wrote on Facebook on Feb. 25. Kokoshko joined the Ukrainian Armed Forces at the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. He served in the 72nd Mechanized Brigade, which defended Kyiv during the first days of the all-out war and then relocated to Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. &quot;My dad was a man of great heart and soul, so our hearts and souls are so deeply affected by his loss. Thank you for your support,&quot; his daughter wrote. The soldier&apos;s daughter added that he was killed in his brigade&apos;s unit, without specifying any other details. Kokoshko was 58 years old. As a director and producer, Kokoshko has made over 400 commercials. In 1998, he founded the Kinograf advertising agency. He received 43 Effie Ukraine awards and over 350 awards from creative advertising festivals, including Cannes Lions, Epica, Eurobest, and Golden Drum.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-commercials-director-vitalii-kokoshko-killed-in-russias-war/	2025-02-26T07:11:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/414007590_1661525397708968_7413840240881385105_n.jpg
Ukraine's DTEK plans LNG import deal by April, Bloomberg reports	Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy company, DTEK, is in talks with several sellers for a two-year liquefied natural gas (LNG) import contract into the country, CEO Maxim Timchenko said in an interview at IE Week in London, Bloomberg reports. &#xA0; The company expects to finalize and announce the deal within the next two months, with most potential partners based in the U.S. DTEK is also exploring longer-term agreements of 10 to 20 years with suppliers, including those from the Middle East. Timchenko declined to disclose specific suppliers, as negotiations are still in the early stages. &quot;We want to build a medium-term and long-term business,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;We want to see Ukraine be an offtaker with gas storage facilities.&quot; In June 2024, DTEK signed the first major deal with U.S. Venture Global to supply LNG to Ukraine for two years. It was the first time ever Ukraine has never purchased U.S. LNG directly. According to the agreement, Ukraine and other Eastern European countries would receive gas from Venture Global&apos;s Plaquemines plant located on the Gulf Coast in Louisiana. DTEK successfully imported Ukraine&apos;s first US LNG shipment through a Greek terminal in December, utilizing gas swaps to transfer it into the European system since Ukraine lacks its own import facility, Bloomberg wrote. The energy company plans to maintain monthly LNG imports and is exploring additional European terminals in Poland, Lithuania, Croatia, and Germany for future deliveries.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-dtek-plans-lng-import-deal-by-april-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-26T05:36:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201456171.jpg
Ukraine's agriculture industry has lost $80 billion due to Russian invasion, minister says	Ukraine&apos;s agricultural sector has suffered around $80 billion in losses due to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Agriculture Minister Vitalii Koval said on Feb. 25 during a World Bank report presentation. This figure includes not only direct damage but also indirect damage caused by disrupted logistics, increased fertilizer and fuel costs, expenses for land reclamation and demining, and occupied territories, the minister added. &quot;I&apos;m convinced that the restoration of the agricultural sector must begin today,&quot; Koval said. &quot;A key priority is helping farmers in front-line territories.&quot; The agricultural sector plays a vital role in Ukraine&apos;s economy, comprising approximately 20% of the country&apos;s GDP, Koval said earlier. After Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion broke out in 2022, Ukraine&apos;s previously dominant share of non-agricultural exports declined significantly. According to a study by the German-Ukrainian Agricultural Policy Dialogue project, after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion began, Ukraine&#x2019;s non-agricultural exports have declined significantly, while agricultural food exports have remained relatively stable, providing vital support to the Ukrainian economy. Koval previously said that farmers, together with agro-processors, produce about 60% of export revenues, playing a key role in the Ukrainian economy amid the full-scale war. Throughout the full-scale war, Moscow has attempted to obstruct Ukraine&apos;s agricultural exports by blockading the Black Sea and trying to replace Ukrainian products in global markets with its own, including grain looted from occupied territories. Despite these challenges, Ukraine reopened a maritime trade corridor in 2023, enabling the revival of its agricultural exports. In 2024, Ukraine&apos;s agricultural exports reached $24.5 billion, approaching pre-war levels and achieving the second-highest record after 2021&apos;s $27.7 billion. Last year, agricultural exports accounted for 59% of the country&apos;s total exports.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-agriculture-industry-lost-80-billion-due-to-russian-invasion-official-says/	2025-02-26T05:33:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1242310109.jpeg
Exclusive: The full text of the US-Ukraine mineral deal	The Kyiv Independent has obtained from a source in the Ukrainian government the full text of the mineral deal agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine and is publishing the text in full. Kyiv and Washington agreed on a deal on Feb. 25. The negotiations around the deal have fueled tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the past week. Zelensky will likely head to Washington for a signing ceremony in the coming weeks, according to reports. The signing could come as early as Feb. 28, a senior Ukrainian official reportedly told AFP. This first document will be followed by a Fund Agreement, which will further define the terms of the Reconstruction Investment Fund, created by the U.S. and Ukraine. That document will require ratification by Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament. The full text is as follows: BILATERAL AGREEMENT ESTABLISHING TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR A RECONSTRUCTION INVESTMENT FUND WHEREAS the United States of America has provided significant financial and material support to Ukraine since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022; WHEREAS the American people desire to invest alongside Ukraine in a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine; WHEREAS the United States of America and Ukraine desire a lasting peace in Ukraine and a durable partnership between their two peoples and governments; WHEREAS the United States of America and Ukraine recognize the contribution that Ukraine has made to strengthening international peace and security by voluntarily abandoning the world&apos;s third largest arsenal of nuclear weapons; WHEREAS the United States of America and Ukraine wish to ensure that those States and other persons that have acted adversely to Ukraine in the conflict do not benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine following a lasting peace; NOW, THEREFORE, the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Ukraine (each, a &#x201C;Participant&#x201D;) hereby enter into this Bilateral Agreement Establishing Terms and Conditions for a Reconstruction Investment Fund to deepen the partnership between the United States of America and Ukraine, as set forth herein. 1.

Further contributions may be comprised of funds, financial instruments, and other tangible and intangible assets critical for the reconstruction of Ukraine. 5. The Fund&apos;s investment process will be designed so as to invest in projects in Ukraine and attract investments to increase the development, processing and monetization of all public and private Ukrainian assets including, but not limited to, deposits of minerals, hydrocarbons, oil, natural gas, and other extractable materials, infrastructure, ports, and state-owned enterprises as may be further described in the Fund Agreement. The Government of the United States of America and the Government of Ukraine intend that the investment process will lead to opportunities for distribution of additional funds and greater reinvestment, to ensure the sufficient supply of capital for the reconstruction of Ukraine as set out in the Fund Agreement. The Participants reserve the right to take such action as necessary to protect and maximize the value of their economic interests in the Fund. 6. The Fund Agreement will include appropriate representations and warranties, including those necessary to ensure that any obligations the Government of Ukraine may have to third parties, or such obligations that it may undertake in the future, do not sell, convey, transfer pledge, or otherwise encumber the Government of Ukraine&#x2019;s contributions to the Fund or the assets from which such contributions are derived, or the Fund&#x2019;s disposition of funds. In drafting the Fund Agreement, the Participants will strive to avoid conflicts with Ukraine&#x2019;s obligations under its accession to the European Union or its obligations under arrangements with international financial institutions and other official creditors. 7. The Fund Agreement will provide, inter alia, an acknowledgment that both the Fund Agreement and the activities provided for therein are commercial in nature. The Fund agreement shall be ratified by the Parliament of Ukraine according to the Law of Ukraine &#xAB;On International Treaties of Ukraine&#xBB;. 8. The Fund Agreement will pay particular attention to the control mechanisms that make it impossible to weaken, violate or circumvent sanctions and other restrictive measures. 9. The text of the Fund Agreement will be developed without delay by working groups chaired by authorized representatives of the Government of Ukraine and the Government of the United States of America. Contact persons responsible for preparing the Fund Agreement on the basis of this Bilateral Agreement are: from the Government of the United States of America: the Department of the Treasury; from the Government of Ukraine: Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Economy. 10. This Bilateral Agreement and the Fund Agreement will constitute integral elements of the architecture of bilateral and multilateral agreements, as well as concrete steps to establish lasting peace, and to strengthen economic security resilience and reflect the objectives set forth in the preamble to this Bilateral Agreement. The Government of the United States of America supports Ukraine&#x2019;s efforts to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace. Participants will seek to identify any necessary steps to protect mutual investments, as defined in the Fund Agreement. 11.

Ukrainian journalist Tatiana Kulyk killed in her home by Russian drone attack in Kyiv Oblast	Journalist Tatiana Kulyk and her husband, surgeon Pavlo Ivanchov, were killed in their home by a Russian drone attack on Bucha district of Kyiv Oblast on Feb. 26, according to Ukrinform and Bogomolets National Medical University. Russia attacked the Bucha district causing a fire in their home. While extinguishing the fire and clearing the rubble, rescuers found two dead bodies. Kulyk was a journalist at the Ukrinform news agency, host of &quot;the Nation of the Invincibles&quot; program, and acted as editor-in-chief of the agency&apos;s Multimedia Department. Kulyk was a member of the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine. Ivanchov was an oncologist and head of the Surgery Department at Bogomolets National Medical University. He was also the co-author of over two hundred scientific papers published in national and foreign journals, according to university&apos;s statement. &quot;Tatiana Kulyk was a great journalist. She made many programs about our struggles and our heroes. Just yesterday, we were talking about preparing an interview with Kyrylo Budanov. She will forever stay in our hearts and in our memory,&quot;said Serhii Cherevatyi, Ukrinform CEO. Russian forces launched 177 drones at Ukraine overnight, targeting Kharkiv, Sumy, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kirovohrad, Kherson, Mykolaiv, and Kyiv oblasts.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-attack-on-kyiv-oblast-kills-journalist-surgeon-in-their-home/	2025-02-26T04:51:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/480975795_1065058052322397_6797416338109524431_n.jpg
More than 40 explosions' — HUR confirms Ukrainian drone strike on Russia's Tuapse oil refinery	Ukrainian drones successfully struck the Tuapse oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai region overnight on Feb. 26, a source in Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;According to intelligence sources, the attack on the facility resulted in at least 40 explosions and a fire, damaging oil refining equipment,&quot; the source said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Earlier on Feb. 26, Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry said 128 Ukrainian drones had been downed over the country, 83 of them in Krasnodar Krai. It did not report any damage or casualties but unverified videos posted to social media showed explosions in the area, including at a nearby seaport. Last night, a large-scale drone attack targeted Russia&#x2019;s Krasnodar Krai as part of an effort to enforce peace. Key sites, including the commercial port in Tuapse and various facilities in the city, were struck.

Ukraine has escalated attacks against Russia&apos;s oil industry, successfully reducing the processing capacities of multiple facilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/more-than-40-explosions-hur-confirms-ukrainian-drone-strike-on-russias-tuapse-oil-refinery/	2025-02-26T04:39:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-26-at-14_29_27-1.png
Ukrainian forces liberate Kotlyne village near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast	Ukrainian troops have regained control of the village of Kotlyne, near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, the 25th Separate Airborne Brigade reported on Feb. 26. The village of Kotlyne is located some 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of Pokrovsk. Kotlyne and Pokrovsk are connected by the T 0406 highway, which also leads to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. &quot;Paratroopers of the 25th Separate Airborne Brigade of the Airborne Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces cleared the village of Kotlyne near Pokrovsk during the assault and recovery operations,&quot; the statement read. The estimated Russian advance at Kotlyne, Donetsk Oblast, as of Feb. 26, 2025, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)If Russian troops occupied the settlement, they would have been able to access the Pokrovsk-Dnipro highway, the military said. The embattled city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast is among the most hotly contested areas of the front. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi previously claimed that 7,000 Russian soldiers were killed near Pokrovsk in January alone. The Ukrainian military, which has published daily estimates of Russian losses since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, has reported that 870,700 personnel have been killed or wounded since the start of the all-out war. According to a report from the monitoring group DeepState in late January, Russian forces have been concentrating nearly half of their attacks in the Pokrovsk direction.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-forces-liberate-kotlyne-village-near-pokrovsk-in-donetsk-oblast/	2025-02-26T03:58:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2191667263.jpg
US, Russia to meet again tomorrow in Istanbul, Lavrov says	U.S. and Russian officials will meet for a second round of Ukraine peace talks on Feb. 27 to discuss the reopening of embassies, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said. &quot;Such a meeting will take place tomorrow in Istanbul. I think that its results will show how quickly and effectively we can move forward,&quot; he said in comments reported by Russian state media. The first round of talks on Feb. 18 in Saudi Arabia marked the first direct negotiations between the U.S. and Russia since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion began, with Russia&apos;s delegation, led by Lavrov, sitting down with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials. Ukraine was not invited to participate Following the initial meeting, Rubio outlined three main objectives both sides had agreed to pursue These include restoring embassy staff in Washington and Moscow, creating a high-level team to facilitate Ukraine peace talks, and exploring ways to strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-russia-to-meet-again-tomorrow-in-istanbul-lavrov-says/	2025-02-26T03:27:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201304255-2.jpg
Trump says sanctions against Russia to be lifted 'at some point'	Sanctions against Russia will be lifted &quot;at some point,&quot; President Donald Trump said on Feb. 25 during a press briefing at the White House. Trump&apos;s comments come as the U.S. and Russia renew contact between officials, including face-to-face discussions on ending the war in Ukraine, reopening embassies in Washington and Moscow, and resuming economic cooperation. &quot;No, we haven&apos;t lifted any sanctions on anybody&#x2026; I guess it will be at some point, but right now, we haven&apos;t agreed to lift sanctions on anybody,&quot; Trump said. Russia has been extensively targeted by Western sanctions since the launch of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Biden administration and the U.K. imposed in January their most extensive sanctions yet on Russia&apos;s oil sector, targeting nearly 200 vessels in the &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; key oil companies, and related entities. These measures, announced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on Jan. 10, have already impacted the global oil market, pushing Brent crude prices up by nearly $5 per barrel. Trump previously said that he would likely impose additional sanctions against Russia if Russian President Vladimir Putin fails to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine. The Trump team is reportedly weighing two primary approaches, according to Bloomberg. The first set of policy recommendations suggests that, if a resolution to the war appears possible, the administration should focus on good-faith measures to benefit sanctioned Russian oil producers that could help seal a peace deal. The second option would involve expanding sanctions to exert maximum pressure, increasing leverage over Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-admits-sanctions-against-russia-to-be-lifted-at-some-point/	2025-02-26T02:37:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194989577.jpg
Hitler wanted to kill me because I'm Jewish. Putin wants to kill me because I'm Ukrainian	Editor&#x2019;s Note: The following is a translated transcript of the address delivered by Roman Shvartsman, the chairman of the Odesa Association of Jews and a Holocaust survivor, at the Yalta European Strategy (YES) Special Gathering hosted by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 24, 2025, marking the third anniversary of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &#x201C;Ladies and gentlemen, A month ago, the German Bundestag commemorated the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. I had the opportunity to speak there as someone who lived through oppression, brutal violence, and endless suffering during World War II. I told them: (Adolf) Hitler wanted to kill me because I am Jewish. (Russian President Vladimir) Putin wants to kill me because I am Ukrainian. You swore: &#x2018;Never again.&#x2019; This &#x2018;never again&#x2019; has arrived. If you are serious, you must support Ukraine differently than you have before. Even if you have already done a lot, we now need action. I don&#x2019;t need to tell you about the suffering of Jews and Ukrainians under German occupation. Babyn Yar is widely known today as a symbol of this abuse, but there were around 2,000 such sites in Ukraine. People in the West know little about this. These were ordinary people carrying out shootings, beatings, burnings, and mass killings. And those who survived the war often returned to their civilian lives, undisturbed. Germany now does a lot to remember. &#x2018;Never again&#x2019; accompanies every memorial service, but this &#x2018;never again&#x2019; is missing a second part. After the unprecedented murders, after humanity stared into the abyss of National Socialism, simply saying &#x2018;never again&#x2019; is not enough. &#x2018;Never again&#x2019; needs a second part: &#x2018;Never again&#x2019; defenseless victims. &#x2018;Never again&#x2019; crimes against humanity. This is a lesson the world must learn from the horrors of the 20th century. The UN Charter enshrines this commitment, yet human rights are trampled every day, borders are forcibly redrawn, and entire nations are threatened. We (Ukraine) are a country under attack from our large neighbor for 11 years. The war has not lasted three years, but 11. Russia wants to conquer and destroy us as an independent state. We are bombed day and night, our energy system is destroyed, and our culture is under attack. There is real terror and the killing of civilians in Russian-occupied territories. And why? Because we want our freedom. Because we want to be part of a free Europe, not a Russian colony. Many countries have pledged their support. At the United Nations, 141 countries condemned the Russian invasion and called for the withdrawal of Putin&apos;s forces. We were hardly ready for war, but the war continued, and people kept dying. We were told that time had not run out. But what was that time when we hardly received any weapons? The time after the first Russian invasion was not used. Where was the military support from Germany, which emphasizes &#x2018;never again?&#x2019; When Putin gathered his troops around us, when he said we were &#x2018;Little Russia,&#x2019; when he announced he wanted to divide the world into zones of influence again, most countries refused to believe it. They were comfortable in their prosperous societies, enjoying cheap Russian gas, and denying that it could ever be their turn. While defense spending in Europe was cut, the American people were paying for Europe&#x2019;s security. We shouldn&#x2019;t be surprised when the man who won the election told Americans: &#x2018;We will not do it anymore. Europeans have to defend themselves.&#x2019; I think we must care for the democratic world together &#x2014; Ukraine, the European Union, and the United States. But now the oldest and most powerful democracy in the world has elected a leader who is turning everything upside down. Victims are being labeled as criminals. A Hanukkah menorah is lit on the eighth day at the former Golden Rose Synagogue site in Lviv, Ukraine, on Jan. 2, 2025. (Les Kasyanov/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)We, Ukrainians, were shocked to see (U.S. President Donald) Trump negotiating with Putin as if nothing had happened. And we, the occupied, are told we should never have started this war. We cannot understand what the American president says and writes. But Europe, with its 450 million citizens and powerful economic space, must finally realize that the era of comfort and prosperity is over. Freedom is not free. Perhaps now we have Munich in 1938, the Hitler-Stalin Pact, and Yalta. If we allow this to happen, the war will not end with Putin conquering Ukraine. If Russia is not stopped in Ukraine, the threat of war for all of Europe will grow. That is why I tell my European friends: the war will come to you. Just as the calculations didn&#x2019;t work in Munich, they won&#x2019;t work this time if you abandon Ukraine. You are poorly armed. You cannot defend yourselves without Ukraine. That is why I tell you: Ukrainians are protecting you every day, year after year, for years. This is also your front, which Putin has opened in Eastern Europe. Finally, realize this. Have the courage now, or your free societies will also perish. Dear guests, I am an old man. I was in the ghetto. I looked the devil in the eye. I tell the democratic world: don&#x2019;t be afraid of him. You give too much power to evil. If you stand together and overcome your fear, you can defeat the devil. Thank you for listening.&#x201D; Editor&#x2019;s Note: The opinions expressed in the op-ed section are those of the authors and do not purport to reflect the views of the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/hitler-wanted-to-kill-me-because-im-jewish-putin-wants-to-kill-me-because-im-ukrainian/	2025-02-26T02:32:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/YES_3Years_time_to_WIN_0809.JPG
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 5, injure 36 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed five civilians and injured 36 others over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 26. Russian forces launched 177 drones from the Russian cities of Orel, Bryansk, Kursk, Shatalovo, Millerovo, and Primosk-Akhtarsk at Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 110 drones over Kharkiv, Sumy, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kirovohrad, Kherson, Mykolaiv, and Kyiv oblasts, the Air Force said. Another 67 drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are often decoys which Russia sends alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian forces killed one civilian and injured 16 others in the Krasnotorka village in the Kramatorsk community. One person was also killed in the village of Yampil, while another was injured in the town of Kostiantynivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 36 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, one person was killed, and eight other people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. On Feb. 26 morning, Russian forces also struck the village of Zelenivka with artillery, injuring a 72-year-old woman. She was hospitalized in a moderately severe condition. In Kharkiv Oblast, a man was killed, and another was injured in a Russian attack with multiple rocket launchers against the villages of Bilyi Kolodiaz and Karaiichne. Russia also targeted the village of Kutkivka with an FPV (first-person-view) drone, injuring a 55-year-old man. In the village of Zolochiv, two women suffered injuries as a result of glide bombs attacks, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. In Kyiv Oblast, Russia carried out several strikes with drones, causing a fire in the Bucha district. Rescuers found a body while extinguishing the fire, the local military administration reported. A woman and a man also suffered injuries in other settlements in Kyiv Oblast. In Chernihiv Oblast, one person was injured in an attack against the village of Halahanivka, and another suffered injuries in an FPV strike on the village of Manukhivka, Operational Command &quot;North&quot; reported. In Sumy Oblast, one civilian was injured in an FPV strike on the Bilopillia community, the local military administration reported. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, a 57-year-old man suffered injuries in an attack on the village of Stepnohirsk. Russian troops launched a total of 499 strikes on 12 settlements in Zaporizhzhia Oblast over the past day, according to the local military administration. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian forces hit a facility owned by DTEK, Ukraine&apos;s largest private energy company. The company did not specify which facility was affected. Power engineers are currently working on restoring its operation.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-5-injure-36-over-past-day/	2025-02-26T01:54:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-26-09_40_58.jpeg
128 Ukrainian drones attack Russia overnight, Krasnodar Krai port targeted	Russian forces downed 128 drones overnight on Feb. 26 over several Russian regions and Russian-occupied Crimea, the country&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed. The Russian air forces shot down 83 drones over Krasnodar Krai and destroyed another 30 drones over Russian-occupied Crimea. Eight drones were downed over the Azov, while another five over the Black Sea. Russia also reportedly shot down one drone in Bryansk and another in Kursk oblasts. Residents reported explosions in the cities of Tuapse and Anapa in Krasnodar Krai, while the airport in Sochi was closed due to a drone attack, the independent Telegram channel Astra reported. The Tuapse sea trade port was also reportedly targeted, according to Astra. The governor of Krasnodar Krai, Veniamin Kondratyev, said there were no casualties in the region, but several houses were damaged. Ukraine routinely launches deep strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia, primarily relying on domestically developed drones. Kyiv has particularly taken aim at Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure as part of its strategy to undermine funding for the Kremlin&apos;s war chest.	https://kyivindependent.com/almost-130-drones-attack-russia-targeting-port-in-krasnodar-krai/	2025-02-25T23:13:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-26-08_49_50.jpeg
Poland to adapt all civilian airports for dual-military use	All civilian airports in Poland must be modernized and adapted for potential use by the country&apos;s military, Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said on Feb. 25. In comments reported by Polish Radio, Kosiniak-Kamysz said such adaptations would allow them to be used as transport hubs, evacuation points, cargo hubs, or aid points in the event of an emergency. &quot;Every airport must be adapted and in some way adapted to the possibility of cooperating and working with the military,&quot; he said. Kosiniak-Kamysz said work was already underway at some major Polish airports &#x2014; a &quot;cargo hub, together with a railway siding, with fuel supplies&quot; are being built at both Katowice and Wroclaw, and &quot;preparatory processes&quot; are underway at Krakow. Situated on NATO&apos;s eastern flank, Poland has taken several steps to boost its military since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk advocated for increased defense spending across NATO on Jan. 15, arguing that if all European members matched Poland&#x2019;s spending, NATO&#x2019;s defense budget would be ten times that of Russia&#x2019;s. &quot;Other countries should not pay 1.5 percent of their GDP for defense &#x2014; this is not enough,&quot; he said, emphasizing that robust European defense contributions could help maintain friendly U.S.-European relations. On Jan. 7, Trump called for NATO&#x2019;s spending target to rise to 5% of GDP, significantly higher than the current 2% goal. &quot;If all European countries start taking their obligations in NATO seriously, I am sure America will be happy to cooperate with us,&quot; Tusk added. While the 5% suggestion has faced resistance, some NATO members are reportedly open to a more modest increase, potentially to 3% of GDP, Reuters reported on Jan. 10.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-to-adapt-all-civilian-airports-for-dual-military-use/	2025-02-25T23:08:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2076698613.jpg

This number includes 1,170 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,201 tanks, 21,183 armored fighting vehicles, 38,702 vehicles and fuel tanks, 23,686 artillery systems, 1,299 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,085 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 26,961 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-870-700-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-02-25T22:24:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/DSCF7839.jpg
Media: Slovak National Party calls on Fico to apologize after Slovakia backs UN resolution condemning Russian aggression	The Slovak National Party has demanded that Prime Minister Robert Fico immediately apologize for supporting a UN resolution condemning Russia&#x2019;s aggression against Ukraine, Czech news outlet Denik N reported on Feb. 25. The UN General Assembly approved a Ukrainian resolution on Feb. 24 condemning Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, with 93 countries voting in favor and 18 against. The resolution, drafted by Kyiv and supported by all EU states except Hungary, reaffirms Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity. It explicitly names Russia as the aggressor. The Slovak National Party stated that an investigation should determine who authorized the Slovak representative at the UN to vote in this manner. The party also emphasized that Slovakia must uphold a consistent stance, and insisted that its representatives in international institutions should not vote against the policies set by Fico&#x2019;s government and backed by the Slovak National Party. &quot;It is important that the Slovak Republic maintains its position and a clear stance, as Hungary, led by Viktor Orban, does,&#x201D; the statement said. &#x201C;If the government declares something, it is unthinkable that our representatives in international institutions would vote contrary to the policy advocated by the government led by Robert Fico with the support of the Slovak National Party.&#x201D; Fico won Slovakia&apos;s parliamentary elections in September 2023. It is his fourth time at the helm of the Slovak government. Before Fico&apos;s return to power, Slovakia had been a staunch supporter of Ukraine. It was the first country to send Kyiv fighter jets after the full-scale invasion and a reliable supplier of military aid. Fico&apos;s government initiated a stark policy reversal, halting weapons deliveries to Ukraine and adopting rhetoric blaming the West for Russia&apos;s war.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-slovak-national-party-calls-on-fico-to-apologize-after-slovakia-backs-un-resolution-condemning-russian-aggression/	2025-02-25T21:47:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188638934.jpg
Poland to transfer 5,000 more Starlink terminals to Ukraine	Polish Deputy Prime Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski confirmed on Feb. 25 that Poland has ordered 5,000 Starlink terminals for Ukraine. He commented on the importance of Ukrainians having access to Starlink, especially after the start of the war. &#x201C;Starlink provides internet and security in both civilian and military spheres. Thanks to this, the front holds,&#x201D; he said. Gawkowski also noted that Poland helps to fund and maintain Starlink access in Ukraine, providing half of all terminals in Ukraine. &quot;Poland is maintaining it, Poland purchased Starlink and transferred it to Ukraine. Poland ensures security by paying the subscription fees. I cannot imagine any American corporation violating such agreements.&quot; More than 20,000 Starlink terminals have been lent to Ukraine by Warsaw since 2022. Tensions have been growing in recent months between Ukraine and Starlink&#x2019;s owner, billionaire Elon Musk, over his ties to Russia and comments about Ukraine. Starlink internet terminals have played a crucial role in securing communications in the war in Ukraine, with most battlefield positions equipped with their own terminal. Last year, Ukraine said that approximately 42,000 terminals were in operation across the military, hospitals, businesses, and aid organizations.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-to-transfer-5-000-more-starlink-terminals-to-ukraine/	2025-02-25T20:26:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1813800965.jpeg
Russian film critic who previously criticized authorities detained in Moscow	The Russian Investigative Committee detained film critic Ekaterina Barabash in Moscow, her son Yuri Barabash reported on Facebook on Feb. 25. The reasons for her detention remain unclear, but it is presumed to be linked to her professional activities, including her work for Republic, a Russian publication that was added to the foreign agent media register and banned in March 2022. Republic Editor-in-Chief Dmitry Kolezev, who recently left Russia, confirmed this on his Telegram channel. Russian state-owned outlet RIA Novosti also confirmed her detention. Barabash&#x2019;s legal status and the nature of the case remain unspecified. Both of her parents were born in Ukraine, and Barabash had publicly supported the country on her social media, most recently on Feb. 23. Her son, Yuri, has been living and working in Ukraine for many years. Previously, Barabash was fired from Interfax in 2016 for criticizing Russian authorities. Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s crackdown on dissent since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has seen thousands of his citizens arrested and many jailed.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-film-critic-who-previously-criticized-authorities-detained-in-moscow/	2025-02-25T18:31:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/barabash.jpg
Trump says Russian oligarchs could be eligible for $5 million US 'gold card'	Russian oligarchs could be eligible to apply for the &quot;gold card,&quot; a $5 million path to U.S. residency and citizenship that U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Feb. 25. Trump unveiled his &quot;gold card,&quot; a scheme to attract &quot;people of wealth&quot; to the U.S. while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Feb. 25. &quot;We&apos;re going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million and that&apos;s going to give you green card privileges, plus it&apos;s going to be a route to citizenship,&quot; he said. Trump said individuals who apply for the card would be heavily vetted, but did not name any countries that would be restricted from the program. When asked if Russian oligarchs would be eligible for the gold card, Trump said they could likely apply. &quot;Yeah, possibly. Hey, I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people,&quot; he said. Trump said Russian oligarchs are &quot;not quite as wealthy as they used to be,&quot; an apparent reference to Western sanctions, but did not object to the idea of such individuals applying for the gold card. &quot;I think they can afford $5 million,&quot; he said. &#xA0; The Trump administration had previously taken measures to soften Washington&apos;s stance against Russian elites, shutting down a government task force that sanctioned Kremlin-linked oligarchs. The White House has meanwhile cracked down on immigration, suspending multiple programs allowing migrants to enter the country, including an initiative for Ukrainians established by former U.S. President Joe Biden. &#xA0; Trump has made increasingly friendly overtures to Moscow in recent days, including speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin and arranging direct talks between U.S. and Russian officials without Ukraine&apos;s participation. Trump also said he&apos;s open to striking a deal with Russia regarding rare earth deposits.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-says-russian-oligarchs-could-be-eligible-for-5-million-us-gold-card/	2025-02-25T16:06:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201360456.jpg
Military equipment and the right to fight on' — Trump on what US minerals deal gives Ukraine	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. An agreement between Kyiv and Washington regarding Ukraine&apos;s critical minerals and natural resources will grant Ukraine &quot;military equipment and the right to fight on,&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 25. President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s office confirmed on Feb. 25 that the U.S. and Ukraine had reached an agreement regarding Ukraine&apos;s critical minerals after an intense period of negotiations. Speaking to reporters from the Oval Office of the White House, Trump said that the agreement gave Ukraine billions of dollars in aid and &quot;lots of equipment.&quot; It was unclear if he was referring to future or past military aid packages from the U.S. The deal gives Ukraine &quot;military equipment and the right to fight on, and originally, the right to fight,&quot; Trump said. Trump also said that Zelensky would visit the White House on Feb. 28 to sign the deal. The finalized agreement, dated Feb. 24, reportedly offers Kyiv no security guarantees in exchange for 50% of revenues from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of Ukraine&apos;s state-owned mineral resources. The White House has said that the agreement is necessary in order for the U.S. to &quot;recoup&quot; the funds it has granted to Ukraine in aid packages over the past three years of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. &quot;Ukraine, I will say they&apos;re very brave, and they&apos;re good soldiers, but without the United States and its money and its military equipment, this war would have been over in a very short time,&quot; Trump said. Trump also said he was open to striking a deal on critical minerals with Russia. &quot;I&apos;d like to buy minerals on Russian land too if we can,&quot; he said. &quot;The rare earth, they have very good rare earth ... It&apos;s great for Russia too, because we could do deals there. They have very valuable land that isn&apos;t utilized, so something like that could take place.&quot; Trump denied having spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding U.S. access to critical minerals in Russian-occupied Ukrainian lands. Putin on Feb. 24 &#x2014;&#xA0;the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine &#x2014;&#xA0;said that Moscow was open to working with foreign partners on developing rare earth metal deposits, including in occupied regions of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/military-equipment-and-the-right-to-fight-on-trump-on-what-minerals-deal-gives-ukraine/	2025-02-25T14:52:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197654088.jpg
State Department officials want to unfreeze US aid to Ukraine, Politico reports	Officials at the U.S. State Department are requesting exemptions to Washington&apos;s freeze on foreign aid that would free up funds for Ukraine, Politico reported on Feb. 25. The U.S. imposed a 90-day freeze on nearly all foreign aid projects when President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20. The funding freeze affected critical humanitarian aid and reconstruction programs in Ukraine. Senior State Department officials are putting together a list of exemptions for Ukraine, Politico reported, citing an official, two other sources with knowledge of the matter, and a document obtained by the outlet. These exemptions would extend beyond the U.S. waiver for &quot;life-saving&quot; programs and would allow Ukraine to receive funding for demining, narcotics control, and civil society projects. Plans for the additional Ukraine exemptions have been in the works since late January, Politico reported. Internal conversations regarding the matter took place as recently as last week. According to a document seen by Politico, waivers cannot be granted for any initiatives supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). It remains uncertain whether the exemptions will be granted. In response to a question on new waivers for Ukraine, the State Department issued a statement saying that &quot;programs that serve our nation&apos;s interests will continue. However, programs that aren&apos;t aligned with our national interest will not.&quot; U.S. policy towards Ukraine has shifted dramatically in recent weeks, with American officials holding direct talks with Russian delegates, the U.S. siding with Russia on a U.N. resolution about the war, and Trump attacking President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy in public comments. The U.S. has also said it wants to &quot;recoup&quot; the aid money it has granted to Kyiv over the course of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. The two countries reportedly reached an agreement on Feb. 25 that would give the U.S. access to Ukraine&apos;s natural resource revenues &#x2014;&#xA0;without offering Kyiv any security guarantees.	https://kyivindependent.com/state-department-officials-want-to-unfreeze-us-aid-to-ukraine-politico-reports/	2025-02-25T14:13:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193483462.jpg
Macron wins no security guarantees from Trump on peacekeepers plan, FT reports	French President Emmanuel Macron did not receive any specific security guarantees from the United States regarding a plan to deploy European peacekeepers to monitor a future ceasefire in Ukraine, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Feb. 25. Macron visited U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Feb. 24 to discuss Ukraine&apos;s postwar security options in the event of a peace deal with Russia. Trump claimed that such a deal could come &quot;within weeks.&quot; While Macron spoke optimistically about his meeting with Trump, calling it &quot;a turning point&quot; in U.S. support for European peacekeeping efforts, officials told the FT that Washington offered no specific guarantees. There is &quot;no definitive agreement&quot; as to how the U.S. will provide security assurances for peacekeeping forces in Ukraine, a French official said. Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who will meet with Trump later this week, are coordinating on a proposal for Ukraine&apos;s postwar security that involves a European peacekeeping force that would rely heavily on air power and be backed by the U.S. The plan would reportedly include a small land force of 30,000 European troops. &#xA0; Starmer has said that this plan requires a U.S. &quot;backstop&quot; to deter future Russian aggression. Following their meeting on Feb. 24, both Macron and Trump signaled openness to U.S. support for the European peacekeeping proposal.&quot;There are Europeans that are ready to engage to provide for these security guarantees,&quot; Macron said. &quot;Now there&apos;s a clear American message that the U.S. as an ally is ready to provide that solidarity for that approach.&quot; When asked if the U.S. would support European troops, Trump said that it would, without getting into details. &#xA0; &quot;We will have a backing of some kind. Obviously European countries are going to be involved,&quot; he said. Trump then said that Europe would not likely &quot;need much backing&quot; because he did not expect Russia to violate a ceasefire agreement. Trump also said that Russian President Vladimir Putin would accept the presence of European troops in Ukraine, a term the Kremlin has repeatedly opposed. The French official who spoke to the FT said that despite the lack of concrete security guarantees on the table at this stage, Trump appeared open to the idea of a U.S. backstop. &quot;There is no objection from President Trump to the Americans giving security guarantees,&quot; the official said.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-wins-no-security-guarantees-from-trump-on-peacekeepers-plan-ft-reports/	2025-02-25T13:08:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201784068.jpg
Taurus missiles, stronger Europe — what can Ukraine hope for after German elections	The victory of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) led by Friedrich Merz was met with relief in Ukraine. The conservative leader has long criticized the supposedly cautious Ukraine strategy of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose government collapsed last November, triggering the snap vote. Merz&apos;s likely coalition with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) is sure to maintain Berlin&apos;s pro-Kyiv trajectory. And with Scholz leading the SPD into the election, saying that he would not take part in the next government, the two dominant parties would have the potential to push Europe to do more for Ukraine. Such a push would be crucial at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump seems to be sidestepping Kyiv&apos;s and Europe&apos;s interests to clinch a swift peace deal with Russia. Underscoring this tectonic geopolitical shift, Merz has used his victory speech to call for Europe&apos;s strategic &quot;independence&quot; from the U.S. &#x2014; a tall order amid the continent&apos;s lagging defense industry, rising populism, and unrelenting Russian threat. The CDU/CSU secured first place in the elections with 28.5% of the vote, almost eight percentage points ahead of the runner-up AfD. Scholz&apos;s SPD, in turn, suffered a historic defeat, coming in third with 16.4% &#x2014; its worst result since the 1880s. The SPD&apos;s former coalition partners fared no better, with the Greens dropping to 11.6% and the centrist Free Democratic Party (FDP) getting booted from the Bundestag. The Left party (Die Linke), which has condemned Russian aggression but opposes military aid to Ukraine, made a surprise comeback with 8.8%, while its Russian-leaning, anti-immigration splinter, the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), failed to hit the 5% parliamentary threshold by a razor-thin margin of 0.03%. Sahra Wagenknecht, party leader of the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), pictured at a press conference in the Haus der Bundespressekonferenz. (Photo by S&#xF6;ren Stache/picture alliance via Getty Images)Overall, despite the far-right surge, the vote ensured that moderate, pro-Ukraine parties now have enough seats to keep the Russian-friendly groups out of government. The conservative leader has already rejected any negotiations with the AfD over its far-right agenda and pro-Moscow stance, aiming instead to hash out a coalition deal with the ostensibly &quot;defeated&quot; SPD by Easter. &quot;The world won&apos;t wait for us, it won&apos;t wait for long, drawn-out coalition negotiations,&quot; Merz said as his party colleagues were celebrating the Sunday victory. The failure of the FDP and the BSW to hit the 5% threshold means a less fractured parliament and allows Merz to seek only a single coalition partner &#x2014; the SPD &#x2014; without entering into more complex three-way talks with the Greens. &quot;A possible triple-coalition would risk a less stable government, and that would, logically, benefit the AfD in the opposition,&quot; said Zuzana Zavadilova, a Germany researcher at the Prague-based Association for International Affairs think tank. Speaking to the Kyiv Independent, the expert said that the decisively pro-Ukraine Greens may play the role of a &quot;constructive opposition,&quot; standing in contrast to the Russian-friendly AfD and Ukraine-skeptic Left. As Scholz has ruled out participating in the CDU/CSU-SPD coalition talks, the question of the next leading figure among the Social Democrats remains. &quot;SPD leader Lars Klingbeil is expected to be elected as the leader of the SPD parliamentary group in the German Bundestag on (Feb. 26). He is already being referred to by many as &apos;the new powerhouse&apos; of the SPD,&quot; said Martin Bialecki, editor-in-chief of the journals Internationale Politik (IP) and Internationale Politik Quarterly (IPQ). &quot;The current defense minister, Boris Pistorius, will also play an important role,&quot; Bialecki predicts, referring to the popular politician under whom Germany stood as Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor. If both Klingbeil and Pistorius &quot;lead the SPD through much-needed reforms while being in government, this could be a net positive for Ukraine as both have been among the most hawkish in support of Kyiv,&quot; Jorn Fleck, senior director with the Europe Center at the Atlantic Council, told the Kyiv Independent. The conservative leader and long-time party rival of ex-Chancellor Angela Merkel has come into the spotlight of Ukraine watchers months before the German elections. Merz has repeatedly lambasted Scholz for his reluctance to provide Ukraine with Taurus missiles, long-range weapons capable of hitting targets 500 kilometers (300 miles) away. However, as Merz&apos;s future chancellorship became evident, the CDU chairman began tempering expectations. According to Fleck, Merz has toned down hawkish stances during his campaign to &quot;avoid alienating eastern German voters.&quot; The politician later clarified that Taurus deliveries must be coordinated with the U.S. and that the step should be taken only after long-range strikes with already provided arms prove insufficient to force Russia to talks. This would imply that the Trump administration&apos;s opposition to strikes inside Russia and its courting of the Kremlin in the name of a quick peace deal might complicate Taurus deliveries. But the events of the past few weeks made Merz, a lifelong Atlanticist, seemingly realize that Europe must forge its own path to ensure security for itself and Ukraine. &quot;My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the U.S.,&quot; Merz laid out his priorities after the elections. &quot;I never thought I would have to say something like this on a television program. But after Donald Trump&apos;s statements last week&#x2026; it is clear that the Americans, at least this part of the Americans, this administration, are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe.&quot; The shock turn came after Trump denounced Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky as a &quot;dictator&quot; and after U.S. Vice President JD Vance delivered a scathing speech against Germany and other European countries during the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15. Amid the uncertainty of the continued U.S. support, &quot;Merz has clearly positioned himself. He does understand that much more is expected of Europe&apos;s largest economy and political power, especially if Washington wavers, or worse,&quot; Fleck said. The chancellor-in-waiting has already launched talks with the SPD on 200 billion euros ($210 billion) in a special defense fund and floated the idea of nuclear sharing with France and the U.K. In light of Trump&apos;s comments, the German politician warned that NATO might not survive in its current form and that Europe should create its own alternative. As Europe is shaping up to be Kyiv&apos;s chief advocate and fears of a possible U.S.-Russia pact grow, Merz has also stressed that Ukraine must be part of any peace talks. But after decades of geopolitical dependence, decoupling from the U.S. is no easy feat. &quot;Even if Europe wants to become &apos;independent&apos; of the U.S., it will take many, many years. Europe has neither the military, nor the economic, nor the technological means to stand on its own two feet,&quot; Bialecki warns. According to Fleck, Merz&apos;s success will depend on three variables: &quot;the economy, his own party&apos;s stance on the debt break, and his junior coalition partner&apos;s disposition.&quot; Yet, not all is sunshine in Berlin. While it was effectively cut off from the government talks, the AfD&apos;s rise in popularity &#x2014; especially in Germany&apos;s east &#x2014; presents a stark warning to Ukraine. Gathering votes on economy and immigration issues, the far-right party has advocated for rapprochement with Russia, criticizing military assistance to Ukraine while calling for the lifting of sanctions and resumption of trade with Moscow. Suspicions that the AfD seeks to strengthen ties with autocracies like Russia and China were only reinforced after several top members came under investigation for collusion with Moscow and Beijing. After Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. election, the AfD gained another ally across the Atlantic. Alice Weidel, co-leader and chancellor candidate of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), speaks to supporters at AfD headquarters after the announcement of initial results in snap federal parliamentary elections on Feb. 23, 2025 in Berlin, Germany. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)The AfD&apos;s cause has been openly promoted by Trump&apos;s top ally, billionaire Elon Musk, who called the far-right party, whose members are suspected of Nazi sympathies, Germany&apos;s &quot;last spark of hope.&quot; And while Trump has congratulated the CDU/CSU on its victory, it was AfD chief Alice Weidel who received Vance in Germany after the U.S. vice president denounced the Munich Security Conference for not inviting Russian-friendly radicals to the event. Merz made clear he sees the AfD-Trump alliance as equally concerning as the far-right party&apos;s sympathies for Russia. &quot;The interventions from Washington were no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interventions we have seen from Moscow,&quot; he said. Holding one-third of the parliament&apos;s seats, the AfD and the Left can still hamper Merz&apos;s efforts to ramp up defense spending. For example, they could block key funding decisions requiring two-thirds of the Bundestag&apos;s votes unless they are quickly adopted by the current outgoing parliament, Zavadilova notes. &quot;Clearly, the strength of the AfD, the Left, and the BSW should be a concern of all democrats. All three parrot Russian talking points and have at their core anti-American and anti-EU sentiments,&quot; Fleck said. &quot;Here, Merz and the next leadership will finally have to engage the German public in a frank conversation about what is at stake in Ukraine and in Europe.&quot; Hi, this is Martin Fornusek.

Ukraine war latest: Ukraine, US reach agreement on minerals deal	Key developments on Feb. 25: Ukraine has reached an agreement with the U.S. on a minerals deal, Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine&#x2019;s deputy prime minister and justice minister, told the Financial Times on Feb. 25. President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s office confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that an agreement has been reached. The negotiations around the deal have fueled tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and Zelensky in the past week. According to the Financial Times report, Ukraine has secured more favorable terms and framed the deal as a way to strengthen ties with the U.S. Zelensky is expected to head to Washington for a signing ceremony in the coming weeks, according to the Financial Times. The final version of the agreement, dated Feb. 24, establishes a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and related logistics. The fund will invest in projects within Ukraine. The deal excludes resources that already contribute to Ukraine&apos;s state budget, meaning it will not cover operations by Naftogaz and Ukrnafta, the country&apos;s largest oil and gas producers. The agreement does not include security guarantees from the U.S., which Kyiv had initially insisted on. The latest draft of the agreement drops earlier U.S. demands for a $500 billion claim over Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources, which had been a major sticking point, according to the Ukrainian media outlet Economic Pravda, which has seen the agreement. Under the revised terms, the fund will receive 50% of revenues from Ukraine&#x2019;s resource-related infrastructure, including ports. Joint ownership will be determined based on actual financial contributions, and while management will be shared, the U.S. will have decision-making authority under its own laws.The questions of the U.S. stake in the fund and the terms of &#x201C;joint ownership&#x201D; will be addressed in follow-up agreements, according to the Financial Times. Zelensky had previously rejected the U.S. proposal, citing the lack of security guarantees and objecting to the 1:2 repayment structure, which would have required Ukraine to return two dollars for every one received in aid. The Trump administration has increased pressure on Ukraine to finalize the deal in the past weeks, with Trump publicly attacking Zelensky, calling him a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; and urging him to &quot;move fast, or he won&#x2019;t have a country left.&quot; Trump has framed the agreement as a way to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s economy while ensuring the U.S. &quot;recoups the tens of billions of dollars and military equipment sent to Ukraine.&quot; Russia&apos;s stated goals in its war against Ukraine remain unachieved despite ongoing diplomatic efforts to start peace negotiations, Russian Foreign Ministry&apos;s Ambassador-at-Large Rodion Miroshnik said on Feb. 25, according to the Russian state-owned news agency TASS. &quot;The objectives of the Special Military Operation have not yet been achieved,&quot; Miroshnik said, using the Kremlin&apos;s term for its war against Ukraine. The objectives include Russia&apos;s failure to fully occupy Ukraine&apos;s four regions it has illegally annexed and the need to ensure Kyiv no longer &quot;poses a threat&quot; to Moscow. &quot;The constitutional territories of Russia have not been liberated,&quot; he said. Russia illegally annexed Ukraine&apos;s Crimea in 2014, followed by Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts in 2022. Moscow does not control all of these territories, including the regional capitals of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded Ukraine withdraw from all four oblasts as a condition for negotiations. Miroshnik said that while military objectives remain unachieved, Russia may attempt to achieve them through future negotiations. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Feb. 24 that Moscow would agree to a ceasefire only if negotiations yield a &quot;sustainable result&quot; that &quot;suits&quot; Russia. The U.S. held direct talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, excluding Ukraine from the meeting. The decision sparked criticism in Kyiv and Europe, with leaders concerned about being sidelined in negotiations. Preparations are underway for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin, with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov saying it could happen by the end of February. Trump said on Feb. 24 that Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine could end &quot;within weeks&quot; and claimed Putin would accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a potential deal. The U.K. is reportedly preparing a plan to deploy 30,000 European troops as a post-ceasefire security guarantee. Western intelligence officials have expressed skepticism about Moscow&apos;s willingness to negotiate in good faith. NBC News reported on Feb. 18 that Putin is not serious about a peace deal and is instead using talks to consolidate Russian territorial gains. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 24 that he believes Ukraine might be able to reclaim some of its territories occupied by Russia, but it would be challenging. He stated this in response to journalists during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, which took place at the White House. &quot;You&#x2019;re asking whether or not they (Ukrainians) could take back the land that they lost. And I say that yes, perhaps some of it, yes. But that&#x2019;s not an easy thing to do,&#x201D; Trump said. He also noted that this question is part of the current negotiations that have recently started with Russia. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll see,&#x201D; Trump said. &#x201C;There has been a lot of land that has been taken, so we will have to see how it works out. It&#x2019;s part of the negotiation.&#x201D; The U.S. held the first round of talks directly with Russia on Feb. 18, excluding Ukraine from the meeting. The decision sparked a backlash in Europe and Ukraine, with European leaders worried they were being sidelined by the U.S. Macron has recently rallied European counterparts to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to visit Washington later this week to meet with Trump. The cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine after three years of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion will be $524 billion over the next decade, the U.N. reported on Feb. 25, citing data from Ukraine&apos;s government, the World Bank, the European Commission, and the U.N. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russia has been attacking Ukrainian cities and villages daily, destroying residential buildings, critical infrastructure, cultural heritage sites, and sports venues, among other facilities. The required reconstruction costs are 2.8 times higher than Ukraine&apos;s nominal GDP for 2024, according to the report. Direct losses in Ukraine reached $176 billion at the end of December 2024 compared to $152 billion in February last year, the Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDNA4) by the World Bank estimated. Housing, transportation, energy, trade and industry, and education sectors have suffered the most from Russian attacks, the report read. Some 13% of Ukraine&apos;s total housing stock was damaged or destroyed, affecting over 2.5 million homes. In the energy sector, the number of damaged or destroyed assets, including production, transmission, distribution, and district heating infrastructure, increased by 70%. Donetsk, Kharkiv, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, and Kyiv oblasts sustained nearly 72% of the total damage. Russia&#x2019;s Ryazan oil refinery suspended operations after a Ukrainian drone attack set its main crude distillation unit, CDU-6, on fire, Reuters reported on Feb. 24. The refinery, owned by Russia&apos;s state energy company Rosneft, halted oil processing entirely, multiple industry sources told Reuters. However, it may partially resume operations within days by using CDU-4 and CDU-3 units, while CDU-6 is repaired. The attack caused at least five explosions, with local authorities attributing the fire to falling drone debris. This refinery had only recently resumed activity on Feb. 11 following an 18-day shutdown after a previous attack. This is the third time since the beginning of 2025 that drones have attacked the Ryazan Oil Refinery, according to the independent Telegram channel Astra. The Ryazan Oil Refinery is one of Russia&apos;s five largest oil refining facilities, according to Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation. Its capacity is 17.1 million metric tons of oil per year. Kovalenko added that the fuel produced at the enterprise is used by the Russian army&apos;s strategic long-range aviation, which launches missile strikes against Ukraine.

Russia targets Ukraine’s supply lines in Kursk as both cling to gains ahead of peace talks	Russian forces have ramped up attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s logistic networks in Kursk Oblast, further hampering the Ukrainian effort to hold on to the Russian territory it controls ahead of potential peace talks, analysts and soldiers on the ground told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;The Russians have been on the offensive in Kursk for several months,&#x201D; said Emil Kastehelmi, a Finnish military analyst from the Black Bird Group open-source intelligence collective. &#x201C;They have made only slow progress in the winter of 2024-25, but they seem to be determined,&#x201D; he added. While Russia has already rejected the possibility of trading its territory for occupied Ukrainian land, pledging to take the land back by military force, Ukraine continues to see its gains in Kursk Oblast as a bargaining chip in future negotiations. Since launching an incursion into the Russian region in early August, Ukraine has lost around two-thirds of the territory it initially captured but continues to control the remainder. Russia&#x2019;s six-month campaign to push Ukrainian soldiers out of Kursk Oblast, involving around 12,000 North Korean soldiers alongside Russian troops, has proved costly for Moscow. But with hampered logistics and in light of Washington&#x2019;s startling alignment with Russia ahead of talks, Ukraine may soon face difficult strategic decisions in the area. Russia&#x2019;s recent attacks in Kursk Oblast are focused on cutting off the only route Ukrainians use for resupply from the adjacent Sumy Oblast in northeastern Ukraine. On the left flank of the Ukraine-controlled salient in Kursk Oblast, Russia launches frequent mechanized assaults that are even more intense than Russian attacks in Pokrovsk, one of the hottest ongoing fights in Ukraine&#x2019;s east, Ruslan Mykula, a military analyst and co-founder of the DeepState OSINT project, said. Mechanized attacks &#x2014; where armored vehicles are used to quickly break through defenses, clearing the way for infantry groups to storm trenches &#x2014; helped Russia capture the village of Sverdlikovo northwest of Ukrainian-controlled Sudzha last week, Mykula told the Kyiv Independent. It brought the Russians &#x201C;uncomfortably close&#x201D; to key Ukrainian logistical routes, Kastehelmi said. &#x201C;There are now less than eight kilometers to the main supply road to Sudzha, which is already in range of Russian drones,&#x201D; he said, adding the complete cut-off of the route is &#x201C;unlikely to happen very quickly.&#x201D; The DeepState monitoring group map shows the Ukrainian gains in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast as of Feb. 25, 2025. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)A Ukrainian artilleryman who has been fighting near Sudzha since August told the Kyiv Independent that the supply situation had deteriorated during the last two weeks. &#x201C;(Logistics) are non-existent,&#x201D; said the soldier going by the callsign &#x201C;Spys.&#x201D; The Kyiv Independent doesn&apos;t use his first and last name for security reasons. &#x201C;The biggest losses of equipment are on the road (between Sumy Oblast and Ukraine&#x2019;s positions in Kursk Oblast),&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;We started rationing (our supplies).&#x201D; Russian forces deployed an elite drone unit that &#x201C;controls the road 24/7 and flies deep into the rear of Ukrainian territory,&#x201D; according to &#x201C;Spys.&#x201D; To be able to use this road, Ukrainian forces have to wait for weather conditions that are unsuitable for drone missions, such as heavy fog or snow. Ukraine has launched several offensive operations in Kursk Oblast after the initial push in August but has only made limited gains. &#x201C;(Russian troops) have a huge advantage in manpower and don&#x2019;t have such problems with logistics, so Ukrainian offensives usually don&#x2019;t end well,&#x201D; Mykula said. However, before Russia captured Sverdlikovo which allowed the ramping up of attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s logistics, Ukrainian forces managed to fend off Russian attacks on the right flank of the salient and retake their positions after an assault made by North Korean infantry last month, &#x201C;Spys&#x201D; said. &#x201C;(North Koreans were) gaining ground due to the fact that there were so many of them that they simply couldn&#x2019;t (all) be physically killed,&#x201D; Mykula said. Ukrainians still hold the village of Cherkasskaya Konopelka southeast of Sudzha, which they took earlier this month to secure the logistics road on the right flank, despite ongoing Russian assaults. For weeks, &#x201D;Spys&#x201D; says he has not seen North Korean troops in his sector. Of nearly 12,000 North Korean soldiers deployed in Kursk Oblast, 4,000 were killed and wounded, President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on Feb. 14. About two-thirds of the 4,000 were killed, according to Zelensky. Zelensky also claimed that in total, Moscow has lost nearly 20,000 of its soldiers in the battles for Kursk Oblast. Exhausting Russia&#x2019;s &#x201C;human and logistical resources&#x201D; is one of the key Ukrainian objectives in the area, according to Mykula. Bringing some of the fiercest battles to Russian soil also means less destruction for Sumy Oblast villages bordering Russia, and losing ground in Kursk is better for Ukraine than losing its own territories to Russia elsewhere along the front line, experts said. &#x201C;The Kursk operation costs Ukraine a lot, of course, but it costs (Russia) way more,&#x201D; Mykula added.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-targets-ukraines-supply-lines-in-kursk-as-both-cling-to-gains-ahead-of-peace-talks/	2025-02-25T12:07:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168599341.jpg
‘Don’t try to build a whole new drone:’ How one Ukrainian wartime startup got into quantum encryption — and the West	One Ukrainian startup has rebuilt the humble walkie-talkie to weather the waves of modern electronic war with Russia. With thousands of Ukrainian soldiers already using their handheld comms devices, NATO is tuning in. Himera, the walkie-talkie startup in question is about to get a new layer of encryption that founder Misha Rudominsky says will guard their devices against the impending arrival of quantum computing on the battlefield &#x2014; a technological threat that is rattling wartime communications experts worldwide. More immediately, $1.2 million in fundraising, active EU manufacturing, U.S. Air Force testing, and a distribution deal with a Canadian firm are putting Himera on the threshold of selling to NATO and the U.S. Defense Department itself. Himera is one of Ukraine&#x2019;s first startups born in response to Russia&#x2019;s 2022 invasion to get a shot with the broader world&#x2019;s biggest armies. Himera grew out of Rudominsky&#x2019;s earlier project, Promin Aerospace &#x2014; like so many Ukrainian startups, a drone company. It&#x2019;s a market that Rudominsky found saturated, saying, &#x201C;There are a hundred companies in every niche who have tried everything,&#x201D; and advising anyone with startup aspirations not &#x201C;to build a whole new drone.&#x201D; Battlefield communications were, he found, a wide-open area for advancement. Ukrainian soldiers have largely depended on cheap Motorola walkie-talkies never meant to function in battle. By targeting that market, Rudominsky and his team have sold something like 6,000 of their G1 and G1 Pro models to Ukrainian units. They are not feats of physical engineering &#x2014; their components are off-the-shelf products that are easy to find within Ukraine or at other workshops in the European Union. But the software is resilient, Rudominsky says. The hand units link up to mobile phones, allowing encrypted texting and exchange of battlefield planning through apps via radio rather than depending on cell service or Starlink satellites. The complete set-up boasts coveted Ukrainian battlefield testing. The real inventiveness was in going small &#x2014; cheap tactical handhelds that operate on low radio frequencies and tiny electrical charges that slip by Russian sensors and jammers. A new algorithm securing communications between Himera&#x2019;s devices, says Jay Toth, a representative for Canadian encryption startup Quantropi, will also minimize both required computing power and battery consumption. &#x201C;Radio communication, satellite, and video are the three really important data streams on the modern battlefield and we&apos;ve got a pathway to help with the encryption and security on each one,&#x201D; Toth told the Kyiv Independent. A Ukrainian soldier uses a Himera walkie-talkie, a secure communication device designed to withstand modern electronic warfare. (Facebook/Himera)In February, Himera announced a deal with Quantropi to put the Ottawa-based startup&#x2019;s quantum-prepped encryption algorithms into their systems. Like top-secret encryption among the U.S. government and elsewhere worldwide, Himera currently uses Advanced Encryption Standard 256, or AES 256 &#x2014; for decades the gold standard but now under threat from quantum computing. Quantum computing is forcing cryptographers to reconsider how safe their communications are. In August, the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology released new algorithms that jolted cryptographers with a warning to prepare for &#x201C;quantum computers that would operate in radically different ways from ordinary computers and could break the current encryption that provides security and privacy for just about everything we do online.&#x201D; Toth says Quantropi&#x2019;s default encryption keys are four times the size of AES-256&#x2019;s, but thanks to different math it runs between &#x201C;10&#x2013;14 times faster.&#x201D; The G1 Pros will, however, still have AES-256 as an option so they can link up with non-Himera devices. Specifically, says Rudominsky, this matters as more and more of their radio repeaters &#x2014; larger less mobile units that handle more data &#x2014; head out to market. These bigger terminals are prime targets for the &#x201C;record now, decode later,&#x201D; in which cyber powers are gathering data encrypted with AES-256 assuming that they&#x2019;ll be able to break it in a matter of years. &#x201C;At some point, we&apos;ll have quantum computers,&#x201D; says Rudominsky. &#x201C;Is it going to be in five years, 10, or 15 years? We don&apos;t really know. But what everyone is betting on &#x2014; what the Chinese are betting on, what the Americans are betting on, I don&apos;t know if the Russians are betting on it yet, but if you have enough capacity as a country to record a lot of information, you can break into some database, you might not be able to decode it, but you can at least record the encrypted information.&#x201D; Toth said Himera immediately catches the eye of representatives of upwards of half a dozen NATO militaries he has spoken to. As one of the 17 firms in NATO&#x2019;s DIANA defense tech accelerator, Quantropi is also getting in on a distribution deal to sell the walkie-talkies Himera is building in the EU to NATO countries. And conversely, Himera is helping Quantropi fulfill its pitch to get its technology on the battlefield. &#x201C;What we proposed that got us into the program was using our encryption on these small, resource-constrained devices in the battlefield,&#x201D; Toth explains. &#x201C;It wasn&apos;t any more specific than that when we made the pitch.&#x201D; A Himera walkie-talkie is a secure communication device designed to withstand modern electronic warfare. (Facebook/Himera)Pentagonal motionHimera is consequently coming close to the prized market of the U.S. Defense Department. The U.S. Air Force&#x2019;s Research Lab is currently testing out Himera&#x2019;s radios, says Toth, who estimates that a report on the lab&#x2019;s findings will go out in about a month. &#x201C;We&apos;ve been told anecdotally that everything is going to be very positive,&#x201D; he continued. &#x201C;The price point of a G1Pro is at a minimum five to ten times less expensive than most tactical radios on the market today,&#x201D; says Toth. &#x201C;Every NATO nation I&#x2019;ve talked to, every NATO Defense Ministry I&#x2019;ve talked to did a double-take when I told them what the price point was and said &#x2018;Yes, follow up, I&#x2019;m sending this to my people.&#x2019;&#x201D; Rudominsky similarly foresees a major market among less wealthy militaries in, especially, southeast Asia facing a technologically savvy and increasingly belligerent China. The U.S. Defense Department in contrast pays tens of thousands of dollars for individual military-grade walkie-talkies from brands like L3Harris. Rudominsky notes that the U.S. radio giant formally launched its Falcon IV model six years ago but hasn&#x2019;t released a more compact screen-less version ready for soldiers, despite teasing it. For comparison, he says, &#x201C;In less than three years, we&#x2019;ve already launched and sunset our first product.&#x201D; &#x201C;A lot of those companies are lacking in innovation,&#x201D; says Rudominsky. &#x201C;They used to be the most advanced products &#x2014; 10 years ago, I would say at that point, they probably were at the top of what could be done. But then everyone slowed down.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/dont-try-to-build-a-whole-new-drone-how-one-ukrainian-wartime-start-up-got-into-quantum-encryption-and-the-west/	2025-02-25T11:38:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/476273235_612638458372403_1180523204137655883_n.jpg
Russia's war objectives 'not yet achieved,' Kremlin's ambassador says	Russia&apos;s stated goals in its war against Ukraine remain unachieved despite ongoing diplomatic efforts to start peace negotiations, Russian Foreign Ministry&apos;s Ambassador-at-Large Rodion Miroshnik said on Feb. 25, according to the Russian state-owned news agency TASS. &quot;The objectives of the Special Military Operation have not yet been achieved,&quot; Miroshnik said, using the Kremlin&apos;s term for its war against Ukraine. The objectives include Russia&apos;s failure to fully occupy Ukraine&apos;s four regions it has illegally annexed and the need to ensure Kyiv no longer &quot;poses a threat&quot; to Moscow. &quot;The constitutional territories of Russia have not been liberated,&quot; he said. Russia illegally annexed Ukraine&apos;s Crimea in 2014, followed by Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts in 2022. Moscow does not control all of these territories, including the regional capitals of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded Ukraine withdraw from all four oblasts as a condition for negotiations. Miroshnik said that while military objectives remain unachieved, Russia may attempt to achieve them through future negotiations. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Feb. 24 that Moscow would agree to a ceasefire only if negotiations yield a &quot;sustainable result&quot; that &quot;suits&quot; Russia. The U.S. held direct talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, excluding Ukraine from the meeting. The decision sparked criticism in Kyiv and Europe, with leaders concerned about being sidelined in negotiations. Preparations are underway for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin, with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov saying it could happen by the end of February. Trump said on Feb. 24 that Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine could end &quot;within weeks&quot; and claimed Putin would accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a potential deal. The U.K. is reportedly preparing a plan to deploy 30,000 European troops as a post-ceasefire security guarantee. Western intelligence officials have expressed skepticism about Moscow&apos;s willingness to negotiate in good faith. NBC News reported on Feb. 18 that Putin is not serious about a peace deal and is instead using talks to consolidate Russian territorial gains.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-war-objectives-not-yet-achieved-ambassador-says/	2025-02-25T11:35:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-835906084.jpg
BREAKING: Kyiv, Washington reach agreement on minerals deal	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story. Ukraine has reached an agreement with the U.S. on a minerals deal, Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine&#x2019;s deputy prime minister and justice minister, told the Financial Times on Feb. 25. President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s office confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that an agreement has been reached. The negotiations around the deal have fueled tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and Zelensky in the past week. According to the Financial Times report, Ukraine has secured more favorable terms and framed the deal as a way to strengthen ties with the U.S. Zelensky is expected to head to Washington for a signing ceremony in the coming weeks, according to the Financial Times. The final version of the agreement, dated Feb. 24, establishes a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and related logistics. The fund will invest in projects within Ukraine. The deal excludes resources that already contribute to Ukraine&apos;s state budget, meaning it will not cover operations by Naftogaz and Ukrnafta, the country&apos;s largest oil and gas producers. The agreement does not include security guarantees from the U.S., which Kyiv had initially insisted on.	https://kyivindependent.com/breaking-kyiv-washington-reach-agreement-on-minerals-deal/	2025-02-25T11:19:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179841418.jpg
Hungary seeks removal of eight names from EU Russia sanctions list, Reuters reports	Hungary is demanding the removal of eight individuals from the EU&apos;s Russia sanctions list and guarantees on Ukraine&apos;s gas transit talks before agreeing to renew restrictions, Reuters reported on Feb. 25, citing sources familiar with the matter. EU sanctions against Russia must be renewed unanimously every six months, and Budapest has repeatedly used the process to negotiate concessions for itself. Hungary has previously secured exemptions for Moscow Patriarch Kirill and domestic use of Russian oil products. Kirill, a close Kremlin ally, has publicly supported Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, yet Budapest has blocked EU efforts to sanction him. The source declined to disclose the names of the individuals Hungary wants removed from the sanctions list. Earlier on Feb. 19, EU ambassadors agreed on a new package of sanctions, targeting Russia&apos;s aluminum trade and the &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of oil tankers. The EU&apos;s sanctions framework consists of economic measures and a list of over 2,400 individuals and entities subject to asset freezes and travel bans. Hungary&apos;s demand to hold gas transit talks with Ukraine is related to Kyiv&apos;s decision to not extend an agreement with Russia, which ensured a gas transit to Europe. As the agreement expired on Jan. 1, Kyiv said it would not finance Russia&apos;s war by allowing the transit going forward. While the EU has reduced reliance on Russian fossil fuels, Hungary and Slovakia remain dependent on Russian gas. Budapest imports around 4.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas annually under a 15-year agreement signed in 2021. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has maintained close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin despite the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, meeting with him and amplifying pro-Russian narratives in Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-seeks-removal-of-eight-names-from-eu-russia-sanctions-list-reuters-reports/	2025-02-25T10:46:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1239783290.jpg
Explainer: Did Trump lie about $350 billion aid to Ukraine, and does Kyiv have to repay it?	U.S. President Donald Trump has claimed that the U.S. spent $350 billion on assistance for Ukraine. He also said he wants it back. Trump has used the sum to pressure Ukraine into signing a deal that would give the U.S. at least a 50% interest in Ukrainian natural resources through a joint investment fund as payback for its support for Kyiv. According to media reports and President Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine would be supposed to gradually contribute $500 billion from its budget revenues from mineral resources to the fund. Ukraine had declined to sign Trump&apos;s version of the deal, with Zelensky saying, &quot;I am not signing something that will be paid by 10 generations of Ukrainians.&quot; The caveat is that both the $350 billion mentioned by Trump as aid provided and the $500 billion demanded in return are not factual and were presented by the White House without explaining where the figures are from. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, the U.S. has provided assistance worth $119.8 billion since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Only around $4 billion has to be repaid, and the repayment deadline is as late as 2065, according to prior agreements. The Kyiv Independent provides a detailed breakdown of the aid provided, how it was measured, and what has happened to it since. The $350 billion aid claim was made by Trump at a news conference on Feb. 19. The statement was immediately contradicted by the Pentagon. The Voice of America reported on Feb. 19, citing the Pentagon and the U.S. government&apos;s Ukraine Oversight interagency group, that the U.S. Congress had appropriated $183 billion for Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. This figure includes $65.9 billion in military aid that has already been sent to Ukraine and an additional $3.9 billion that remains unspent, according to the Pentagon. Zelensky made another claim at a news conference on Feb. 23, saying that the U.S. had allocated just around $100 billion for Ukraine during the full-scale invasion, including $67 billion in military aid and $31.5 billion in financial aid.

(Mustafa Yalcin / Anadolu / Getty Images)What are the facts?Facts confirm that Zelensky&apos;s claim was the closest to the truth. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy&apos;s Ukraine Support Tracker, the U.S. has allocated $119.8 billion for Ukraine during the full-scale war, including $67.1 billion in military aid, $49 billion in financial aid, and $3.6 billion in humanitarian aid. The discrepancy between the Kiel Institute&apos;s figure and the Pentagon&apos;s one is due to the fact that the Pentagon included some Ukraine-related allocations that were not actually sent to Ukraine. Specifically, about $58 billion of the $183 billion in total aid was spent on the U.S. defense industry and did not go to Ukraine. Some of this money was allocated to replace old U.S. weapons given to Kyiv with new U.S.-made weapons. Zelensky said on Feb. 23 that U.S. aid given to Ukraine cannot be counted as debt since it was disbursed in the form of grants. Taras Shchepel, a Ukrainian lawyer who has studied the legal aspects of U.S. aid, and Oleksandr Parashchiy, an analyst at Ukrainian investment bank Concorde Capital, told the Kyiv Independent that the entire military assistance given to Ukraine by the U.S. was in the form of grants and does not have to be repaid. In contrast with military aid, a small share of the financial assistance has been provided in the form of loans. Olena Bilan, chief economist at Ukrainian investment bank Dragon Capital, told the Kyiv Independent that U.S. financial aid to Ukraine includes $32 billion in the form of grants that don&apos;t have to be repaid and loans worth $4 billion. The $4 billion in loans has to be repaid in 2065 but the U.S. president has the authority to write off this debt before Jan. 1, 2026, she said. Additionally, the U.S. has disbursed a $20 billion loan as part of a G7 initiative, according to the Ukraine Oversight Group. However, Ukraine doesn&apos;t have to repay it because this money will be repaid by proceeds from $300 billion in frozen Russian assets. So far, Ukraine has actually received only $1 billion of the $20 billion loan allocated by the U.S., according to Parashchiy and Bilan.	https://kyivindependent.com/explainer-did-trump-lie-about-350-billion-aid-to-ukraine-and-does-kyiv-have-to-repay-it/	2025-02-25T10:42:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/1_GettyImages-2195744586.jpg
Ukraine approves Vidmak drone system to target Russian vehicles	Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry has authorized a new high-speed FPV (first-person view) drone, called Vidmak (Witcher), designed to intercept and destroy Russian vehicles, the ministry announced on Feb. 25. &quot;These high-speed FPV drones are capable of chasing down any wheeled vehicles of the invaders,&quot; the ministry wrote. The Vidmak is manufactured by a Ukrainian enterprise. The compact yet powerful drones can operate day and night, identifying and tracking targets. &quot;The complex was created taking into account the combat experience of our soldiers. Most of the components are domestically produced,&quot; the statement reads. Its high-speed maneuverability allows it to chase down any wheeled Russian vehicle, while its payload is strong enough to destroy armored targets and fortified positions. Kyiv has significantly expanded domestic drone production over the past year, integrating drones into reconnaissance and combat operations. On Feb. 9, the Defense Ministry launched the &quot;Drone Line&quot; initiative to accelerate their deployment on the battlefield. Ukraine has also developed long-range missile-drone hybrids, such as the Palianytsia and Peklo models, featuring turbojet engines as alternatives to cruise missiles. President Volodymyr Zelensky has set a target of producing at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025. The Peklo hybrid drone, described by Zelensky as a &quot;fundamentally new type&quot; of weapon, has a range of 700 kilometers (430 miles) and a top speed of 700 km/h (430 mph).	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-approves-vidmak-drone-system-to-target-russian-vehicles/	2025-02-25T10:16:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-25_14-38-37-2.jpg
What we know about the US, Ukraine minerals deal	The media cycle around a natural resources deal between Washington and Kyiv has been nonstop as the two sides lock horns over an agreement that has escalated from speculative critical minerals to Ukraine&#x2019;s fruitful oil and gas sector.The relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine has been tense since negotiations began at the start of the month. The U.S. has reportedly put forth three proposals, of which the first two have been turned down by the Ukrainian side for not including security agreements, even as Washington ramped up the pressure. As of Feb. 25, the two sides are currently hashing out the final details of the agreement. U.S. President Donald Trump said he will meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky &#x201C;very soon&#x201D; to sign it. But as no details of the agreement have been officially released, the public has had to rely on a whirlwind of leaked information and drafts of the deal to get a sense of what&#x2019;s at stake for Ukraine. Trump first said he wanted to make a deal back on Feb. 3 and a proposal was presented to Zelensky by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Feb. 12. Although the U.S. was keen to get the deal over and done with, Zelensky refused to sign over the lack of security guarantees, leading to an arduous back and forth for the last two weeks. &#xA0;An apparent second proposal dated Feb. 21 that was leaked by Axios correspondent Barak Ravid, set out plans for a U.S.-owned &#x201C;Reconstruction Investment Fund&#x201D; that would require Ukraine to transfer 50% of future profits from its natural resources, including oil and gas, and infrastructure like ports. Around the same time, Ukrainian media outlet New Voice on Feb. 22 reported, citing five sources close to the deal, that the second proposal was &#x201C;much stricter&#x201D; than the first one. In it, Washington would maintain 100% ownership of the fund, while Kyiv would have to contribute $500 billion to the fund as repayment for American aid to Ukraine. Again, no security guarantees were mentioned in the deal. President Volodymyr Zelensky slammed the fund&#x2019;s value, saying U.S. aid had totaled less than $100 billion. He told a conference in Kyiv on Feb. 23 that he wouldn&#x2019;t sign &#x201C;something that will be paid by 10 generations of Ukrainians,&#x201D; particularly without security guarantees. The half-a-trillion-dollar demand is more than twice Ukraine&#x2019;s pre-war GDP. He also took aim at the proposal&#x2019;s stipulation that the Ukrainian government should provide double the money given by the U.S. once the agreement is signed. &#x200B;&#x200B;&#x201C;For every U.S. dollar, Ukraine must return two. In simple terms, this is 100% of the loan,&#x201D; Zelensky said.The proposals so far have ultimately given the White House as much control over Ukraine&#x2019;s main sources of revenue as the Ukrainian government. In addition, the U.S. could earn more than 50% of revenue from assets in the occupied territories if they are liberated, Ukrainian media outlet Ekonomichna Pravda reported on Feb. 22.Since the latest leaked draft, the agreement has changed, with the U.S. dropping the $500 billion request &#x2014; although creating a fund is still on the table, Bloomberg reported citing sources close to the deal. The details will be ironed out after the agreement is signed, according to Bloomberg. Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, backed the latest version, saying that &#x201C;it&#x2019;s better than it was&#x201D; while speaking at the YES conference in Kyiv on Feb. 24.&#x201C;There will not be a penny incurred to that fund unless there is a free sovereign Ukraine. It says the profits will be reinvested at least annually. Ukrainians have negotiated it very, very well,&#x201D; he added. Johnson, a Trump supporter, encouraged Ukraine to sign the deal quickly while acknowledging that &#x201C;it doesn&#x2019;t go far enough on security.&#x201D; Nonetheless, he believes it&#x2019;s still a &#x201C;prospect of progress for Ukraine.&#x201D;Bessent has framed the deal as an economic boost for Ukraine that will incentivize foreign investment. In an op-ed for the Financial Times on Feb. 22, he said the fund would be used for &#xA0;&#x201C;the long-term reconstruction and development of Ukraine where the U.S. will have economic and governance rights in those future investments.&#x201D;During an interview with Fox News Sunday Morning Features on Feb. 23, Bessent said that the first part of the deal is a U.S.-Ukraine partnership for &#x201C;strategic minerals, energy, and state-owned enterprises.&#x201D; He added that Washington is offering an &#x201C;economic security guarantee,&#x201D; rather than meeting Kyiv&#x2019;s demands for a military assurance. The draft dated Feb. 21 stated that the U.S. wants to invest &#x201C;in a free, sovereign, and secure Ukraine&#x201D; and &#x201C;a lasting peace.&#x201D; While it made no mention of military guarantees, it said that the U.S. will work with Ukraine to &#x201C;identify any necessary steps to protect mutual investments.&#x201D; What was once Ukraine&#x2019;s attempt to win over President Trump has descended into a ruthless battle that risks Kyiv giving up its natural resources in return for very little. Kyiv first presented its natural resources, including critical minerals, to Senator Lindsey Graham in September 2024, but Ukraine delayed the deal until Trump&#x2019;s election in order to appeal to the president&#x2019;s business nature. Trump zeroed in on Ukraine&#x2019;s &#x201C;rare earths,&#x201D; although he likely meant critical minerals as Ukraine only has small deposits of rare earths, at the start of February. He said the minerals would be in exchange for American aid, claiming that Kyiv was ready to make a deal. Ukraine claims to have $12 trillion worth of minerals, including 22 types listed by the EU as &#x2018;critical,&#x2019; like titanium and lithium. In reality, the number is based on old Soviet-era estimations and Ukraine would need to carry out geological surveys to get a more accurate figure. Mineral deposits are also a state secret, despite calls to make them public. The Trump administration seemed aware that minerals may be a gamble. The first proposal presented by Bessent on Feb. 12, expanded its list of demands to include all natural resources. Zelenskly turned down the deal, stressing the need for security guarantees. Over the following days, the media leaked the details of the proposal sending shockwaves through Ukraine. Critics labeled the deal as &#x201C;colonial&#x201D; over its ask for 50% interest in resources and state-owned companies, including in the oil and gas sector. It also stated that &#x201C;for all future licenses, the U.S. will have the priority right to purchase exported minerals.&#x201D;Ukraine handed over its own proposal on Feb. 14 during a meeting with their American counterparts at the Munich Security Conference. The next day Zelensky said he wouldn&#x2019;t sign the agreement as it was &#x201C;not ready&#x201D; to protect Ukrainian interests. Over the following days, the U.S. ramped up its rhetoric. Trump labeled Zelensky &quot;a dictator&quot;and the White House was reportedly considering shutting off Starlink satellite terminals, which are critical for soldiers on the front line, unless Kyiv signed the agreement. This was later refuted by Starlink owner, billionaire Elon Musk. The White House sent Ukraine another version of the deal on the eve of Feb. 20, which then led to a lengthy overnight negotiation between Ukrainian and American officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/what-we-know-about-the-current-us-ukraine-minerals-deal/	2025-02-25T09:19:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199117207.jpg
1 killed, 14 injured in Russian attack on Kramatorsk	Russian forces attacked the city of Kramatorsk in Donetsk Oblast on Feb. 25, killing one person and injuring at least 14, including four children, Ukraine&apos;s National Police reported.

Rescue operations are ongoing. &quot;We are identifying all the circumstances of the attack, the exact number of victims, and the extent of the damage,&quot; Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Kramatorsk, located about 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of the front line, remains a frequent target as Russian forces continue their offensive in the region. Russian artillery and airstrikes on settlements in Donetsk Oblast occur daily, often resulting in civilian casualties.	https://kyivindependent.com/1-killed-14-injured-in-russian-attack-on-kramatorsk/	2025-02-25T08:25:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-25_18-17-32-1.jpg
Poland pledges $210 million in new military aid for Ukraine	Poland is preparing its 46th military aid package for Ukraine worth 200 million euros ($210 million), Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said on Feb. 25, according to the Polish media outlet Interia. &quot;This is the forty-sixth contribution, and we will continue to help,&quot; Kosiniak-Kamysz said. Poland has been a key ally of Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, providing extensive military aid, including tanks, heavy equipment, and ammunition. The announcement comes amid the uncertainty of future aid from the U.S., which has been Ukraine&apos;s biggest supporter since 2022. Kosiniak-Kamysz didn&apos;t share what capabilities Poland&apos;s new military aid package will include aside from training. &quot;We will train the Ukrainian military,&quot; the minister said. &quot;Out of 80-90,000 soldiers trained by the EU countries, Poland has trained about a third &#x2014; 28,000 soldiers.&quot; Poland has delivered 45 military aid packages to Ukraine since 2022, totaling over $4 billion, according to former Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland Vasyl Zvarych. Despite Warsaw&apos;s ongoing support, Ukraine-Poland bilateral relations have been strained by trade disputes and historical grievances. Public support for military assistance to Ukraine in Poland has declined, with a Mieroszewski Center poll showing a drop from 54% to 49% throughout 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-pledges-210-million-in-new-military-aid-for-ukraine-defense-minister-says/	2025-02-25T08:09:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2079424446.jpg
US opposed Ukraine's UN resolution to avoid 'antagonizing' Russia, Rubio says	Washington voted against a UN resolution condemning Russian aggression against Ukraine because it contradicted U.S. efforts to bring both sides to the negotiating table, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Breitbart News on Feb. 24. &quot;We didn&apos;t feel it was conducive, frankly, to have something out there at the UN that&#x2019;s antagonistic to either side,&quot; Rubio said. He defended a separate U.S.-led resolution that avoided blaming Russia directly, calling it &quot;very fair language&quot; that states that &quot;war is a terrible thing.&quot; Rubio&apos;s comments come after the UN General Assembly vote on Kyiv&apos;s resolution on Feb. 24, the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, with 93 countries voting in favor and 18 against. The resolution, drafted by Kyiv and supported by all EU states except Hungary, reaffirms Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity and explicitly names Russia as the aggressor. The U.S., Israel, Hungary, Russia, and Belarus voted against it. On the same day, the UN Security Council passed a U.S.-drafted resolution, which calls for a swift end to the &quot;Russia-Ukraine conflict&quot; and avoids any criticism of Moscow&apos;s war of aggression. Out of the 15 members of the Security Council, 10 voted in favor, while the U.K., France, Denmark, Greece, and Slovenia abstained. Suspilne earlier reported that Washington sent letters to UN member states urging them to support the softer U.S. resolution, aligning with broader U.S. efforts to tone down language on Russia in international statements. The shift in tone comes as U.S. President Donald Trump pushes for a peace deal with Russia while increasingly criticizing Ukraine. Trump has called President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and falsely claimed that Ukraine started the war &#x2014; before later acknowledging that &quot;Russia attacked, but they shouldn&apos;t have let him attack.&quot; The Financial Times earlier reported that the U.S. also opposed referring to Russia as the aggressor in a G7 statement marking the war&apos;s anniversary.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-opposed-ukraines-un-resolution-to-avoid-antagonizing-russia-rubio-says/	2025-02-25T07:14:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194528244.jpg
UK to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, Starmer says	The U.K. aims to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced on Feb. 25 during a speech in the British Parliament. Starmer&apos;s statement comes amid growing uncertainty about the security situation in Europe, as the U.S. sends clear signals that the continent won&#x2019;t be able to rely on Washington for its security in the future. Starting in 2027, the UK will spend &#xA3;13.4 billion &#xA0;($17 billion) yearly on security needs. After the end of the parliament&apos;s term in 2029, it is expected to reach 3% of GDP, according to Starmer. It is the largest sustained increase in British defense spending since the end of the Cold War. &quot;(Vladimir) Putin thought he would weaken NATO. He has achieved the exact opposite,&quot; Starmer said. Due to the changes, the budget for foreign aid will have to be cut from this year&apos;s 0.5% of national income to 0.3% in 2027, Starmer added. &quot;It remains a cut, and I will not pretend otherwise. We will do everything we can to return to a world where that is not the case and rebuild a capability on development,&quot; Starmer said. &quot;But at times like this, the defense and security of the British people must always come first,&quot; he added. U.S. President Donald Trump previously urged NATO allies to increase their defense contributions beyond the current 2% benchmark, citing the need for Europe to take greater responsibility for its security amid Russia&apos;s ongoing full-scale war in Ukraine. Trump also blamed Ukraine for starting the war, saying Kyiv &quot;should have never started it&quot; and instead should have &quot;made a deal.&quot; Later, Trump added that President Volodymyr Zelensky is not essential to negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine and called him a &quot;dictator.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-plans-to-increase-defense-spending-to-2-5-of-gdp-by-2027-starmer-says/	2025-02-25T06:30:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2159996904.jpg
France could send nuclear-armed jets to Germany, Telegraph reports	France could deploy jet fighters equipped with nuclear weapons to Germany to send a &quot;strong message&quot; to Russia, the Telegraph reported on Feb. 24. The proposal comes as the U.S. shifts away from Europe and Ukraine, sending clear signals that the continent won&#x2019;t be able to rely on Washington for its security in the future. A French official speaking to the Telegraph said deploying fighter jets to Germany &quot;should not be difficult and would send a strong message,&quot; and would also pressure U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer to make a similar move. France is thought to have 300 nuclear weapons in its&apos; &apos;force de dissuasion&apos; program, with both sea and air-based launch systems. Meanwhile, the U.K.&apos;s Trident nuclear deterrent comprises four Vanguard-class submarines, each capable of carrying up to 16 warheads. The Telegraph report came on the same day that French President Emmanuel Macron met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House where they discussed the future of support for Ukraine and possible peace negotiations. At a press conference after the pair met, Macron said that Europe needs U.S. support in any peace agreement &quot;because this is part of the credibility of security guarantees,&quot; but he also urged Europeans to take greater responsibility for safeguarding the continent. Before he met Trump, Macron talked to Friedrich Merz, who is expected to be Germany&apos;s next chancellor. Merz has also called on Britain and France to extend their nuclear protection as he seeks &quot;independence&quot; for Europe from the U.S. &quot;If those who really do not just make &apos;America first,&apos; but almost &apos;America alone&apos; their motto prevail, then it will be difficult,&quot; he said on Feb. 24. &quot;But I remain hopeful that we will succeed in maintaining the transatlantic relationship,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-could-send-nuclear-armed-jets-to-germany-telegraph-reports/	2025-02-25T06:05:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2191796999.jpg
Ukraine needs $524 billion for recovery, reconstruction after 3 years of Russia's full-scale war	The cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine after three years of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion will be $524 billion over the next decade, the U.N. reported on Feb. 25, citing data from Ukraine&apos;s government, the World Bank, the European Commission, and the U.N. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russia has been attacking Ukrainian cities and villages daily, destroying residential buildings, critical infrastructure, cultural heritage sites, and sports venues, among other facilities. The required reconstruction costs are 2.8 times higher than Ukraine&apos;s nominal GDP for 2024, according to the report. Direct losses in Ukraine reached $176 billion at the end of December 2024 compared to $152 billion in February last year, the Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDNA4) by the World Bank estimated. Housing, transportation, energy, trade and industry, and education sectors have suffered the most from Russian attacks, the report read. Some 13% of Ukraine&apos;s total housing stock was damaged or destroyed, affecting over 2.5 million homes. In the energy sector, the number of damaged or destroyed assets, including production, transmission, distribution, and district heating infrastructure, increased by 70%. Donetsk, Kharkiv, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, and Kyiv oblasts sustained nearly 72% of the total damage.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-needs-524-billion-for-recovery-reconstruction-after-3-years-of-russias-full-scale-war/	2025-02-25T05:47:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1377903979.jpg
In calling Zelensky a ‘dictator without elections,’ Trump misunderstands democracy	After the top diplomats of Moscow and Washington met in Riyadh to discuss &#x201C;peace&#x201D; in Ukraine &#x2014; without Ukraine at the table &#x2014; the conversation quickly shifted to elections, as if they were the only topic discussed and the sole reason the war continues. And once again, U.S. President Donald Trump was at the center of the discourse. Beyond blaming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for starting the war and not ending it soon enough, Trump recently referred to him as a &#x201C;dictator without elections&#x201D; in a post on Truth Social. But in doing so, Trump wasn&#x2019;t just attacking a wartime leader &#x2014; he was promoting a deeply flawed understanding of democracy. His claims reflect a dangerous political mindset: electoralism, the notion that holding elections is the sole measure of democracy, regardless of whether institutions, public accountability, and the rule of law remain intact. Electoralism twists the truth. It provides a convenient justification for autocrats to present themselves as &#x201C;democratically elected&#x201D; while abusing power. At the same time, it undermines legitimate democracies, like Ukraine, when they make necessary, temporary deviations from the electoral cycle in times of crisis. And most ironically, it&#x2019;s a standard that Trump himself has never met. Let&#x2019;s start with the facts. Ukraine&#x2019;s constitution explicitly prohibits holding elections under martial law, which has been in place since Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022. This isn&#x2019;t a rule invented by Zelensky &#x2014; it&#x2019;s a necessity, recognized by both domestic and international legal experts. And from a purely practical standpoint, holding an election while a significant portion of the population is fighting for survival, many are in exile, and the majority live in fear would be neither free nor fair. History provides countless examples of elections being postponed during wartime. The most well-known case is the United Kingdom, which delayed its elections in 1940 to focus on battling Nazi Germany. None of this made Winston Churchill a dictator. Yet, according to Trump&#x2019;s logic, Zelensky&#x2019;s inability to hold elections makes him an authoritarian, despite Ukraine maintaining a free press, an independent judiciary, and ongoing debates about when and how elections should resume. Meanwhile, leaders like Putin and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb&#xE1;n &#x2014; whom Trump has openly praised &#x2014; continue to hold elections while consolidating power, silencing dissent, and rigging the system in their favor. If democracy is only about voting, why do these strongmen get a pass? Trump&#x2019;s call for democratic integrity might carry more weight if he weren&#x2019;t the last person who should be making it. This is the same man who tried to overturn a legitimate U.S. election in 2020, encouraged an insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, and still refuses to accept his own defeat. If anything, Trump&#x2019;s approach to democracy aligns much more closely with the leaders he claims to oppose. Like Putin, he undermines institutions when they don&#x2019;t serve his interests. Like Orb&#xE1;n, he tries to redefine democracy in ways that prioritize his hold on power rather than actual democratic principles. In his recent post on X, he even wrote a line that could have come from Lenin or Stalin: &#x201C;He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.&#x201D; And like many autocrats, he weaponizes democracy&#x2019;s own rhetoric to achieve the opposite of what it stands for. By calling Zelensky a dictator, Trump isn&#x2019;t defending democracy &#x2014; he&#x2019;s distorting it for political gain. Trump&#x2019;s labeling of Zelensky as a &#x201C;dictator without elections&#x201D; is more than just a verbal attack. It plays into Russian propaganda efforts, which have long sought to delegitimize Zelensky by portraying him as an unelected, Western-backed puppet. When a U.S. president amplifies that narrative, it weakens international support for Ukraine, fractures Western unity, and reinforces Russia&#x2019;s belief that Trump would be an ally to their cause. Beyond Ukraine, Trump&#x2019;s comments send a dangerous signal to global democracy. If the U.S. starts judging democracy solely by the presence of elections, it will allow authoritarian regimes to claim legitimacy simply by holding sham votes &#x2014; while penalizing legitimate democracies that make necessary adjustments during crises. That&#x2019;s a gift to strongmen from Moscow to Tehran. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky answers questions from the media during a press conference in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 23, 2025. (Kostiantyn Liberov / Libkos / Getty Images)If Trump truly believed democracy was only about elections, he would have accepted the results of 2020. If he truly believed that lacking an election makes someone a dictator, he would be far more critical of leaders who game the system to maintain permanent rule. But he doesn&#x2019;t. His attack on Zelensky isn&#x2019;t about democracy &#x2014; it&#x2019;s about politics. It&#x2019;s about shaping public opinion against continued U.S. support for Ukraine and laying the groundwork for a future in which the U.S. aligns more with authoritarian powers than democratic allies. Trump&#x2019;s claims demand more than just fact-checking. They require a deeper discussion about what democracy actually means &#x2014; and how its enemies, foreign and domestic, are trying to redefine it for their own benefit. The question isn&#x2019;t whether Ukraine is a democracy. It is. The real question is: Who benefits from pretending it isn&#x2019;t? The answer is clear: those who want to attack democratic institutions, normalize autocratic rule, and justify their own attacks on democratic norms. If the U.S. allows electoralism to define democracy, it will not only abandon Ukraine &#x2014; it will undermine its own democratic resilience. And that would be a victory for the very forces democracy was meant to resist.

In negotiations with Russia, Trump is repeating his ‘complete disaster’ peace deal with Taliban	Donald Trump is elected U.S. president after criticizing a war abroad and calling for its end. He negotiates a deal with an adversary of the United States under heavy sanctions, cutting an ally out of their own country&#x2019;s peace talks. The disastrous deal is viewed as a surrender to the opposition, prioritizing ending the conflict quickly over supporting U.S. allies or long-term stability in the region. If that sounds familiar, that&#x2019;s because it&#x2019;s what happened in Afghanistan during Trump&#x2019;s first term in office, and what Ukrainians and their partners fear may be happening to them now. When Trump began promising on the campaign trail to end the war in Ukraine, U.K. parliamentary member Mark Martin saw &#x201C;loads of similarities&#x201D; to how Trump ended the war in Afghanistan. &#x201C;The deal wasn&#x2019;t a deal, it was a capitulation,&#x201D; said Martin, who served in Afghanistan and wrote An Intimate War, a book on the conflict. &#x201C;And that&#x2019;s what Trump&#x2019;s trying to engineer here (in Ukraine).&#x201D; In February 2020, Trump&#x2019;s team signed an agreement with the Taliban, ending two decades of U.S. involvement in the war in Afghanistan. The Afghan government at the time &#x2014; a partner of the U.S. &#x2014; was excluded from negotiations. The subsequent withdrawal of U.S. troops, despite the Taliban&#x2019;s failure to adhere to its side of the agreement, was a key factor in the shocking takeover of Kabul by the Taliban in 2021. Though no comparison is exact, &#x201C;what&#x2019;s the same is the core instinct of the American leadership &#x2014; to reach out to the enemy and just give away the family jewels,&#x201D; said Martin. Since taking office, Trump and his staff have alarmed Ukrainian officials with their negotiating stance towards Russia. Immediately, officials appeared to undermine Ukraine&#x2019;s negotiating leverage by saying NATO membership was not an option and restoring Ukraine&#x2019;s borders was &#x201C;an unrealistic objective.&#x201D; An especially concerning development was a February meeting in Saudi Arabia between U.S. and Russian officials, to which Ukraine and Europe were not invited. Earlier this week, Trump said that it was &#x201C;not important&#x201D; for Zelensky to be present during the negotiations.

(Evelyn Hockstein / AFP via Getty Images)Of course, the United States had troops deployed in Afghanistan for two decades fighting a Taliban insurgency alongside Afghan Army troops, while Ukraine is fighting a land invasion by a sovereign nation without any U.S. boots on the ground. The deal with the Taliban also centered on ending U.S. involvement, not the entire conflict. However, the U.S. agreement signed with the Taliban in Doha was the only other peace deal Trump negotiated and is instructive in what his isolationist rhetoric looks like in practice. Many experts see clear parallels with the way peace talks are unfolding today. The lesson for Ukrainians, warns Martin, is clear: &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t rely on America. Find other allies.&#x201D; Trump had railed against the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan on social media and called for a withdrawal as far back as 2011. By the time Trump was inaugurated in 2017, almost 2,400 Americans had died serving in Afghanistan since the initial invasion in 2001. Trump began his efforts to directly negotiate with the Taliban in 2018 and appointed Zalmay Khalilzad as his special advisor tasked with facilitating talks. Meeting in Qatar, Khalilzad and Taliban representatives opened up peace talks, though they excluded the Afghan government at the Taliban&#x2019;s demand. &#x201C;The Afghan government was completely excluded. They were cut out,&#x201D; said Tim Willasey-Wilsey, a visiting professor at War Studies at King&apos;s College and former British diplomat. &#x201C;This is the same playbook (in Ukraine). Zelensky is out and Europe is out.&#x201D; John Bolton, Trump&#x2019;s national security advisor at the time of the Doha deal, was also frozen out of the Afghanistan talks once Trump realized Bolton didn&#x2019;t support his plans for a quick withdrawal at the expense of stability.

(Wakil Kohsar / AFP / Getty Images)This precedent bodes poorly for those hoping that U.S. officials who oppose Russia, like State Secretary Marco Rubio, might steer Trump away from siding with Moscow, Willasey-Wilsey added. Already, Keith Kellogg, Trump&#x2019;s current special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, was absent from recent U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia. There has been no indication from the Trump Administration that he will attend future rounds, and some experts argue he is actively being sidelined due to his relatively pro-Ukraine stance. In February 2020, during Trump&#x2019;s previous presidency, the Taliban signed a deal with the United States in Doha, Qatar. The U.S. promised to withdraw its troops within 14 months and signaled it would lift economic sanctions, while the Taliban agreed to not attack U.S. troops, eventually open talks with the Afghan government, and to prevent terrorist groups from operating in Taliban-controlled territory. The deal signed in Doha had secret agreements that were not publicized, leaving Afghan President Ashraf Ghani confused about exactly what the U.S. president had promised his foe. Meanwhile, the Taliban violated its pledges almost immediately. It escalated violent attacks and maintained ties with terrorist groups. Rather than holding the Taliban accountable, the Trump administration continued with its pledge to withdraw troops.

(Taylor Crul / U.S. Air Force / Getty Images)&#x201C;It&#x2019;s very easy to say (the two wars) are not similar. Of course, it&#x2019;s very easy to draw distinctions. But in terms of the general behavior of Trump towards negotiations, I think it&#x2019;s very instructive,&#x201D; said Willasey-Wilsey. &#x201C;All Trump wanted was to say, &#x2018;I got out of Afghanistan.&#x2019; The details didn&#x2019;t really matter,&#x201D; said Willasey-Wilsey, calling his negotiating tactics a &#x201C;complete disaster.&#x201D; &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve got such short memories. It was only four years ago. But we should have remembered how this man operates,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;It&apos;s a bit of a condemnation of all of us that we weren&apos;t really ready.&#x201D; Trump&#x2019;s successor, Joe Biden, inherited the Doha deal and decided to see through the U.S. commitment. Within weeks of Biden&#x2019;s announcement in April 2021 that the war in Afghanistan would end and a full withdrawal was on track, violence surged and the Taliban began to rapidly conquer huge swaths of land &#x2014; culminating in a deadly and chaotic evacuation of more than a hundred thousand people from the main airport in Kabul. The poorly planned withdrawal has remained a stain on Joe Biden&#x2019;s legacy, but many in the U.S. and abroad have forgotten the role of Trump&#x2019;s negotiation priorities in laying the groundwork for one of Washington&#x2019;s worst foreign policy failures in recent history. Many from Trump&#x2019;s administration distanced themselves from the deal in the aftermath, and critics have seen it as an effective surrender. Should the Ukraine deal similarly fall apart, Trump may again try to blame anyone but himself, said Willasey-Wilsey: &#x201C;If the thing goes horribly wrong in two or three years&apos; time, because Putin kicks off again, and if the guarantees are hopeless, which they will be, he&apos;ll blame Biden, he&apos;ll blame the Europeans.&#x201D; U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in the Oval Office in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 24, 2025. (Bonnie Cash / UPI / Bloomberg / Getty Images)Trump blamed Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris for the &#x201C;humiliation in Afghanistan&#x201D; as recently as last year. Yet a review led by the U.S. National Security Council found that Biden&#x2019;s actions were constrained by the Doha deal, and placed the blame on Trump. &#x201C;The (Afghanistan) deal itself was highly flawed,&#x201D; said Philippe Lefevre, associate director of the University of Surrey&#x2019;s Centre for Britain and Europe. &#x201C;It gave everything to the Taliban with no real response back. The Taliban immediately reneged on the deal. There was no ability or mechanism for the U.S. or NATO forces in Afghanistan to hold them accountable.&#x201D; &#x201C;That is the same fear here&#x201D; in Ukraine, added Lefevre, &#x201C;that you will be giving (Russian President Vladimir) Putin everything he wants. He can promise whatever he wants. But if he reneges &#x2014; and my belief is he wants to renege &#x2014; what can you do?&#x201D; Both the Taliban and Putin have a track record of human rights violations, noted Lefevre, and have undermined their credibility during negotiations. Russia&#x2019;s 2022 full-scale invasion, for example, was a blatant violation of the Minsk Agreements signed in 2014 and 2015 after Russian military offensives in Ukraine&apos;s Donbas. In his negotiations, Zelensky has tried to protect against potential violations of a future agreement by maintaining that any ceasefire must come with security assurances. Zelensky recently provided U.S. officials with a list of more than two dozen times that he says Russia violated ceasefires negotiated between 2014 and 2022. Even Khalilzad, who negotiated the deal in Doha that led to Afghanistan&#x2019;s collapse, has chimed in on the issue. In a post on X on Feb. 18, Khalilzad wrote that &#x201C;credible security guarantees to deter future Russian invasions&#x201D; and &#x201C;a peace-keeping force&#x201D; are necessary for a permanent end to the war in Ukraine, perhaps drawing on his experience with Afghanistan. Zelensky has maintained that Ukraine will not accept any deal negotiated without its participation. And, since Trump is seeking an end to fighting involving Zelensky&#x2019;s forces &#x2014; rather than just a withdrawal of U.S. troops &#x2014; Zelensky&#x2019;s involvement can&#x2019;t be ignored as easily as in Afghanistan. Either way, Trump officials have made it clear that they want a deal quickly and have suggested that one is already &#x201C;close.&#x201D; A press secretary for the administration said it could arrive as soon as this week, while Moscow said it is open to a ceasefire only if the agreement &#x201C;suits&#x201D; Russia. One of the biggest differences between Afghanistan and Ukraine may also be one of the biggest hopes for Kyiv to avoid repeating the mistakes in Kabul, according to Lefevre: the role of other European countries. &#x201C;Europe has a much larger ability to manage this withdrawal, has a much larger interest in successfully bolstering Ukraine during this potential withdrawal, and could and should help Ukraine push back against some of the worst aspects of the negotiations,&#x201D; said Lefevre. Among the most egregious aspects, he said, is the discussion to transfer Ukrainian mineral rights and natural resources to the U.S., which is &#x201C;clearly one-sided.&#x201D; The U.S. has reportedly pressured Ukraine to give up $500 billion of its natural resources as repayment for American aid to Ukraine, which was given without the expectation of repayment. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy answers questions during a press conference in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 23, 2025. (Kostiantyn Liberov / Libkos / Getty Images)Zelensky has thus far refused, noting that the proposed agreement fails to provide any security guarantees and vastly outweighs the $100 billion provided by the U.S. Kellogg has said that Europe will not be directly included in peace negotiations but its interests will be taken into account. So far, Europe has vocally called for Ukraine&#x2019;s and its own inclusion in peace talks, is continuing to provide aid, and is reportedly forming a plan to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not an inevitability that there is a withdrawal like Afghanistan, but it is up to Europeans to make sure that&#x2019;s the case,&#x201D; said Lefevre. &#x201C;The Europeans must be far more prepared to go it alone. We were not prepared to go it alone in Kabul.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/in-negotiations-with-russia-trump-is-repeating-his-complete-disaster-peace-deal-with-taliban/	2025-02-25T04:34:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1240566522.jpg
How North Korea’s role in Russia’s war undermines the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty	The nuclear dimension has been a key aspect of the Russo-Ukrainian War since its onset in February 2014. Behavior in this war, not just of Moscow and Kyiv but of other states as well, has been conditioned by Russia&#x2019;s possession and Ukraine&#x2019;s lack of weapons of mass destruction. Russia holds the world&#x2019;s largest arsenal of nuclear warheads, while Ukraine has no weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Since 2014, Moscow has repeatedly reminded the world of its destructive nuclear power. In November 2024, the Kremlin publicly amended Russia&#x2019;s military doctrine, lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons to make its nuclear threats more credible. In contrast, Kyiv agreed in 1994 to give up its inherited Soviet-era atomic arms and all related delivery systems in exchange for promises from the U.S., U.K., France, Russia, and China never to attack or threaten Ukraine (under the Budapest Memorandum), leaving it without nuclear deterrence capability today. This situation is oddly legitimized, supported, and protected by international law. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) allows Russia, as an official nuclear-weapon state, to possess nuclear weapons. The NPT also explicitly forbids Ukraine, as a non-nuclear weapon state, from doing the same. Ukraine&#x2019;s non-atomic allies are similarly bound by the NPT to remain conventional military powers in supporting Ukraine. Having already defied international law and the Helsinki Final Act with its territorial expansions into Moldova, Georgia, and Ukraine, Moscow is further undermining the logic of the non-proliferation regime and the letter of the NPT with its nuclear posturing. The NPT&#x2019;s preamble prescribes that &quot;States must refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State.&quot; In particular, the use or threat of force by a nuclear-weapon state against a non-nuclear-weapon state is inadmissible. Russia further made a promise, under the NPT acquis, to refrain from the threat or use of force against Ukraine in exchange for joining the treaty as a non-nuclear-weapon state. The logic of nuclear non-proliferation is now further under attack through North Korea&#x2019;s involvement in the Russo-Ukrainian War. Since 2023, Russia has increasingly relied on North Korea, a state that violated the NPT in order to build its own atomic arsenal, in its assault on Ukraine. After already supplying military equipment and ammunition, Pyongyang deepened its collaboration with Moscow in the fall of 2024 by sending regular troops to fight against Ukraine. These North Korean military units have engaged in direct combat with Ukrainian forces and suffered significant casualties. North Korea&#x2019;s involvement is expanding the war&#x2019;s scope into a global conflagration. North Korea violated and then withdrew from the NPT in 2003, long before it entered a European war. Subsequent to its departure, Pyongyang revealed its nuclear weapon program, and it has since freely developed and tested atomic arms and their delivery systems. In fact, North Korea had already violated the NPT while still a party to the Treaty, flouting international consequences, including UN sanctions. Today, North Korea is one of four nuclear-weapon states outside the NPT, along with India, Pakistan, and Israel. Nonetheless, North Korea&#x2019;s change in status in 2003 does not diminish the importance of its participation, through weapon deliveries and the deployment of thousands of troops, in Russia&#x2019;s war on Ukraine. Neither Moscow&#x2019;s initiation of hostilities in 2014 nor Pyongyang&#x2019;s full entry into the war 10 years later has lessened the NPT&#x2019;s absolute restriction on Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to seek nuclear deterrence. By observing the NPT, Ukraine is now disadvantaged in the face of two nuclear-armed states: Russia, an official nuclear-weapon state, and North Korea, a de facto nuclear-weapon state outside the NPT. This novel situation puts even more pressure on the purpose of the NPT than was already the case during the bilateral phase of the Russo-Ukrainian War from 2014 to 2023. Treaty implementation by Ukraine and its non-nuclear allies now puts them at risk with Russia, one of the NPT&#x2019;s official nuclear-weapon states, while restricting their maneuvering room in relation to the war waged against Ukraine by North Korea. Ukraine is being attacked by nuclear-armed states with different legal statuses and losing its internationally recognized state territory to an official nuclear-weapon state, with no recourse in the context of the NPT to address this unprecedented situation.

(Jung Yeon-je / AFP via Getty Images)North Korea&#x2019;s violation of and absence from the non-proliferation regime as well as possession of atomic arms have given it freedom of international action. The Russian-North Korean alliance further undermines the NPT by showing that nuclearization need not have consequences and can even result in more security benefits. This lesson is surely being studied closely in capitals such as Seoul, Taipei, and Tokyo. In contrast, Ukraine&#x2019;s observance of the NPT limits its ability to defend itself against Russia and North Korea, within the right of states to defend themselves as defined under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. North Korea&#x2019;s new relationship with Russia also touches on other Russian obligations under the NPT. In June 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Treaty, which entered into force in December 2024. It includes a promise to defend each other in case of an armed attack, which could involve the use of nuclear weapons by either Russia or North Korea. Both sides also committed to opposing &quot;the application of unilateral compulsory measures including those that assume extraterritorial nature&quot; and Russia pledged to support North Korean interests in &#x201C;the United Nations and its specialized agencies,&#x201D; which includes the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Institute for the Study of War has described the new situation in this way: &#x201C;...Russia has abandoned its past opposition to North Korea&#x2019;s nuclear program. It vetoed a UN resolution to tighten sanctions on North Korea in 2022 and another resolution to extend the mandate of the UN sanctions monitoring committee on North Korea in 2024, effectively ending UN sanctions compliance monitoring.&#x201D; Although still officially a nuclear-weapon state, Russia no longer upholds sanctions on North Korea that it had introduced as a permanent member of the UN Security Council in response to, among others, North Korea&#x2019;s development of nuclear weapons outside the NPT. Instead, Moscow has legitimized Pyongyang&#x2019;s right to possess nuclear weapons. Russia&#x2019;s Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, said in September 2024 that &quot;applying the term &#x2018;denuclearization&#x2019; to (the) DPRK (Democratic People&#x2019;s Republic of Korea) no longer makes any sense. For us, this is off the table.&quot; The nuclear non-proliferation regime emerged with the entry into force of the NPT in 1970. It has since drawn its legitimacy from being an all-encompassing agreement of today 191 states aimed at preventing nuclear war and proliferation, while also ensuring that nuclear-weapon states do not use or threaten to use atomic arms against non-nuclear-weapon states in good standing with their NPT obligations. Since 2014, however, the NPT has inadvertently provided cover for Russia, an NPT-defined nuclear-weapon state and permanent member of the UN Security Council, to carry out expansionist and genocidal policies against Ukraine, an official non-nuclear-weapon state. Since 2023, moreover, the NPT has put the signatory states Ukraine and its non-nuclear allies in a disadvantageous position vis-a-vis Russia&#x2019;s nuclear-armed ally North Korea. The solution to this paradoxical situation is that all NPT signatory states interested in a continuation of the non-proliferation regime should provide Kyiv with as much as possible conventional military and non-military help in order to enable the Ukrainian armed forces to repel Russia&#x2019;s and North Korea&#x2019;s attack on the logic of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. &#xA0; Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article is based on a longer Stockholm Centre for Eastern European Studies (SCEEUS) commentary.

I was tired' — Serbia's president apologises for accidentally backing Ukraine's UN resolution	Serbia erroneously voted in favor of a Ukrainian resolution at the U.N. General Assembly calling Russia an aggressor state, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on Feb. 24, RTS reported. The U.N. General Assembly approved the resolution on Feb. 24 condemning Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, with 93 countries voting in favor and 18 against, including the U.S. Serbia was supposed to abstain from voting on the Ukrainian resolution, Vucic said. &quot;I believe that Serbia made a mistake today. I apologize to the citizens of Serbia for that, and I take the blame for that because I was probably tired and overwhelmed,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn&apos;t have time to deal with this (issue) enough, maybe I&apos;m too tired, maybe I have too many things (to deal with)... I don&apos;t think we should pander to any power, neither Russians nor Americans. I think it was in the interest of the state of Serbia. Unfortunately, it didn&apos;t happen,&quot; he added. Serbia maintains a friendly attitude toward Russia and has refused to join international sanctions against Moscow in the wake of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. At the same time, Vucic has called Ukraine a &quot;friendly country&quot; and previously affirmed that Crimea and Donbas are Ukrainian sovereign territories. Vucic expected his vote error would also result in him &quot;losing favor or political points in the EU.&quot; The Ukrainian resolution explicitly names Russia as the aggressor state and demands the complete withdrawal of troops. The American version of the resolution did not explicitly mention Russia as an aggressor, but after amendments from the EU countries, the document included the wording &quot;Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.&quot; The U.S. abstained from voting after these changes, while Russia opposed it. Both resolutions were adopted.	https://kyivindependent.com/serbia-mistakenly-backs-ukrainian-resolution-on-russias-war-at-un-general-assembly-vucic-says/	2025-02-25T04:14:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189211336.jpg
Peace in Ukraine must look like Korea, not Vichy	Peace is an attractive, yet elusive, concept. It can mean different things to different people at different times. Ukraine is a case in point. The quest for peace could yield either of two fundamentally different outcomes: a Vichy-style capitulation, perhaps with an interim ceasefire that buys Russia more time to rearm and prepare its next attack, or a robust defense of a frozen front line, as one finds on the Korean Peninsula today. The Kremlin&#x2019;s vision for peace in Ukraine is clear. Russian forces would directly occupy swaths of illegally seized Ukrainian territory, and a compliant, helpless Ukrainian government (lacking any meaningful military capacity) would take orders from Moscow. Something quite similar happened in France during World War II, when the part of the country not under direct German occupation was run by General Philippe P&#xE9;tain&#x2019;s collaborationist government and took orders from Berlin. Thus, for most of World War II &#x2014; roughly between 1940 and 1944 &#x2014; the situation on the ground in France was &#x201C;peaceful.&#x201D; The Vichy regime under P&#xE9;tain regularly boasted that it had protected France, while blaming the Resistance &#x2014; French guerrillas (&quot;maquis&quot;) &#x2014; and periodic Allied bombing raids for any disturbances to the &#x201C;peace.&#x201D; This option has been on offer for Ukraine since the first hours of Russia&#x2019;s large-scale invasion. Yet having witnessed the executions, rapes, and other atrocities committed by Russian forces against civilians in Bucha and elsewhere, the Ukrainians have understandably refused to capitulate. The alternative is the type of peace that kept Germany peaceful for decades after World War II, and kept the Korean Peninsula peaceful since the 1953 armistice. In each case, the peace was secured by accepting de facto borders, which were fortified with massive defensive military buildups, boots on the ground, and credible security guarantees. While West Germany enjoyed NATO membership after 1955, South Korea relied on a bilateral alliance with the United States. Even today, the U.S. keeps around 28,000 active-duty troops in South Korea and 50,000 in Germany. Such backstops made the former wartime front line almost impregnable, allowing each rump state to consolidate, develop, and remain at peace. The equivalent of a West German or South Korean model for Ukraine today would require a freezing of the front line and either NATO accession or a deployment of tens of thousands of Western troops to its Ukrainian territory. The French government has pushed for this kind of solution since February 2024, and it now features prominently in discussions among European leaders. With the new U.S. administration demanding that Europe do more to ensure its own peace and security, at least a half-dozen European governments are said to be seriously considering it. Of course, if Europeans dislike the first model (a Vichy-style peace) but prove unable to deliver a sufficient security guarantee, that will create the conditions for a third possible scenario: a bogus peace leading to another war. A temporary ceasefire &#x2014; like the one that prevailed under the Minsk agreements after 2014 &#x2014; would allow Russia to regroup, rearm, and attack again sooner rather than later. Not only might this cycle be repeated more than once; it also could implicate countries beyond Ukraine &#x2014; such as the Baltics or Poland. Thus, if Ukraine does not get enough support in the coming months and years, Europe will find itself confronting a dangerous new strategic reality, one that would challenge NATO solidarity and leave EU territory perpetually vulnerable. With enough prodding and hybrid warfare, Russia could test the limits of NATO&#x2019;s mutual defense guarantee and either expose it as a dead letter or precipitate a direct military confrontation between nuclear powers. Such would be the consequences of a bogus peace. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio (C), U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz (R) and U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff attend an interview after meeting with Russian officials in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Feb. 18, 2025. (Evelyn Hockstein / AFP via Getty Images)The immediate task for Europe, then, is not only to navigate U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s unilateral pursuit of a settlement with Russia that could offer Ukraine on a platter to Russia, but also to ensure that any deal does not increase the likelihood of an even wider war in the near future. Many Europeans think that if Russia could not conquer Ukraine in 2022, Russia would not dare challenge NATO and the European Union. That is dangerously wishful thinking. Occupying most of Ukraine would not only allow Russia to expand its territory, but also allow it to unite Europe&#x2019;s biggest and second-biggest armies, under Kremlin command. Occupied territories bring in new people, defense production capacities, and resources &#x2014; from rare-earth minerals to gas and nuclear power plants. Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industrial capacity &#x2014; which has been impressive in multiple areas, from sea drones to the shear capacity to produce equipment en masse &#x2014; would be a welcome bonus for Russia as well, and it could be used against Europe. French President Emmanuel Macron already publicly warned that the combined armed forces of Russia and Ukraine would be unstoppable. The bottom line is that avoiding a Ukrainian capitulation or a fake peace will require a European commitment to, at the very least, freezing the current frontline. Otherwise, vulnerable EU and NATO members could be the next targets. European public opinion must wake up to the reality that the only alternative is something that no one wants: a perpetual threat of war for much of Central and Northern Europe, with all the security and economic uncertainty that comes with it.

Russia will not be readmitted to G7, German finance minister says, rebuffing Trump	Russia will not be readmitted to the Group of Seven (G7), Germany&apos;s finance minister, Joerg Kukies, told Reuters on Feb. 25, despite U.S. President Donald Trump saying he would &quot;love&quot; to see it happen. &quot;The condemnation of the G7 of Russia&apos;s war of aggression is very clear, especially on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s brutal attack,&quot; Kukies said. Trump said on Feb. 13 that he would &quot;love&quot; to see Russia readmitted into the G7, calling Russia&apos;s 2014 expulsion from the group a &quot;mistake.&quot; &quot;I&apos;d love to have them back. I think it was a mistake to throw them out,&quot; Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. &quot;Look, it&apos;s not a question of liking Russia or not liking Russia. It was the G8,&quot; Trump said, referring to the former name of the international forum. Then-Group of Eight (G8) countries expelled Russia from the group in 2014 after it invaded parts of eastern Ukraine and annexed Crimea. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, G7 countries have collectively supported Ukraine with military and financial aid. But cracks have been showing in recent days after the U.S.&apos;s abrupt shift away from Ukraine since Trump took office last month. The G7 is still discussing a joint statement on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine due to disagreements with the U.S., Reuters reported on Feb. 25, citing Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly. &quot;We&apos;ve been working, indeed, with the Europeans and Americans. We are still having some conversations,&quot; Joly said during the briefing when asked about the statement&apos;s status. Joly&apos;s statement comes after the U.S. joined Russia and Belarus in voting against a U.N. resolution condemning Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion on Feb. 24. &quot;Canada and other countries don&apos;t agree with the position that the U.S. advocated at the UN, particularly the resolution they brought up,&quot; Joly said. Washington also opposes the wording &quot;Russian aggression&quot; in any joint G7 statement on the war, according to Reuters.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-will-not-be-readmitted-to-g7-german-finance-minister-says-rebuffing-trump/	2025-02-25T04:01:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201260761.jpg
Ukraine passes resolution on elections when there is 'sustainable peace' at 2nd attempt	Ukraine&apos;s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, passed a resolution on Feb. 25 to hold elections after &quot;a comprehensive, just, and sustainable peace is secured&quot; in the country, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said. The decision was supported by 268 members of parliament (MPs), while 12 abstained, according to Zhelezniak. A day earlier, the parliament lacked the votes to approve the resolution on its first attempt. The resolution to &quot;support for democracy in Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression&quot; stipulates that elections cannot be held under martial law, emphasizing the &quot;need for continuity of leadership&quot; in such circumstances. The resolution comes after U.S. President Donald Trump called President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; in a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Feb. 19, accusing him of refusing to hold elections, and repeating false claims about the war in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin is the only one who is responsible for making it impossible to hold &quot;free, transparent, and democratic elections&quot; in Ukraine with the participation of international observers, the resolution states. &quot;Martial law in Ukraine, introduced in response to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, does not allow for elections by Ukraine&apos;s Constitution of Ukraine. At the same time, the Ukrainian people are united in the opinion that such elections should be held after the war&apos;s end,&quot; the parliament declared. Russia has widely used the claim that Zelensky is illegitimate in its propaganda to discredit the Ukrainian government. The false claim is based on the premise that Zelensky&apos;s first term in office was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. But Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and the subsequent declaration of martial law in Ukraine has meant elections have been impossible to hold, and his term has been extended, something constitutional lawyers say is allowed under Ukrainian law.	https://kyivindependent.com/parliament-passes-resolution-on-elections-when-there-is-sustainable-peace-at-2nd-attempt/	2025-02-25T03:26:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167201231.jpg
Second round of Saudi Arabia talks with US not happening today, Russia says	Russia&apos;s foreign ministry has said none of its representatives are scheduled to meet their U.S. counterparts in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 25, Russian state media RIA Novosti reported. The statement comes after Euronews reported on Feb. 22 that U.S. President Donald Trump had announced a second round of talks on how to end the war in Ukraine. The first round of talks on Feb. 18 in Saudi Arabia marked the first direct negotiations between the U.S. and Russia since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion began, with Russia&apos;s delegation, led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, sitting down with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials. Ukraine was not invited to participate. Following the initial meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlined three main objectives both sides had agreed to pursue. These include restoring embassy staff in Washington and Moscow, creating a high-level team to facilitate Ukraine peace talks, and exploring ways to strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries. Meanwhile, Russia&#x2019;s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said that preparations are underway for a potential face-to-face meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Speaking to Russian state media, Ryabkov said such a summit could cover a broad range of global issues beyond the war in Ukraine. He emphasized the need to &quot;move toward normalizing relations&quot; and address &quot;the most acute and potentially very, very dangerous situations, of which there are many, Ukraine among them.&quot; Ryabkov claimed that plans for the summit remain in the early stages and would require &quot;the most intensive preparatory work&quot; to materialize. He added that U.S. and Russian envoys may hold another meeting within the next two weeks to prepare for further high-level discussions. President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected any potential outcome from the talks, stressing that Kyiv was not included in the discussions. European allies have also voiced concerns over being sidelined in the negotiations, raising further doubts about the legitimacy of the ongoing diplomatic efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/second-round-of-saudi-arabia-talks-with-us-not-happening-today-russia-says/	2025-02-25T03:07:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199670497.jpg
G7 still discussing joint statement on Russia's full-scale invasion due to disagreement with US	The Group of Seven nations (G7) is still discussing a joint statement on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine due to disagreements with the U.S., Reuters reported on Feb. 25, citing Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly. &quot;We&apos;ve been working, indeed, with the Europeans and Americans.

Washington also opposes the wording &quot;Russian aggression&quot; in any joint G7 statement on the war, according to Reuters. &quot;It is a fluid situation, and we&apos;ll continue to engage, but I&apos;ve been foreign minister now for three years and a half, and it&apos;s never been so intense in terms of diplomatic engagement, to say the least,&quot; Joly added. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz both declined to explicitly name Russia as the aggressor in Fox News interviews. Hegseth referred to the war as &quot;a very complicated situation&quot; when asked if Russia attacked Ukraine unprovoked. U.S. President Donald Trump also chose not to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a dictator while responding to journalists on the sidelines of a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron on Feb. 24. Trump called the Ukrainian leader a &quot;dictator&quot; in a post on his social media platform Truth Social, accusing him of refusing to hold elections and repeating false claims about the war in Ukraine. Yet, Trump&apos;s remarks disregard Ukraine&apos;s constitution, which prohibits elections under martial law, and echoed the narratives of Russian propaganda.	https://kyivindependent.com/g7-still-discussing-joint-statement-on-anniversary-of-full-scale-invasion-due-to-disagreement-with-us/	2025-02-25T02:20:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201807339.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, injure 36 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed two civilians and injured 36 others over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 25. The Russian military regularly attacks Ukrainian cities and villages with drones, missiles, glide bombs, and artillery. Despite overwhelming evidence, the Russian government has denied that its army is targeting civilians. In Sumy Oblast, Russia struck the Sumy community with a drone, injuring two people overnight on Feb. 25, the local military administration reported. The day prior, Russia targeted the Velykapysarivka community with artillery, drones, and mortars. One person was killed, and two others were injured in the attacks. In the Myropillia community, Russian forces struck the settlements with a glide bomb, drones, and mortars, injuring three civilians. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian strikes killed one person and injured two others in the town of Sloviansk. In Kramatorsk, two people suffered injuries and one person was injured in Kostiantynivka. One civilian was also injured in the attack against the village of Fedorivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 34 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, 13 people, including a child, were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. As of Feb. 25 morning, Russian forces struck Kherson again, injuring a 63-year-old man. He suffered a shrapnel wound to his leg and an explosive injury. In Kharkiv Oblast, a Russian glide bomb struck the town of Derhachi, injuring four women, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. Russian forces also attacked the village of Tsupivka, injuring four civilians. In Kyiv Oblast, Russian forces attacked several settlements with drones. A 44-year-old woman suffered leg injuries in the Obukhiv district, the local military administration reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-2-injure-36-over-past-day/	2025-02-25T02:06:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-25-10_05_52.jpeg
EU offers Ukraine 'mutually beneficial' minerals deal, despite Trump saying US version close to signing	The EU has offered Ukraine its own deal on the country&apos;s natural resources, describing it as &quot;mutually beneficial&quot; and a &quot;win-win partnership,&quot; AFP reported on Feb. 24. The European Commissioner for industrial strategy, Stephane Sejourne, said he&apos;d offered Kyiv an alternative to that proposed by the U.S. while on a visit to Ukraine to mark the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Negotiations on a deal to entrench U.S. interests in Ukraine&apos;s reserves are ongoing, with the latest draft presented by the White House reportedly demanding $500 billion of Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including critical minerals, to recuperate American aid to Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky has so far refused to sign the deal because it does not contain any security guarantees for Ukraine and because the $500 billion sum vastly outnumbers the $100 billion provided under former President Joe Biden as a grant. &quot;Twenty-one of the 30 critical materials Europe needs can be provided by Ukraine in a win-win partnership,&quot; Sejourne said. &quot;The added value Europe offers is that we will never demand a deal that&apos;s not mutually beneficial.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump previously reiterated his push for a deal between the U.S. and Ukraine, arguing that it would help Kyiv&apos;s economy while ensuring that Washington &quot;recoups the tens of billions of dollars and military equipment sent to Ukraine.&quot; During a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House, Trump said he may soon meet President Volodymyr Zelensky to sign the agreement.

US, Ukraine close to signing deal on minerals worth 'hundreds of billions of dollars,' Axios reports	Ukraine and the U.S. are close to signing a deal on rare earths worth &quot;hundreds of billions of dollars,&quot; Axios reported on Feb. 24 after receiving a draft of the document. Negotiations on a deal to entrench U.S. interests in Ukraine&apos;s reserves are ongoing, with the latest draft presented by the White House reportedly demanding $500 billion of Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including critical minerals, to recuperate American aid to Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky has so far refused to sign the deal because it does not contain any security guarantees for Ukraine and because the $500 billion sum vastly outnumbers the $100 billion provided under former President Joe Biden as a grant. According to the draft obtained by Axios, the U.S. would express its desire to keep Ukraine &quot;free, sovereign and secure.&quot; Yet the document does not provide for any military commitments on Washington&apos;s part. The draft deal includes establishing a &quot;Reconstruction Investment Fund&quot; jointly managed by Washington and Kyiv. The fund will be reportedly created to &quot;invest in projects in Ukraine and attract investments to increase development,&quot; including in areas like mining and ports. The U.S. will also be able to reimburse part of its costs associated with &quot;defending, reconstructing, and returning Ukraine&quot; to pre-war GDP levels, according to the agreement&apos;s text. The deal also includes provisions for the territories currently under Russian occupation. Much of Ukraine&apos;s rare mineral resources have been under Russian control since the beginning of the war. An unnamed Ukrainian official told Axios that the agreement could be signed as early as March 3. The source added that the document obtained by Axios is the latest version but may be subject to amendments. U.S. President Donald Trump previously reiterated his push for a deal between the U.S. and Ukraine, arguing that it would help Kyiv&apos;s economy while ensuring that Washington &quot;recoups the tens of billions of dollars and military equipment sent to Ukraine.&quot; During a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House, Trump said he may soon meet President Volodymyr Zelensky to sign the agreement.

According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,182 tanks, 21,168 armored fighting vehicles, 38,582 vehicles and fuel tanks, 23,652 artillery systems, 1,299 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,083 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 26,767 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-868-230-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022-2/	2025-02-24T22:20:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2164070731.jpg
Reclaiming occupied territories possible but 'not easy' for Ukraine, Trump claims	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 24 that he believes Ukraine might be able to reclaim some of its territories occupied by Russia, but it would be challenging. He stated this in response to journalists during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, which took place at the White House. &quot;You&#x2019;re asking whether or not they (Ukrainians) could take back the land that they lost. And I say that yes, perhaps some of it, yes. But that&#x2019;s not an easy thing to do,&#x201D; Trump said. He also noted that this question is part of the current negotiations that have recently started. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll see,&#x201D; Trump said. &#x201C;There has been a lot of land that has been taken, so we will have to see how it works out. It&#x2019;s part of the negotiation.&#x201D; The U.S. held the first round of talks directly with Russia on Feb. 18, excluding Ukraine from the meeting.

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to visit Washington later this week to meet with Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/reclaiming-occupied-territories-possible-but-not-easy-for-ukraine-trump-claims/	2025-02-24T20:21:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198721894.jpg
Russia's Ryazan oil refinery halts operations following drone strike, Reuters reports	Russia&#x2019;s Ryazan oil refinery suspended operations after a Ukrainian drone attack set its main crude distillation unit, CDU-6, on fire, Reuters reported on Feb. 24. The refinery, owned by Rosneft, halted oil processing entirely, multiple industry sources told Reuters. However, it may partially resume operations within days by using CDU-4 and CDU-3 units, while CDU-6 is repaired. The attack caused at least five explosions, with local authorities attributing the fire to falling drone debris. This refinery had only recently resumed activity on Feb. 11 following an 18-day shutdown after a previous attack. This is the third time since the beginning of 2025 that drones have attacked the Ryazan Oil Refinery, according to the independent Telegram channel Astra. The Ryazan Oil Refinery is one of Russia&apos;s five largest oil refining facilities, according to Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation. Its capacity is 17.1 million metric tons of oil per year. Kovalenko added that the fuel produced at the enterprise is used by the Russian army&apos;s strategic long-range aviation, which launches missile strikes against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-ryazan-oil-refinery-halts-operations-following-drone-strike-reuters-reports/	2025-02-24T18:41:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1245921994.jpg

Peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine,' Macron says following Trump visit	French President Emmanuel Macron reaffirmed his commitment to Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine in a joint press conference with U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 24. &quot;I&apos;m going to tell him (Trump) &apos;You can&apos;t be weak with (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin,&apos;&quot; Macron said on Feb. 20 in the lead-up to his meeting with Trump. Europe has scrambled to strengthen support for Ukraine in response to uncertainty in U.S. foreign policy. Macron praised Trump for working on a minerals deal with President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the deal is a commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty. The minerals deal is an agreement in the works that would grant the U.S. preferential access to rare earth minerals among other resources such as oil in Ukraine. The deal could reportedly grant the U.S. $500 billion in value stemming from 50% of revenue from resource extraction in Ukraine, but has garnered criticism from many for being a &quot;colonial agreement.&quot; &quot;This peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine. It must not mean a ceasefire without guarantees. This peace must allow for Ukrainian sovereignty and allow Ukraine to negotiate with other stakeholders,&quot; Macron said. Macron said he and Trump both share the view that a lasting peace must be established swiftly in Ukraine. The French leader stressed the need to ensure a peace agreement is not weak in response to Trump&apos;s calls for a swift peace settlement that many fear would favor Russia. Trump and Macron agreed on the importance of having European peacekeepers deployed to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. &quot;That is one of the great areas of progress that we&#x2019;ve made during this trip and during this discussion,&quot; Macron said referring to the deployment of peacekeepers to Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to visit Trump in a similar meeting on Feb. 27.	https://kyivindependent.com/peace-must-not-mean-a-surrender-of-ukraine-macron-says-following-trump-visit/	2025-02-24T16:15:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1258320110.jpg
Ukraine, Russia reach a deal to evacuate Kursk Oblast residents, Russian official claims	Ukraine and Russia have agreed to evacuate residents of Kursk Oblast through Belarus to other regions of the country, a Russian official claimed on Feb. 24. &quot;There are people who are already in Sumy (Oblast) today. And there is an agreement with the Red Cross and the Ukrainian side that they will be evacuated through Belarus to Russia,&quot; Russian rights commissioner Tatyana Moskalkova said on Feb. 24. It is unclear how many people would be relocated under this agreement. Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024 and still holds significant territory in the region. Many believe Ukraine&#x2019;s control of Kursk Oblast could be a bargaining chip in potential peace negotiations with Russia. Russian media has been reporting allegations that Ukrainian troops shot civilians, &quot;including women, children and the elderly, both in their own homes and while attempting to evacuate them in civilian vehicles&quot; in the areas where Ukrainian forces have been operating. Ukraine&#x2019;s Center for Countering Disinformation has dismissed these claims as disinformation, adding that Russia has been working to create a narrative of Ukrainian atrocities. &quot;The Kremlin has been pumping in lots of money to create a &apos;Russian Bucha&apos; (hundreds of civilians were massacred by Russian troops in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha during Russian occupation of the area in spring 2022) &#xA0;in the information space by any means necessary, spreading fakes about the alleged &apos;terrible crimes&apos; of Ukrainians on the territory of the Russian Federation for several months now,&quot; the center said in late January. Russian authorities routinely appeal to the international community and accuse Ukraine of committing atrocities, while simultaneously block the International Red Cross (IRC) representatives from accessing the sites of these alleged crimes. Instead, they rely on the complicity of the Russian Red Cross office, whose neutrality and impartiality remains questionable. Unlike these propaganda narratives, Russian war crimes have been documented by international organizations. The U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has recorded 79 executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war by Russian forces since August 2024. Russian officials claim 500 people are missing in Kursk Oblast, but many locals believe the true number is closer to 3,000. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has been pushing for Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine to be resolved swiftly. The first step came on Feb. 18 when Russian and U.S. officials met in Saudi Arabia for preliminary talks without Ukraine. Trump has previously promised to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours. Since his victory in the U.S. presidential election, that timeline has been revised. The U.S administration has reportedly told European officials that it hopes to achieve a ceasefire agreement by Easter, which falls on April 20.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-and-russia-reached-a-deal-to-evacuate-kursk-oblast-residents-russian-official-claims/	2025-02-24T14:57:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/Red-Cross.jpeg
Trump refuses to label Putin a dictator	U.S. President Donald Trump chose not to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a dictator, responding to journalists on the sidelines of a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron on Feb. 24. &quot;I don&apos;t use those words lightly... I think we&apos;re going to see how it all works out,&quot; Trump said on Feb. 24 when asked if he would call Putin a dictator the same way he labeled President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 19. Trump called Ukrainian leader a &quot;dictator&quot; in a post on his social media platform Truth Social, accusing him of refusing to hold elections, and repeating false claims about the war in Ukraine. Trump&apos;s remarks disregard Ukraine&apos;s constitution which prohibits elections under martial law and echoed the narratives of Russian propaganda. Trump will meet with Zelensky within the next two weeks to finalize a minerals deal. Ukraine and the U.S. have been working out the terms of such a deal for weeks. Trump said in early February that he wanted to strike a deal with Ukraine involving access to rare earth minerals in exchange for continued aid. Trump later claimed that Kyiv has &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal. A former Ukrainian official described the initial deal as &quot;a colonial agreement.&quot; Following Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to meet Trump on Feb. 27.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-refuses-to-label-putin-a-dictator/	2025-02-24T13:54:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200644008.jpg
Nobody can demand anything from Russia' — Putin talks about renewed US-Russia contacts, rare earth metals	Russian President Vladimir Putin met with officials on Feb. 24 to discuss rare earth metals production, calling it a strategic reserve crucial for Russia&apos;s economic growth and global competitiveness. He emphasized the importance of the newly launched national project, &quot;New Materials and Chemistry,&quot; which aims to strengthen the domestic industry. The initiative seeks to develop a full-cycle rare and rare-earth metals sector, from extraction to high-tech manufacturing, with a significant increase in production. In an interview with Russian propagandist Pavel Zarubin published on Feb. 24, Putin followed up on the minerals topic, adding that any potential agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine over natural resources would not affect Russia. He pointed out that Russia has significantly larger reserves of rare earth metals than Ukraine is open to working with foreign partners in developing rare earth deposits, including in the occupied parts of Ukraine which Putin called &quot;newly controlled regions.&quot; Putin also suggested that U.S. President Donald Trump has greater freedom in handling Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine than European leaders. &quot;He doesn&#x2019;t just say what he thinks&#x2014;he does what he wants. That is the privilege of the leader of a great power,&quot; Kremlin leader said. While Russia and the U.S. must restore mutual trust, he added that no substantial talks with Trump on Ukraine had taken place. Putin also claimed that President Volodymyr Zelensky has become a &quot;toxic figure for Ukraine&#x2019;s armed forces who &quot;blocks peace efforts and weakens his country.&quot; He blamed Zelensky&#x2019;s &quot;absurd orders&quot; for the military&apos;s &quot;catastrophic losses&quot; and accused the Ukrainian president of avoiding negotiations to delay elections. Putin went on to dismiss Europe&apos;s concerns over U.S.-Russia talks. &quot;Nobody can demand anything from Russia, especially not Europe. Let them make demands of someone else. For centuries, they have been making demands of their vassals&#x2014;now their own people are making demands of them. They should sit at home and think about how they ended up in this situation,&quot; he said. Putin also welcomed Trump&#x2019;s proposal to cut defense spending, suggesting that Russia and the U.S. could agree to a 50% reduction.	https://kyivindependent.com/nobody-can-demand-anything-from-russia-putin-talks-about-renewed-us-russia-contacts-rare-earth-metals/	2025-02-24T13:30:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164023634.jpg
Ukraine war latest: War in Ukraine could end 'within weeks,' Putin open to peacekeepers, Trump claims	Key developments on Feb. 24: U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 24 that Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine could end &quot;within weeks&quot; and claimed Russian President Vladimir Putin would allow European peacekeepers to be stationed in Ukraine as part of a potential agreement. &quot;I think we could end it within weeks. If we&apos;re smart. If we&apos;re not smart, it&apos;ll keep going, and we&apos;ll keep losing young, beautiful people that shouldn&apos;t be dying,&quot; he said, speaking alongside French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House. Trump claimed the U.S. supported sending European troops to monitor a ceasefire and that he had discussed the proposal with Putin, who &quot;would accept it.&quot; When asked whether Ukraine should be willing to cede territory to Russia as part of a negotiated settlement, Trump responded, &quot;We&apos;ll see,&quot; noting that talks are still in the early stages. Macron said Europe is prepared to provide security guarantees to Ukraine, including peacekeepers, in case of a ceasefire. American and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 without Ukrainian or European participation, with a follow-up meeting scheduled for Feb. 25. Macron has recently rallied European counterparts to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to visit Washington later this week to meet with Trump. The U.K. is reportedly preparing to propose a plan to deploy 30,000 European peacekeepers to Ukraine as a post-ceasefire security guarantee. Macron has also led calls for a European-led mission to ensure stability in Ukraine. Trump has repeatedly said he wants Europe to take over responsibility for funding and overseeing Ukraine&apos;s security. His administration has also pressured Kyiv to sign a minerals deal with the U.S., which President Volodymyr Zelensky has criticized for offering no security guarantees in return. The UN General Assembly approved a Ukrainian resolution on Feb. 24 condemning Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, with 93 countries voting in favor and 18 against. The U.S., Israel, Hungary, Russia, and Belarus have voted against the resolution. The resolution, drafted by Kyiv and supported by all EU states except Hungary, reaffirms Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity. It explicitly names Russia as the aggressor. On the same day, the General Assembly passed a separate U.S. resolution marking the third anniversary of the invasion. That resolution also received 93 votes in favor but avoided directly calling Russia the aggressor. Ukraine abstained from voting on the U.S. version. According to Suspilne, Washington sent letters to UN member states urging them to support its resolution. The move aligns with recent U.S. efforts to soften language on Russia in international statements. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz both declined to explicitly name Russia as the aggressor in Fox News interviews. Hegseth referred to the war as &quot;a very complicated situation&quot; when asked if Russia attacked Ukraine unprovoked. U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia while adopting increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Kyiv. He recently called President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and falsely claimed Ukraine started the war &#x2014; before later conceding that &quot;Russia attacked, but they shouldn&#x2019;t have let him attack.&quot; The shift in U.S. language extends beyond the UN. The Financial Times reported that the U.S. opposed referring to Russia as the aggressor in a G7 statement commemorating the invasion&apos;s anniversary. European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen arrived in Kyiv on Feb. 24 on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. European leaders and other partners are arriving in Kyiv for a summit to discuss the country&apos;s strategy for possible negotiations and security guarantees. The meeting is taking place amid uncertainty about the U.S.&apos;s continued commitment to Ukraine&apos;s and Europe&apos;s security under President Donald Trump. &quot;We are in Kyiv today, because Ukraine is Europe,&quot; von der Leyen said on X. &quot;In this fight for survival, it is not only the destiny of Ukraine that is at stake. It&#x2019;s Europe&#x2019;s destiny.&quot; 0:00/1&#xD7;European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen arrived in Kyiv on Feb. 24, 2025, on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. (Ursula von der Leyen/X)Thirteen leaders are expected to join the summit in person, and 24 would join the event online, President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed at a press conference on Feb. 23. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, and Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal arrived soon after Costa and von der Leyen. Other leaders, including Finnish President Alexander Stubb, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere, Icelandic Prime Minister, Kristrun Frostadottir, and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson are also in the capital, Suspilne reported. Boris Johnson, the former U.K. prime minister, also announced his arrival. &quot;I am proud to be here in Kyiv on the third anniversary of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&#x2019;s invasion. I salute the continuing heroism of the Ukrainian people in resisting a vile act of unprovoked aggression and I categorically reject the bizarre untruths currently being peddled about the origins of that war,&quot; Johnson said on X. Around 165,000 Russian troops have been killed since the launch of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to a report by Meduza and Mediazona, independent Russian media outlets, on Feb. 24. Using open-source research and statistical analysis, the report suggests that Russian losses have increased each year. In 2022, approximately 20,000 Russian soldiers were killed. That number more than doubled in 2023, reaching between 47,000 and 53,000, and surged to nearly 100,000 in 2024. The assessment does not account for foreign fighters or conscripts from occupied Ukrainian territories, whom Russia forcibly recruits to replenish its forces. The estimate is based on comparing roll call lists of the deceased with Russia&apos;s Register of Inheritance Cases. Russia&apos;s total losses &#x2014; including killed, wounded, missing, and captured personnel &#x2014; are significantly higher, with Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 24 of 868,230 such cases. President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on Feb. 15 that Moscow had lost around 250,000 soldiers, with 20,000 killed in battles for Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast alone. Over 610,000 Russian troops have been wounded since the invasion began, according to Zelensky. Kyiv launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk in August 2024, initially seizing about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. Up to 12,000 North Korean soldiers were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces after they failed to push out Ukrainian troops. The rising casualties have fueled a surge in missing persons cases in Russia, with courts handling 20,000 such claims in 2024 &#x2014; two-and-a-half times the pre-war annual average, Mediazona reported on Feb. 4. Drones operated by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces struck an oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Ryazan Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 24. Kyiv considers oil refineries to be valid military targets, as profits from the fossil fuel industry fund Russia&apos;s war machine. This is the third time since the beginning of 2025 that drones have attacked the Ryazan Oil Refinery, according to the independent Telegram channel Astra. The Ryazan Oil Refining Company&apos;s facility was previously struck overnight on Jan. 24 and Jan. 26. At least five explosions were heard near the facility. According to preliminary data from the General Staff, the attack caused a fire near the primary oil processing facility. The full consequences of the attack are still being determined, according to the statement. Ryazan Oblast Governor Pavel Malkov confirmed that falling drone debris had caused a fire at &quot;one of the enterprises&quot; in the region. According to Malkov, no one was injured. Ryazan lies almost 500 kilometers (310 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border. The Ryazan Oil Refinery is one of Russia&apos;s five largest oil refining facilities, according to Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation. Its capacity is 17.1 million metric tons of oil per year. Kovalenko added that the fuel produced at the enterprise is used by the Russian army&apos;s strategic long-range aviation, which launches missile strikes against Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The Ryazan Oil Refinery previously suspended operations due to damage from Ukrainian drone attacks, Reuters reported on Jan. 27, citing two industry sources. Ukraine confirmed hitting the plant in an overnight drone strike on Jan. 24. Russia will agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine only once negotiations provide a &quot;sustainable result&quot; that &quot;suits&quot; the Russian leadership, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Feb. 24, Russian state-controlled news agency RIA Novosti reported. Lavrov&apos;s comments come as the White House said a peace deal with Russia could be hashed out this week. U.S. President Donald Trump has intensified diplomatic outreach to Russia, announcing a second round of talks in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 25. &quot;The president (Vladimir Putin) has clearly said that we are ready to negotiate with Ukraine, with Europe, and with any representatives who, in a spirit of goodwill, would like to help achieve peace,&quot; Lavrov claimed. &quot;But we will cease hostilities only when these negotiations produce a firm, sustainable result that suits the Russian Federation. Of course, the realities on the ground must be considered,&quot; Lavrov added. Lavrov added that consultations with U.S. officials on the reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and the Russian Embassy in Washington are scheduled for this week. Preparations are also underway for a meeting between Trump and Putin, Russia&apos;s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Feb. 22. Trump previously said he would &quot;probably&quot; meet Putin before the end of February. The U.S. held the first round of talks directly with Russia on Feb. 18, excluding Ukraine from the meeting. The decision sparked a backlash in Europe and Ukraine, with European leaders worried they were being sidelined by the U.S. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 24 he had provided U.S. President Donald Trump with a list of all ceasefires violated by Russia, warning against a quick peace deal without clear security guarantees. &quot;Peace cannot be concluded in an hour, a day, today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow,&quot; Zelensky said in an address to world leaders at the Support Ukraine summit in Kyiv. &quot;When General (Keith) Kellogg was in Kyiv, I handed him and the U.S. president a document with all the ceasefires, along with specific dates, that Russia had violated.&quot; According to Ukraine&apos;s president, Russia has violated 25 ceasefires since the start of its aggression in 2014. Zelensky&apos;s comments come amid growing concerns that Trump is seeking to sideline Ukraine and Europe in possible peace negotiations to cut a deal with Russia. U.S. and Russian delegates held talks in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 without Ukraine&apos;s participation, with a follow-up meeting scheduled for Feb. 25. While no specific plans for a peace deal were announced, Trump&apos;s diplomatic outreach to Moscow comes hand-in-hand with his increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Ukraine and Zelensky. The U.S. president has lambasted Zelensky as a &quot;dictator without elections,&quot; echoing Russian propaganda narratives about the latter&apos;s legitimacy. Trump&apos;s aides have also been pushing Kyiv to sign a deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, which Zelensky said provides no security guarantees in return. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly warned that a swift ceasefire deal without strong security guarantees, such as continued military support or NATO membership, would give Russia time to regain strength and resume its aggression at a later date. &quot;Therefore, peace must be based on balanced diplomacy and clear security guarantees,&quot; Zelensky said at the summit.

Despite growing Russian, US pressure, world rallies in support of Ukraine	Three years into Russia&#x2019;s all-out war, Ukraine is under increasing pressure from Russia on the battlefield and the U.S. in high cabinets. Russian troops have been gaining ground around Pokrovsk in Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk Oblast, while U.S. President Donald Trump has made increasingly hostile comments against President Volodymyr Zelensky in an attempt to force Ukraine to sign a deal that it doesn&#x2019;t want. But in these fights, Ukraine doesn&#x2019;t stand alone. On the days nearing the third anniversary, thousands of people around the world have taken to the streets their desire to show support for Ukraine and its fight for freedom. Ukrainian World Congress (UWC) told Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty on Feb. 24 that the demonstrations have been held in 78 countries, covering over 600 cities. Demonstrations were held in the EU, the U.S., Canada, as well as South Africa, Uruguay, Vietnam, Guatemala, Peru, Jordan, Indonesia, and Japan.	https://kyivindependent.com/the-world-rallies-in-support-of-ukraine/	2025-02-24T12:55:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200947529.jpg

Trump says Ukraine minerals deal to 'be signed very soon,' plans meeting Zelensky	U.S. President Donald Trump said in a Feb. 24 Truth Social post that he hopes the minerals deal with Ukraine &quot;will be signed very soon.&quot; Trump reiterated his push for a deal between the U.S. and Ukraine, arguing that it would help Kyiv&apos;s economy while ensuring that Washington &quot;recoups the tens of billions of dollars and military equipment sent to Ukraine.&quot; During a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House, Trump said he may soon meet President Volodymyr Zelensky to sign the agreement. He added that he expects Zelensky to visit Washington &quot;this week or next week.&quot; Trump&apos;s comments came after a virtual Group of Seven (G7) summit marking the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Zelensky spoke with Trump during the meeting and described their conversation as &quot;very good.&quot; A draft of the agreement, obtained by the New York Times, reportedly seeks 50% of revenues from Ukraine&apos;s natural resources without offering security commitments in return. Trump also claimed he was in &quot;serious discussions&quot; with Russian President Vladimir Putin on &quot;ending the war&quot; and on &quot;major economic development transactions between the United States and Russia.&quot; He added that &quot;talks are proceeding very well&quot; without providing further details. U.S. and Russian officials held talks in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 without Ukrainian participation, with a follow-up meeting scheduled for Feb. 25. While no formal peace proposals have been announced, Trump&apos;s diplomatic outreach to Moscow has coincided with increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Ukraine. Trump has accused Zelensky of being a &quot;dictator without elections,&quot; echoing Russian propaganda narratives about his legitimacy. His remarks ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-says-ukraine-minerals-deal-to-be-signed-very-soon-plans-meeting-with-zelensky/	2025-02-24T11:16:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170591813.jpg

He recently called President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and falsely claimed Ukraine started the war &#x2014; before later conceding that &quot;Russia attacked, but they shouldn&#x2019;t have let him attack.&quot; The shift in U.S. language extends beyond the UN. The Financial Times reported that the U.S. opposed referring to Russia as the aggressor in a G7 statement commemorating the invasion&apos;s anniversary.	https://kyivindependent.com/un-adopts-ukraines-resolution-condemning-russias-invasion-us-votes-against/	2025-02-24T10:00:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1676985291.jpg
How Ukraine has pushed back and held the line against Russia for 3 years	Elon Musk on Feb. 21 questioned why Ukraine was still actively defending itself amid the ongoing Russian full-scale invasion, suggesting the country&apos;s fight against the Kremlin&apos;s imperialist ambitions was, in fact, a giant money-making scam. &quot;What are they dying for? What exactly are they dying for? The line of engagement has barely moved for two years. People are dead in trenches, and for what?&quot; Musk said at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Without providing evidence and repeating unfounded claims, he added: &quot;I&apos;ll tell you what for, for the biggest graft machine I&apos;ve ever seen in my life.&quot; Three years ago, on Feb. 24, 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion against Ukraine in an attempt to wipe out the country and its people. Moscow&apos;s brutal invasion killed tens of thousands of Ukrainians, who have died defending their country&apos;s right to exist as a sovereign and democratic nation. On April 7, 2022, as Russia was pushed out of Kyiv&apos;s outskirts, Pentagon spokesperson Major General Pat Ryder said Russian President Vladimir Putin had &quot;achieved exactly zero of his objectives inside Ukraine.&quot; &quot;He didn&apos;t take Kyiv. He didn&apos;t topple the government. He didn&apos;t remove Ukraine as a nation state,&quot; he added. Three years on and this statement still holds true. In fact, Russia occupies less Ukrainian territory than it did when Ryder spoke. Before the start of the full-scale invasion, Russia occupied 7.1 percent of Ukrainian territory, according to U.S. intelligence assessments, consisting of the whole Crimean peninsula and around one-third of both Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. According to data from Ukrainian data journalism website Texty, the peak of Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine was in March 2022. On the 31st of that month, Moscow&apos;s forces controlled 167,223 square kilometers of Ukraine, just under 28% of the country&apos;s total land mass of 603,628 square kilometers. A comparison of occupied Ukrainian territory &#x2014; at its peak in March 2022 vs. February 2025 (Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)Due to the fast moving nature of Russian advances in February 2022, there is no reliable data for how much land Moscow&apos;s forces fully controlled in the first few days of the full-scale invasion. Russia had advanced in the north, south, and east of Ukraine, with the northern push aiming to take the capital of Kyiv. Due to fierce Ukrainian resistance, this advance quickly stalled, and Russia was forced into a humiliating retreat at the beginning of April 2022, giving up around 40% of the land taken since Feb. 24, and exposing the myth of Russia&apos;s military superpower status. Moscow&apos;s initial advances in the south and east saw large parts of Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Kharkiv, and Luhansk oblasts fall under Russian control. But lightning Ukrainian counteroffensives launched in late summer 2022, saw Kyiv retake control of great swathes of land including the cities of Kherson. Russia illegally annexed Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts on Sept. 30, 2022, despite controlling none of the regions in full. At the beginning of 2023, Russia occupied 108,928 sq kilometers, or just over 18.04% of Ukrainian territory, according to the DeepState monitoring group. A long-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive launched in June 2023 stalled, and since then, the war in Ukraine has settled largely into one of attrition as Kyiv holds the line against Moscow&apos;s forces. Russian losses vs. Ukrainian land occupied. (The Kyiv Independent)One notable exception was Ukraine&apos;s surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. According to Russian General Staff officer Sergei Rudsky, Ukrainian soldiers are in control of about 500 square kilometers (193 square miles) out of 1,268 square kilometers (490 square miles) initially seized by Kyiv. As of Feb. 23, 2025, Russia occupies 112,333 sq kilometers, 18.61% of Ukrainian territory, with the small gains made in grinding advances in eastern Ukraine, taken at huge cost. According to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, Russia has lost 868,230 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. They are broadly in line with estimates from Western nations. Around 165,000 Russian troops have been killed since the launch of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to a report by Meduza and Mediazona, independent Russian media outlets, on Feb. 24. Russia&apos;s rate of advance has slowed over the last three months, and according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), at this speed, it would take Russia more than 83 years to capture the rest of Ukraine. &quot;Assuming that they can sustain massive personnel losses indefinitely,&quot; it added. Three years of war have also cost Ukraine dearly &#x2014; more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, and 380,000 have been injured, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with NBC published on Feb. 16.	https://kyivindependent.com/how-ukraine-has-pushed-back-and-held-the-line-against-russia-for-3-years/	2025-02-24T09:47:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2192693446.jpg
EU imports of Russian fossil fuels exceeded aid to Ukraine in third year of the Russian invasion, report says	The EU paid 21.9 billion euros ($22.9 billion) for Russian fossil fuel imports in the third year of Moscow&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, just a 1% year-on-year drop in volumes, according to a new report by the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) published on Feb. 24. The total of Russian imports exceeds the 18.7 billion euros ($19.6 billion) in financial aid that Europe sent to Ukraine in 2024, said the report, published on the third anniversary of the full-scale invasion. While Europe began reducing its dependence on Russian energy after Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Gazprom gradually cut flows to the EU to pressure Ukraine&apos;s allies, the EU has continued to fuel the Kremlin&#x2019;s war chest with imports of Russian fossil fuels. &quot;Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Europe has made significant progress in terms of energy independence. Imports of Russian oil and gas have decreased substantially, with gas imports dropping from 45% in 2021 to 18% in 2024,&#x201D; said Thomas Pellerin-Carlin, EU Parliament member, in a comment for the report. &#x201C;However, a quarter of Russia&apos;s fossil fuel export revenues still come from Europe.&quot; Despite reduction efforts, EU member states spent 7 billion euros ($7.3 billion) on Russian natural gas in the third year of the full-scale invasion, with volumes rising 9% compared to the previous year. Stronger sanctions could cut the Kremlin&apos;s fossil fuel revenues by 51 billion euros ($53.3 billion) annually, effectively reducing profits, said CREA. Russia&apos;s total global fossil fuel revenue reached 242 billion euros ($253 billion) in the third year of the full-scale invasion, mainly due to its increased use of &quot;shadow&quot; tankers to transport oil to new markets, bypassing oil price caps. &quot;Due to insufficient sanctions and loopholes, Russia has earned over 825 billion euros ($862.9 billion) from fossil fuel exports since the start of their invasion of Ukraine,&quot; said Isaac Levi, Europe-Russia Energy policy analyst of CREA. &quot;Sanctioning countries are fueling the very war that&apos;s killing their allies in Ukraine,&quot; Levi said. The European Union on Feb. 24 approved its 16th package of sanctions imposed against Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, targeting Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of oil tankers, banks, aluminum imports, and other sectors. &quot;The West&#x2019;s strategic priority should be to impose sanctions on as many Russian shadow oil vessels as possible,&quot; said Petras Katinas, energy analyst at CREA. &quot;Targeting these ships would not only curtail Moscow&#x2019;s revenue from a key export but also strengthen leverage to enforce or adjust the price cap mechanism.&quot; EU members Slovakia, Hungary, and Czechia continue exploiting exemptions, importing 4.9 billion euros ($5.1 billion) of Russian pipeline oil in the third year. &quot;This isn&apos;t about technical constraints, but about putting profits from discounted Russian crude ahead of European security,&quot; said CREA analyst Luke Wickenden. Three countries now dominate Russian fossil fuel purchases: China (78 billion euros or $81.6 billion), India (49 billion euros or $51.3 billion), and Turkey (34 billion euros or $35.6 billion), accounting for 74% of Russia&apos;s fossil fuel revenues.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-imports-of-russian-fuels-exceed-financial-aid-to-ukraine-in-third-year-of-the-russian-invasion-report-says/	2025-02-24T09:25:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2159134814.jpg
Trump’s Ukraine rare earths deal: 'The art of the steal'	Among the bombshells coming out of the Trump administration in its first month in office is the president&#x2019;s demand that Ukraine pledge $500 billion worth of mineral resources to the United States in return for American support. U.S. President Donald Trump appears to see this as payback for vastly exaggerated sums of American military and financial assistance provided to Ukraine since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion three years ago. As always, the devil is in the details when assessing how such a deal might work. It is true that the Ukrainian government, as the sovereign owner of mineral rights, can sign agreements for development consistent with Ukrainian laws and the constitution. However, the U.S. government, which is the counterparty to the draft memorandum proposed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Kyiv on Feb. 12, does not invest directly in mining projects &#x2014; especially those overseas. Presumably, Trump envisions the American private sector extracting Ukrainian resources included in the memorandum. Investors in mineral, oil, and gas development (a field I worked in for decades) must conduct detailed geological surveys, assay the quality of the ore or source rocks, carry out pilot projects and feasibility studies, and perform other due diligence to determine whether any project is commercially viable. Normally, it takes five to 10 years, including regulatory approvals, to reach a final investment decision and secure financing. It is difficult to estimate how long this would take in a war-torn country whose territorial integrity is under attack. If conceding to demands on critical minerals is a condition for security support, then America is no different from Russia&#x2019;s Wagner Group of mercenaries. The whole concept is a mirage &#x2014; or worse, a head fake. It is reminiscent of what Trump said in 2019 during his first term about why he was keeping American troops in Syria: &#x201C;I like oil, we&#x2019;re keeping the oil.&#x201D; Observers were left wondering how he planned to seize Syria&#x2019;s oil production, which in any case was not significant. Of course, nothing came of it. Now, Trump is fixated on Ukraine&#x2019;s rare earths. The total value of rare earths produced globally is estimated at $15 billion a year. It is hard to imagine how $500 billion in value could be extracted from Ukrainian rare earths. Perhaps Trump is confusing rare earths with critical minerals, such as titanium, base metals, and oil and gas, which may be included in the draft memorandum. These resources require larger-scale, long-term investments, and restoring peace and stability is a prerequisite. In 2010, the Pentagon estimated Afghanistan had $1 trillion in mineral deposits. Another decade of American presence in Afghanistan did not lead to their development. A memorandum granting rights to speculative Ukrainian minerals is just as worthless.

(Evgeniy Maloletka/Bloomberg via Getty Images)The U.S. has more important national interests in Ukraine than extracting economic benefits from transactions that are impossible to execute. Does the Trump administration understand this &#x2014; or is it setting up Ukraine for abandonment under the pretext that Kyiv is unwilling to accept Washington&#x2019;s new terms for continued support? That such basic questions can be asked after Russia&#x2019;s initial invasion in 2014 reflects Washington&#x2019;s policy confusion about why assisting Ukraine defends core American interests. This is a bipartisan failure, as demonstrated by President Joe Biden&#x2019;s timid and incremental military support for Ukraine and weak sanctions against Russia. Ironically, Biden left Trump with a stronger hand by finally enacting tougher sanctions on Jan. 10 before leaving office. Trump could use strict sanctions enforcement as leverage on Russia to reach a just settlement acceptable to Ukraine. Instead of pressuring the victim, he should pressure the aggressor. Given the sorry state of Russia&#x2019;s military and economy, Putin is desperate to declare victory and pocket any gains handed to him. If this were a game of poker, Putin would be bluffing with a weak hand &#x2014; while Trump is poised to fold without even looking at his own stronger hand. The danger to Ukraine is obvious, but the risks to America&#x2019;s global standing are just as great. If America betrays both its principles and its own interests in Ukraine, every nation will have to recalibrate its relationship with the U.S. Allies and partners would reevaluate the value of American commitments to them, while adversaries would be emboldened to test America&#x2019;s resolve. Putin overreached after America&#x2019;s abrupt and chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the world became a more dangerous place. Losing in Europe would turn the idea of America refocusing on the Asia-Pacific into a sick joke.

Zelensky, Trump have 'good' conversation during G7 meeting	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

In 3 years of war, Ukraine's mothers have been forced underground	As Ukraine reaches the three-year mark since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, the impact on women&#x2019;s health &#x2014; and especially maternal health &#x2014; has grown increasingly dire. Missiles and drone attacks strike without warning, putting pregnant women and their newborns at constant risk. In areas closer to the front line, the challenges are even greater, with higher rates of premature births, a lack of consistent medical services, and overwhelming mental stress that reverberates through every aspect of daily life. I recently learned of Ira, a 31-year-old mother already raising a six-year-old boy when she discovered she was pregnant with triplets. Living in Kherson Oblast, a region routinely targeted by nighttime assaults, she and her husband faced a terrifying dilemma: endure the pregnancy amid constant shelling or uproot their entire lives. Ultimately, Ira gave birth prematurely. Though her babies initially required intensive care, they recovered and were able to leave the hospital. Her relief at their safe arrival mirrored the resolve of countless Ukrainian mothers who persist in bringing new life into the world despite difficult odds. Yet Ira&#x2019;s story is part of a broader crisis. Maternal health is consistently threatened by damaged hospitals, infrastructure, staff shortages, and the simple but devastating reality that an air raid can happen at any moment &#x2014; interrupting childbirth or prenatal care. According to 2023 data, the national rate of preterm births is around 6%, but in hard-hit regions such as Kherson Oblast, that rate rises to 11.8% &#x2014; nearly double the national average. Kherson also has the highest stillbirth rate in Ukraine. Doctors working in these conditions consistently link high stress levels to the uptick in adverse outcomes. Because of the environment, there is a need for bunkered maternity wards in areas close to the front lines. Facilities in Kharkiv and Kherson are setting up reinforced underground units designed to protect women in labor from shelling. These structures, supported by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the organization&#x2019;s sexual and reproductive health agency, allow full perinatal services to continue even during attacks, relieving pregnant women of the need to relocate in the middle of childbirth. A woman sits in a bomb shelter after a maternity ward moved underground for safety in Kharkiv, Ukraine, on March 25, 2022. (Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times)The Kherson City Perinatal Centre, for example, has been hit by shelling three times since the invasion began &#x2014; an unsettling reminder that medical facilities are still not safe. By creating safer underground spaces, staff and patients can focus on care rather than constant evacuation plans. Medical teams in these vulnerable areas are brave. Some, like the staff at Kherson&#x2019;s maternity hospital, have chosen not to leave despite the dangers. They know their departure could mean an absence of care for expectant mothers who decide to stay in their hometowns. As one obstetrician noted, many pregnant women refuse offers to relocate because they would rather remain in familiar surroundings and trust local doctors. There is a shared commitment to preserving a sense of normalcy &#x2014; even when bombs continue to fall. Unfortunately, the war does more than threaten physical safety. Psychological distress has become widespread. According to the UN&#x2019;s humanitarian coordination office, 63% of households in Ukraine report at least one mental health challenge &#x2014; ranging from anxiety to severe depression. Constant shelling, economic hardship, and the fear of future attacks compound these issues. For pregnant women, the added stress can increase the risk of complications and postpartum disorders. Such an environment also increases the prevalence of gender-based violence (GBV). Economic uncertainty and relentless fear fuel intimate partner violence, domestic abuse, and sexual exploitation. An estimated 2.4 million people in Ukraine &#x2014; most of them women and girls &#x2014; need GBV prevention and response services. UNFPA supports these interventions, however, while the war continues, international actors, community-based organizations, and health providers struggle to meet the rising demand. We know that safeguarding women&#x2019;s health is essential for any nation&#x2019;s future. Ensuring safe births today means ensuring a resilient generation tomorrow. By constructing bomb-proof maternity wards, delivering comprehensive healthcare, and expanding mental health and GBV services, Ukraine can mitigate some of the conflict&#x2019;s harshest effects. Yet none of these measures can fully substitute for the one factor that truly guarantees the well-being of mothers and newborns: lasting peace. Peace is the foundation on which we can work toward justice. Until it is achieved, we have a duty to support the well-being of women and families &#x2014; on the surface and underground.

Women account for 21% of applicants at Ukraine's army recruitment centers	Women make up 21% of applicants at Ukraine&apos;s army recruitment centers, the Defense Ministry said on Feb. 24. Since the centers began operations, 42,366 Ukrainians have applied, with the highest number of female candidates coming from western Chernivtsi, Khmelnytskyi, and Ternopil oblasts. Among all applicants, the most sought-after positions include drone operators, drivers, and shooting specialities. Ukraine currently operates 48 recruitment centers, including one online platform, to guide and support potential recruits. While Kyiv passed a major draft reform bill in April, mobilization slowed in the fall, leaving front-line units depleted. Russian forces have maintained an overwhelming numerical advantage, allowing them to advance in eastern Ukraine despite sustaining heavy casualties. Despite their persistent offensives, Russian forces have not achieved a major breakthrough, while Ukrainian defenses remain under constant pressure across multiple front-line sectors. Ukraine&apos;s government approved a one-year contract for volunteers aged 18-24 on Feb. 11, aiming to boost recruitment with financial incentives and social benefits.	https://kyivindependent.com/women-account-for-21-of-applicants-at-ukraines-army-recruitment-centers-defense-ministry-reports/	2025-02-24T08:40:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/valkiriya_training-17.jpg
Lithuania's Nauseda proposes 2030 as Ukraine's EU accession date	Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda proposed on Feb. 24 setting Jan. 1, 2030, as the official date for Ukraine&#x2019;s accession to the European Union. Speaking at the Support Ukraine summit in Kyiv, Nauseda called for decisive leadership to accelerate Ukraine&apos;s integration. &quot;The security of Europe depends on the security of Ukraine. That is why let us accelerate Ukraine&apos;s accession to the EU,&quot; Nauseda said. He added that the first cluster of accession talks could be opened in the coming weeks and urged European leaders to make Ukraine&apos;s path to the bloc &quot;inevitable.&quot; Ukraine applied for EU membership in 2022, shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion. The country achieved candidate status within months, and formal negotiations began in June 2024. President Volodymyr Zelensky has set an ambitious goal of opening five or six negotiation clusters in 2025, with the first phase expected under Poland&apos;s rotating EU presidency. EU Enlargement Commissioner Oliver Varhelyi previously suggested that Ukraine could join the bloc by 2029 if it successfully implements the necessary reforms. Ukraine&apos;s EU accession process is structured around six negotiation clusters, covering various political and economic reforms. The country aims to open at least two or three clusters in early 2025, with additional progress expected under Denmark&apos;s EU Council presidency in the latter half of the year.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuanias-nauseda-proposes-2030-as-ukraines-eu-accession-date/	2025-02-24T07:52:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2095080149.jpg

‘It’s not the end’ — Kyiv Independent staff on what they’d tell themselves right before Russia's invasion	Feb. 24, 2025 marks three years of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Three years since Ukraine, and the world, ceased to exist as we knew them. Kyiv Independent staff members have answered the question, &quot;If you could go back in time, what would you tell yourself on the eve of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion?&quot; The following reflections offer a window into the profound impact this war has had on a group of people covering the war &#x2014; and a nation &#x2014; changed forever. I would tell myself that everything about your life will change tomorrow: your understanding of war, peace, and life. And that you made a good call convincing your parents not to return to Ukraine, where they had been living, because you had good instincts about what was to come. Don&#x2019;t freak out, but the war that is about to consume your life is way worse than you could have ever imagined. The most important thing is that you know you are not alone. You have friends and colleagues who will be there for you, so just keep taking one step at a time. You are only a 21-year-old university student who just stepped into the world of journalism. Nothing is expected of you. So just cherish the last few hours in peace, the calm before the storm before the innocence of youth is taken away from you. Make sure that you are comfortable with the risk you are taking, and follow your gut &#x2014; it can sometimes save lives. Don&#x2019;t panic, and stay true to yourself. You will lose many friends to war, you will attend funerals for the first time, and you will witness horrifying scenes that you were always scared to watch in war movies. But you are loved, and there will be beautiful moments amid the uncertainty and darkness that shine so brightly. You will discover more about yourself along the way. But also, leave the Kyiv Independent office a little earlier on Feb. 23 so that you can get a good sleep in (I left at 2 a.m. on Feb. 24 and the invasion started a few hours later).

(Roman Pilipey/Getty Images)Toma Istomina, deputy chief editor I didn&#x2019;t sleep on Feb. 24, 2022. The days leading up to the full-scale invasion were already crazy enough to keep me in the office until late at night, and by late I mean past 2 a.m. By the time I got home, it was already clear that tonight was the night when Russia would go through with its sick plan. Just 30 minutes before the first explosions rocked Kyiv and Russian tanks started rolling over Ukrainian borders from all sides, I published a post on Instagram, saying: &#x201C;Again and again we prove to have something Russia can only envy. We are united, we are courageous, and our values prevail in the face of hundreds of thousands of fully equipped troops encircling our country. We might have been unfortunate to share a border with Russia. But we are damn fortunate to have each other. And nobody will ever take that away.&#x201D; Three years later, after everything we&#x2019;ve been through, I couldn&#x2019;t say it better. If I could go back in time to the eve of the full-scale invasion, I would take my own phone, open that post, and read it out loud to myself, with a lot of confidence. No words could have truly prepared me for the horror to come, but knowing my future self stood by this vision might have made it easier to see the light ahead. Oh, and I would tell myself to call our developers and ask them to prepare our website for record traffic at 5 a.m. Waking them up after the full-scale invasion had already started to fix our crashed website? A bit awkward. A woman carries a girl past the heavily damaged Ohmatdyt Children&apos;s Hospital after a Russian missile attack in Kyiv, Ukraine, on July 8, 2024. (Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)Natalia Yermak, reporterI had a picnic on a frozen lake with my friends on the eve of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. We fried eggs and sausages over a fire. I would have told myself in that moment that my old life was about to end forever. But I will not be the only one. I&#x2019;d also tell myself that my first impression of the war &#x2014; that it is bigger than just Ukraine, and will change people&#x2019;s lives all over the world &#x2014; will prove more true than ever in a few years. There are so many stories of strength and compassion that I&#x2019;ll see over three years, and so many tragedies &#x2014; more than I ever thought I could handle. Telling these stories will help me to get through. They&#x2019;ll stay with me, and hopefully, with you, our readers, so that one day, when you or I get to have a picnic with friends, we remember the people who stood up to evil to protect the good in our lives, and we ask ourselves: What can I do to repay them?

(Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)Elsa Court, audience development managerI&#x2019;d tell myself that it&#x2019;s going to feel like the end. It&#x2019;s going to feel like there is no hope, that Ukraine will be completely occupied, that you will never see Kyiv again. You&#x2019;re also going to feel powerless watching what is happening from abroad, like seeing a tsunami or earthquake rip into a piece of land from afar. You will feel like you are standing there, frozen, as the unthinkable happens, and an unstoppable force swallows Ukraine. But just because this is how it feels, doesn&#x2019;t mean it&#x2019;s true. First of all, it&#x2019;s not the end &#x2014; it&#x2019;s only the beginning, and not just for Ukraine, but for all of Europe. You are going to see Kyiv again (in fact, you will move there two years later). And you will find working at the Kyiv Independent will make you feel like you have some impact, at least on how other non-Ukrainians like you understand Ukraine and Russia&#x2019;s war. You will also find out that Russia is not an unstoppable force &#x2014; but so far, only Ukrainians have dared to stop it. You will become a lot less fatalist after moving to Ukraine &#x2014; there&#x2019;s something about being surrounded by people who continue to live, regardless of their neighbor&#x2019;s best effort to kill them, that will change your attitude. That doesn&#x2019;t mean feelings of hopelessness will ever go away. When I feel particularly hopeless, a good Ukrainian friend tells me, &#x201C;Elsa, do kinstya&#x201D; &#x2014; Ukrainian for &quot;keep going, until the end.&quot; After three years, you still won&#x2019;t know for sure when, or where, the end will be.

You know what&#x2019;s coming &#x2014; you have no doubt. But you aren&#x2019;t ready for the full extent of Russia&#x2019;s cruelty. Prepare yourself for the fact that the country you were born in won&#x2019;t help the country you love as much as it can or should. And its next president? He might betray us completely. Prepare yourself to constantly worry about your friends on the front line, and to struggle with the dual feelings of gratitude and guilt from having some semblance of a normal life thanks to them. Prepare yourself to see a video, after a Russian attack, where your friend is clearly not going to make it. It can happen again. It can happen to anyone you know &#x2014; even you. The fact that you will spend two weeks in Kharkiv without hearing a single explosion is dumb luck. Still, you should not shrug off every air raid siren like you will in Chernivtsi. You should not become so acclimated to the sounds of war. Prepare yourself &#x2014; because you will have a child. And no matter what happens, you won&#x2019;t be allowed to cry about any of this in front of her. Your job will be to teach her to cherish her culture above all else, to hate Russia for bringing war to her lands, and most importantly, to survive.

I&#x2019;d also tell myself that this war concerns the whole world; there is no justice, but you should never lose hope and always act. Back then, on the first day of Russia&#x2019;s all-out invasion, as a Ukrainian and a journalist, I was sure that the world would not just sit by and watch; it would give us all the weapons we needed, close the skies, and do everything to stop Russia from destroying my nation. But this did not happen. I would tell myself that it was in fact Ukraine &#x2014; not other countries that are richer and have more means &#x2014; that would be the most powerful and decisive in the moment, even as it seemed it was about to fall into Russia&#x2019;s hands. Will was the only weapon that Russia did not have and will never have. Ukrainian military chaplains attend their graduation at Saint Sophia&apos;s Cathedral in Kyiv, Ukraine, on June 23, 2023. (Roman Pilipey/Getty Images)Dominic Culverwell, business reporter I would tell myself to be mentally prepared for a hard and emotional three years. And to be strong because tomorrow morning, you are going to wake up and have a panic attack, but just know that your friends are going to survive the battle of Kyiv and the occupation of Bucha. You are also going to meet some of the most incredible people and make amazing friends. Ukrainians are going to teach you so much about strength and unity but be prepared for a dark shift in your humor &#x2014; it&apos;s a coping mechanism, so don&apos;t be alarmed. Ukrainians are good at cracking a joke in bleak times. I&#x2019;d tell myself that there&apos;s a long road ahead and moving to Kyiv during the war will be one of the best decisions you&apos;ve ever made. Even though the night-time drone and missile attacks are exhausting and the stories you hear are emotionally gutting, you won&apos;t ever question your decision.	https://kyivindependent.com/its-not-the-end-what-kyiv-independent-journalists-would-tell-themselves-on-the-eve-of-russias-full-scale-invasion-3-years-ago/	2025-02-24T07:33:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196727689.jpg
Around 165,000 Russian troops killed in Ukraine, media reports	Around 165,000 Russian troops have been killed since the launch of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to a report by Meduza and Mediazona, independent Russian media outlets, on Feb. 24. Using open-source research and statistical analysis, the report suggests that Russian losses have increased each year. In 2022, approximately 20,000 Russian soldiers were killed. That number more than doubled in 2023, reaching between 47,000 and 53,000, and surged to nearly 100,000 in 2024. The assessment does not account for foreign fighters or conscripts from occupied Ukrainian territories, whom Russia forcibly recruits to replenish its forces. The estimate is based on comparing roll call lists of the deceased with Russia&apos;s Register of Inheritance Cases. Russia&apos;s total losses &#x2014; including killed, wounded, missing, and captured personnel &#x2014; are significantly higher, with Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 24 of 868,230 such cases. President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on Feb. 15 that Moscow had lost around 250,000 soldiers, with 20,000 killed in battles for Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast alone. Over 610,000 Russian troops have been wounded since the invasion began, according to Zelensky. Kyiv launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk in August 2024, initially seizing about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. Up to 12,000 North Korean soldiers were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces after they failed to push out Ukrainian troops. The rising casualties have fueled a surge in missing persons cases in Russia, with courts handling 20,000 such claims in 2024 &#x2014; two-and-a-half times the pre-war annual average, Mediazona reported on Feb. 4.	https://kyivindependent.com/around-165-000-russian-troops-killed-in-ukraine-media-reports/	2025-02-24T07:03:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1242120665.jpg
Russia has launched over 30 mass strikes on Ukraine's energy system in 3 years, ministry says	Russia has launched more than 30 mass strikes on Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure over the three years of its full-scale invasion, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said on Feb. 24. &quot;Each large-scale attack on the energy sector involves 100-200, and now 3,00 different munitions that simultaneously hit power generation facilities, substations, power lines, and gas infrastructure,&quot; Halushchenko wrote on Facebook. Russia continues to target Ukrainian energy infrastructure, testing Ukraine&apos;s resolve as the country is enduring another winter. Material losses from Russian attacks have amounted to &quot;billions of dollars,&quot; according to the minister. &quot;Russia is committing crimes by attacking facilities critical to the operation of nuclear power plants, threatening to cause a nuclear disaster,&quot; Halushchenko said. Over the past three years, Russian troops have occupied territories hosting energy facilities producing 18 gigawatts (GW) of generation. The occupied facilities include hydroelectric power plants, thermal power plants, and Europe&apos;s largest nuclear power plant, stationed in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Halushchenko added. &quot;No other energy system in the world has faced such challenges. Yet, despite Russia&apos;s unbridled desire to destroy our infrastructure, the Ukrainian energy system remains intact and functioning,&quot; the minister said. The Russian military regularly attacks Ukrainian cities and villages with drones, missiles, glide bombs, and artillery. Moscow&apos;s attacks have resulted in heavy civilian casualties and destroyed hospitals, schools, kindergartens, and energy and water supply facilities. Despite the overwhelming evidence, the Russian government has denied that its army is targeting civilian targets.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-has-launched-over-30-mass-strikes-on-ukraines-energy-system-during-3-years-of-war-ministry-says/	2025-02-24T06:17:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1244055383-16661182035zpcg.jpg
When your 'ass is burning, you start to move faster' — Lithuanian minister urges Europe to step up defense	Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene urged European countries on Feb. 24 to &quot;move faster&quot; in strengthening their security in the light of recent geopolitical shifts. Speaking in the context of Russian aggression in Ukraine and Europe&apos;s need to boost its defense capabilities, Sakaliene said, &quot;When you feel that your own ass is burning, you start to move faster.&quot; &quot;So I do hope that we will start to move faster in the next few months,&quot; Lithuania&apos;s defense chief said at the YES conference event held in Kyiv by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation on Feb. 24, the third anniversary of the Russian full-scale invasion. The comments come as European leaders and other partners gather in Kyiv to devise a common strategy for Ukraine&apos;s security and pledge further assistance. The stability of the pro-Ukraine coalition grows uncertain as U.S. President Donald Trump intensifies diplomatic outreach to Moscow while sidelining Ukraine and Europe, casting doubt on his commitment to Ukrainian security. &quot;We need to strengthen our transatlantic bond. Even though we are a dysfunctional family, a divorce is not an option,&quot; Sakaliene said at the event, which was attended by the Kyiv Independent. In contrast, Lithuania&apos;s former foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, said at the conference that &quot;Europe has to understand we are in this fight most likely alone, there&#x2019;s us and Ukrainians and no one else. We pick up this battle or lose.&quot; &quot;Is Europe actually alive? If it still hasn&apos;t woken up, what&#x2019;s happening with the patient?&quot; Landsbergis said. Lithuania&apos;s former diplomacy chief urged Europe to confiscate the roughly $200 billion in frozen assets frozen in European accounts and deploy peacekeepers on the ground in Ukraine. &quot;The only question that remains is whether we ask Putin for permission. It&#x2019;s not a joke. Leaders in Europe say, &apos;We will send troops if (Russian President Vladimir) Putin allows it.&apos; This is the mentality, and we need to break it,&quot; Landsbergis said. Calls for confiscating frozen Russian assets and taking more decisive steps against Russia were also supported by businessman and oligarch Viktor Pinchuk, the host of the conference. &quot;Europe needs to completely change its understanding of this moment and do something simple but revolutionary&#x2014;use $300 billion frozen Russian assets for Ukraine, increase the military budget at least to 3%, spend much more money on supporting Ukraine and your own defense, send soldiers to Ukraine, and take Ukraine into the EU now, not later,&quot; Pinchuk said at the event. &quot;This is the right response to this moment. You are not just witnesses to this moment; you are participants.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/when-your-ass-is-burning-you-start-to-move-faster-lithuanian-minister-urges-europe-to-move-faster-on-defense/	2025-02-24T05:53:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2189744856.jpg
US reportedly urges UN to back its Ukraine resolution not naming Russia as aggressor	The U.S. sent a letter to U.N. member states asking them to vote for the American version of a resolution marking the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine that does not name Moscow as the aggressor, Suspilne reported on Feb. 24, citing an obtained text of the letter. According to the letter, Washington calls for a vote against &quot;any other option or amendments presented during the 11th emergency special session on Feb. 24, 2025.&quot; The news underscores Washington&apos;s shifting views on the Russia-Ukraine war since the accession of President Donald Trump. According to reporting from last week, the U.S. allegedly refused to co-sponsor a U.N. resolution on Russia&apos;s all-out war, which reaffirms Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity and condemns Moscow&apos;s aggression. More than 50 countries, including all EU states and Ukraine, are the authors of the collective draft. It calls Russia an aggressor country and demands that it withdraw its troops from all of Ukraine&apos;s territory. The U.N. General Assembly is expected to consider the two resolutions on Russia&apos;s war later on Feb. 24. The U.S. version of the resolution, dubbed the &quot;Path to Peace,&quot; reportedly does not name Russia as the aggressor but calls for &quot;an immediate end to the conflict.&quot; Moscow proposed adding a phrase to this sentence &#x2014; &quot;including by addressing its root causes,&quot; the media outlet reported. The authors of the collective and competing resolution proposed to replace the word &quot;conflict&quot; with &quot;Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine&quot; and to call for a &quot;just lasting peace&quot; instead of merely a &quot;lasting peace.&quot; Last week, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz avoided directly naming Russia the aggressor in its war against Ukraine in interviews with Fox News. The Pentagon chief acknowledged there was &quot;an invasion into Ukraine&quot; without naming Russia. When asked if it&apos;s fair to say that Russia attacked Ukraine without provocation in 2022, Hegseth replied that it&apos;s &quot;fair to say it&#x2019;s a very complicated situation.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed to mediate a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia while using increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Kyiv. He dubbed President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and accused Ukraine of starting the war. Soon after, Trump admitted that Russia launched a full-scale war by attacking Ukraine. &quot;Russia attacked, but they shouldn&apos;t have let him attack,&quot; Trump said. The U.S. also opposed directly calling Russia the &quot;aggressor&quot; in a G7 statement devoted to the anniversary of the invasion, according to the Financial Times, which marked the first time the U.S. has pushed back on such language.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-urges-un-members-to-vote-for-american-version-of-resolution-on-russias-war-resists-aggressor-lable-media-reports/	2025-02-24T05:43:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1676985291.jpg
Spain to provide Ukraine with military aid package worth over $1 billion in 2025	Spain will deliver a new 1 billion euro ($1.04 billion) military aid package to Ukraine in 2025, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced on Feb. 24 during the Support Ukraine summit in Kyiv. Sanchez announced the new military aid during his visit to Kyiv on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;We are ready to continue to provide military assistance and equipment with even more determination than we have in the past. I am ready to announce a new package of military assistance to Ukraine worth 1 billion euros ($1.04 billion) in 2025,&quot; Sanchez said. The new package will be provided as part of a 10-year bilateral security agreement signed between Ukraine and Spain in May 2024. Last year, Madrid also provided over 1 billion euros ($1.04 billion) in military aid to Ukraine, according to the Spanish government&apos;s statement. Speaking in Kyiv, Sanchez said that Spain will work with Ukraine on its post-war recovery, encourage its companies to participate in Ukraine&apos;s projects and programs, and address the needs of the Ukrainian diaspora. &quot;We must ensure that Ukraine joins the EU soon. Ukraine&apos;s accession to the EU is the biggest victory for the Ukrainian people,&quot; he added. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Antonio Costa, leaders of the Baltic States, Spain, and Canada, as well as leaders of Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, arrived in Kyiv for the international summit on the morning of Feb. 24, the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Nordic countries announced new humanitarian and military aid for Ukraine the same day.	https://kyivindependent.com/spain-to-provide-ukraine-with-new-military-aid-package-worth-over-1-billion-in-2025/	2025-02-24T05:07:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201111218.jpg
Moscow open to ceasefire only when talks yield results that 'suit Russia,' Lavrov says	Russia will agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine only once negotiations provide a &quot;sustainable result&quot; that &quot;suits&quot; the Russian leadership, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Feb. 24, Russian state-controlled news agency RIA Novosti reported. Lavrov&apos;s comments come as the White House said a peace deal with Russia could be hashed out this week. U.S. President Donald Trump has intensified diplomatic outreach to Russia, announcing a second round of talks in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 25. &quot;The president (Vladimir Putin) has clearly said that we are ready to negotiate with Ukraine, with Europe, and with any representatives who, in a spirit of goodwill, would like to help achieve peace,&quot; Lavrov claimed. &quot;But we will cease hostilities only when these negotiations produce a firm, sustainable result that suits the Russian Federation. Of course, the realities on the ground must be considered,&quot; Lavrov added. Lavrov added that consultations with U.S. officials on the reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and the Russian Embassy in Washington are scheduled for this week. Preparations are also underway for a meeting between Trump and Putin, Russia&apos;s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Feb. 22. Trump previously said he would &quot;probably&quot; meet Putin before the end of February. The U.S. held the first round of talks directly with Russia on Feb. 18, excluding Ukraine from the meeting. The decision sparked a backlash in Europe and Ukraine, with European leaders worried they were being sidelined by the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/hostilities-to-end-only-when-negotiations-yield-result-that-satisfies-russia-lavrov-says/	2025-02-24T04:59:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2050986119.jpg

Boris Johnson backs Trump's deal on Ukraine's natural resources	Former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson voiced support for the U.S.-proposed deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources during an event in Kyiv on Feb. 24. &quot;The deal should be signed,&quot; Johnson said, speaking at the YES conference event held in Kyiv by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation on Feb. 24, the third anniversary of the Russian full-scale invasion. &quot;It commits the U.S. to a free and sovereign Ukraine. A continued American support is well worth the price for Ukraine.&quot; Ukrainian officials said earlier the same day that negotiations on the deal, which would entrench U.S. interests in Ukraine&apos;s resources, are in their final stages. Despite pressure from Washington, President Volodymyr Zelensky has been reluctant to sign the initial drafts of the deal as they lacked security commitments for Ukraine and because the $500 billion demanded by Washington vastly outnumbered the $100 billion provided under the previous U.S. administration. The initial White House proposal reportedly sought a 50% interest in Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas, as well as critical infrastructure and ports. Zelensky said Ukraine is not ready to &quot;split 50/50 without knowing what&#x2019;s ahead.&quot; Johnson compared the deal to the World War II-era lend-lease deal, emphasizing that the U.S. imposed a harsh deal for the U.K., which &quot;gave up a lot&quot; and had to pay the U.S. back until 2006. &quot;I think Trump is trying to show Republicans that he&#x2019;s got something. The tragedy is he&#x2019;s been listening for too long to Tucker Carlson, who pedals the Russian propaganda,&quot; the former British prime minister said. &quot;Ukraine will win. I remain defiantly optimistic about the chances of this country. (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is going to fail, Ukraine is going to succeed.&quot; Johnson was critical of Europe&#x2019;s unwillingness to confiscate the roughly $300 billion in frozen Russian assets, of which roughly two-thirds are held in European accounts. &quot;Who in Europe in the past two years has been talking about these billions? Why haven&#x2019;t we been hearing from European leaders about $300 billion?&quot; he said. &quot;We only talk about it in the rooms like this, at conferences. There&#x2019;s not enough political will to do it.&quot; While hesitant to confiscate the funds outright, the G7 members pledged a $50 billion loan for Ukraine covered by proceeds from the immobilized Russian assets. Johnson backed the idea of putting British troops on the ground, saying it is about showing Putin who is in charge and asserting Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty as a free country that &quot;can choose which clubs to join.&quot; &quot;Putin says to Ukraine (that) you can&#x2019;t have foreign boots on the ground. By rejecting that, we show who&#x2019;s in charge of Ukraine. That&#x2019;s all it&#x2019;s about. You make visible the fact of Ukrainian sovereignty and independence.&quot; The comments come as U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed readiness to deploy British peacekeepers to Ukraine to monitor a potential ceasefire. The Telegraph previously reported that Starmer&apos;s plan includes deploying 30,000 peacekeepers in Ukraine in case of a ceasefire, who would be backed by U.S. firepower.	https://kyivindependent.com/boris-johnson-backs-trumps-mineral-deal-for-ukraine/	2025-02-24T04:36:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198441762.jpg
Nordic countries to provide Ukraine with additional humanitarian, military, energy aid	Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland will allocate additional humanitarian, military, and energy aid to Ukraine, the governments announced on Feb. 24, the day marking the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The Nordic governments&apos; statements coincided with their leaders&apos; visits to Kyiv on the anniversary of the beginning of the all-out war. Denmark will allocate 405 million Danish kroner ($56.8 million) for humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts in Ukraine, the Danish Foreign Ministry announced. The situation in Ukraine is still &quot;very serious,&quot; the ministry said, adding that nearly 13 million people in Ukraine will need humanitarian assistance in 2025, according to the U.N. The new aid package will be split into two halves. One-half of the financial assistance will be earmarked for humanitarian aid and will go to &quot;basic aid such as food, medicine, water and shelter for Ukrainians in the most affected areas.&quot; The other half will be used for reconstruction efforts. The latest package will bring Denmark&apos;s total humanitarian aid to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion to more than 1 billion Danish kroner (over $140 million). Denmark&apos;s military assistance to Ukraine over this period has totaled about $7.5 billion, the statement read. Norway will provide 12.5 billion Norwegian kroner ($1.1 billion) to Ukraine, which will be used for humanitarian aid and energy security, among other spheres, according to the Norwegian Foreign Ministry. These funds are part of the allocation approved by the Norwegian parliament last November for the Nansen Support Program for Ukraine in 2025. Norway has so far allocated 35 billion Norwegian kroner ($3 billion) under this program, 12.5 billion Norwegian kroner ($1.1 billion) of which are dedicated to civilian expenditures and another 22.5 billion Norwegian kroner ($2 billion) for military support. Sweden will provide Ukraine with air defense systems worth 1.2 billion Swedish kroner (over $113 million). The funds are part of an aid package worth 13.5 billion Swedish kroner ($1.2 billion), which was announced in January. &quot;For the past three years, the Ukrainian people have been fighting for freedom and security &#x2014; theirs and ours,&quot; Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson wrote on X, marking his visit to Kyiv. &quot;Today, we are announcing 100 million euros ($105 million) to support Ukraine&apos;s air defenses. Strengthening Ukraine&apos;s capability to defend itself against Russian aggression also increases our security,&quot; Kristersson added. Finland, for its part, is providing 4.5 million euros ($4.7 million) through the Partnership Fund for a Resilient Ukraine (PFRU) for 2025-2027 to support Ukraine&apos;s resilience and stability, the Finnish Foreign Ministry announced. &quot;Rebuilding Ukraine and supporting basic services will contribute to the country&apos;s resilience, which is also needed to achieve lasting peace,&quot; Finnish Foreign Trade and Development Minister Ville Tavio said. Finland provided 4.3 million euros ($4.5 million) for the fund between 2022 and 2024. Over this period, the PFRU implemented 577 recovery projects, helped 2 million people access basic services, implemented media campaigns, and supported mental health services in eastern and southern Ukraine, the statement read.	https://kyivindependent.com/nordic-countries-to-provide-ukraine-with-additional-humanitarian-military-energy-aid/	2025-02-24T04:13:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201117138.jpg
Starmer announces UK's largest package of sanctions against Russia, confirms readiness to deploy peacekeepers in Ukraine	The U.K. is imposing its largest-ever package of sanctions against Moscow, targeting its &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of tankers and foreign-based companies providing military parts to Russia, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Feb. 24. &quot;Later today, I will be discussing further steps with the G7. And I am clear that the G7 should take more risk, including the oil price cap, sanctioning Russia&apos;s oil giants, and going after banks that are enabling the evasion of sanctions,&quot; Starmer said in a video address to the Support Ukraine summit in Kyiv. Starmer&apos;s announcement, made on the third anniversary of the full-scale war, comes shortly after Australia and New Zealand announced additional sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv&apos;s international partners are ramping up economic pressure on Moscow just as the Trump administration pushes for peace talks and signals that sanction relief could be part of an eventual peace deal. Starmer did not reveal the full details of the new package. The British prime minister reiterated that the U.K. is ready to provide Ukraine with 4.5 billion pounds ($5.7 billion) in military aid in 2025, the most significant yearly sum provided since the outbreak of the full-scale war. U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey previously announced the sum during the Ramstein-format meeting on Feb. 12. According to the media, London is also expected to announce an additional defense aid package later on Feb. 24. European countries are looking for ways to increase military support for Ukraine as the continued U.S. commitment grows uncertain under President Donald Trump. &quot;If we want peace to endure, Ukraine must have a seat at the table, and any settlement must be based on sovereign Ukraine, backed by strong security guarantees,&quot; Starmer said. &quot;The U.K. is ready and willing to support this with troops on the ground, with the Europeans, and with the right conditions in place,&quot; Starmer said, adding that the U.S. &quot;backstop&quot; will be crucial to deter any future Russian aggression. The British prime minister is expected to meet Trump in Washington later this week to discuss peace efforts in Ukraine. The Telegraph previously reported that Starmer&apos;s plan includes deploying 30,000 peacekeepers in Ukraine in case of a ceasefire, who would be backed by U.S. firepower.	https://kyivindependent.com/starmer-announces-largest-package-of-sanctions-against-russia/	2025-02-24T04:06:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194219228.jpg
Ukraine-US talks on natural resources deal in 'final stages,' Deputy PM says	The U.S.-Ukraine talks on the use of Ukrainian natural resources are in their &quot;final stages&quot; as &quot;nearly all key details (have been) finalized, &quot; Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said on Feb. 24. &quot;We are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature,&quot; Stefanishyna said on X. While praising the talks as &quot;constructive,&quot; the official did not provide any details on the deliberations or the content of the deal. Negotiations on a deal to entrench U.S. interests in Ukraine&apos;s reserves are ongoing, with the latest draft presented by the White House reportedly demanding $500 billion of Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources, including critical minerals, to recuperate American aid to Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky has so far refused to sign the deal because it does not contain any security guarantees for Ukraine and because the $500 billion sum vastly outnumbers the $100 billion provided under former President Joe Biden as a grant. &quot;We hope both U.S. and Ukrainian leaders might sign and endorse (the deal) in Washington (as soon as possible) to showcase our commitment for decades to come,&quot; Stefanishyna said. The initial White House proposal reportedly sought a 50% interest in Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas, as well as critical infrastructure and ports. Zelensky said Ukraine is not ready to &quot;split 50/50 without knowing what&#x2019;s ahead.&quot;The Ukrainian leader also pointed out that the U.S. proposed to return future aid with an interest of 1:2. &quot;For every U.S. dollar, Ukraine must return two. In simple terms, this is 100% of the loan,&quot; he said. The Trump administration has ramped up the pressure on Ukraine to sign the deal, with U.S. President Donald Trump lambasting Zelensky in public as a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; and urging him to &quot;move fast, or he won&#x2019;t have a country left.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-talks-on-natural-resources-deal-in-final-stages-deputy-pm-says/	2025-02-24T03:21:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2150526931.jpg
Canada disbursing 1st tranche of its G7 loan contribution for Ukraine	Canada is disbursing the first installment of 5 billion Canadian dollars ($3.5 billion) it contributed to the G7&apos;s $50 billion loan for Ukraine, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Feb. 24. The G7 loan, shouldered mainly by the U.S. and the EU, will be repaid by proceeds from roughly $300 billion in Russian assets held in Western bank accounts. The Canadian prime minister did not specify the sum of the first installment. Speaking at the Support Ukraine summit in Kyiv, Trudeau also announced new military support for the besieged country. This assistance will include 25 LAV III infantry fighting vehicles, two combat support vehicles, and four F-16 flight simulators, provided &quot;on top of million rounds of ammunition, components for drone cameras, and first aid kits,&quot; Trudeau said. Since the outbreak of the full-scale war, Canada has allocated 4.5 billion Canadian dollars ($3.2 billion) in military assistance to Ukraine, a figure that includes future commitments through 2029.	https://kyivindependent.com/canada-disbursing-1st-tranche-of-its-g7-loan-contribution-covered-by-russian-assets/	2025-02-24T02:54:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160972094.jpg
EU to provide Ukraine with $3.7 billion tranche in March	Ukraine will receive a new tranche of 3.5 billion euros ($3.7 billion) from the European Union in March, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Feb. 24 at the international Support Ukraine summit in Kyiv. Von der Leyen&apos;s statement came during her official visit to Kyiv on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;Europe is here to strengthen Ukraine in this critical moment. I can announce that a new 3.5 billion euros ($3.7 billion) payment for Ukraine will arrive already in March,&quot; von der Leyen said. In 2025, the EU is expected to provide Ukraine with 35 billion euros ($36 billion) in financial assistance under the G7 Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) credit initiative and the Ukraine Facility program. The European bloc pledged to contribute 18.1 billion euros ($19 billion) to the G7-backed $50 billion loan for Ukraine, which will be repaid by proceeds from Russian assets. The EU and its member states have provided 134 billion euros ($140 billion) in support to Ukraine since the all-out war began, more than any single country, according to von der Leyen. &quot;Thanks to our Ukraine Facility and the G7 loan, we have closed Ukraine&apos;s budgetary gap for the entire year 2025,&quot; she stressed. On Jan. 10, Ukraine received 3 billion euros ($3 billion) from the EU, the first tranche of loans from the bloc funded by proceeds of frozen Russian assets.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-to-provide-ukraine-with-new-3-7-billion-tranche-in-march/	2025-02-24T02:29:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1763769676.jpg
All-for-all prisoner exchange could be step toward peace, Zelensky says	Russia releasing all of its Ukrainian captives would be a good step toward peace, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the Support Ukraine summit on Feb. 24. &quot;Ukraine is ready for an all-for-all exchange, it is a fair option,&quot; Zelensky said in an address to world leaders. The comments come amid growing expectations of peace talks in 2025 amid U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s push for a swift ceasefire. Russia and Ukraine have held a number of prisoner swaps throughout the full-scale war, most recently on Feb. 5, when 150 Ukrainian soldiers were brought back from Russian captivity. Ukraine does not reveal the exact figures on how many Ukrainian prisoners of war (POW) are held in Russia. According to Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets, Russia holds over 16,000 Ukrainian civilians. Moscow has also deported or forcibly displaced over 19,500 Ukrainian children, transporting them to Russia, Belarus, or other Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine. &quot;Thousands of people are being held in Russia. And some of them have been held not only since 2022, but much earlier, since 2014,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine floated the idea of an all-for-all prisoner exchange already back in 2024, but Russia has not agreed to the proposal.	https://kyivindependent.com/all-for-all-prisoner-exchange-could-be-step-toward-peace-zelensky-says/	2025-02-24T02:13:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156503093.jpg
Zelensky sent Trump list of all 'ceasefires' violated by Russia	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 24 he had provided U.S. President Donald Trump with a list of all ceasefires violated by Russia, warning against a quick peace deal without clear security guarantees. &quot;Peace cannot be concluded in an hour, a day, today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow,&quot; Zelensky said in an address to world leaders at the Support Ukraine summit in Kyiv. &quot;When General (Keith) Kellogg was in Kyiv, I handed him and the U.S. president a document with all the ceasefires, along with specific dates, that Russia had violated.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s comments come amid growing concerns that Trump is seeking to sideline Ukraine and Europe in possible peace negotiations to cut a deal with Russia. U.S. and Russian delegates held talks in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 without Ukraine&apos;s participation, with a follow-up meeting scheduled for Feb. 25. While no specific plans for a peace deal were announced, Trump&apos;s diplomatic outreach to Moscow comes hand-in-hand with his increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Ukraine and Zelensky. The U.S. president has lambasted Zelensky as a &quot;dictator without elections,&quot; echoing Russian propaganda narratives about the latter&apos;s legitimacy. Trump&apos;s aides have also been pushing Kyiv to sign a deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, which Zelensky said provides no security guarantees in return. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly warned that a swift ceasefire deal without strong security guarantees, such as continued military support or NATO membership, would give Russia time to regain strength and resume its aggression at a later date. &quot;Therefore, peace must be based on balanced diplomacy and clear security guarantees,&quot; Zelensky said at the summit.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-gave-trump-list-of-all-ceasefires-violated-by-russia/	2025-02-24T01:38:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2188254103.jpg
Kallas to visit US to meet Rubio, discuss peace efforts in Ukraine	The EU&apos;s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, will visit the U.S. on Feb. 25 to meet Secretary of State Marco Rubio and discuss efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war, Kallas told journalists on Feb. 24 before a ministerial meeting in Brussels. Kallas&apos;s statement comes after American and Russian delegations met in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 for talks on ending the war in Ukraine. Neither Ukraine nor the European Union was invited to participate. Kallas stressed that no agreement regarding Ukraine or Europe can work without their participation. The EU&apos;s top diplomat said she plans to discuss &quot;these and other issues&quot; with Rubio and other officials in the U.S. Reacting to U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s denouncing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as a &quot;dictator,&quot; Kallas noted that, unlike Ukraine, Russia has not had fair elections in 25 years. Kallas also suggested that &quot;the messages coming out of the U.S.&quot; regarding the elections in Ukraine suggest that &quot;the Russian narrative is very strongly represented there.&quot; Kremlin propaganda has pushed the narrative that Zelensky is an illegitimate leader, relying on the premise that his first presidential term was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. Trump&apos;s claim ignores the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. As a result, Zelensky&apos;s term has been extended, which constitutional lawyers argue is permitted under Ukrainian law.	https://kyivindependent.com/kallas-to-visit-us-to-meet-with-rubio-discuss-peace-deal-on-ukraine/	2025-02-24T01:30:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1401349176.jpg
Russian consulate in Marseille attacked with Molotov cocktails, media reports	Two Molotov cocktails were thrown into the garden of the Russian consulate building in Marseille, France, on Feb. 24, the French news channel BFM TV wrote. Local media previously reported a blast near the Russian consulate building in the southern French city and firefighters working on site. No casualties were reported. The incident was confirmed by Russian Consul General in Marseille Stanislav Oransky, who said that an explosion occurred &quot;inside the consulate.&quot; Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed the incident has all the hallmarks of a &quot;terrorist attack&quot; and urged &quot;swift investigation&quot; and &quot;strengthening the security of Russian foreign institutions,&quot; according to the Russian news agency RBK. French authorities have not commented on the identity of the perpetrators or the motivations behind the attack, which took place on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The incident took place less than a month after a man attempted to drive a passenger car through the gates of Russia&#x2019;s Embassy in Stockholm, Sweden.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-consulate-in-marseille-attacked-with-molotov-cocktails-media-reports/	2025-02-24T01:07:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1239890156.jpg
Ukrainian drones reportedly strike Russian refinery in Ryazan Oblast for 3rd time in 2025	Drones operated by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces struck an oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Ryazan Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 24. Kyiv considers oil refineries to be valid military targets, as profits from the fossil fuel industry fund Russia&apos;s war machine. This is the third time since the beginning of 2025 that drones have attacked the Ryazan Oil Refinery, according to the independent Telegram channel Astra. The Ryazan Oil Refining Company&apos;s facility was previously struck overnight on Jan. 24 and Jan. 26. At least five explosions were heard near the facility. According to preliminary data from the General Staff, the attack caused a fire near the primary oil processing facility. The full consequences of the attack are still being determined, according to the statement. Ryazan Oblast Governor Pavel Malkov confirmed that falling drone debris had caused a fire at &quot;one of the enterprises&quot; in the region. According to Malkov, no one was injured. Ryazan lies almost 500 kilometers (310 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border. The Ryazan Oil Refinery is one of Russia&apos;s five largest oil refining facilities, according to Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation. Its capacity is 17.1 million metric tons of oil per year. Kovalenko added that the fuel produced at the enterprise is used by the Russian army&apos;s strategic long-range aviation, which launches missile strikes against Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The Ryazan Oil Refinery previously suspended operations due to damage from Ukrainian drone attacks, Reuters reported on Jan. 27, citing two industry sources. Ukraine confirmed hitting the plant in an overnight drone strike on Jan. 24.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-attack-oil-refinery-in-russias-ryazan-oblast-for-3rd-time-since-beginning-of-2025/	2025-02-24T00:47:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Gkihz5AXAAEt9p2.jpeg
EU officially adopts 16th package of sanctions against Russia	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. The European Union officially approved its 16th package of sanctions imposed against Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The new measures, announced on the third anniversary of the all-out war, target Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of oil tankers, banks, aluminum imports, and other sectors. &quot;For three years now, Russia has relentlessly bombed Ukraine, attempting to steal land that isn&#x2019;t theirs to take,&quot; the EU&apos;s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said in a statement. &quot;There is no doubt about who the aggressor is, who should pay and be held accountable for this war. Every sanction package deprives the Kremlin of funds to wage war.&quot; Forty-eight persons and 35 entities were listed in the 16th package of sanctions, which was approved by EU ambassadors last week. The package expands restrictions against the &quot;shadow fleet&quot; &#x2014; a group of aging tankers used to evade sanctions&#x2014;by targeting 73 additional vessels, bringing the total to 153. For the first time, the EU also imposed a transaction ban on financial institutions outside Russia that use the Russian System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS), a Russian alternative to the international SWIFT payment system.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-officially-adopts-16th-package-of-sanctions-against-russia/	2025-02-24T00:12:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1252156264.jpg
Australia, New Zealand impose new sanctions against Russia	The Australian and New Zealand governments announced new sanctions against Russia on Feb. 24 in a show of solidarity with Ukraine on the third anniversary of the full-scale invasion. The new measures, imposed mere days after the EU&apos;s ambassadors approved the bloc&apos;s 16th package of sanctions, come as the Trump administration signaled that sanctions relief could be part of peace talks with Russia. Australia has introduced the most extensive package of sanctions since the beginning of the all-out war, targeting 70 individuals and 79 organizations linked to Russia, the government&apos;s statement read. Sanctions were imposed on Russian government officials and individuals involved in &quot;deepening cooperation between Russia and North Korea.&quot; North Korea has been Russia&apos;s leading ally during the full-scale war, providing artillery, ballistic missiles, and up to 12,000 soldiers deployed against Ukraine in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. The Australian government has imposed over 1,400 sanctions in response to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine since 2022 and has provided over 1.5 billion Australian dollars ($960 million) to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression, according to the statement. New Zealand announced sanctions against 52 individuals and entities &quot;involved in Russia&apos;s military-industrial complex and energy sector, North Korea&apos;s support to Russia&apos;s war effort, and the forced relocation or re-education of Ukrainian children,&quot; New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters said. The sanctions list includes governors of several Russian regions, heads of military-industrial complex enterprises, and military unit commanders. Restrictions were also imposed on Russian NGOs and charitable foundations. The New Zealand government further introduced sanctions on a senior North Korean military officer who provided strategic assistance to Russia&apos;s military efforts. Peters also announced an additional 3 million New Zealand dollars ($1.7 million) in contribution to the World Bank-administered Ukraine Relief, Recovery, Reconstruction, and Reform Trust Fund. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, New Zealand has imposed sanctions on more than 1,800 individuals and entities, along with a range of trade restrictions.	https://kyivindependent.com/australia-new-zealand-introduce-new-sanctions-against-russia/	2025-02-23T23:40:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1941899735.jpg
1 killed, 5 injured in Russian attacks; Moscow launches mass drone strike on full-scale war's anniversary	Russian attacks across Ukrainian oblasts killed at least one civilian and injured at least five over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 24. Russia launched a massive drone attack on the third anniversary of its full-scale invasion, deploying 185 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 113 drones over 12 oblasts, while 71 decoy drones were lost without causing damage, the Air Force reported. In Donetsk Oblast, one person was injured during a Russian attack against the town of Myrnohrad, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast killed one person and injured three, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. A high-rise building and 19 houses were reported as damaged. One civilian was injured during an airstrike against the Hlukhiv community in Sumy Oblast, the regional military administration reported. In Odesa Oblast, Russian drone attacks damaged port infrastructure, a house, and cars but inflicted no casualties, Governor Oleh Kiper reported.

General Staff: Russia has lost 868,230 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 868,230 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 24. This number includes 1,050 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day.

Switzerland would consider sending 200 troops for potential peacekeeping role if requested, Swiss army chief says	Switzerland could contribute around 200 troops to a prospective peacekeeping mission in Ukraine if such a request were received and if the government agreed, Swiss armed forces chief Thomas Suessli said on Feb. 23. &quot;We could probably field around 200 soldiers in nine to 12 months,&quot; Suessli stated in an interview with Blick newspaper. He made the distinction between peacekeeping and peace-enforcement operations and said that Switzerland would not participate in any peace-enforcement operations as they involve some degree of force. &quot;Peace-enforcement means peace must be imposed by force of arms. Switzerland does not participate,&#x201D; he said. &quot;Peacekeeping presupposes Russia and Ukraine agree to cease hostilities and accept the UN sending a peacekeeping force to guarantee peace,&quot; Suessli added. However, he also noted that at this point there are no concrete requests from the UN, and that these questions are currently hypothetical. While refusing to supply Kyiv with military aid on account of its long-term neutrality policy, Switzerland has provided economic and humanitarian support worth over $3 billion. Switzerland also hosted the 2024 global peace summit, which had representatives from around 100 countries, as well as the 2022 Ukraine Recovery Conference in Lugano, which laid down principles for Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction and recovery.	https://kyivindependent.com/switzerland-would-consider-sending-200-troops-for-potential-peacekeeping-role-if-requested-swiss-army-chief-says/	2025-02-23T21:37:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-155097444.jpg
Sweden to transfer air defense systems to Ukraine estimated at $113 million in new aid package	Sweden has announced a transfer of air defense systems worth 1.2 billion Swedish krona (approximately $113 million) to Ukraine, Svenska Dagbladet reported on Feb. 23. This announcement was made by Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, Deputy Prime Minister Ebba Busch, and Minister of Education Johan Pehrson.

UK to ban entry for Russian elites as Starmer heads to Washington for Ukraine talks	The U.K. will impose a travel ban on individuals who have significant ties to the Russian state or have built their wealth through Kremlin connections. The U.K.&#x2019;s new sanctions come amid broader Western efforts to tighten pressure on Moscow as the war enters its fourth year. The sanctions, set to be announced on the third anniversary of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, will also target those with access to the highest levels of the Russian government, including senior politicians, officials, and business figures, the U.K. government said. The measures will expand existing British sanctions against Russian elites accused of supporting President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s war effort. British Security Minister Dan Jarvis made it clear that those benefiting from the Kremlin&#x2019;s actions will no longer be welcome. &quot;You are not welcome in the U.K.,&quot; he said. &quot;The measures announced today slam the door shut to the oligarchs who have enriched themselves at the expense of the Russian people whilst bankrolling this illegal and unjustifiable war.&quot; U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer will travel to Washington this week for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump on the war in Ukraine. His visit follows that of French President Emmanuel Macron, who is scheduled to meet Trump at the White House on Monday. Both leaders aim to persuade the U.S. president to avoid rushing into a ceasefire deal with Putin that could undermine Ukraine&#x2019;s security. European leaders have grown increasingly concerned over Trump&#x2019;s recent decision to engage in direct negotiations with Moscow without Kyiv&#x2019;s involvement. Starmer and Macron are expected to push for continued Western military support for Ukraine and stress the importance of European involvement in any peace process. They will also discuss potential military guarantees for Ukraine&#x2019;s future security.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-to-ban-entry-for-russian-elites-as-starmer-heads-to-washington-for-ukraine-talks/	2025-02-23T17:50:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200011633.jpg
Trudeau presses Trump on Ukraine peace deal ahead of Kyiv summit	Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged U.S. President Donald Trump to ensure any peace agreement for Ukraine includes security guarantees and prevents further Russian aggression. During a Feb. 22 phone call, Trudeau emphasized that any deal must not be seen as appeasement by Russian President Vladimir Putin, warning that it could lead to future land grabs in eastern Europe and the Baltics, according to a source with direct knowledge of the conversation. Trudeau left Ottawa on Feb. 23 for a summit in Kyiv, where world leaders will mark the third anniversary of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. The summit coincides with a video conference of G7 leaders on Monday, where the Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine will be a key topic. Trump recently authorized direct talks with Moscow on ending the conflict, excluding Kyiv from the negotiations. His administration&#x2019;s proposal would allow Russia to retain some occupied territories while transferring control of billions of dollars&apos; worth of Ukrainian natural resources to the U.S. President Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking at a Feb. 23 news conference, insisted that Kyiv must be part of any negotiation and said he would step down if it ensured Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership. However, he firmly rejected any deal that would hand over Ukraine&#x2019;s critical minerals to the U.S. &quot;I am not signing something that 10 generations of Ukrainians will have to repay,&quot; Zelensky said. French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer will travel to Washington this week in an effort to convince Trump not to abandon Ukraine. They plan to propose a European-led deployment of &quot;reassurance&quot; troops to bolster Ukraine&#x2019;s security. It remains unclear whether Canada will be asked to participate, but Trudeau&#x2019;s discussions with Trump suggest Ottawa remains committed to supporting Ukraine as the war enters its fourth year. Since the beginning of 2022, Canada has committed around $3.15 billion (CAD $4.5 billion) in aid to Ukraine, inlcuding air defense, ammunition, artillery, tanks, field equipment and clothing.	https://kyivindependent.com/trudeau-presses-trump-on-ukraine-peace-deal-ahead-of-kyiv-summit/	2025-02-23T16:45:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160972094.jpg
CDU wins German election, Friedrich Merz raises NATO concerns	Germany&#x2019;s center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is set to return to power, with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) emerging as the second-largest party, according to exit polls. The snap election was driven by concerns over immigration, economic issues, and the return of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency. Cheers erupted at CDU headquarters on the evening of Feb. 23 as exit polls confirmed the opposition party&#x2019;s victory, according to CNN. Outside the building, a small group of demonstrators protested against CDU leader Friedrich Merz&#x2019;s stance on immigration. Declaring victory, Merz addressed supporters in central Berlin, saying, &quot;Let&#x2019;s get the party started,&quot; signaling his intent to begin coalition talks swiftly. With 28.8% of the vote, according to exit polls, Merz is expected to become Germany&#x2019;s next chancellor. A staunch conservative who has never held government office, he will lead Europe&#x2019;s largest economy. The AfD secured 20.2%, an unprecedented result for the far-right party, which has long been considered extremist. Merz expressed doubts about NATO&#x2019;s future following recent comments from the Trump administration. &quot;I would never have thought that I would have to say something like this in a TV show but, after Donald Trump&#x2019;s remarks last week... it is clear that this government does not care much about the fate of Europe,&quot; he told German broadcaster ARD. He also questioned whether NATO would remain intact by the June summit and stressed the urgency of building an independent European defense strategy. Known for his hardline stance on Russia, Merz has supported sending medium-range Taurus missiles to Ukraine, a move the outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz has firmly opposed. On Feb. 21, Merz criticized Trump&apos;s recent statements on Ukraine, calling them &quot;shocking&quot; and aligned with Russian narratives. &quot;This is the Russian narrative; this is how Putin has presented it for years, and I&apos;m frankly shocked that Donald Trump has now apparently embraced it himself,&quot; Merz added.	https://kyivindependent.com/cdu-wins-german-election-friedrich-merz-raises-nato-concerns/	2025-02-23T15:37:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200983429.jpg
Thousands rally across Europe, Canada ahead of 3rd anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion	Thousands of people rallied in support of Ukraine on Feb. 23 ahead of the third anniversary of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion which began on Feb. 24, 2022. Rallies were held across Europe on Sunday, with thousands of demonstrators lining the streets of Prague and Brussels. Czech President Petr Pavel addressed rally-goers in Prague, emphasizing his country&apos;s support for Ukraine. &quot;From what happened, I think it is quite clear who is the aggressor, who violated international law, and who is the victim, whose side we should stand on,&quot; Pavel said. &quot;And if we allow (international law) to be compromised, if we reward the aggressor, then sooner or later it will affect us too.&quot; Thousands also took to the streets of Brussels&apos; city center to mark the third anniversary. Amid the start of the fourth year to Russia&apos;s full-scale war, European allies have grown increasingly concerned over Kyiv&apos;s role in upcoming peace talks between Russia and the United States to end the war. European leaders have scrambled to deliver military support to Ukraine as the U.S., under the Trump administration, races to make a deal with Moscow. Trump has said he wants Europe to play a greater role in supporting Ukraine&apos;s financial and defense needs, but his administration has sent mixed signals as to whether Europeans are welcome in the negotiations process. Thousands of Ukrainian Canadians also attended a protest against Russian aggression in Toronto, Canada, in a rally attended by the Kyiv Independent.

(Dmytro Basmat/The Kyiv Independent)Chrystia Freeland, Canada&apos;s former Finance Minister, who is running to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, attended the rally and touted the country&apos;s support for Ukraine. &quot;In this fight, we are on the side of democracy versus dictatorship,&quot; Freeland, who is of Ukrainian descent, said during the rally. &quot;We are on the side of rule and order, and not bullies.&quot; Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said on Feb. 18 that Canada is interested in partaking in conversations about security guarantees for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/thousands-rally-across-europe-canada-ahead-of-3rd-anniversary-of-russias-full-scale-invasion/	2025-02-23T13:32:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/pxl_20250223_202453998.jpg
US envoy suggests Ukraine-Russia peace deal is close	The United States is reportedly nearing a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia, according to Steve Witkoff, the U.S. envoy to the Middle East. He said that any potential deal would require both territorial and economic concessions from both sides. &quot;You will see concessions from both sides. And this is what the president does best. He brings people together. He makes them understand that the path to peace is through concessions and reaching a consensus,&quot; Vitkoff said on Feb. 23. He also suggested that the 2022 Istanbul agreements could serve as the foundation for a future peace treaty between Ukraine and Russia. The Istanbul agreements between Ukraine and Russia in 2022 refer to a series of negotiations held in Istanbul, Turkey in late March 2022, shortly after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The produced communique outlined potential terms for a peace agreement including Ukraine adopting a neutral status and abandoning NATO aspirations, limits on Ukraine&apos;s military forces, Western security guarantees for Ukraine, negotiation of Crimea&apos;s status over 10-15 years, and allowing Ukraine to apply for EU membership. While these negotiations were seen as a potential breakthrough, with both sides reportedly considering significant concessions, they did not result in a final agreement and were halted in May 2022. Vitkoff linked the ongoing war to discussions about Ukraine&#x2019;s possible NATO membership, which he claimed Russia perceived as a threat. His remarks contrast with the position of the previous U.S. administration, which viewed Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion as unprovoked aggression. U.S. President Donald Trump said a new phase of ceasefire negotiations between American and Russian delegations aimed to stop Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine would take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Feb. 25. This meeting follows the first round of discussions held in the same city earlier in the week. No Ukrainian officials were present at the Saudi negotiations. Following the initial meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlined three main objectives both sides had agreed to pursue. These include restoring embassy staff in Washington and Moscow, creating a high-level team to facilitate Ukraine peace talks, and exploring ways to strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-envoy-suggests-ukraine-russia-peace-deal-is-close/	2025-02-23T13:24:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199709214.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Zelensky willing to step down in exchange for peace; Russia launches largest drone attack since start of full-scale invasion	Key developments on Feb. 22-23: President Volodymyr Zelensky is ready to step down as president if it means &#x201C;peace for Ukraine,&#x201D; he said during the Ukraine: Year 2025 forum in Kyiv on Feb. 23.Talks about elections in Ukraine have amplified in recent months despite martial law prohibiting them. Zelensky, who was elected in 2019 for five years, came under fire from U.S. President Donald Trump who recently accused the Ukrainian leader of not wanting to hold elections.&#x201C;I am focusing on security today and not in 20 years time. I don&#x2019;t plan to be in power for 10 years,&#x201D; Zelensky told the forum.Ukraine has repeatedly said that it won&#x2019;t hold elections until the war is over, in line with martial law as Russia constantly bombards the country and occupies one-fifth of its territory. With Trump amping up peace negotiations with Russia this month, many expect an election to follow shortly after a ceasefire is agreed.These constraints have not stopped Trump from repeating Russian propaganda points and accusing Zelensky of being &#x201C;a dictator.&#x201D; Ukrainian NGOs have said organizing an election during the war is &#x201C;impossible,&#x201D; as elections must be preceded by a stable ceasefire backed by security guarantees and proper preparations for the election process, including restoring relevant infrastructure.Zelensky&apos;s administration pledged to hold elections &quot;immediately&quot; after the end of the war, thus allowing soldiers and refugees to safely take part in the vote as well.&quot;The Ukrainian consensus on elections no earlier than six months after the end of martial law is supported by the authorities, the opposition, and the society,&quot; the statement by the Ukrainian NGOs read.According to a February survey, 69% of Ukrainians believe that Zelensky should remain in office until the next elections can be held after the end of martial law. Several opposition politicians also supported this position, warning against Russian attempts to use the elections to divide society. Russia launched its largest single drone attack overnight since the start of the full-scale invasion with 267 drones entering Ukrainian airspace, Air Force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said on Feb. 23.Explosions were heard across the country, including in Kyiv where drone debris fell in the center of the capital and other districts that two houses and a post office, Kyiv&#x2019;s military head Tymur Tkachenko reported. Ukraine&#x2019;s air defense shot down 138 drones while 119 decoy drones were lost.While there were no reported casualties in Kyiv, three people were injured in Odesa Oblast after a fire broke out at a residential house, reported Odesa Oblast military head Oleh Kiper.In addition to the drone attacks, Russian forces also launched missiles at Ukraine. In Zaporizhzhia, a 53-year-old woman was injured after Russian shelling hit residential areas causing a fire.The worst attack occurred in Kryvyi Rih, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, where a missile strike killed one person and injured five. The attack inflicted heavy damage on the city&apos;s civilian infrastructure, including 12 apartment buildings, an infrastructure facility, a retirement home, and a church.The strike also caused damage to social and industrial buildings, a gas station, and multiple vehicles.The night before, a Russian drone attack killed a man in Kyiv Oblast. Several civilian buildings were damaged in the city, including an apartment block and an educational facility. The current U.S. proposal regarding Ukraine&apos;s critical minerals seeks 50% of revenues from Ukraine&apos;s natural resources while offering no security guarantees in return, according to a draft of the agreement seen by the New York Times (NYT). The U.S. and Ukraine have been working intensively over the past few days to hammer out the details of a revised version of the agreement. Ruslan Stefanchuk, speaker of Ukraine&apos;s parliament, said Kyiv aims to conclude the agreement on Feb. 24, the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The terms of the revised draft are virtually the same as those of an earlier version rejected by Zelensky, the NYT reported, citing a draft of the agreement dated Feb. 21. In some cases, the U.S. demands are even more stringent. The agreement demands 50% of revenues from Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas, as well as stakes in ports and other key infrastructure through a joint investment fund. The new version says that the U.S. would hold a 100% financial interest in this fund, and that Ukraine should contribute to the fund until it reaches $500 billion. This amount vastly exceeds Ukraine&apos;s actual resource revenues, which totaled $1.1 billion in 2024, and is over four times the value of U.S. aid to Kyiv. That $500 billion figure was not listed in the original proposal presented to Zelensky by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Feb. 12. Trump has cited the number in public comments, claiming on Feb. 10 that Ukraine had &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal. When Zelensky then refused to sign the proposed agreement on the grounds that it offered no security guarantees, Trump lashed out at the Ukrainian president, echoing Kremlin talking points by calling him an &quot;unelected dictator.&quot; A visit from Trump&apos;s Special Envoy on Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, appeared to ease tensions and revive negotiations on the resource deal. U.S. and Ukrainian officials have reportedly been working through the night to hammer out an agreement. Trump said on Feb. 21 that the U.S. and Ukraine were &quot;pretty close&quot; to reaching a deal. The new document provides no specific security guarantees, according to the NYT. It instead says the U.S. will provide long-term economic development support for Ukraine. Trump said in early February that he wanted to strike a deal with Ukraine involving access to rare earth minerals in exchange for continued aid &#x2014; a change in U.S. foreign policy that turned support for Ukraine&apos;s defense and sovereignty into a business transaction. Ukraine said it was open to such a deal and has stressed the need for concrete security guarantees. A former senior Ukrainian official called the first U.S. proposal &quot;a colonial agreement&quot; and said Zelensky could not sign the document on those terms. Reuters reported on Feb. 21 that the U.S. has threatened to cut off Ukraine&apos;s access to Starlink internet terminals it it does not sign the agreement &#x2014; a claim SpaceX CEO and Trump ally Elon Musk has denied. Zelensky pushed back at the U.S.&#x2019; demand for a $500 billion fund to be financed with Ukrainian natural resource revenue, saying that the U.S.&#x2019;s aid grants are not debts, during the Ukraine: Year 2025 forum in Kyiv on Feb. 23. Zelensky said that he will not recognize such a large sum since it vastly outweighs the $100 billion the U.S. has sent to Ukraine under former President Joe Biden.The president added that the aid given to Ukraine cannot be counted as debts since they are grants and stressed that security guarantees need to be included in the deal. So far no such guarantees have been put in place, he said.&#x201C;I am not signing something that will be paid by 10 generations of Ukrainians,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that he wants a dialogue with Trump.The initial White House proposal sought a 50% interest in Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil and gas, as well as critical infrastructure and ports. Zelensky said Ukraine is not ready to &#x201C;split 50/50 without knowing what&#x2019;s ahead.&#x201D;The Ukrainian leader also pointed out that the U.S. proposed to return future aid with an interest of 1:2. &#x201C;For every U.S. dollar, Ukraine must return two. In simple terms, this is 100% of the loan,&#x201D; he said.The exact details of the current proposal have been kept secret but the administration of President Donald Trump has ramped up pressure on Kyiv to sign. Ukraine has had a back and forth with its American counterparts for nearly two weeks and Kyiv will start working to conclude an agreement with the U.S. on Feb. 24, said Ruslan Stefanchuk, speaker of Ukraine&apos;s parliament.The value and volume of Ukraine&#x2019;s critical minerals are unknown with the figure hotly debated among experts as assessments are based on old Soviet-era figures. However, $350 billion worth of natural resources are located in the Russian-occupied territories, First Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said at the forum. Arrangements for an in-person meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are already underway, Russia&apos;s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov claimed on Feb. 22. Trump previously said he would &quot;probably&quot; meet Putin before the end of February. The two leaders could discuss a broad range of global topics in addition to the war in Ukraine, Ryabkov told Russian state media. &quot;The question is about starting to move toward normalizing relations between our countries, finding ways to resolve the most acute and potentially very, very dangerous situations, of which there are many, Ukraine among them,&quot; he said. Preparations for the meeting are still in the early stages, Ryabkov said, and organizing the summit will require &quot;the most intensive preparatory work.&quot; U.S. and Russian delegates may hold meetings over the next two weeks in preparation for the Trump-Putin talks, he added. The U.S. and Russia have already held their first direct talks since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, signaling and end to Moscow&apos;s political isolation from the West. Representatives met in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 to discuss preliminary steps towards ending the war in Ukraine. Trump announced that U.S. and Russian envoys will hold another round of talks in Riyadh on Feb. 25. Ryabkov did not provide any details as to a potential date or location for the meeting between Trump and Putin. Trump has said that the leaders&apos; first meeting will take place in Saudi Arabia. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the possibilities of a Trump-Putin meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, during the Saudi Arabia talks. Rubio said on Feb. 20 that a face-to-face meeting between the two leaders would depend on whether &quot;we can make any progress&quot; towards a peace agreement. Ukraine and European leaders have objected to Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the U.S.-Russia talks. Zelensky said he would not accept the outcome of any negotiations that did not involve Kyiv&apos;s participation. Trump has already spoken to Putin regarding his goal to broker a quick ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump spoke to Putin for nearly 90 minutes in a phone call on Feb. 12, holding a separate call with Zelensky later that day. Following the Riyadh talks, Putin announced that he would &quot;gladly&quot; meet with Trump and said he hoped Washington and Moscow would work out the war in Ukraine in advance of their meeting.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-zelensky-willing-to-step-down-in-exchange-for-peace-russia-launches-largest-drone-attack-since-start-of-full-scale-invasion/	2025-02-23T10:54:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/gettyimages-2201504268-612x612.jpg
Do international observers want to be placed in Pokrovsk?' — Zelensky criticizes calls for elections following Trump's comments	President Volodymyr Zelensky lambasted ongoing calls to hold elections in Ukraine during a press conference on Feb. 23 amid an unstable security situation across the country. &quot;If we held elections right now, it&apos;s understandable that for (Ukraine), in terms of security, it&apos;s the number one priority that we have a democratic situation, democratic elections, and that they are determined (to be legitimate),&quot; Zelensky said, ahead of listing a number question surrounding concerns over how an democratic election would be conducted amid the ongoing war. &quot;This is just not right. How can we call an election in which half of the population of the country won&apos;t be able to vote in?&quot; Zelensky question. &quot;How will they be able to vote?&quot; &quot;How will military personnel be able to vote? There&apos;s no way. How can we vote normally when today (Kyiv was) attacked with 267 drones?&quot; he added. Zelensky&apos;s remarks follow those of U.S. President Donald Trump who said on Feb. 18 that he believes Ukraine should hold new elections, alleging, without evidence. that Zelensky holds a &quot;4% approval rating.&quot; Trump further called Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; in a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Feb. 19, accusing him of refusing to have elections. A poll release the same day by the case of Ukraine (IBIF) project in partnership with the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) found that around 63% of Ukrainians approve of Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s actions as a president. Ukraine has repeatedly said that it won&#x2019;t hold elections until the war is over, in line with martial law as Russia constantly bombards the country and occupies one-fifth of its territory. Ukraine was scheduled to hold a presidential election in March or April 2024, concluding Zelensky&apos;s first five-year term. The vote was postponed as the country&apos;s constitution does not permit elections under martial law, which was declared on Feb. 24, 2022, at the onset of Russia&apos;s all-out invasion. Earlier in the press conference, Zelensky said he was ready to step down as president if it means &#x201C;peace for Ukraine.&quot; &#x201C;I am focusing on security today and not in 20 years time. I don&#x2019;t plan to be in power for 10 years,&#x201D; Zelensky told the forum. Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to use the delay to portray Zelensky as &quot;illegitimate,&quot; saying that the authority should pass to Parliament speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk, a claim rejected by Kyiv as a distortion of the constitution.	https://kyivindependent.com/do-international-observers-want-to-be-placed-in-pokrovsk-zelensky-criticizes-calls-for-elections-following-trumps-comments/	2025-02-23T10:13:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/gettyimages-2201504276-612x612.jpg
Hungary playing role in spreading disinformation about rationale for Russia's invasion to Trump's team, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a press conference on Feb. 23 that it was &quot;dangerous&quot; that members of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban&apos;s team are spreading disinformation about the rationale for the start of the war to members of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s orbit. &quot;I know that there are people from this Hungarian leader who have contact with people in President Trump&apos;s orbit, and are constantly raising questions... in regards to not expanding NATO into eastern Europe,&quot; Zelensky said, criticizing Kremlin talking points that NATO was at fault for Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Orban, known for his close ties with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump, has openly criticized EU aid for Ukraine and obstructed sanctions against Moscow. Hungarian government insiders revealed that Trump sought Orban&#x2019;s opinion on strategies to end the Ukraine war multiple times after Trump&apos;s victory in the 2024 presidential election. In February 2024, Orban said that Ukraine should be left as a &quot;buffer zone&quot; between Russia and the West, with allies giving the country security guarantees but not accepting it into the EU or NATO. Trump has himself previously criticized former President Joe Biden for provoking Russia&#x2019;s invasion, claiming Ukraine&#x2019;s potential NATO membership had long been a significant concern for Moscow. &quot;I could understand their feelings,&quot; he said, referring to the country that launched the deadliest war in Europe since World War II. &quot;Is it not a risk that all the countries that became NATO members after various agreements between the (former) Soviet Union and the U.S. that they could all be under attack or occupation by the Russian army on their territory,&quot; Zelensky added, criticizing disproven talking points about NATO expansionism. &quot;This is why all this disinformation... is dangerous, and I want President Trump to speak to me &#x2014; with those at the table, not those who walk around the table.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s comments come amid a strained week in U.S.-Ukraine relations. Earlier in the week, Trump blamed Ukraine for starting the war, saying Kyiv &quot;should have never started it&quot; and instead should have &quot;made a deal.&quot;Later Trump added that Zelensky is not essential to negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. &quot;I don&apos;t think he&apos;s very important to be at meetings, to be honest with you,&quot; Trump told Fox News Radio on Feb. 21. Trump later conceded that Russia, not Ukraine, was the aggressor. &quot;Russia attacked, but they shouldn&apos;t have let him attack,&quot; he said. On Feb. 19, Trump called Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; in a post on his social media platform Truth Social, accusing him of refusing to have elections, and repeating false claims about the war in Ukraine. &quot;He refuses to have elections, is very low in Ukrainian polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden &apos;like a fiddle,&apos;&quot; Trump wrote.

Ukraine needs the US to win, says Polish PM	Polish President Andrezj Duda said Ukraine cannot win the war without U.S. support in a press briefing following a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, Polish media RMF 24 reported on Feb. 23. Duda and Trump met at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland on Feb. 22. After the conversation, the Polish leader told reporters that Trump is determined to end Russia&#x2019;s war on Ukraine adding that Russia cannot be allowed to win.However, he noted that the question remains of how to end the bloodshed. In his opinion, &quot;without American support, Ukraine will not survive this war&#x201D; and that the war &#x201C;has to be ended somehow.&#x201D; According to Duda, a just and sustainable peace is needed to make sure &quot;the war will not return and that Russia will not attack anyone again.&quot; The Polish Prime Minister discussed the peace negotiations with Trump, reminding him that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a former KGB officer. The White House said that a deal with Russia could be expected in the coming week. Duda, who has served as Prime Minister since 2015, previously said in November that he does not believe Trump will allow Russia to win. However, Ukraine is growing anxious that U.S. military support will end as Trump negotiates with Russia. Tensions have grown between the U.S. and Europe over peace negotiations, as Washington held direct talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 without Ukraine and Europe. European allies, including the U.K., have stressed that Ukraine needs to be directly involved in the negotiations. The next round of talks between the U.S. and Russia is planned for Feb. 25, in Riyadh.Duda&#x2019;s comments echo that of other European leaders, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who stressed that only a U.S. security guarantee can deter Russia from launching further aggression. He called for the U.S. to support a peacekeeping force in Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-needs-the-us-to-win-says-polish-pm/	2025-02-23T08:22:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1249297634-1.jpg
Zelensky won't sign natural resource deal that 'will be paid by 10 generations of Ukrainians'	President Volodymyr Zelensky pushed back at the U.S.&#x2019; demand for a $500 billion fund to be financed with Ukrainian natural resource revenue, saying that the U.S.&#x2019;s aid grants are not debts, during the Ukraine: Year 2025 forum in Kyiv on Feb. 23.Negotiations on a deal to entrench U.S. interests in Ukraine&apos;s reserves are ongoing, with the latest draft presented by the White House demanding $500 billion of Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources, including critical minerals, to recuperate American aid to Ukraine. Zelensky said that he will not recognize such a large sum since it vastly outweighs the $100 billion the U.S. has sent to Ukraine under former President Joe Biden.

Defense Minister: Ukraine has alternatives to Starlink system	Ukraine has alternatives for the Starlink internet system widely used by front-line units and is making decisions about the use of the technology, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said at the Ukraine: Year 2025 forum in Kyiv on Feb. 23.Tensions have been growing in recent months between Ukraine and Starlink&#x2019;s owner, billionaire Elon Musk, over his ties to Russia and comments about Ukraine. Recently, Reuters reported that the U.S. threatened to block Starlink access in Ukraine unless Kyiv signs a deal on its natural resources although this was denied by Musk. Starlink internet terminals have played a crucial role in securing communications in the war in Ukraine, with most battlefield positions equipped with their own terminal. Last year, Ukraine said that approximately 42,000 terminals were in operation across the military, hospitals, businesses, and aid organizations.Umerov did not specify what the alternatives were or go into details about the discussions. Last month, the Digital Transformation Ministry told the Kyiv Independent that Starlinks were still a critical part of communication on the frontline and that a new order was underway. The U.S. has the ability to remotely cut off Starlink connections and has previously turned off Starlinks belonging to Russian forces in the military &#x2018;gray zone&#x2019;, akin to no man&#x2019;s land, Ukrainian military intelligence head Kyrylo Budanov told reporters at the forum. No Starlinks belonging to Ukrainians have been turned off so far, he said. Umerov also noted that when it comes to U.S. provision for air defense missiles, &#x201C;the situation is controlled.&#x201D;Continued U.S. support to Ukraine is critical and Ukraine has a &#x201C;very low chance of survival&#x201D; without U.S. weapons, President Volodymyr Zelensky told NBC News on Feb. 15. Concerns have arisen among soldiers that the White House will stop weapon deliveries as U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s administration prepares negotiations with Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/defense-minister-ukraine-has-alternatives-to-starlinks/	2025-02-23T07:22:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1259126916.jpeg

These constraints have not stopped Trump from repeating Russian propaganda points and accusing Zelensky of being &#x201C;a dictator.&#x201D; Ukrainian NGOs have said organizing an election during the war is &#x201C;impossible,&#x201D; as elections must be preceded by a stable ceasefire backed by security guarantees and proper preparations for the election process, including restoring relevant infrastructure.Zelensky&apos;s administration pledged to hold elections &quot;immediately&quot; after the end of the war, thus allowing soldiers and refugees to safely take part in the vote as well.&quot;The Ukrainian consensus on elections no earlier than six months after the end of martial law is supported by the authorities, the opposition, and the society,&quot; the statement by the Ukrainian NGOs read.According to a February survey, 69% of Ukrainians believe that Zelensky should remain in office until the next elections can be held after the end of martial law. Several opposition politicians also supported this position, warning against Russian attempts to use the elections to divide society.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-is-willing-to-step-down-in-exchange-for-peace/	2025-02-23T07:14:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/photo_2024-01-29_14-15-42.jpg
US sidelines Ukraine in favor of Russia | Ukraine This Week	The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Anna Belokur breaks down the stories impacting Ukraine this week. The U.S. special envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg visited Kyiv as the U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s team started talks with Russia about a ceasefire deal &#x2014; without Ukraine&#x2019;s involvement.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-sidelines-ukraine-in-favor-of-russia-ukraine-this-week/	2025-02-23T06:49:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/IMG_0499.JPG
Economy Minister: Occupied Ukrainian territories have over $350 billion in natural resources	Ukraine has $350 billion worth of natural resources in the Russian-occupied territories, First Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said at the &#x2018;Ukraine. Year 2025&#x2019; forum in Kyiv on Feb. 23. The minister&apos;s comment comes as Kyiv and Washington negotiate a deal for Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources in return for support and security guarantees. The exact value and reserves of Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources, which include critical minerals like lithium and titanium, are only estimated and further calculations are underway. Kyiv turned down the White House&#x2019;s first proposal stating that it did not contact security guarantees although the U.S. has pressured Ukraine into signing an agreement over the last week. U.S. President Donald Trump first said that he wanted $500 billion in minerals to recuperate American aid to Ukraine. &#x201C;The agreement that may emerge must meet the national interests of Ukraine and at the same time be interesting for our partners,&#x201D; Head of the President&#x2019;s Office Andrii Yermak said at the forum. &#x201C;We view American and European investments in mineral extraction primarily as an element of security guarantees,&#x201D; he added. Details of the agreement have not been made public. However, the media leaked the White House&#x2019;s initial proposal on Feb. 12 revealing that the U.S. is seeking a 50% interest in minerals and other natural resources like oil and gas, as well as critical infrastructure, sparking outrage in Ukraine with some officials calling the deal &#x201C;colonial.&#x201D; Since then, there has been a back and forth, with Kyiv presenting its own proposal to the U.S. during the Munich Security Forum on Feb. 14. If done right, it could be a win-win for Ukraine, several figures in Ukraine&#x2019;s business community told the Kyiv Independent. One idea could be sharing a large amount of the resources in the occupied territories, which have resources like gas and lithium, with the U.S. if it helps Ukraine liberate them from Russia, said Ukrainian MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak. Ukraine will start working to conclude an agreement with the U.S. on Feb. 24, Ruslan Stefanchuk, speaker of Ukraine&apos;s parliament, told Japanese media outlet NHK on Feb. 22.	https://kyivindependent.com/economy-minister-occupied-ukrainian-territories-have-over-350-billion-in-natural-resources/	2025-02-23T06:14:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1679993124.jpg
Foreign Minister: Ukraine plans to end war this year	Ukraine plans to end the war this year with a just peace, Ukraine&#x2019;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said at the Ukraine: Year 2025 conference in Kyiv on Feb. 23. Sybiha noted that this is the goal of President Volodymyr Zelensky and told partners that &#x201C;it is time to fasten our diplomatic seat belts&#x201D; and &#x201C;not give in to emotions.&#x201D;&#x201C;We are convinced that we really have a chance to end the war this year,&#x201D; Sybiha said. The minister&apos;s comments come as the White House announced that a peace deal with Russia could be hashed out this week. President Donald Trump has amped up negotiation efforts in the last week, with plans to hold a second round of peace talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 25. Preparations are underway for a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russia&apos;s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Feb. 22. Trump previously said he would &quot;probably&quot; meet Putin before the end of February. The U.S. held the first round of talks directly with Russia on Feb. 18, although notably did not include Ukraine in the meeting. The decision sparkeda backlash in Europe and Ukraine, with Europeans worried they are being sidelined by the U.S. Sybiha stressed that cooperation with the U.S. is important in order to achieve a just peace. Trump previously said that Zelensky is not important to the peace negotiations. Tensions have arisen in recent days after Trump labeled Zelensky a dictator and claimed that Ukraine started the war against Russia. He later walked back on the comment and admitted that Russia attacked Ukraine, although said Ukraine &#x201C;shouldn&#x2019;t have let&#x201D; Russia attack.	https://kyivindependent.com/foreign-minister-ukraine-plans-to-end-war-this-year/	2025-02-23T05:20:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197755028.jpg

Starmer urges Trump to put Ukraine at center of peace negotiations	British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will tell U.S. President Donald Trump that Ukraine must be &#x201C;at the heart&#x201D; of any peace negotiations, the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Office reported on Feb. 22.

The call came a day after Trump said that Zelensky was not important in negotiations having previously labeled the Ukrainian leader a &#x201C;dictator.&#x201D; Trump&#x2019;s rhetoric and decision-making have alarmed allies, particularly after Washington held direct talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 without Ukraine and Europe. Starmer will visit Washington D.C. in the coming week where he will meet Trump and emphasize that Kyiv &#x201C;must be at the heart of any negotiations to end the war.&#x201D; Protecting Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty is &#x201C;essential&#x201D; to prevent further Russian aggression, the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Office added. Trump has repeatedly said he wants to negotiate a swift end to the full-scale war. On Feb. 22, the White House announced that a deal to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine could be reached as early as this week. Trump previously said he would &quot;probably&quot; meet Putin before the end of February. Arrangements for an in-person meeting between the two leaders are already underway, Russia&apos;s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov claimed on Feb. 22.

Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said on Feb. 15 that Europe will not be directly involved in negotiations, but its interests will be considered.Starmer has ramped up vocal support for Kyiv in the last weeks and even said that British peacekeeping troops could be deployed to Ukraine. He also called on Trump to provide American military backing for a proposed European peacekeeping force in Ukraine, arguing that only a U.S. security guarantee can deter Russia from launching further aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/starmer-urges-trump-to-put-ukraine-at-center-of-peace-negotiations/	2025-02-23T01:04:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193601148.jpg

Russian missile attack in Kryvyi Rih kills 1, injures 5	Russia launched a missile attack on the city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast late in the evening on Feb. 22, killing one person and injuring five others. The missile attack left one person dead and five others wounded, Oleksandr Vilkul, head of the city&apos;s military administration &#xA0;reported. Four women and one man were injured. Three of the injured victims have been hospitalized, with one woman reportedly in critical condition. She is being treated in the hospital&apos;s intensive care unit.

Investigation names over 95,000 Russians killed in Ukraine	The names of over 95,000 Russians who died fighting in Ukraine have been verified in a joint investigative project by the BBC&apos;s Russia service and the independent media outlet Mediazona, the BBC reported on Feb. 22. Over 5,000 names have been added to the list of Russian casualties since Jan. 24. The project has been collecting data on losses since February 2022. While the project confirmed over 95,000 deaths since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, the true death toll is believed to be much highter. Military analysts consulted by researchers estimated that the list likely represents only 45% to 65% of Russia&apos;s total casualties. The current list includes 16,171 Russian convicts who were recruited from penal colonies to fight in Ukraine. The total number of convicts who have died on the front lines is likely much higher. Prisoners could account for a third of Russia&apos;s military losses since the full-scale invasion, researchers said. Russia has been recruiting prisoners for the war in Ukraine since the summer of 2022. Investigators verified the names of the dead using data from official reports, newspapers, social media, and graveyards. Russia has not released official figures on its military deaths in Ukraine since September 2022, when the Kremlin claimed only 5,937 personnel had been killed in the war. President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on Feb. 15 that nearly 250,000 soldiers fighting for Russia&apos;s armed forces have been killed in the war against Ukraine. Russian forces have suffered heavy losses in recent months amid Moscow&apos;s accelerating offensive in eastern Ukraine. Troop losses reached record levels in November and December, with casualties continuing to mount in 2025. According to Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, Russia lost more soldiers fighting in the direction of Pokrovsk, a small city in Donetsk Oblast, than its total losses in the Second Chechen War.	https://kyivindependent.com/investigation-names-over-95-000-russians-killed-in-ukraine/	2025-02-22T20:32:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2159525304.jpg
Trump team could strike a deal to end war 'this week,' White House says	U.S. President Donald Trump is &quot;very confident&quot; that he will reach a deal to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, possibly as early as &quot;this week,&quot; White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Feb. 22. Trump has repeatedly said he wants to negotiate a swift end to the full-scale war. Members of his administration held direct talks with Russian officials earlier this week and are currently working to secure a critical minerals deal with Ukraine. &quot;The president, his team are very much focused on continuing negotiations with both sides of this war to end the conflict, and the president is very confident we can get it done this week,&quot; Leavitt said following the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Feb. 22. U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz will be &quot;working around the clock all weekend to get a deal and end this conflict with Ukraine,&quot; she said. According to Leavitt, Trump is confident that Moscow is prepared to negotiate an agreement to end the war. &quot;He believes very strongly that Russia is willing to make a deal, he&apos;s fighting to make a deal,&quot; she said. &quot;The president said he wants the killing to stop, he wants to stop seeing innocent men die, and he wants peace.&quot; Leavitt did not provide any additional details on the types of peace negotiations that would take place in the coming days. Trump previously announced that the U.S. and Russia would hold a second round of talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Feb. 25. Ukraine was not invited to participate in the Saudi Arabia discussions. In his address at CPAC earlier in the day, Trump claimed that the U.S. and Ukraine were &quot;pretty close&quot; to a deal regarding Ukraine&apos;s critical natural resources. The two countries have been working intensively over the past few days to hammer out the details of a revised version of the agreement after President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected an initial proposal on the grounds that it did not offer concrete security guarantees. Trump said at the conference that the deal would compensate the U.S. for the aid it sent Ukraine after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;I want them to give us something for all of the money that we put up,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re asking for rare earth and oil &#x2014; anything we can get.&quot; Leavitt told reporters that the resource agreement was &quot;very important&quot; to Trump. &quot;When it comes to the critical minerals, this is an important piece for the president,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s very important for the president, because it will recoup American tax dollars. And it also will be a great economic partnership between the United States of America and for the Ukrainian people as well, as they rebuild their country following this brutal war.&quot; Officials from the U.S. and Ukraine have indicated that they believe an agreement will be reached soon, but a draft of the new proposal seen by the New York Times (NYT) provides no specific security guarantees for Kyiv in exchange for 50% of the revenues from Ukraine&apos;s natural resources. Zelensky has objected to Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the U.S.-Russia negotiations and dismissed any potential outcomes of talks that do not involve Kyiv&apos;s direct participation. Trump&apos;s overtures toward Russia &#x2014;&#xA0;coupled with increasingly hostile rhetoric towards Zelensky and Ukraine &#x2014;&#xA0;have alarmed Kyiv and leaders across Europe. This week marks the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russia launched the all-out war on Feb. 24, 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-team-could-strike-a-deal-on-ending-war-this-week-white-house-says/	2025-02-22T19:29:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200647187.jpg
Trump-Putin meeting preparations already underway, Russia claims	Arrangements for an in-person meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are already underway, Russia&apos;s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov claimed on Feb. 22. Trump previously said he would &quot;probably&quot; meet Putin before the end of February. The two leaders could discuss a broad range of global topics in addition to the war in Ukraine, Ryabkov told Russian state media. &quot;The question is about starting to move toward normalizing relations between our countries, finding ways to resolve the most acute and potentially very, very dangerous situations, of which there are many, Ukraine among them,&quot; he said. Preparations for the meeting are still in the early stages, Ryabkov said, and organizing the summit will require &quot;the most intensive preparatory work.&quot; U.S. and Russian delegates may hold meetings over the next two weeks in preparation for the Trump-Putin talks, he added. The U.S. and Russia have already held their first direct talks since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, signaling and end to Moscow&apos;s political isolation from the West. Representatives met in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 to discuss preliminary steps towards ending the war in Ukraine. Trump announced that U.S. and Russian envoys will hold another round of talks in Riyadh on Feb. 25. Ryabkov did not provide any details as to a potential date or location for the meeting between Trump and Putin. Trump has said that the leaders&apos; first meeting will take place in Saudi Arabia. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the possibilities of a Trump-Putin meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, during the Saudi Arabia talks. Rubio said on Feb. 20 that a face-to-face meeting between the two leaders would depend on whether &quot;we can make any progress&quot; towards a peace agreement. Ukraine and European leaders have objected to Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the U.S.-Russia talks. President Volodymyr Zelensky said he would not accept the outcome of any negotiations that did not involve Kyiv&apos;s participation. Trump has already spoken to Putin regarding his goal to broker a quick ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump spoke to Putin for nearly 90 minutes in a phone call on Feb. 12, holding a separate call with Zelensky later that day. Following the Riyadh talks, Putin announced that he would &quot;gladly&quot; meet with Trump and said he hoped Washington and Moscow would work out the war in Ukraine in advance of their meeting.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-putin-meeting-preparations-already-underway-russia-claims/	2025-02-22T17:53:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-810261630.jpg
We're going to get our money back' — Trump on US-Ukraine resources deal	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 22 that the United States would &quot;get our money back&quot; after Ukraine agrees to a deal giving Washington access to half its revenues from critical natural resources. &quot;We&apos;re going to get our money back because it&apos;s just not fair,&quot; Trump said at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Feb. 22. &quot;And we will see, but I think we&apos;re pretty close to a deal, and we better be close to a deal.&quot; The U.S. and Ukraine have been working intensively over the past few days to hammer out the details of a revised version of the resources agreement after President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected an initial proposal on the grounds that it did not offer concrete security guarantees. Officials from both countries have indicated that they believe an agreement will be reached soon, but a draft of the new proposal seen by the New York Times (NYT) provides no specific security guarantees for Ukraine. Trump has said that the U.S. deserves compensation for the military aid it has donated to Ukraine since Russia launched the full-scale invasion in 2022. &quot;I want them to give us something for all of the money that we put up,&quot; he said at CPAC. &quot;We&apos;re asking for rare earth and oil &#x2014; anything we can get. I&apos;m trying to get the money back or secured.&quot; The U.S. deal currently on the table demands 50% of revenues from Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas, as well as stakes in ports and other key infrastructure through a joint investment funds. The new version says that the U.S. would hold a 100% financial interest in this fund, and that Ukraine should contribute to the fund until it reaches $500 billion, according to the NYT. While Trump claims he wants to &quot;get the money back&quot; for the U.S., Washington has provided around $100 billion &#x2014;&#xA0;not $500 billion &#x2014;&#xA0;in aid to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war. Trump has cited the $500 billion figure in public comments, claiming on Feb. 10 that Ukraine had &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal. That figure was not included in the original version of the deal presented to Zelensky on Feb. 12. Zelensky&apos;s rejection of the U.S. resource deal triggered a barrage of insults from Trump, who accused the Ukrainian president of being an &quot;unelected dictator.&quot; Reuters reported on Feb. 21 that the U.S. has threatened to cut off Ukraine&apos;s access to Starlink internet terminals it it does not sign the agreement &#x2014; a claim SpaceX CEO and Trump ally Elon Musk has denied.	https://kyivindependent.com/were-going-to-get-our-money-back-trump-on-us-ukraine-resources-deal/	2025-02-22T16:46:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201345531.jpg
Russia exceeded mobilization goals in occupied Ukrainian territories last year, official says	Russia fulfilled its goal of mobilizing thousands of men in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine last year, Bohdan Okhrimenko, head of the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, told the news outlet Ukrinform in an interview Feb. 22. In its efforts to avoid an unpopular mass mobilization campaign at home, Russia has illegally drafted thousands of residents living in occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, as well as in occupied Crimea. Russia exceeded its mobilization goals for these regions in 2024, Okhrimenko told Ukrinform, citing Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR). &quot;In 2024, Russia had to mobilize thousands of people from the newly occupied territories and those who had previously been under occupation,&quot; Okhrimenko said. &quot;According to &#xA0;(HUR), this plan has been fulfilled by 104%. They have a plan for mobilization here and for the current year. It is also thousands of people.&quot; Okhrimenko did not say exactly how many people in the occupied territories had been drafted into the Russian military. The Ukrainian government is working on amending legislation to remove prisoner of war (POW) status from forcibly mobilized Ukrainians who are later captured in Ukraine. &quot;There is a certain legal incident in international documents, international law, so we are working on amending Resolution No. 413 and a number of other resolutions,&quot; Okhrimenko said. Since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, Russia has supplemented its troops by forcibly drafting tens of thousands of Ukrainians in occuped territories. Nearly 5,500 residents of Russian-occupied Crimea were mobilized into the Russian army in 2024 &#x2014;&#xA0;a year that saw record personnel losses as Moscow ramped up its offensive in eastern Ukraine. Forced conscription under occupation constitutes a war crime under international law.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-exceed-mobilization-goals-in-occupied-ukrainian-territories-last-year-official-says/	2025-02-22T16:03:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2164323055.jpg
US mineral deal offers no security guarantees for Ukraine, NYT reports	The current U.S. proposal regarding Ukraine&apos;s critical minerals seeks 50% of revenues from Ukraine&apos;s natural resources while offering no security guarantees in return, according to a draft of the agreement seen by the New York Times (NYT). The U.S. and Ukraine have been working intensively over the past few days to hammer out the details of a revised version of the agreement. Ruslan Stefanchuk, speaker of Ukraine&apos;s parliament, said Kyiv aims to conclude the agreement on Feb. 24, the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &#xA0; The terms of the revised draft are virtually the same as those of an earlier version rejected by President Volodymyr Zelensky, the NYT reported, citing a draft of the agreement dated Feb. 21. In some cases, the U.S. demands are even more stringent. The agreement demands 50% of revenues from Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas, as well as stakes in ports and other key infrastructure through a joint investment fund. The new version says that the U.S. would hold a 100% financial interest in this fund, and that Ukraine should contribute to the fund until it reaches $500 billion. This amount vastly exceeds Ukraine&apos;s actual resource revenues, which totaled $1.1 billion in 2024, and is over four times the value of U.S. aid to Kyiv. That $500 billion figure was not listed in the original proposal presented to Zelensky by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Feb. 12. U.S. President Donald Trump has cited the number in public comments, claiming on Feb. 10 that Ukraine had &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal. When Zelensky then refused to sign the proposed agreement on the grounds that it offered no security guarantees, Trump lashed out at the Ukrainian president, echoing Kremlin talking points by calling him an &quot;unelected dictator.&quot; A visit from Trump&apos;s Special Envoy on Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, appeared to ease tensions and revive negotiations on the resource deal. U.S. and Ukrainian officials have reportedly been working through the night to hammer out an agreement. Trump said on Feb. 21 that the U.S. and Ukraine were &quot;pretty close&quot; to reaching a deal. The new document provides no specific security guarantees, according to the NYT. It instead says the U.S. will provide long-term economic development support for Ukraine. Trump said in early February that he wanted to strike a deal with Ukraine involving access to rare earth minerals in exchange for continued aid &#x2014;&#xA0;a change in U.S. foreign policy that turned support for Ukraine&apos;s defense and sovereignty into a business transaction. Ukraine said it was open to such a deal and has stressed the need for concrete security guarantees. A former senior Ukrainian official called the first U.S. proposal &quot;a colonial agreement&quot; and said Zelensky could not sign the document on those terms. Reuters reported on Feb. 21 that the U.S. has threatened to cut off Ukraine&apos;s access to Starlink internet terminals it it does not sign the agreement &#x2014;&#xA0;a claim SpaceX CEO and Trump ally Elon Musk has denied.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-mineral-deal-offers-no-security-guarantees-for-ukraine-nyt-reports/	2025-02-22T14:57:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1843522320.jpg
Ukraine expects further F-16 deliveries from the Netherlands, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky has confirmed that Ukraine anticipates continued deliveries of F-16 fighter jets from the Netherlands, emphasizing their importance in securing the country&#x2019;s airspace. Following his meeting with Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof at the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky stressed that bolstering Ukraine&#x2019;s air defenses remains a top priority. &quot;The sky over Ukraine must be closed and safe,&quot; he said on Feb. 22, highlighting the critical role of military support in countering Russian aggression. The president thanked the Netherlands for its ongoing assistance and commitment to increasing military aid. He emphasized that strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s defense capabilities is crucial not only for the country&#x2019;s security but also for broader European stability. Several countries have contributed F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine&apos;s defense efforts, with the Netherlands playing a significant role by committing 24 F-16s, the first batch of which arrived in summer 2024. Denmark has pledged 19 F-16s, with initial deliveries made in 2024, while Norway has promised between 6 and 22 aircraft. Belgium has also announced its intention to supply F-16s, though the exact number remains undisclosed. Zelensky also reiterated Ukraine&#x2019;s firm stance on international negotiations, stating: &quot;Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine, nothing about Europe without Europe.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-expects-further-f-16-deliveries-from-the-netherlands-zelensky-says/	2025-02-22T13:20:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1601919862.jpg
Musk denies US threat to cut Starlink over Ukraine minerals deal	Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has denied reports that the United States threatened to shut off Starlink in Ukraine unless Kyiv agreed to a minerals deal. Responding to a report by Reuters, Musk called the claim &quot;false&quot; and accused the news agency of lying. He offered no evidence to back up his statement. His response came after the Kyiv Independent shared the news, which cited anonymous sources alleging that Starlink&apos;s continued operation in Ukraine was being tied to an agreement over mineral resources. This is false. Reuters is lying. They are second only to AP (Associated Propaganda) as legacy news liars. https://t.co/UwbDPk7MWj The U.S. has threatened to cut Ukraine&#x2019;s access to Starlink if Kyiv doesn&#x2019;t agree to a critical minerals deal, Reuters reported on Feb. 21, citing sources. Negotiations are ongoing after President Zelensky refused an initial proposal, though Trump said a deal is near. SpaceX began providing Starlink terminals to Ukraine shortly after the full-scale invasion, giving Kyiv a crucial communications advantage on the battlefield. Since then, however, Musk has grown increasingly vocal in criticizing Ukraine. Musk, who Trump has tasked with eliminating &quot;fraud&quot; and &quot;waste&quot; from the government budget, has called for shutting down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), an organization that provides vital humanitarian aid to Ukraine. He has also amplified Russian disinformation and mocked Zelensky for calling Ukraine an independent country. Musk&apos;s comments on X are often misleading or outright false.	https://kyivindependent.com/musk-denies-us-threat-to-cut-starlink-over-ukraine-minerals-deal/	2025-02-22T12:01:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194950593.jpg
EU considers confiscating part of Russia’s frozen $280 billion, Bloomberg reports	The European Union is intensifying discussions on how to seize Russia&#x2019;s frozen central bank assets to provide financial and military aid to Ukraine, as concerns grow that the United States may scale back its support. EU officials are considering using these assets as collateral for a proposed International Claims Commission, which would assess damages owed to Ukraine, people familiar with the talks told Bloomberg. If Russia refuses to pay, the assets could be confiscated. The initiative follows signals from Washington that Ukraine may receive less assistance moving forward. Discussions on asset seizure come amid escalating tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump recently criticized Zelensky, calling him a &quot;dictator&quot; and falsely blaming Ukraine for Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. As a result, Zelensky has urged European leaders to take greater responsibility in ensuring Ukraine receives sustained financial and military backing. The EU, along with the Group of Seven and Australia, has already frozen approximately $280 billion in Russian central bank assets, primarily held by the Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear. An additional $58 billion in private Russian assets, including luxury properties and yachts, has been frozen under sanctions. Despite support from EU officials such as Valdis Dombrovskis and Maria Lu&#xED;s Albuquerque, EU&apos;s financial services commissioner, the proposal to confiscate Russian assets faces legal and economic hurdles. Some EU nations, including Germany and France, have voiced opposition, warning that such a move could have significant repercussions for the international role of the euro and undermine legal frameworks governing sovereign assets. Another option under review involves directing EU member states to seize Russian assets specifically to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure, though legal justifications remain under debate. The G7 has already pledged profits generated from frozen Russian assets to back a $50 billion loan for Ukraine. Meanwhile, EU legal teams are assessing whether judicial rulings would be necessary to authorize full asset confiscation or if a damage assessment alone could suffice. The European Commission recently informed EU ambassadors that negotiations to establish the International Claims Commission will begin on March 24. The commission&apos;s role will be to determine the exact amount Russia must pay for war damages.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-considers-confiscating-part-of-russias-frozen-280-billion-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-22T10:57:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158001247.jpg
As Trump and Moscow align their vision, battle to stabilize Donetsk front rests on a knife edge	Editor&#x2019;s note: In accordance with the security protocols of the Ukrainian military, soldiers featured in this story are identified by first names and callsigns only. DONETSK OBLAST &#x2013; Scanning an array of nine video feeds from a command point in an abandoned summer, mortar battery commander Tymur &#x201C;Babai&#x201D; searches for movement. On this work video call that continues 24/7, each user is a colleague, but the cameras don&#x2019;t look into living rooms. Instead, each screen shows the eyes of a different Ukrainian drone, scanning the battlefield for Russian targets. On a couple of screens, the unmistakable slanted tower and huge pulley of a Ukrainian coal mine can be seen. Yesterday, drone pilots of his unit, the 23rd Special Purpose Battalion of Ukraine&#x2019;s Presidential Brigade, were hunting Russian infantrymen in the mine buildings; videos on Babai&#x2019;s phone show the last moments of the enemy soldiers&#x2019; lives, caught unaware as the drones flew right through the windows. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s just meat, meat, meat;&#x201D; says Babai of his enemy&#x2019;s tactics, &#x201C;they mobilize someone, and within a week, they&#x2019;re already sitting in a trench. They have this human conveyor belt, and they&#x2019;ll keep sending more and more.&#x201D; &#x201C;Here, the soldiers are unprepared &#x2014; there&#x2019;s no elite assault force or anything like that, just cannon fodder. They give them a rifle, tell them, &#x2018;Go there, those are your comrades, and shoot at anything that moves.&#x2019;&#x201D; A photo of a Ukrainian video feed showing a coal mine near Kotlyne, Donetsk Oblast, on Feb 2, 2025. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Rising by the railway just outside the village of Kotlyne, this small mine, one of dozens dotting the landscape of Donetsk Oblast, represents the very frontier of Russia&#x2019;s westward advance to outflank the embattled city of Pokrovsk. Failing to make progress with a direct assault on Pokrovsk since approaching the southern outskirts of the city in September, Russian forces have turned to a time-honored tactic of trying to surround defenders with wide pushes to Pokrovsk&#x2019;s west and east. Day by day, the offensive also brings with it a grim new reality: that Russia&#x2019;s war could soon enter a new Ukrainian region. According to open-source mapping, Russian forces are now less than five kilometers from the border of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which has not so far seen fighting on the ground. The highway from Pavlohrad to Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, on Feb 2, 2025. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Though Pokrovsk is still far from being surrounded, further south, the situation is markedly more dire. In the aftermath of the fall of Kurakhove in January, elite Ukrainian brigades, though badly depleted, continued to cling on to a pocket of territory just west of the city, despite being encircled on three sides. In mid-February, the Kurakhove pocket began to collapse, and now, the question looms of whether a more evened-out front line will be what Ukraine needs to truly knock the wind out of Russia&#x2019;s offensive, if only temporarily. On the geopolitical front, the last frosty weeks of winter have brought with them chilling signs for Ukraine. But as the world&#x2019;s focus fixates on U.S. President Donald Trump and his alignment with Moscow&#x2019;s war narrative, a desperate struggle to stabilize the Donetsk Oblast front line is continuing uninterrupted. The Kyiv Independent spent two weeks in the Pokrovsk and Kurakhove sectors of the front line, speaking to infantry and artillery commanders, medics, and drone pilots. Though all spoke of heavy fighting and frequent Russian assaults, attacks were reported to have seen a relative lull in the final weeks of winter. &#x201C;When you look at the whole situation, you could say it&apos;s a small operational pause that we&apos;ve observed,&#x201D; Emil Kastehelmi, a Finnish military analyst and member of the Black Bird Group open-source intelligence collective, told the Kyiv Independent &#x201C;They have kept the contact, advancing small steps here and there, but the larger-scale offensive operations have died down.&#x201D; In a narrow treeline between fields of frost, three Ukrainian mortarmen get to work by the dim red light of head torches. Dropping 82mm shells into a weapon that hasn&#x2019;t changed much for over a century, they go about their work without seeing the result, laying fire down on the coordinates given by Babai&#x2019;s officers at the command point. The crew fires around half a dozen shells throughout the night, laying down fire on Russian infantry positions in the hope of crippling the next planned enemy assault. These mortar positions are less than two kilometers (1.2 miles) from the Russian forces digging in around Kotlyne and the coal mine. A week earlier, said mortarman Artem &#x201C;Rio,&#x201D; things were a lot hotter here. &#xA0; &#x201C;When we came in, it was a chaotic situation, it seems to have evened out,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We held on to our positions well, but the flanks were pushed back, and we were basically surrounded for a while there.&#x201D; According to commander Babai, the hectic month his unit has spent fighting here outside Pokrovsk bears all the hallmark signs of systemic organization problems in the Ukrainian military. &#x201C;When we were brought here our battalion was already not combat-effective. We had less than 30 infantrymen left,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;When we came in here, into the chaos we found ourselves in, where there was no established position, no properly constructed supply routes, we ended up in a head-on battle. Some of us were killed while disembarking near trenches that were supposed to be ours, but in reality, they were occupied by the enemy.&#x201D; Two Ukrainian mortarmen prepare shells at a firing position near Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, on Feb. 3, 2025. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Problems in communication in command are only exacerbated by the manpower crisis, asserted Babai, who has routinely had to take the painful step of transferring his own artillerymen into the infantry. &#x201C;When the high command looks at the roster and sees 400 troops in the battalion, they think it&#x2019;s a combat-effective unit,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;They don&#x2019;t actually check how many soldiers are assigned to each company or realize that there is no infantry, and send us in anyway.&#x201D; &#x201C;Our infantry ran out pretty quickly, while our flanks folded, and we had to retreat to Kotlyne.&#x201D; The general chaos recalled by Babai testifies to the critical situations that arise when positions are lost in quick succession, leaving the flanks of neighboring units exposed without their knowledge, and leaving mortarmen like Rio&#x2019;s crew in danger of being trapped in a direct firefight. Worst of all is the lot of the infantry in such conditions, forced to fight off assaults from makeshift positions, with little prospect for planned rotation. &#x201C;A soldier deploys and might sit there for a week, two weeks, a month &#x2014; until he gets wounded or until someone else returns from the hospital to replace him,&#x201D; said Babai. &#x201C;Under these conditions, with constant assaults, guys hold out for a week or two, and then we see desertion cases. These are guys who fought hard, repelled dozens of attacks &#x2014; but the assaults don&#x2019;t stop, and their minds can&#x2019;t hold up forever. Their psyche breaks.&#x201D; Ukrainian mortar battery commander Tymur &quot;Babai&quot; near Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, on Feb 2, 2025. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)With the arrival of freezing temperatures in mid-February, Russian offensives in the Kotlyne sector have died down, even allowing for successful local counterattacks. On the southern outskirts of Pokrovsk, Ukrainian troops took back the village of Pishchane, while in Babai&#x2019;s sector, Ukrainian assault battalions and special forces took back the coal mine. &#x201C;In the Pokrovsk sector, the initiative is beginning to shift to us,&#x201D; said a Ukrainian Special Forces sniper fighting in the area, who declined to be identified for security reasons. &#x201C;They are taking crazy losses; I&#x2019;ve never seen anything like it.&#x201D; If Ukraine can keep up the pressure and uses its time to reorganize its defense, Russian attacks in the area could be stopped dead in their tracks for a long time, according to Babai. &#x201C;The enemy loses morale and can no longer assault,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;They scatter, hiding not even in trenches but in basements, and they don&#x2019;t move anywhere. Their commanders don&#x2019;t know where their personnel are, while we simply finish off the remnants.&#x201D; In a grove of trees somewhere southwest of Pokrovsk, company commander Oleksandr &#x201C;Willy&#x201D; arrives with his team at dusk in an armored vehicle to begin his shift. &#x201C;I hope the day will be quiet, but maybe we could see some movement from their infantry,&#x201D; he says as he takes his place in front of the computer screen. &#x201C;They could try to crawl up to our positions in their small groups.&#x201D; This group is an infantry company of Ukraine&#x2019;s 14th National Guard Brigade, better known as Chervona Kalyna (Red Viburnum) after the subject of a famous Ukrainian folk song. Formed in 2023 as part of the Assault Guard group of new brigades fighting under the Interior Ministry, Chervona Kalyna first saw action in the 2023 Zaporizhzhia Oblast counteroffensive before being transferred to the defense of Pokrovsk in the latter half of 2024. This small dugout, divided crudely into a workspace and a flat area for sleeping, is the brain of the day-to-day positional infantry warfare that has defined this war.

(Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Next to the ubiquitous drone feeds, a neat Excel spreadsheet displays the names of the company&#x2019;s men currently out on positions. Each column of callsigns in the table represents a small, isolated group of Ukraine&#x2019;s most precious resource at this stage of the full-scale war: trained, motivated infantrymen. Even when manning organized lines of defense, Ukrainian infantry have found themselves in isolated conditions that only get more brutal with each month, as the skies get increasingly saturated with Russian drones. Every hour throughout the night, Willy and his team check in on each position, one by one. The calm, laconic replies across the radio &#x201C;450 (Ukrainian military code for everything under control), online,&#x201D; provide a testament that the night is unusually quiet. A rarity in the Pokrovsk area, the Chervona Kalyna brigade has been able to hold the same positions for many months, thanks both to favorable terrain in their sector and a well-organized, well-manned defense. According to Willy though, this hasn&#x2019;t stopped Russian forces from attempting to break their line with near-daily assaults. &#xA0; &#x201C;We try to deal with them before they make it to the position, especially with drones,&#x201D; he said, &quot;the problem is that sometimes they manage to take shelter in the basements and dig in.&#x201D; &#x201C;They are looking for weak points, and when they find them, that&apos;s when they bring in more vehicles, from motorcycles to tanks.&#x201D; Ukrainian soldiers rotating positions near Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, on Feb. 3, 2025. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Sure enough, as dawn breaks, Russian forces are spotted on the move on the outskirts of the occupied town of Hrodivka. Two old motorcycles carrying two enemy infantrymen each can be seen speeding along the last street towards the Ukrainian lines. Before reaching their destination, the soldiers can be seen hastily abandoning their steeds in the middle of the road; sure enough, a few seconds later, the bikes are struck with two small explosions, one after the other. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s our FPVs (first-person view drones) working,&#x201D; says Willy, watching the screen closely. Abandoning whatever their original mission was, the four Russian soldiers take shelter in a wrecked basement. Now, throughout the day their location will be known to Ukrainian fire and drone teams, who have the rest of the day to smoke them out. Further south, in an unassuming hut on the edge of a village, the true cost of the fierce battles in the Kurakhove sector is on full display. At a stabilization point run by Ukraine&#x2019;s 37th Marine Brigade, casualties evacuated from the fighting right in the epicenter of the Kurakhove pocket are given emergency treatment before further transportation to larger military hospitals. Just before the Kyiv Independent arrived for the medics&#x2019; night shift, a large group of wounded and dead had passed through, victims of a Russian Lancet drone strike on their vehicle. The shift continues, first with a drone team who made it out of a Russian attack on their basement with no more than concussions, then a lone, newly-mobilized infantryman who took light shrapnel damage to the arm on his very first combat mission.

(Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Ukrainian medics at a stabilization point near Kurakhove, Donetsk Oblast, on Feb. 10, 2025. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Along with the 37th Marines, the Kurakhove pocket is being defended by some of Ukraine&#x2019;s top brigades, including the 46th Airmobile and 79th Air Assault Brigades, who have fought in the area since the battle of Marinka, over 30 kilometers to the east. Despite their heroic effort, the Ukrainian high command&#x2019;s decision to hold onto semi-encircled areas like this one has come under criticism for causing unnecessary personnel loss and exacerbating the already dire manpower crisis. &#x201C;In some places, it might be worth it to stay and defend, if there are especially favorable locations,&#x201D; said Kastehelmi, &#x201C;but in many places, it seems that the Ukrainians are just holding ground for the sake of holding ground.&#x201D; &#x201C;Getting into pockets stretches the front line, and creates excess amounts of front line in a situation where the units are already depleted of manpower.&#x201D; &#x201C;At the moment, all the wounded are all either very serious or very mild,&#x201D; said senior medic Illia &#x201C;Ptakh,&#x201D; speaking in between treating the wounded. &#x201C;Either they have been hit and can&apos;t be evacuated for days, making light wounds become serious, or they managed to get out as soon as they were hit.&#x201D; With the activity of enemy drones only increasing over 2024, the evacuation of soldiers several days after being wounded &#x2014; what used to be a nightmare scenario in military medicine &#x2014; is now a grim new normality. As the red winter sun rises over the steppe, a wounded infantryman is delivered to the stabilization point. &#x201C;Shrapnel wounds on the right side of the face, including the eye&#x201D; &#x2014; the paramedic&#x2019;s call lets the medics know who and what they can expect to come through the doors. Kostiantyn &#x201C;Hostryi,&#x201D; the wounded soldier, stumbles in, the medics helping him gingerly remove his clothes. &#x201C;It&apos;s very tense,&#x201D; he says, with an impressively calm tone as the medics tend his wounds with disinfectant swabs. &#xA0; &#x201C;I was the last one standing, I hung on there for four days on my own (after being wounded). There were assaults. My group was all killed, and they couldn&apos;t get us out. They just dismantled our dugouts with FPVs.&#x201D; Ukrainian medics attend a wounded soldier at a stabilization point near Kurakhove, Donetsk Oblast, on Feb. 10, 2025. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Within half an hour, Hostryi&#x2019;s company commander arrives, asking him about the hellish situation that his soldier escaped from. &#x201C;When you were retreating, were you shouting out to the guys that were hit?&#x201D; the commander asked. &#x201C;As I ran to the other basement, I couldn&#x2019;t stay outside long, they were dropping bombs on us from drones,&#x201D; Hostryi replied. &#x201C;But yes, I shouted, and nobody called back.&#x201D; &#x201C;Good job, now get healed up,&#x201D; the commander replies after a pause, tapping Hostryi&#x2019;s arm before heading out. For Ptakh, Hostryi&#x2019;s laconic tone after such a dramatic ordeal is no surprise; all in all, while everyone is tired, morale in his unit remains resolute. &#x201C;Of course, those who have lost limbs have lost a part of themselves, it&apos;s pretty hard to come back from that,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;but the others, who just took a little shrapnel, are the most motivated people I have seen, they get patched up and off they go to fight again. &#x201C;People have motivation, their country is being taken from them. It&apos;s not a question of fighting morale, it&apos;s motivation to continue living at all.&#x201D; The arrival of spring will likely bring with it new challenges to the defense of Donetsk Oblast, as the fresh leaves offer better cover from sight for enemy infantry assault groups, and the clearer skies open the field for the widespread use of Russia&#x2019;s feared heavy glide bombs. Going forward, the result of these battles will ultimately hinge greatly on Moscow&#x2019;s ability to keep feeding men into Russian infantry assault teams, said Kastehelmi. &#x201C;With the tactics the Russians use, it&apos;s really difficult to actually attrit them to the point where their offensive would culminate at all,&#x201D; he said. A Ukrainian soldier speaks to a military chaplain in a village near Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, on Feb. 8, 2025. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Over a year after attention was first brought to the need to build strong fortifications to wage the most effective defensive war possible, the failures to build extensive, well-designed lines of defense in advance have been well-documented. Shortcomings in fortification-building &#x2014; a task usually split between military engineers and civilian contractors &#x2014; have been particularly stark in Donetsk Oblast, where Russia&#x2019;s rapid advance and the proliferation of drones mean that excavators are frequently targeted, while chaotic retreats impede Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to prepare coherent lines of defense as positions get quickly overrun. In the case of the Kurakhove area, a formidable line of Ukrainian fortifications along the Vovcha River was rendered effectively useless, facing south rather than east, from where Russia attacked. More naturally favorable terrain in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which has been well-fortified in advance, offers some hope that Russian advances could be stopped in their tracks if they enter the region, according to Kastehelmi. &#x201C;There are some better places to defend, and there are new lines to retreat to,&#x201D; he said, but the problem is that if you don&apos;t have enough people to hold the worst positions, then the defensive line is basically only as strong as its weakest spot.&#x201D; With Trump&#x2019;s willingness to get tough on Russia in serious doubt, Moscow must be ground down here on the battlefield, by the hands of Ukrainians, according to Babai. &#x201C;What we need is to establish a solid defensive line and then move in the infantry,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We have the mortars, UAVs, and strike drones &#x2014; we just need to set up a strong defense.&#x201D; &#x201C;Relying on Western partners is pointless.&#x201D; A makeshift memorial at the entrance sign to Donetsk Oblast, on Feb. 1, 2025.

Hi, this is Francis Farrell, the author of this piece. It&apos;s quite a rare thing that as a journalist spending just a day with soldiers, that you are witness to this much action. What I saw in my time with Achilles is proof of two things: first, how damn good these guys are at their jobs, and second, how damn good Russia is at throwing endless waves of humans at Ukrainian defenses. This type of cyberpunk battlefield matchup could be defining for the war in 2025. Whatever ends up happening, you can count on the fact that we will take you right there. &#xA0;Please consider supporting our reporting.	https://kyivindependent.com/as-trump-and-moscow-align-their-vision-battle-to-stabilize-donetsk-front-rests-on-a-knife-edge/	2025-02-22T09:33:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/DSCF7839.jpg
Trump announces next round of Ukraine peace talks in Riyadh on Feb. 25	U.S. President Donald Trump said a new phase of ceasefire negotiations between American and Russian delegations aimed to stop Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine would take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Feb. 25. This meeting follows the first round of discussions held in the same city earlier in the week. No Ukrainian officials were present at the Saudi negotiations. Following the initial meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlined three main objectives both sides had agreed to pursue. These include restoring embassy staff in Washington and Moscow, creating a high-level team to facilitate Ukraine peace talks, and exploring ways to strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries. Meanwhile, Russia&#x2019;s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said that preparations are underway for a potential face-to-face meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Speaking to Russian state media, Ryabkov said such a summit could cover a broad range of global issues beyond the war in Ukraine. He emphasized the need to &quot;move toward normalizing relations&quot; and address &quot;the most acute and potentially very, very dangerous situations, of which there are many, Ukraine among them.&quot; Ryabkov claimed that plans for the summit remain in the early stages and would require &quot;the most intensive preparatory work&quot; to materialize. He added that U.S. and Russian envoys may hold another meeting within the next two weeks to prepare for further high-level discussions. President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected any potential outcome from the talks, stressing that Kyiv was not included in the discussions. European allies have also voiced concerns over being sidelined in the negotiations, raising further doubts about the legitimacy of the ongoing diplomatic efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-announces-next-round-of-ukraine-peace-talks-in-riyadh-on-feb-25/	2025-02-22T09:18:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183214747.jpg
Ukraine’s work on finalizing minerals deal to start on Feb. 24, parliament speaker says	Ukraine will start working to conclude an agreement with the U.S. for its natural resources on Feb. 24, Ruslan Stefanchuk, speaker of Ukraine&apos;s parliament, told Japanese media outlet NHK. &#xA0; The U.S. is reportedly looking to obtain an interest in 50% of Ukraine&apos;s natural resources through a joint investment fund as payback for its support for Kyiv, according to a leaked version of the deal passed along to President Volodymyr Zelensky by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. According to the NHK report published on Feb. 22, the Ukrainian government will assemble an expert team to begin working on finalizing the agreement on Monday, which also marks the third anniversary of the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &#xA0; Stefanchuk said Ukraine is ready to work with partners on the agreement but wants to &quot;receive specific security guarantees,&quot; according to the report. He also said Ukraine seeks to have &quot;constructive discussions&quot; and a summit with the U.S. Zelensky previously said Kyiv was not ready to sign the document as it did not include any security guarantees. Earlier in the day, Bloomberg reported, citing its source with knowledge of the talks, that Ukraine and the U.S. need more time to finalize the agreement for Ukraine&apos;s natural resources. According to Bloomberg, the draft agreement proposed by the U.S. President Donald Trump administration &quot;currently has some questionable elements&quot; for the Ukrainian side, without specifying them. Sky News also reported, citing its source, that the agreement &#x201C;is not yet ready to be signed&#x201D; due to a number of &quot;problematic issues,&quot; adding that Zelensky is not ready to accept the current form of the draft. However, U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said on Feb. 21 that the deal &#x201C;was going to be done&#x201D; this week, according to Sky News. &quot;Here&apos;s the bottom line, President Zelensky is going to sign that deal, and you will see that in the very short term,&quot; he said during the Conservative Political Action Conference, as quoted by Sky News. Trump said in early February that he wanted to strike a deal with Ukraine involving access to rare earth minerals in exchange for continued aid. Trump later claimed that Kyiv had &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal. However, the latest reports come shortly after Trump accused the Ukrainian president of being &quot;a dictator without elections,&quot; saying that &quot;Zelensky better move fast or he won&#x2019;t have a country left.&quot; On Feb. 19, Trump also said he aims to &quot;resurrect&quot; talks on the agreement for Ukraine&apos;s natural resources. &quot;I think I&#x2019;m gonna resurrect that deal, you know, we&apos;ll see what happens, but I&#x2019;m gonna resurrect it, or things are gonna not make him (President Volodymyr Zelensky) too happy. And look, it&#x2019;s time for elections,&quot; Trump said, without elaborating on the consequences for Ukraine and its president if the deal is not signed.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-work-on-rare-earth-agreement-to-start-on-feb-24-parliament-speaker-says/	2025-02-22T08:03:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1496402851.jpg
NATO to reportedly extend jet fuel pipeline to Czechia, Poland in case of war with Russia	NATO plans to construct a pipeline network connecting Germany with Poland and the Czech Republic to secure a swift jet fuel supply for fighter jets in case of a war with Russia, Reuters reported on Feb. 22, citing Der Speigel. According to an internal memo from Germany&#x2019;s armed forces, Bundeswehr, cited by Der Spiegel, there are &quot;major challenges in ensuring a reliable fuel supply&quot; for troops that would need to be deployed to the eastern border in an emergency. The current pipeline system of the alliance, dating back to the Cold War, ends in western Germany, Reuters reported. There has been no official confirmation from Polish and Czech officials yet. Reuters reports that internal discussions among NATO allies have concluded that pipeline systems are &quot;the backbone of NATO&#x2019;s fuel supply,&quot; as stated in a separate briefing document for senior German defense ministry leaders. The project is estimated to cost 21 billion euros ($22 billion) and is expected to be completed by 2035. The report comes amid growing concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about Washington&apos;s shifting stance on the war, particularly after the U.S. held direct talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. Moscow allegedly demanded that the U.S. withdraw NATO forces from eastern Europe during U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia as a condition for &quot;normalizing relations,&quot; the Financial Times (FT) reported on Feb. 20, citing two officials in the region. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed on Feb. 21 that Russia did not ask the U.S. to withdraw the troops, while the U.S. delegation also reportedly rejected the demand. However, concerns remain over what concessions U.S. President Donald Trump might consider to secure a deal with Russia on ending its war against Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin frequently claims that NATO poses a threat to Russia, accusing the alliance of seeking to expand its borders eastward. Moscow has repeatedly used Ukraine&apos;s possible entry into NATO as one of the justifications for launching its full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-to-reportedly-extend-jet-fuel-pipeline-to-czechia-and-poland/	2025-02-22T07:06:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-996215146.jpg
Russian attacks on Kostiantynivka, Donetsk Oblast, kill at least 2	Russian troops launched multiple airstrikes against the city of Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast, killing at least two civilians and injuring four on the morning of Feb. 22, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported.

Fico says Zelensky 'needs this war,' justifies Russia's full-scale invasion	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has justified the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine, saying that Russia had &quot;serious security reasons&quot; for it. &#xA0; &quot;No one is disputing that Russia&apos;s use of military force in Ukraine was a violation of international law. However, Russia had serious security reasons for doing so because it has long been misled on the issue of NATO enlargement,&quot; Fico said at the Conservative Political Action Conference in the U.S. on Feb. 21. &quot;The conflict could have been brought to an end shortly after it began,&quot; he said. &#xA0; In his 15-minute-long speech, Fico also backed U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s recent criticism of President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying that Zelensky &quot;actually needs this war&quot; to remain in power. Earlier on Feb. 21, U.S. President Donald Trump claimed Zelensky is not essential to negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. He previously also accused Zelensky of being a &quot;dictator&quot; and espoused false claims about Ukraine. &quot;When there is a war, there cannot be democratic elections... When there is a war, it is difficult to investigate where a huge part of the funding given to Ukraine ended up,&quot; said Fico. The speech comes amid intensified tensions between Fico and Zelensky. Fico, who maintains friendly ties with Russia, has escalated threats against Kyiv following the termination of Russian gas transit via Ukrainian territory on Jan. 1. In his remarks on Jan. 28, Fico called Zelensky &quot;the enemy&quot; of Slovakia. Ukraine expressed &quot;deep disappointment&quot; over Fico&apos;s statements, accusing him of acting as &quot;the Kremlin&apos;s mouthpiece&quot; while ignoring Slovakia&apos;s EU membership. The Foreign Ministry warned that this undermines relations between the two countries and damages EU unity. On Jan. 29, the Slovak Foreign Ministry summoned Ukrainian Ambassador Myroslav Kastran, delivering a &quot;strong protest&quot; against what it called Ukrainian interference in Slovakia&apos;s internal affairs. In response, Ukraine summoned Slovak Ambassador Pavel Vizdal on Jan. 30. In his speech on Feb. 21, Fico also claimed the &quot;absolute majority&quot; of the EU member states, except &#xA0;Slovakia and Hungary, have &quot;endorsed the idea that the war in Ukraine should be used to weaken Russia politically and economically.&quot; &quot;Ukraine has been a victim of a bad strategy,&quot; Fico claimed. He also accused the EU of &quot;pushing themselves to the US-Russian peace negotiating table, even though for three years now, they have and still do openly support the war in Ukraine&quot; and said that &quot;peace talks&quot; may not lead to a just and sustainable peace for Ukraine and its territorial integrity. &quot;However, Europe should, in any case, help the US president to end the senseless killings in Ukraine as quickly as possible and not hinder him from achieving this goal,&quot; Fico said.	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-says-zelensky-needs-this-war-justifies-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/	2025-02-22T04:17:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192475502.jpg
Ukraine's SBU claims attack on Russian oil pumping station in Krasnodar Krai	Drones operated by Ukraine&#x2019;s Security Service (SBU) struck a substation powering the Novovelychkovskaya oil pumping station in Russia&#x2019;s Krasnodar Krai on Feb. 20, effectively disrupting its operations, a security source told the Kyiv Independent. According to the source, the station is one of the &quot;key facilities for transporting oil in the Kuban region, supplying the Afipsky and Ilysky oil refineries.&quot; Russian authorities are currently assessing the damage, the source said. On Feb. 20, several local Russian media outlets and Telegram channels reported explosions in the Krasnodar Krai region, claiming Russian air defense repelled the drone attack and there was no fire. &quot;This is the eighth successful SBU special operation since the beginning of the year targeting Russia&apos;s oil refining and pumping facilities. Each such explosion results in multimillion-dollar losses for Russia and complicates the provision of fuel to the Russian army,&quot; the source said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Ukraine routinely launches deep strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia, primarily relying on domestically developed drones. Kyiv has particularly taken aim at Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure as part of its strategy to undermine funding for the Kremlin&apos;s war chest. Earlier on Feb. 20, a source in Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) confirmed they were behind the detonations of goggles for first-person-view (FPV) drones used by Russian soldiers. According to the source, HUR bought a large batch of FPV goggles for the operation and rigged them with explosives and a detonation mechanism.	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-confirms-attack-on-russian-oil-pumping-station/	2025-02-22T03:13:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/photo_2024-07-07-18_27_19.jpeg
The US wants lasting peace' — Polish FM meets State Secretary Rubio	Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski met U.S. State Secretary Marco Rubio during his trip to the U.S. on Feb. 21, saying it was a &quot;powerful conversation between close allies.&quot; Sikorski said their meeting was &quot;substantial and cordial&quot; and it &quot;confirmed the durability of the Polish-American alliance,&quot; Polish RMF FM reported. When asked about the Ukraine peace negotiation tactics of U.S. President Donald Trump, Sikorski said it was better to ask the U.S. side about them, adding he &quot;got the impression that the United States wants lasting peace.&quot; Sikorski and Rubio&apos;s meeting comes amid growing concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about Washington&apos;s shifting stance on the war, particularly after the U.S. held direct talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18.

Earlier on Feb. 21, Sikorski wrote on X that he had brought the &quot;Shahed&quot; drone, shot down by Ukrainian forces, to the Conservative Political Action Conference in the U.S. &quot;The Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington is one of the most influential political events in the world.

Zelensky, Scholz discuss 'ways to achieve just peace' in Ukraine	President Volodymyr Zelensky and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz discussed &quot;ways to achieve just peace in Ukraine&quot; during a phone call on Feb. 21. According to a statement from Steffen Hebestreit, the German Federal Government spokesman, Scholz &quot;reiterated his ongoing and unwavering solidarity with Ukraine,&quot; and assured that Germany would continue to support Ukraine in close coordination with European and international partners until a &quot;just, comprehensive and lasting peace is achieved.&quot; The phone call comes amid growing concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about Washington&apos;s shifting stance on the war, particularly after the U.S. held direct talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18.

Both Zelensky and Scholz agreed that Ukraine must be &quot;at the table in future negotiations on peace,&quot; that &quot;questions about European security must be discussed together with the Europeans,&quot; and that &quot;close coordination between Ukraine and its closest partners is necessary.&quot; &#xA0; Following the call, Zelensky also announced their discussion on a shared approach to ending the war and ensuring reliable security guarantees was &quot;substantive.&quot; &quot;We discussed in detail the necessary steps to achieve a just peace, as well as Europe&#x2019;s role at the negotiating table,&quot; he said in a post on Telegram. Zelensky also thanked Scholz for his support, adding that since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Germany has provided Ukraine with 43.6 billion euros in assistance. &quot;I thanked him (Scholz) for Germany&#x2019;s contribution to protecting thousands of lives, as well as for its leadership in strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s air defense,&quot; Zelensky wrote. &quot;Ukrainian people will always remember such strong support.&quot; According to a recent poll released on Feb. 21 by Ukrainian polling firm Rating, 91% of Ukrainians surveyed oppose peace negotiations between the U.S. and Russia without Ukraine&apos;s participation.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-scholz-discuss-ways-to-achieve-just-peace-in-ukraine/	2025-02-22T00:17:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/Zelensky-and-Scholz-June-11.jpeg
Europe did more than the U.S.' — EU defense commissioner pushes back against Trump accusations	Editor&apos;s note: The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. Donald Trump&apos;s return to the White House has forced Kyiv and other European capitals to ask themselves a sobering question: What will happen to Western support for Ukraine if the U.S. withdraws? The U.S. has been, by far, the largest military donor to Kyiv, delivering $67 billion in arms since 2022, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky &#x2014; a figure slightly higher than the overall defense commitments by all European countries combined. Yet in recent days, Trump has attacked Europe over its supposed lack of contributions to Ukraine, overstated Washington&apos;s support, and given a very clear signal that the continent won&#x2019;t be able to rely on the U.S. for its security in the future. If the U.S. does withdraw, questions remain over whether Europe can realistically plug the gap and pay for the defense of Ukraine and the continent as a whole. Lulled by decades of peace, Europe&apos;s defense industry has struggled to catch up with the high-attrition warfare in Ukraine, often failing on its promises to deliver arms and ammunition as fast as needed. To whip the European defense industry into shape, Brussels has appointed veteran Lithuanian politician Andrius Kubilius as its first-ever defense commissioner. The Kyiv Independent sat down with Commissioner Kubilius to ask whether the EU is ready to step up in the light of recent shifts in the U.S. Speaking on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14, Kubilius pushed back against Washington&apos;s accusations while underscoring the strides made by the European defense industry since 2022. Nevertheless, catching up with Russia&apos;s wartime arms production remains a challenge to be overcome, Kubilius warns. The Kyiv Independent: U.S. officials said earlier this week that Europe should take up greater responsibility for supporting Ukraine militarily. Do you think the EU has the capacity to become Ukraine&apos;s leading supporter if the U.S. withdraws or reduces support? Andrius Kubilius: First of all, we need to look precisely at the numbers. During three years of the (full-scale) war, EU support to Ukraine, which includes military support, budgetary support, and humanitarian support, was around 134 billion euros ($140 billion). If you calculate the same support from the United States, it&apos;s around $100 billion. So, the overall support from the European Union is 30% bigger than support from the United States. When we look at military support, yes, Americans provided around $60 billion, and European support is 48 billion euros ($50 billion). But if we are looking at the scale of support, unfortunately, both the EU and American support for Ukrainian defense per year does not reach 0.1% of GDP. We need to look at how to increase support for Ukraine because we want to achieve this formula: &quot;Peace through strength.&quot; Strength demands, from our side, bigger military support for Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent: There are reports that the Americans are considering the idea that Europe would be buying U.S. weapons for Ukraine. What do you think about this proposal? Andrius Kubilius: First of all, it would be good for us to buy much more Ukrainian production under the so-called Danish model. This would allow us to procure two times more weapons, which are needed for the Ukrainian army, with the same amount of money because the Ukrainian defense industry is very successful and becoming stronger. Secondly, we can look at what we can provide from European Union industries. Then, perhaps there are some weapons that the Europeans are not producing and which are produced by Americans, and we need to look at how those weapons can be delivered to Ukraine. I don&apos;t know if the Americans will stop providing support to Ukraine. I still hope they understand how important it is to give Ukraine additional strength. For the time being, we cannot react to what Americans are saying because we can see some different statements from different members of the administration. The Kyiv Independent: The European defense industry has been criticized during the full-scale war for not delivering enough fast enough to Ukraine. For example, 1 million artillery shells were delivered only after a significant delay. Have these deficiencies been addressed? Andrius Kubilius: Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine and our effort to support Ukraine have shown quite deep problems in the European defense readiness and defense industry. I would remind you that back in 2022, the European industry was able to produce only around 300,000 artillery shells per year. Once the promise to give 1 million shells was given, suddenly it was clear that we were not able to produce (them). That is why the first European Union-level program, the so-called ASAP program, was introduced, which created mechanisms for how we can support European industries when they are expanding their production capacities on the EU level. According to the numbers, we will end this year with the ability to produce around 2 million artillery shells per year. So we increased our production capacity by almost eight times. We are now producing more than the Americans, but still, we see the challenge that the Russians, with their war economy and with assistance from North Korea, are able to produce more. We need to continue those programs and look at how to expand our defense industry production in all different areas. In our white paper about European defense, which we are now drafting, we are trying to have a very clear understanding of what NATO capability targets European member states need to achieve very soon. I&apos;m always saying that we need to increase our defense capabilities, not incrementally but in what I call a Big Bang approach. Bundeswehr soldiers participate in the final NATO exercise &quot;Quadriga 2024&quot; in Pabrade, Lithuania, on May 29, 2024 (Kay Nietfeld / picture alliance via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Do you have an estimate for when the European defense industry will match Russia&apos;s production? Andrius Kubilius: We have a clear understanding from different EU intelligence services that Russia could be ready to test the European Union before 2030. Some, like the Danish intelligence, are saying even by 2027. So our task is to be ready to defend the European Union in such a way as to deter Russia from any ideas about military aggression against European member states. That is why we need to move very rapidly. The Kyiv Independent: President Donald Trump said that NATO countries should increase their defense spending benchmark to 5% of GDP, which is a level that none of the NATO countries, including the U.S., reached in 2024. How realistic do you think this goal is? Andrius Kubilius: It&apos;s very clear that we need to increase our defense spending from 2%. It&apos;s a question for NATO to agree on the target. And as you correctly mentioned, when President Trump is speaking about 5%, he needs to say in a very clear way that he is ready himself to increase American defense spending, because now, their defense spending is around 3.5%. There are quite a number of European member states who are now spending around the same amount, like 3.5%. Poland is leading with perhaps 4.5%. Now, the Baltic states are announcing they are going to raise defense spending up to 5% or 6%. But those decisions are made not because Trump is demanding them, but because there is such a guy as Putin. We understand very well what can happen if we don&apos;t increase our defense readiness radically in a very short period of time. The Kyiv Independent: You mentioned that one of the main goals now is to help Ukraine negotiate from a position of strength. But it seems time may be short, as President Trump is pushing for negotiations. Do you feel there is enough momentum from the EU to really help Ukraine negotiate from a position of strength? Andrius Kubilius: As I said, the EU has been doing quite a lot with our assistance to Ukraine, because during the war, it&apos;s not only military assistance that&apos;s important &#x2014; it&apos;s also assistance to the budget to keep the financial system stable. Humanitarian assistance is also very crucial. So the Europeans have done, we can say, more than Americans. If the Americans are criticizing us (by saying) the Europeans need to do more, we accept that criticism, but we can say that the Americans could also do more. I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s the best way for us to spend time, criticizing each other on who needs to do more. In my view, we need to do more to strengthen Ukraine and have a clear plan on how we can realize that. Note from the author: Hi, this is Martin Fornusek. I hope you enjoyed this interview.

US threatens to shut off Starlink if Ukraine won't sign minerals deal, sources tell Reuters	The United States has threatened to cut off Ukraine&apos;s access to Starlink satellite internet terminals if Kyiv does not reach a deal with the U.S. regarding critical mineral resources, Reuters reported on Feb. 21, citing three sources familiar with the negotiations. U.S. and Ukrainian officials are currently negotiating the terms of a revised minerals deal after President Volodymyr Zelensky refused to sign an initial proposal. U.S. President Donald Trump said earlier on Feb. 21 that the parties are &quot;pretty close&quot; to an agreement. U.S. negotiators have warned that Ukraine would lose access to Starlink terminals, owned by billionaire Elon Musk&apos;s company SpaceX, if Kyiv did not sign the deal, sources told Reuters. Starlink internet terminals have played a crucial role in securing communications in the war in Ukraine. Last year, Ukraine said that approximately 42,000 terminals were in operation across the military, hospitals, businesses, and aid organizations. Washington first raised the prospect of shutting off Starlink service after Zelensky rejected the deal presented by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Feb. 12, sources said. The deal reportedly sought a 50% stake in Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas, without offering Ukraine any concrete security guarantees. The Starlink threat came up again in talks with U.S. Special Envoy Keith Kellogg, who met with Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials in Kyiv on Feb. 20. A source told Reuters that the loss of Starlink access would be devastating for Ukraine. &quot;Ukraine runs on Starlink. They consider it their North Star,&quot; the source said. &quot;Losing Starlink ... would be a massive blow.&quot; SpaceX began providing Starlink terminals to Ukraine shortly after the full-scale invasion, giving Kyiv a crucial communications advantage on the battlefield. Since then, however, Musk has grown increasingly vocal in criticizing Ukraine. Musk, who Trump has tasked with eliminating &quot;fraud&quot; and &quot;waste&quot; from the government budget, has called for shutting down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), an organization that provides vital humanitarian aid to Ukraine. He has also amplified Russian disinformation and mocked Zelensky for calling Ukraine an independent country. Trump also began lashing out at Zelensky after he refused to sign the minerals deal. He&apos;s questioned Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy as president and claimed he&apos;s not important to peace negotiations with Russia. Trump said in early February that he wanted to strike a deal with Ukraine involving access to rare earth minerals in exchange for continued U.S. aid. Trump later claimed that Kyiv has &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal. The contents of the revised agreement currently under discussion have not been disclosed. Trump claimed on Feb. 21 that Ukraine was &quot;very happy&quot; with the deal and that the U.S. would &quot;get our money back.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-threatens-to-shut-off-starlink-if-ukraine-wont-sign-minerals-deal-sources-tell-reuters/	2025-02-21T21:43:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1853200567.jpg
US proposes rival UN statement on Ukraine war, clashing with Kyiv, Europe, Reuters reports	The United States has prepared its own draft of a United Nations resolution marking the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, rivaling Kyiv and European countries&apos; joint statement, Reuters reported on Feb. 21. The move comes after the U.S. reportedly refused for the first time to co-sponsor the previous draft of the UN resolution, which reaffirms Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity and condemns Moscow&apos;s aggression. The new U.S. resolution mourns the casualties of the &quot;Russia-Ukraine conflict&quot; and &quot;implores a swift end to the conflict,&quot; according to a draft obtained by Reuters. It also affirms &quot;that the principal purpose of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security and to peacefully settle disputes.&quot; The resolution &quot;further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.&quot; According to Reuters, Russia has proposed an amendment that edits the text to &quot;implores a swift end to teh conflict, including by addressing its root causes, and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.&quot; Russia&apos;s envoy to the U.N., Vasily Nebenzya, called the U.S. draft a &quot;good move.&quot; He also said the U.S. briefed him on the text before circulating it to the other members of the General Assembly. Moscow would vote in favor of the U.S. resolution if the General Assembly voted to adopt it, a Russian official told Reuters, speaking on the condition of anonymity. European diplomats reportedly held a meeting on Feb. 21 to discuss the U.S. draft. The General Assembly will vote on the resolution on Feb. 24, which marks the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In previous years, the U.S. has co-sponsored resolutions condemning Russian aggression and calling for a just peace. The upcoming UN vote is considered a key indicator of global support for Ukraine. The softened language towards Russia reflects a dramatic shift in U.S. rhetoric towards Kyiv and Moscow over the past week. U.S. President Donald Trump has lashed out at President Volodymyr Zelensky, calling him a &quot;dictator&quot; and blaming Ukraine for starting the war. Trump on Feb. 21 acknowledged that &quot;Russia attacked&quot; Ukraine, but still shifted blame to Zelensky and former U.S. President Joe Biden for not preventing the invasion. The U.S. also opposed directly calling Russia the &quot;aggressor&quot; in a G7 statement marking the anniversary of the invasion, according to the Financial Times.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-proposes-rival-un-statement-on-ukraine-war-clashing-with-kyiv-europe-reuters-reports/	2025-02-21T20:38:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1676985291.jpg
EU preparing military aid package for Kyiv worth $20.9 billion, Bloomberg reports	The European Union is preparing a military aid package for Ukraine worth approximately 20 billion euros ($20.9 billion), Bloomberg reported on Feb. 21, citing a source familiar with the matter. The latest package aims to bolster Ukraine&apos;s strategic position as U.S. President Donald Trump presses for a speedy ceasefire agreement with Russia. The additional military support would aim to supply Kyiv with air defense systems, artillery ammunition, long-range missiles, and drones, Bloomberg reported. People familiar with the plans said that the details of the discussion will be discussed at an upcoming foreign ministers meeting. EU member states and allies could offer cash contributions or military equipment to the aid package, sources told Bloomberg, speaking on the condition of anonymity. European leaders would then agree on the final value of the package and approve the aid. The package could potentially be delayed, as Hungary &#x2014;&#xA0;one of Europe&apos;s most Kremlin-friendly countries &#x2014; has promised to oppose any additional aid to Ukraine. The German elections, set for Feb. 23, could also affect the timeline. Earlier this week, Politico reported that the EU was preparing additional security assistance for Ukraine worth at least $6.2 billion. European leaders have scrambled to deliver military support to Ukraine as the U.S., under the Trump administration, races to make a deal with Moscow. When U.S. and Russian officials met in Riyadh on Feb. 18 for preliminary talks on ending the war, EU officials feared Europe was being shut out of the peace process altogether. Trump has said he wants Europe to play a greater role in supporting Ukraine&apos;s financial and defense needs, but his administration has sent mixed signals as to whether Europeans are welcome in the negotiations process.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-preparing-military-aid-package-for-kyiv-worth-20-9-billion-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-21T19:34:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2151615401.jpg
Trump admits Russia attacked Ukraine	U.S. President Donald Trump admitted on Feb. 21 that Russia launched the full-scale war by attacking Ukraine. Earlier in the week, Trump blamed Ukraine for starting the war, saying Kyiv &quot;should have never started it&quot; and instead should have &quot;made a deal.&quot; During an interview with Fox News Radio, Trump conceded that Russia, not Ukraine, was the aggressor. &quot;Russia attacked, but they shouldn&apos;t have let him attack,&quot; he said. Trump said that President Volodymyr Zelensky and former U.S. President Joe Biden should have taken steps to prevent the full-scale invasion. In the same interview, Trump claimed that Zelensky was not important to future peace negotiations. The U.S. did not invite Zelensky or any Ukrainians to participate in talks between Russian and American officials in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. In the interview, Trump claimed there was no reason to invite Zelensky &quot;because he did such a bad job in negotiating so far.&quot; Trump has used increasingly hostile rhetoric towards Zelensky in recent days, calling him a dictator and accusing him of being partly to blame for Russia&apos;s attacks. Russia launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-admits-russia-attacked-ukraine/	2025-02-21T18:48:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198715828.jpg
US 'pretty close' to minerals deal with Ukraine, Trump claims	The United States is &quot;pretty close&quot; to signing a rare earth minerals agreement with Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump claimed on Feb. 21. Trump&apos;s remarks come after reports that the U.S. sent Ukraine a revised version of the deal on Feb. 20 after President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected an initial proposal presented on Feb. 12. &quot;I think we&apos;re pretty close,&quot; Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Feb. 21. &quot;I think (the Ukrainians) want it. They feel good about it, and it&apos;s a significant &#x2014; it&apos;s a big deal, but they want it, and it keeps us in that country, and they&apos;re very happy about it. We get our money back.&quot; U.S. and Ukrainian officials have been reportedly working through the night to hammer out an agreement that would give Washington access to Ukraine&apos;s rare earth mineral deposits in exchange for continued military aid to Kyiv. Earlier in the day, U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz predicted that Zelensky would sign the deal &quot;in the very short term.&quot; In his evening address on Feb. 21, Zelensky said the agreement could improve relations between the U.S. and Ukraine. &quot;This is an agreement that can strengthen our relations, and the key is to work out the details to ensure its effectiveness. I look forward to the outcome &#x2014;&#xA0;a just result,&quot; he said. The latest round of negotiations follow a week of heightened tensions between Trump and Zelensky. Shortly after U.S. and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia for talks on the war without inviting Ukraine, Trump blamed Ukraine for starting the war and called Zelensky a &quot;dictator.&quot; Zelensky in turn accused Trump of succumbing to Russian disinformation. A visit from Trump&apos;s Special Envoy on Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, appeared to ease tensions somewhat. Kellogg praised Zelensky as a &quot;courageous leader&quot; and Zelensky said the meeting &quot;restores hope&quot; for U.S.-Ukraine relations. &#xA0; Trump said in early February that he wanted to strike a deal with Ukraine involving access to rare earth minerals in exchange for continued aid. Trump later claimed that Kyiv has &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal. The initial U.S. proposal reportedly sought a 50% stake in Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas, as well as stakes in ports and other key infrastructure through a joint investment fund. Zelensky aid Kyiv was not ready to sign the document as it lacked concrete security guarantees. A former senior Ukrainian official reportedly called the proposal &quot;a colonial agreement.&quot; The U.S. has revised the deal to better align with Ukrainian law, Axios reported. The details of the revised deal have not yet been disclosed.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-pretty-close-to-minerals-deal-with-ukraine-trump-claims/	2025-02-21T18:28:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194989577.jpg
Austria offers to host Ukraine peace negotiations, ambassador says	Austria is open to hosting Ukraine peace talks, Austrian Ambassador to Ukraine Arad Benko said in an interview with RBC-Ukraine on Feb. 21. With U.S.-led peace talks to stop Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine looming, various countries have put themselves forward as potential hosts for negotiations. &quot;(Austrian) Chancellor (Karl) Nehammer emphasized that as the capital of a neutral country, Vienna is always ready to host future peace talks,&quot; Benko said in an interview with RBC-Ukraine on Feb. 21. Austria has a history of hosting opposing sides for talks. The country hosted leaders of the U.S. and Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War, Benko said. &quot;Austria, as a neutral country, has offered its good services as a host of negotiations between parties involved. It&apos;s important to point out that Austria is also a seat of 52 international organizations including 18 UN organizations,&quot; he said. Austria, a permanently neutral nation under its constitution, hosts various international agencies, including the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Ukraine and the EU must be involved in the peace talks alongside Russia and the U.S., Benko added, echoing sentiment in Europe that the U.S. should not exclude Europe and Ukraine from peace talks. Europe must participate in potential peace talks &quot;not only because we are the biggest donors but because Ukraine is a European country fighting for our values and freedom,&quot; Benko said. Nehammer previously proposed Vienna as a site of talks between Kyiv and Moscow in September 2024. The Austrian chancellor reiterated the offer in a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in December. Nehammer also became the first EU leader to visit Russian President Vladimir Putin following the full-scale invasion in February 2022. He visited Moscow in April 2022, claiming it was his duty to open &quot;humanitarian corridors&quot; as a step towards ending the war. Other countries that have volunteered to host future peace talks include Turkey, China, and Saudi Arabia. U.S. and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 for preliminary talks without the participation of Ukraine or Europe. Kyiv continues to insist that no talks about ending Russia&apos;s all-out war should be held without Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/austria-offers-to-host-ukraine-peace-negotiations-official-says/	2025-02-21T17:27:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1243178046.jpg
One person killed in drone attack on Kyiv Oblast, warehouse on fire	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A 60-year-old man was killed at a railway crossing in Kyiv Oblast, amid a Russian drone attack on the region, the Kyiv Oblast Military Administration reported. The deceased man, an employee Ukrzaliznytsia &#x2014; Ukraine&apos;s state railway company, was pronounced dead when paramedics arrived at the scene. Multiple drones targeted Kyiv Oblast in the early hours of Feb. 22 in a Russian drone attack, local authorities reported. Drone debris fell in Kyiv and a fire broke out on private property, Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said on Feb. 22. A local warehouse in Kyiv Oblast is burning as firefighting operations are underway. The windows of an educational institution and residential high-rise building have also been shattered. The full extent of the damage caused was not immediately available. Russia has increased its drone attacks on Ukraine&apos;s capital and surrounding region in recent months, regularly launching dozens of attack drones towards Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/one-dead-in-kyiv-oblast-drone-attack-warehouse-buildings-on-fire/	2025-02-21T15:27:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/kyiv.jpg
Bulgarian parliament votes against deploying troops to Ukraine	The Bulgarian parliament voted overwhelmingly in favor of a non-binding declaration on Feb. 21 that would seek to halt any deployment of military forces to Ukraine. European leaders have increased discussions of sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine in a potential peace settlement. Bulgaria backed out of signing a security deal with Ukraine in December citing potential peace talks. The Bulgarian armed forces can not conduct military actions in Ukraine outside of its alliance and international commitments, the declaration read. The declaration does not rule out Bulgarian forces participating in missions led by the United Nations (UN), EU, NATO, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). In the declaration, the Bulgarian parliament called for a lasting and just peace in Ukraine and believes peace can be achieved through negotiations that include all directly impacted parties. 166 lawmakers voted in favor of the declaration, 27 lawmakers voted against, and 11 lawmakers abstained from voting. Lawmakers from the ruling majority voiced that the purpose of the declaration was to reassure the Bulgarian public. &quot;We hope that as Bulgarians we&#x2019;ll look after our own national interest,&quot; Boyko Borissov, leader of the ruling GERB party said. Pro-Russian lawmakers voted against an amendment condemning Russian aggression. Bulgaria has provided Ukraine with a variety of aid since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, but the matter has been contentious due to significant pro-Russian sentiment in the country and opposition from President Rumen Radev. European leaders have called for peacekeeping forces to be deployed in Ukraine to enforce a potential ceasefire. The U.K. is reportedly leading a plan to have 30,000 peacekeeping troops deployed to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/bulgarian-parliament-votes-against-deploying-troops-to-ukraine/	2025-02-21T15:13:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-507854558.jpg
Ukrainian, US officials negotiated throughout the night amid minerals deal dispute, Axios reports	Ukrainian and U.S. officials were at the table overnight and into the morning discussing an &quot;improved&quot; bilateral rare earth mineral deal on Feb. 21, Axios reported. The U.S. is looking to obtain 50% of Ukraine&apos;s rare earth minerals, NBC reported on Feb. 15. Washington has signaled openness to deploy American troops to guard these resources if there is a deal with Russia to end the war, unnamed American officials said. U.S. President Donald Trump said in early February that he wanted to strike a deal with Ukraine involving access to rare earth minerals in exchange for continued aid. Trump later claimed that Kyiv has &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal. A former Ukrainian official described the initial deal as &quot;a colonial agreement.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump slammed President Volodymyr Zelensky for failing to accept the mineral deal on Feb. 19. The White House sent Ukraine the latest version of the deal on the eve of Feb. 20, Axios reported citing a U.S. official and a source with direct knowledge. It is not immediately clear to what the terms of the new deal are. The U.S. proposed an improved agreement earlier this week and has further modified the proposal. The original deal did not offer any security guarantees to Ukraine. The deal is a &quot;make or break scenario for the Ukrainians,&quot; the U.S. official told Axios. It is now up to Zelensky to accept the new deal, both sources expressed concern the rift between Trump and Zelensky may worsen if Ukraine does not accept a deal. During his evening address on Feb. 21, Zelensky said that as negotiations are ongoing, Ukraine was looking for the deal to culminate in a &quot;just result.&quot; &quot;This is an agreement that can strengthen our relations, and the key is to work out the details to ensure its effectiveness. I look forward to the outcome,&quot; Zelensky said. U.S. officials and some Ukrainian officials are reportedly pressuring Zelensky to come to an agreement, Axios reported. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said on Feb. 21 that President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to sign a minerals deal with the U.S. &quot;in the very short term,&quot; the Guardian reported. &quot;President Zelensky is going to sign that deal, and you will see that in the very short term,&quot; Waltz said at the Conservative Political Action Conference. &quot;And that is good for Ukraine. What better could you have for Ukraine than to be in an economic partnership with the United States?&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-and-us-officials-negotiated-all-night-amid-minerals-deal-dispute-axios-reports/	2025-02-21T14:06:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GkOwkA1XwAAtUyM.jpg
91% of Ukrainians oppose peace talks without Ukraine's participation, poll finds	A total of 91% of Ukrainians surveyed oppose peace negotiations between the U.S. and Russia without Ukraine&apos;s participation, a poll released on Feb. 21 by Ukrainian polling firm Rating suggests. The poll, commissioned between Feb. 20 - 21, comes amid growing concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about Washington&apos;s shifting stance on the war, particularly after the U.S. held direct talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. Concerns in Kyiv continued to mount on Feb. 21 as U.S. President Donald Trump claimed on Feb. 21 President Volodymyr Zelensky is not essential to negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. &quot;I don&apos;t think he&apos;s very important to be at meetings, to be honest with you,&quot; Trump told Fox News Radio on Feb. 21. &quot;When Zelensky said, &apos;Oh, he wasn&apos;t invited to a meeting,&apos; I mean, it wasn&apos;t a priority because he did such a bad job in negotiating so far.&quot; Zelensky on Feb. 16 rejected the idea of peace negotiations being conducted behind Ukraine&apos;s back. Ukrainian surveyed overwhelmingly agreed with Zelensky&apos;s assertion, with only 7% of respondents in favor of Ukraine not participating in the peace talks. Trump plans to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia in the coming months, though the extent of Ukraine&apos;s involvement in those talks remains unclear. NBC News reported on Feb. 16, citing two U.S. officials, that the intention is for the U.S. to host a bilateral meeting with Russia, followed by a bilateral meeting with Ukraine, and culminating with talks together. A vast majority, 64%, of Ukrainians surveyed in the poll support Ukraine participating in direct negotiations with Russia to end the war &#x2014; with 32% of respondents opposed. As negotiations to end the war begin, a total of 81% of respondents believe that negotiations involving other countries are necessary for a realistic solution to end the war, with a further 83% believing that that Ukraine should agree to a ceasefire only if security guarantees are provided. The survey was conducted across all regions of the country, except those currently under Russian occupation, and survey 1,200 adults. The results are deemed to be accurate within 2.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.	https://kyivindependent.com/91-of-ukrainian-oppose-peace-talks-without-ukraines-participation-poll-shows/	2025-02-21T13:34:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1152488863.jpg
Trump's Ukraine remarks 'shocking,' echo Russian narratives, German opposition leader says	German opposition leader Friedrich Merz has criticized U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s statements about Ukraine, calling them &quot;shocking&quot; and aligned with Russian narratives, the German TV news program Tagesschau reported on Feb. 21. &quot;This is the Russian narrative; this is how Putin has presented it for years, and I&apos;m frankly shocked that Donald Trump has now apparently embraced it himself,&quot; Merz, the leading candidate for chancellor in the upcoming Feb. 23 parliamentary election, said. Trump has made multiple false claims about Ukraine in recent days, including calling President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and accusing him of refusing to hold elections. His remarks ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections under martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. On Feb. 18, Trump appeared to place responsibility for the ongoing war on President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s wartime leadership. Merz described Trump&apos;s comments as &quot;a classic substitution of the criminal for the victim.&quot; The criticism comes as tensions between Kyiv and Washington escalate following U.S.-Russia talks in Riyadh on Feb. 18. Neither Ukraine nor Europe were represented at the talks. Merz stressed that Europe must not passively seek a seat at the negotiations but rather assert its influence through diplomatic efforts. &quot;We have to agree on a common strategy very, very quickly,&quot; he said. As the chancellor candidate for Germany&apos;s conservative CDU/CSU alliance in the upcoming Feb. 23 elections, Merz has been a vocal critic of incumbent Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s Ukraine policy. He has repeatedly urged the government to provide Kyiv with long-range Taurus missiles and accused Scholz of being too hesitant in supporting Ukraine. Recent polls indicate the CDU/CSU is leading ahead of the elections, which were called after Scholz&apos;s ruling coalition lost its parliamentary majority due to the departure of the Free Democratic Party (FDP).	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-ukraine-remarks-shocking-echo-russian-narratives-german-opposition-leader-says/	2025-02-21T13:02:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1929925182.jpg
How Trump could help Russia achieve the original aim of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s claim that Ukraine&apos;s president is an illegitimate &quot;dictator&quot; aligns with Kremlin war objectives and puts Volodymyr Zelensky in an almost impossible situation, experts and analysts have told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;In the last few days we&#x2019;ve seen how closely Trump has aligned himself with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&#x2019;s view of Ukraine in general and Zelensky in particular,&quot; Ruth Deyermond, senior lecturer in post-Soviet security at King&apos;s College London, said. &quot;The demand for elections at a point when they obviously can&#x2019;t be held fairly is a Kremlin talking point that seems designed to give Zelensky an impossible choice &#x2014; hold elections under impossible conditions, allowing Russia to try to steal them and install a puppet, or refuse and be labeled a dictator,&quot; she added. Russia has been demanding an election in Ukraine in hopes to get rid of Zelensky, destabilize the political situation and potentially install Russian puppets in power, experts say. Trump echoed the Russian demands this week. Trump&apos;s comments stunned Ukraine and its allies, and flipped reality on its head as he labeled Zelensky as a &#x201C;dictator&#x201D; and simultaneously embraced Putin &#x2014; a dictator who has not held a single free and fair election for many years &#x2014; as a legitimate democratic leader. Speaking after U.S. officials held their first official meeting with their Russian counterparts since the start of the full-scale invasion, Trump on Feb. 18 falsely claimed that Zelensky had a 4% approval rating, adding that in order to &quot;have a seat at the table&quot; during negotiations, Ukraine should hold elections despite Russia&apos;s war. The day after, Trump went even further, saying Zelensky &quot;refuses to have elections, is very low in Ukrainian polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing (former U.S. President Joe) Biden like a fiddle.&quot; &quot;A dictator without elections, Zelensky better move fast or he is not going to have a country left,&quot; he added. Most of the elections held by Ukraine since 1991 have been recognized by domestic and international observers as free and competitive. In contrast with Ukraine, elections have been routinely rigged in Russia, genuine opposition candidates have not been allowed to run, and the Kremlin&apos;s monopoly on television ensured that only government-backed candidates have air time. In 2020, Russia held a rigged vote on constitutional amendments that eliminated limits on Putin&apos;s presidential terms, effectively making him dictator for life. More than 20 opponents of Putin have been killed or died in mysterious circumstances. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny died in prison in February 2024, with independent analysts accusing Putin of either ordering his murder or creating conditions that led to his death. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrives to meet with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the 61st Munich Security Conference on February 15, 2025 in Munich, Germany ( Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Elections in UkraineUnder the martial law act passed by Ukraine after Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, presidential, parliamentary and local elections are banned. If martial law had not been imposed, Zelensky&apos;s term would have ended on May 20, 2024. Both Russia and some of Zelensky&apos;s critics claim that he ceased to be a legitimate president on May 20. Major Ukrainian constitutional lawyers and legal experts believe the claim is false and unfounded. The Kremlin has long been pushing the narrative that, since Zelensky is allegedly illegitimate, he cannot sign any documents in peace talks. According to the Kremlin, Ukraine must hold elections, and a newly elected president should sign a peace deal. Stefan Wolff, professor of international security at the University of Birmingham, told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;elections in Ukraine before a final peace deal will be better for Russia than for Ukraine.&quot; &quot;It will offer Russia an opportunity to unleash its usual election meddling and to sow further division and instability,&quot; he said. &quot;Replacing Zelensky has been a war aim for Russia since the (first) day of the full-scale invasion in 2022, so this is also part of Putin&#x2019;s victory narrative.&quot; Bettina Renz, a professor of international security at Nottingham University, said that Trump &quot;is reiterating various longstanding Kremlin narratives about Ukraine and this is playing into the Kremlin&#x2019;s hands.&quot; &quot;Ukraine is a sovereign state and the idea that the timing of elections should be dictated by external powers as a precondition for a ceasefire or peace deal is baffling,&quot; she added. While the U.S. may not share the Kremlin&apos;s aim of installing a pro-Kremlin president in Ukraine, Trump&apos;s actions could inadvertently aid it. Deyermond argued that Trump&apos;s &quot;tantrum&quot; could be a reaction to Zelensky&apos;s reluctance to immediately sign a deal that would give the U.S. a stake in 50% of Ukraine&apos;s natural resources through a joint investment fund as payback for its support for Kyiv. Zelensky pushed back against a first version &#xA0;of the deal, suggesting he couldn&apos;t sign it as it didn&apos;t include security guarantees for Ukraine. &quot;Trump seems angry that he can&#x2019;t bully Zelensky and he&#x2019;s trying to put the blame on him for the failure to get a quick &#x2018;deal&#x2019; on peace, which he promised American voters during the election,&quot; Deyremond said. Wolff and Ryhor Nizhnikau, a Russia expert at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, also attributed Trump&apos;s comments to his personal dislike of Zelensky. This predates Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and stems from Zelensky&apos;s refusal to investigate a Ukrainian firm linked to Hunter Biden, the son of Trump&apos;s political opponent and ex-President Joe Biden, in 2019, they said. Trump&apos;s pressure on Zelensky resulted in his first impeachment. Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during while visiting the Radar MMC military plant, February 19, 2025, in Saint Petersburg, Russia (Contributor/Getty Images)What could happen if it works?If Ukraine found itself forced by U.S. pressure to hold elections, experts said Russia would almost certainly seek to destabilize the political situation within the country and install a pro-Kremlin leader. Olha Aivazovska, head of Ukrainian watchdog Opora, told the Kyiv Independent that any Russian attacks on or around an election day &quot;would lead to low voter turnout,&#x201D; which in turn would lead to &quot;weak&quot; legitimacy for the newly-elected Ukrainian government. &quot;If the ceasefire is violated at the start of the electoral process, Ukraine will lose the opportunity to properly organize these elections,&#x201D; she added. Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said that as part of peace negotiations, Russia could demand that Ukraine legalize pro-Russian parties in the election, which would trigger a conflict with nationalist groups, destabilize the political situation and create another excuse for the Kremlin not to recognize the election. &quot;Russia&#x2019;s goal is to weaken the state and implement a Georgian-style scenario in Ukraine,&quot; Aivazovska said, referring to the country&#x2019;s Georgian Dream party, which initially positioned itself as pro-Western but has drifted into Russia&#x2019;s orbit. &quot;(In Ukraine) Russia can achieve the same through elections &#x2014; elections that Russia will control and influence, enabling it to incorporate its political groups (into Ukrainian politics),&quot; she said. &quot;This is something Russia will certainly do if the elections are not conducted in a protected manner.&quot; Russia could, in short, achieve the original aims of its full-scale invasion by political rather than military means, aided in part by the U.S. Nizhnikau stressed that &quot;the original goal of the military invasion was to orchestrate regime change in Kyiv and install a puppet government.&quot; Experts say that, contrary to the Kremlin narrative about immediate elections, Ukraine should only hold elections when there is stable peace and when the country is fully prepared. Aivazovska believes that Ukraine should prepare its election infrastructure within a 12-month period after a ceasefire deal is signed. But elections can only be held when a final peace deal is signed and implemented, she added. &quot;Demobilization and the lifting of martial law must occur at the stage of the peace agreement and its implementation,&quot; she said. &quot;Only then will martial law be lifted, and a fully-fledged, democratic, and transparent electoral process will begin.&quot; Politicians and experts the Kyiv Independent has spoken to emphasized that elections could only be held when peace is secure, and Ukraine is fully prepared. Nizhinikau said that &quot;if the elections occur before the peace deal, it will be self-defeating at the very least.&quot; &quot;It will create an illegitimate government in Ukraine because holding free and fair elections under current conditions is impossible,&quot; he said. &quot;The electoral campaign will undermine a fragile consensus and unity inside Ukraine: it rests on the war efforts against the common enemy and elections may ruin it.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/how-trump-could-help-russia-achieve-the-original-aim-of-its-full-scale-invasion/	2025-02-21T12:37:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200472517-2.jpg
Ukraine periodically loses up to 40% of gas production due to Russian attacks, Reuters reports	Ukraine will import up to 800 million cubic meters (mcm) of gas from Europe in February and March to make up for lost domestic production caused by Russian missile attacks, Reuters reported on Feb. 21, citing a senior industry source. Russian strikes have repeatedly hit Ukraine&#x2019;s gas infrastructure over the course of the war, reducing production by as much as 40% at certain periods following an attack. Ukraine&apos;s main gas production facilities are primarily located in frontline regions such as Kharkiv and neighbouring Poltava, making them vulnerable to Russian attacks. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukrainian infrastructure with missiles and drones over the course of the war, including gas storage facilities in western Ukraine as well. Before the onslaught of Russian attacks, Ukraine produced about 52 mcm of gas daily but needed 110&#x2013;140 mcm per day in winter, covering the shortfall from storage. Energy experts had previously warned that storage reserves were close to a critically low 10% of the storage capacity of around 30 billion cubic meters. Earlier this month, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Ministry Herman Halushchenko said Russian strikes had severely impacted Ukraine&apos;s domestic gas production capacity, and that the country would need to import an estimated 1 billion cubic meters of gas by the end of the year. He declined to provide figures on the severity of the impact. According to the Reuters, Ukraine needs to start pumping gas for next year&apos;s winter season in the spring, and that the country needs to accumulate about 13 billion cubic meters of gas. Naftogaz and private energy company DTEK confirmed to Reuters that Russian forces have attacked and damaged their facilities at least twice in February. At the beginning of this year, Ukraine halted its agreement with Russia to transport Russian gas to European customers using Ukraine&apos;s pipelines.

Canada opposes Russia's return to G7, vows to 'stand its ground,' ambassador says	Canada, which currently chairs the Group of Seven (G7), opposes Russia&apos;s return to the format, Canadian Ambassador to Ukraine Natalka Cmoc said on Feb. 21. &quot;Canada is not ready for a change in the membership of the G7 and is standing its ground,&quot; she said at the Kyiv Security Forum&apos;s event marking three years since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Her remarks follow U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s statement on Feb. 13 that he would &quot;love&quot; to see Russia readmitted to the G7, calling its 2014 expulsion a &quot;mistake.&quot; Cmoc stressed that the G7 should strengthen support for Ukraine and increase diplomatic, financial, and economic pressure on Russia. She emphasized the need to lower the oil price ceiling, expand sanctions to new sectors, and close loopholes that allow their circumvention. Russia was expelled from the then-Group of Eight (G8) in 2014 following its illegal annexation of Crimea. Since the start of the full-scale war, G7 countries have provided Ukraine with substantial military and financial aid. The Financial Times reported that U.S. officials are opposing the use of the phrase &quot;Russian aggression&quot; in a planned G7 statement commemorating the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Traditionally, G7 leaders issue a joint declaration on Feb. 24 reaffirming support for Ukraine, but U.S. envoys have reportedly objected to language that explicitly blames Russia. Trump&apos;s statements have raised concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about Washington&apos;s shifting position on the war, particularly after the U.S. held direct talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 without Ukraine&apos;s participation. Trump has also made multiple false claims about Ukraine in recent days, including calling Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and accusing him of refusing to hold elections. His remarks ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in place since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. EU Ambassador to Ukraine Katarina Mathernova reaffirmed that Europe does not insist Ukraine hold elections under martial law, emphasizing that Ukraine&apos;s constitution regulates the matter. &quot;All the reasons that led to the introduction of martial law remain in force,&quot; she said. Kremlin propaganda has pushed the narrative that Zelensky is an illegitimate leader, falsely claiming that his first presidential term was set to end on May 20, 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/canada-opposes-russias-return-to-g7-vows-to-stand-its-ground-ambassador-says/	2025-02-21T12:08:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2158427632.jpg
The Kyiv Independent presents its first magazine — ‘The Power Within’	The Kyiv Independent has presented its first-ever magazine, &#x201C;The Power Within,&#x201D; as a record of Ukrainian resilience and life three years into Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. This special edition marks a departure from the solely digital presence that the Kyiv Independent has maintained since its foundation in November 2021. It was born from a desire to create something tangible and permanent amid the uncertainty of war. Original stories crafted specifically for this magazine capture the multifaceted reality of wartime Ukraine. &quot;We founded the Kyiv Independent just before the invasion, and for three years, we&apos;ve been a war publication, delivering breaking news and in-depth reporting online,&quot; says Olga Rudenko, editor-in-chief at the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This print edition is our way of taking a step back, of creating a permanent record of this moment in Ukrainian history &#x2013; a testament to the resilience and complexity of life here.&quot; This print edition takes readers on a journey across Ukraine, from the front lines of the Donbas to the vibrant cultural spaces of Kyiv. It profiles the bravery of those resisting occupation, the sorrow of those displaced because of Russia&#x2019;s invasion, and the enduring spirit of a nation refusing to be defined solely by war. &quot;Not only was this our first experience creating a print product, but it was also a bold challenge to craft something permanent at a time when nothing is,&quot; says Toma Istomina, deputy chief editor. &quot;As with all our work, we cared deeply about this magazine and had passionate discussions during the creative process &#x2014; like when we went through nearly 30 cover options before choosing the final one,&quot; she goes on. &quot;But we are proud of the magazine we present to you today and hope you will like it too, placing it in a special spot at home or in your office as a sign of support for Ukraine.&quot; In the cover photo, taken near occupied Bakhmut, a drone operator from the 93rd Separate Mechanized Brigade readies a heavy bomber drone &#x2014; once built for farming, now repurposed for war. About 200 kilometers north, in Kharkiv, people dance at a rave, moving to the beat of a city that refuses to fall silent despite constant Russian attacks. (The Kyiv Independent)The magazine features work by 12 Ukrainian photographers and illustrators, as well as foreign contributors. &#x201C;It was essential for us to tell our own story &#x2014; showing Ukraine through Ukrainian eyes, imagination, and creativity. Featuring Ukrainian photojournalists and illustrators, and printed in Ukraine, this magazine stands as a testament to the fact that even in wartime, we continue to create,&#x201D; says Irynka Hromotska, photo editor. The launch of the magazine comes at a critical juncture in the war, a time of heightened uncertainty. The Kyiv Independent views this project as a powerful statement of Ukrainian perseverance. &#x201C;The Power Within&#x201D; is now available to pre-order at The Kyiv Independent store, and shipping will begin in April.

Ukraine war latest: Russia wants to declare 'victory' over Ukraine on Feb. 24, Ukrainian intel claims	Key developments on Feb. 21: Russia is instructing its propagandists to declare &quot;victory&quot; in the war &quot;against Ukraine and NATO&quot; on Feb. 24, the third anniversary of its full-scale invasion, Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) claimed on Feb. 21. After Russia failed to take over Ukraine within days in 2022 and suffered several defeats in 2022, the Kremlin began to push the false claim that Russia was at war with NATO. Western partners have been providing Ukraine with weapons since the beginning of the all-out war but have never sent troops to Ukraine, fearing escalation. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported in its daily update on Feb. 21 that Moscow had lost 864,860 troops in Ukraine since February 2022, including 1,280 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to Ukraine&apos;s intelligence agency, Russia now aims to sow despair among Ukrainians, destabilize the situation in the country, and discredit Ukraine among its allies. Russian intelligence services plan to spread the narrative that &quot;Ukraine has been betrayed&quot; by the West and the U.S., HUR claimed. Russian propaganda will also keep on questioning the legitimacy of President Volodymyr Zelensky and &quot;the corrupt Ukrainian officials who steal U.S. aid.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s allies had generally ignored a propaganda narrative about Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy until U.S. President Donald Trump accused Ukraine of starting the war and appeared to echo the Kremlin&apos;s lines, dubbing Ukraine&apos;s president as a dictator. This claim ignores the fact that it is impossible to hold elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. As a result, Zelensky&apos;s term has been extended, which constitutional lawyers argue is permitted under Ukrainian law. HUR says that the Kremlin may use the recent U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia to impose its terms of peace on the world, trying to portray governments in Europe that back Kyiv as &quot;enemies of peace.&quot; No concrete decisions were announced following the meeting between American and Russian delegations, but Ukraine&apos;s exclusion sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe. Echoing HUR&apos;s warnings, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) pointed to mounting cases of Russia&apos;s informational and psychological operations aimed against Ukraine. Using bot farms and fake social media accounts, Russian intelligence services aim to divide Ukrainian society and call for public order disruptions, the SBU said. U.S. President Donald Trump claimed on Feb. 21 that President Volodymyr Zelensky is not essential to negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. &quot;I don&apos;t think he&apos;s very important to be at meetings, to be honest with you,&quot; Trump told Fox News Radio on Feb. 21. &quot;When Zelensky said, &apos;Oh, he wasn&apos;t invited to a meeting,&apos; I mean, it wasn&apos;t a priority because he did such a bad job in negotiating so far.&quot; Trump&apos;s remarks come amid growing concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about Washington&apos;s shifting stance on the war, particularly after the U.S. held direct talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. Zelensky on Feb. 16 rejected the idea of peace negotiations being conducted behind Ukraine&apos;s back. Trump has also made multiple false claims about Ukraine in recent days, including calling Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and accusing him of refusing to hold elections. His remarks ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said on Feb. 15 that Europe will not be directly involved in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, but its interests will be considered. Trump said on Feb. 20 that Russia &quot;holds the cards&quot; in any peace talks due to its control over a significant portion of Ukrainian territory. He further announced plans to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia, though the extent of Ukraine&apos;s involvement in those talks remains unclear. Moscow has positioned the U.S. as its &quot;main counterpart&quot; in negotiations, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 13. On Feb. 18, Trump appeared to place responsibility for the ongoing war on President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s wartime leadership. U.S. Vice President JD Vance also criticized Zelensky on Feb. 19, calling his public remarks about Trump &quot;counterproductive&quot; after the Ukrainian president dismissed Trump&apos;s claim that his support in Ukraine had fallen to 4%, labeling it Russian disinformation. A Feb. 19 poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) showed that 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky, marking a five-point increase since December. There is no appetite for another assistance bill for Ukraine, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said in an interview with Newsmax on Feb. 20 amid growing tensions between Washington and Kyiv. U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed to mediate a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia while using increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Kyiv. After accusing Ukraine of starting the war, Trump dubbed President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator without elections.&quot; &quot;We have to bring (the war) to an end. And I can tell you that our European allies understand the necessity as well. It&apos;s (dragged) on too long,&quot; Johnson said. Johnson, a Republican and staunch Trump supporter, has served as the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives since October 2023. He delayed aid to Kyiv for six months by refusing to hold a vote on various iterations of a $61 billion foreign assistance bill but eventually reached a deal to pass the legislation in April 2024. The speaker voiced support for the U.S. president, saying he is &quot;the brute force&quot; that can end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Trump&apos;s plan to end the war remains unclear. His special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, said the war could end this year, pledging to &quot;engage all parties&quot; within 180 days to achieve this. American and Russian delegations met in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. No concrete decisions were announced following the talks, but Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the meeting sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe. Unofficial U.S. and Russian representatives have also reportedly been quietly meeting in Switzerland in recent months for informal discussions regarding Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, lauded on Feb. 21 &quot;positive discussions&quot; he held with President Volodymyr Zelensky a day earlier. &quot;A long and intense day with the senior leadership of Ukraine,&quot; Kellogg said on X after his meetings with Zelensky and top Ukrainian officials in Kyiv this week. &quot;Extensive and positive discussions with (President Volodymyr Zelensky), the embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war, and his talented national security team.&quot; Kellogg&apos;s appraisal of Zelensky stands in stark contrast to recent statements from the White House. Earlier this week, Trump has denounced the Ukrainian president as a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; who is doing a &quot;terrible job.&quot; Trump&apos;s aides have linked his displeasure to Kyiv&apos;s reluctance to sign the U.S.-proposed deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources and to Zelensky&apos;s statement that the U.S. president lives in a &quot;disinformation space&quot; after refuting some of his false claims. Zelensky and Kellogg held a bilateral meeting on Feb. 20. Even though the expected joint press conference was canceled at Washington&apos;s request, the Ukrainian president said the meeting &quot;restored hope.&quot; &quot;And we need strong agreements with America &#x2014; agreements that will really work,&quot; Zelensky added. Axios reported on Feb. 20 that after Ukraine refused to sign the natural resource agreement due to a lack of security guarantees, the Trump administration presented an &quot;improved&quot; draft that was likely to be accepted by the Ukrainian side. Russia may be willing to use a portion of its $300 billion in frozen assets to help rebuild Ukraine as part of a potential peace deal but insist that some of the funds be allocated to occupied territories, Reuters reported on Feb. 21, citing sources familiar with the matter. The discussions reportedly come amid negotiations between U.S. and Russian officials following their Feb. 18 meeting in Saudi Arabia. It is unclear whether the frozen assets were discussed during the talks. According to Reuters, one of the sources said Russia could agree to allocate up to two-thirds of frozen assets for Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction, provided accountability guarantees. The remaining funds, Moscow reportedly insists, would go toward rebuilding Russian-occupied territories in eastern Ukraine, which the Kremlin claims as part of Russia. Another source noted that, while Moscow appears open to using the frozen assets, the distribution of funds and the allocation of reconstruction contracts remain key points of contention. A separate Kremlin-linked source, not directly involved in negotiations, said Russia still demands a gradual easing of sanctions and the full release of its frozen assets. Following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, over $300 billion in Russian central bank reserves were frozen, with most &#x2014; 191 billion euros ($198 billion) &#x2014; held in Belgium&apos;s Euroclear depository. The G7 has previously announced that these funds will remain frozen until Russia pays for the destruction it has caused in Ukraine. The EU has already begun leveraging proceeds from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine. In January, Ukraine received 3 billion euros ($3.09 billion) as part of the EU&apos;s Ukraine Facility, funded through interest earned on the frozen reserves. The U.S. and G7 partners have pledged nearly $50 billion in loans to Ukraine, backed by revenue from Russian assets. Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the illegal annexation of Ukraine&apos;s Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kherson oblasts on Sept. 30, 2022. Moscow&apos;s latest position signals a potential shift in its approach to post-war financial settlements but underscores its continued insistence on legitimizing its occupation of Ukrainian territories. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Procurement Agency is launching a new supply model for delivering drones to the front line within weeks rather than months, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Feb. 20. Kyiv has ramped up domestic drone production over the past year. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks throughout the full-scale with Russia. According to the new model, military units will be able to choose the unmanned systems best suited to their needs. The system also aims to support manufacturers through advance orders, allowing them to plan for scaling up their production. The model aims to boost transparency in procurement as it establishes clear supply mechanisms and stimulates competition. The structure is based on the DOT-Chain, an IT system already used by the State Rear Operator (DOT), an agency dealing with non-lethal procurement for the military. DOT-Chain is designed to streamline and digitize procurement processes while reducing delivery time. &quot;Together with manufacturers, we are working to ensure that no soldier waits for weeks or months for what they need,&quot; Umerov said after a meeting with representatives of 200 drone manufacturers.

Putin orders ministers to prepare for Western companies' return to Russia	Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed his Cabinet of Ministers on Feb. 21 to prepare for the return of Western companies, saying Russian firms should have &quot;certain advantages&quot; over those re-entering the market. &quot;We can adjust accordingly the return to our market of those who want to return,&quot; Putin said during a speech at the Future Technologies Forum plenary session, suggesting potential restrictions or conditions for Western firms looking to resume operations in Russia. &quot;External problems, sanctions, with all the challenges and difficulties for us, have played an important stimulating role,&quot; &#xA0;he added. The comments come amid a rapprochement between Russia and the U.S. A Russian delegation led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met on Feb. 18 with a U.S. delegation led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, marking the highest-level meeting between the two sides since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. and Russia agreed to start the process on Ukrainian settlement, appoint ambassadors to each other, lift &quot;obstacles to diplomatic missions&quot; and create conditions for starting U.S.-Russian cooperation, according to Lavrov. Russia is also offering the Trump administration a deal on Russian natural resources and access to the Arctic, The Moscow Times reported on Feb. 18, citing Kirill Dmitriev, one of the Russian delegates in recent Saudi Arabia talks. Following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, hundreds of Western companies exited the Russian market, unwilling to contribute to the country&apos;s economy or war effort. According to the Kyiv School of Economics Institute, 472 foreign firms have fully withdrawn, while another 1,360 have scaled back their operations. The Kremlin imposed strict exit requirements, including approval from a government commission, a mandatory 50% discount on asset sales, and an &quot;exit tax&quot; of at least 10%. Russian authorities have also seized assets from subsidiaries of Western companies that remained operational. Moscow&apos;s measures have been widely seen as retaliation for Western sanctions, including the freezing of around $300 billion in Russian central bank assets. Despite these efforts, many foreign companies have either found ways to continue business in Russia or have re-entered the market after a temporary pause.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-orders-ministers-to-prepare-for-western-companies-return-to-russia/	2025-02-21T11:17:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1259097881.jpg
Zelensky is not 'important' to negotiations on ending war, Trump says	U.S. President Donald Trump claimed on Feb. 21 President Volodymyr Zelensky is not essential to negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. &quot;I don&apos;t think he&apos;s very important to be at meetings, to be honest with you,&quot; Trump told Fox News Radio on Feb. 21. &quot;When Zelensky said, &apos;Oh, he wasn&apos;t invited to a meeting,&apos; I mean, it wasn&apos;t a priority because he did such a bad job in negotiating so far.&quot; Trump&apos;s remarks come amid growing concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about Washington&apos;s shifting stance on the war, particularly after the U.S. held direct talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18.

Zelensky to sign US minerals deal soon, Waltz says	U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said on Feb. 21 that President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to sign a minerals deal with the U.S. &quot;in the very short term,&quot; the Guardian reported. &quot;President Zelensky is going to sign that deal, and you will see that in the very short term,&quot; Waltz said at the Conservative Political Action Conference. &quot;And that is good for Ukraine. What better could you have for Ukraine than to be in an economic partnership with the United States?&quot; Waltz also predicted that U.S. President Donald Trump would be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to negotiate an end to Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. His comments follow reports that the Trump administration has presented Kyiv with a revised version of a minerals agreement after Zelensky rejected an initial proposal. Axios reported on Feb. 20 that U.S. officials made changes to align the deal with Ukrainian law, while some of Zelensky&apos;s aides have encouraged him to sign it to avoid further tension with Washington. Following his meeting with Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, on Feb. 21, Zelensky signaled Kyiv&apos;s openness to a &quot;strong, beneficial agreement&quot; with the U.S. on investments and security. The initial U.S. proposal reportedly sought a 50% stake in Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas, as well as stakes in ports and other key infrastructure through a joint investment fund. The document was delivered to Zelensky during U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent&apos;s visit to Kyiv last week. Ukraine&apos;s leader previously said Kyiv was not ready to sign the document as it lacked concrete security guarantees. The issue has become a key sticking point in U.S.-Ukraine relations, as Trump has linked future aid to trade deals with Ukraine. Trump has made multiple controversial statements about Ukraine in recent days, including calling Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and falsely claiming that he refuses to hold elections. His remarks ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. U.S. Vice President JD Vance also criticized Zelensky on Feb. 19, calling his remarks about Trump &quot;counterproductive&quot; after the Ukrainian president dismissed Trump&apos;s claim that his support among Ukrainians had fallen to 4%, labeling it Russian disinformation. A Feb. 19 poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) showed that 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky, a five-point increase since December.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-sign-us-minerals-deal-in-very-short-term-waltz-says/	2025-02-21T09:07:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2162467139.jpg
After 3 years of war in Ukraine, sometimes I think: Stop the planet, I want to get off	I bet you woke up this morning, read the world news, and couldn&#x2019;t believe it &#x2014; how is this really happening? Has the world truly plunged into total chaos and madness? You just want to wake up from this nightmare, but instead, it keeps insisting on becoming the new normal &#x2014; your everyday reality. This is exactly how Ukrainians felt three years ago &#x2014; only multiplied by the horrors of war &#x2014; when Russia launched its criminal full-scale invasion and began bombing our peaceful cities. It made us want to scream: Stop the planet, I want to get off! Over these three years of full-scale war, we Ukrainians have gone through several stages in our relationship with reality. At first, there was complete rejection and denial &#x2014; it seemed impossible to believe that a war was not only a crime but utter madness, something that had no place in the 21st century. It felt like all we had to do was take millions of photos of the war, flood social media with stories and reels, translate our messages into every language, and the world would wake up, see the truth &#x2014; and within weeks, this nightmare would be over. Righteous anger and fury soon took over, driving the Ukrainian army to carry out brilliant military operations, expelling the occupiers from our land with unimaginable effort. By the end of 2022, there was a sense of euphoria &#x2014; of mutual support within the country and solidarity from the Western world. It felt like people of goodwill, standing for moral and just principles, could achieve anything together. By 2023, the war had become our daily reality, just a part of life. Anger turned into powerless hatred, and fear lost its sting &#x2014; we had grown used to it. When the Kremlin tried to scare us with nuclear strikes, we simply laughed in response. Because what else can an ordinary person do when faced with the most terrifying bomb? Ukrainians instantly came up with a meme about Shchekavytsia, a historic hill in the center of Kyiv. The joke went that if a nuclear strike were to wipe us all out in a millisecond, we would first gather on Shchekavytsia for a joyful, carefree, ancient Greek-style orgy. The tyrant wouldn&#x2019;t scare us &#x2014; if we were to die, we&#x2019;d do so with dignity, laughing, and with our heads held high. Almost immediately, one of the most popular T-shirts in Ukraine became the one with the slogan: &quot;I&#x2019;ll be the first on Shchekavytsia.&quot; By the third year of war, there was no energy left for anger, hatred, or even laughter. It turned out that fear, like hatred, is an incredibly draining emotion &#x2014; one simply cannot live with it for too long. A sense of emptiness set in, exhaustion, an acceptance of reality as fate&#x2014;something inescapable. Whatever strength remained was directed toward the daily struggle for existence &#x2014; often without light or heat in our homes, and most importantly, without hope that this would ever end. What can be said today, as the fourth year of this bloody invasion and assault on the world order begins? We have regressed from dreaming of victory over the aggressor to the humiliating hope for an unjust peace. In practice, this means that the idea of reclaiming the 1991 borders is no longer popular in Ukrainian society. No one seriously talks about territories anymore &#x2014; the only thing that matters is ending the war, stopping our people from dying on the front lines and in the rear. Even the word &quot;victory&quot; has become almost taboo. In the past, every birthday toast ended with wishes for a swift victory; every good deed was described on Facebook as &quot;our contribution to the common victory.&quot; Now, speaking like this feels embarrassing. Such lofty words might still belong in the trenches, spoken by soldiers-turned-heroes &#x2014; but there are fewer and fewer of them every day. On the home front, that kind of rhetoric sounds cheap and hollow. Now, we hear talks of a potential peace agreement, but it&#x2019;s already clear that no matter how it plays out, for Ukraine, it will be humiliating &#x2014; some outcomes worse than others, but none truly just. A peace deal may at least temporarily stop the bloodshed, but it won&#x2019;t restore the most important thing. And I&#x2019;m not talking about lost territory &#x2014; I&#x2019;m talking about justice. What kind of world will we wake up to after this so-called peace? Not just a world where a stronger country has bitten off 20% of a weaker one. We are about to start living in a world where a war criminal orders the execution of unarmed prisoners of war kneeling before their killers and then proudly spreads footage of the massacre through his own propaganda channels. A world where people are beheaded or bludgeoned to death with sledgehammers, where children&#x2019;s oncology hospitals are bombed, where power stations are destroyed in the dead of winter to freeze millions of civilians to death, where a drone packed with explosives is deliberately aimed at the sarcophagus of a nuclear power plant during the most critical security conference. And no one is held accountable for any of it. Ukrainian soldiers rest alongside a T-72 tank in Sumy Oblast, Ukraine, on Aug. 12, 2024.

(Photo by Roman Pilipey / AFP via Getty Images)Yes, the disgust you feel reading these lines is absolutely justified &#x2014; and to Ukrainians, it has long been familiar. From now on, this feeling will slowly become a part of your daily life, too. Because even a so-called peace agreement &#x2014; however humiliating &#x2014; will not deliver what matters most: the punishment of war criminals and the condemnation of their atrocities. Instead of facing prison or isolation, the aggressor will take a seat at prestigious international gatherings, dictating his own terms. A murderer whose crimes have been captured on camera millions of times in the most documented war in human history will not stand trial but will instead laugh in our faces. And it makes you want to scream: This cannot be! This is exactly what we felt three years ago, in February 2022. We wanted to shake the world awake, to scream until someone listened. The West sympathized with us, helped us, but refused to acknowledge the truth: this war was against them, too. Today, that terrifying realization is finally dawning on Europeans, as it becomes clear to all that if war comes, America will not fight for Europe, and NATO no longer works. Tragically, it wasn&#x2019;t Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s crimes or Ukraine&#x2019;s warnings that woke Europe up &#x2014; it was Donald Trump. This geopolitical shift &#x2014; what is, in reality, America&#x2019;s betrayal &#x2014; has forced Europe to face a conclusion that was already obvious three years ago. The reason for the global chaos we now see &#x2014; where Trump openly speaks about occupying Greenland and makes it clear that Europe is no longer under America&#x2019;s security umbrella &#x2014; is painfully simple. It is the unpunished evil of Putin&#x2019;s aggression against Ukraine. That is what ultimately shattered the world order and erased all rules. It was this cynical and successful assault on global stability that led to the absurd reality where the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant for Putin, is now facing sanctions from what was once the leading democratic nation in the world. This is now a world of mockery, humiliation, and the brazen trampling of not just political norms but the moral and ethical values that define Europe itself. The evil genie has been let out of the bottle, and with each passing day, it grows stronger, bolder, more aggressive. Does anyone still doubt that if it is not stopped, not punished, it will attack again after some so-called peace agreement? And next time, it likely won&#x2019;t be just Ukraine. So forgive me, but after four years of war, my message to you from Ukraine may not be to your liking. We, Ukrainians, are glad that you are finally beginning to realize the truth: this war is against all of us &#x2014; including you. And the criminal does not even bother to hide his bloodstained teeth. Yes, it is good &#x2014; though tragically late &#x2014; that after 1,100 days of war, from Kyiv to Brussels, there is finally a shared understanding: we are all aboard the same Titanic. A ship that will never reach America &#x2014; because America is far away, and our disaster is here. We, Ukrainians, clenched our teeth long ago and did what needed to be done to survive this Titanic. Now, it will be interesting to see what choice you make: will you search for a lifeboat together with us &#x2014; or will you continue to sink helplessly beneath the waves to the sentimental strains of &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;?

Why Ukraine can’t hold elections during wartime	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This op-ed was first published by the Ukrainian NGO Civil Network OPORA as an open statement, which garnered nearly 300 signatures at the time it was published by the Kyiv Independent. Democracy during wartime must be protected even more than in peacetime, as the consequences of mistakes or a loss of trust are far too high. Our partners and allies must ensure that elections in Ukraine result in a genuine expression of the nation&apos;s will. International standards for peaceful and post-conflict elections are the same, and there is no measure of democracy other than the true access of citizens to govern their state through their representatives, legally elected in free, fair elections by secret ballot &#x2014; without intimidation or threats. Russia&#x2019;s unprovoked aggression against a sovereign state makes holding presidential and parliamentary elections in Ukraine impossible. Russia is not a democracy: there is no real opposition, independent media, or political pluralism. In contrast, there is strong consensus in Ukraine on the need for elections no earlier than six months after martial law ends, supported by the government, opposition, and society. The legitimacy of Ukraine&#x2019;s government is an exclusive prerogative of the Ukrainian people. Any peace process must account for Ukraine&apos;s voice and include a logical sequence of democratic steps for elections. First, a sustainable ceasefire with security guarantees from allied countries. Second, the proper preparation for elections and restoration of relevant infrastructure. And third, holding elections after sustainable peace is achieved, martial law is lifted, and the war is settled internationally. Holding elections within the next six months is not aligned with security realities, the political and economic situation, or public sentiment in Ukraine. As of February 2024, 69% of Ukrainians believed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky should remain in office until the end of martial law without holding elections. This reflects unity in society and respect for the military, which is currently defending Ukraine and cannot fully participate in the political process. From the perspective of Ukraine&apos;s Constitution and legislation, holding elections during martial law is prohibited, and the authorities continue to exercise their powers legitimately.

(Jose Colon / Anadolu via Getty Images)A significant challenge to holding elections in Ukraine without sustainable peace is the lack of legal mechanisms for organizing them and ensuring voter participation. These mechanisms must account for the consequences of Russian aggression. In addition to creating the necessary legal framework for post-war elections, Ukraine must ensure millions of citizens, including those who have fled abroad, internally displaced people, and military personnel, can vote. To properly hold elections, democratic conditions must be established, including the free activity of the media, political parties, and civil society organizations, as well as parliamentary consensus on election rules. This requires additional time to transition from martial law to the election period. Elections are not only about expressing political will &#x2014; they involve preparation and organization. Equally important are tasks critical in a post-war environment: election commissions, secure voting facilities, cyber-attack-proof information systems, and ensuring transparency and security. The unstable security situation, threats of shelling, terrorist acts, sabotage, landmines, and unexploded ordnance present substantial obstacles at every stage of the electoral process. From ballot delivery to proper election observation, free campaigning, and potential voter turnout due to security threats, the principles of equal and universal suffrage could be jeopardized. Holding elections where candidates and voters face missile and drone threats violates human rights principles. The greatest challenge to electoral democracy in Ukraine is interference from Russia, which will use any means possible: from cyberattacks to direct voter bribery, spreading disinformation to dividing society, and discrediting candidates deemed unacceptable by Russian authorities. Ukraine &#x2014; both its government and society &#x2014; must prepare for such interference to protect its sovereignty, democracy, and freedom, which are being defended on the battlefield. This preparation requires sufficient time, an independent risk audit, and a strengthened mechanism to counter illegal election interference. Elections in Ukraine must take place, but only after the war ends, sustainable peace is achieved, and conditions are set to ensure free, fair, democratic, and accessible elections. Ukraine has never refused to hold elections, but organizing them requires time, resources, and careful planning &#x2014; not demands. We sincerely urge the leaders of the free world to prioritize guaranteeing security for Ukraine and preparing for the first post-war elections. This will ensure they are held as soon as possible and in line with international standards.

Russia may offer frozen assets for Ukraine's reconstruction, demand funds for occupied territories, Reuters reports	Russia may be willing to use a portion of its $300 billion in frozen assets to help rebuild Ukraine as part of a potential peace deal but insist that some of the funds be allocated to occupied territories, Reuters reported on Feb. 21, citing sources familiar with the matter. The discussions reportedly come amid negotiations between U.S. and Russian officials following their Feb. 18 meeting in Saudi Arabia. It is unclear whether the frozen assets were discussed during the talks. According to Reuters, one of the sources said Russia could agree to allocate up to two-thirds of frozen assets for Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction, provided accountability guarantees. The remaining funds, Moscow reportedly insists, would go toward rebuilding Russian-occupied territories in eastern Ukraine, which the Kremlin claims as part of Russia. Another source noted that, while Moscow appears open to using the frozen assets, the distribution of funds and the allocation of reconstruction contracts remain key points of contention. A separate Kremlin-linked source, not directly involved in negotiations, said Russia still demands a gradual easing of sanctions and the full release of its frozen assets. Following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, over $300 billion in Russian central bank reserves were frozen, with most &#x2014; 191 billion euros ($198 billion) &#x2014; held in Belgium&apos;s Euroclear depository. The G7 has previously announced that these funds will remain frozen until Russia pays for the destruction it has caused in Ukraine. The EU has already begun leveraging proceeds from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine. In January, Ukraine received 3 billion euros ($3.09 billion) as part of the EU&apos;s Ukraine Facility, funded through interest earned on the frozen reserves. The U.S. and G7 partners have pledged nearly $50 billion in loans to Ukraine, backed by revenue from Russian assets. Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the illegal annexation of Ukraine&apos;s Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kherson oblasts on Sept. 30, 2022. Moscow&apos;s latest position signals a potential shift in its approach to post-war financial settlements but underscores its continued insistence on legitimizing its occupation of Ukrainian territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-may-offer-frozen-assets-for-ukraines-reconstruction-demands-funds-for-occupied-territories-reuters-reports/	2025-02-21T08:08:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1496360455-2.jpg
With coal miners fighting to keep Ukraine's lights on	A decade ago, Ukraine&#x2019;s Donbas region was known for its thriving heavy industry and coal mining. Today, most of the region&apos;s mines are closed due to the destruction caused by Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, which has brought global attention to this area. The Kyiv Independent team visited one of the last remaining operating mines in the region to highlight the resilience of the workers who continue their work despite danger and tough conditions.	https://kyivindependent.com/with-coal-miners-fighting-to-keep-ukraines-lights-on/	2025-02-21T08:07:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/telegram-cloud-document-2-5316643267285116352.jpg
Lawmaker from Zelensky's party resigns after corruption charges, MP says	Iryna Kormyshkina, a member of parliament from President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Servant of the People party, has submitted a resignation letter amid a corruption investigation against her, Oleksii Honcharenko, an MP from the European Solidarity party, said on Feb. 21. Kormyshkina was charged by Ukraine&apos;s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) on Oct. 17 with illicit enrichment worth more than Hr 20 million ($480,000). In early January 2025, the NABU filed an additional charge against her for allegedly falsifying data in her electronic asset declaration. According to Honcharenko, parliament&apos;s rules committee will now review her resignation request before parliament holds a vote on the matter. Ukraine&apos;s asset declaration system was initially introduced as part of anti-corruption reforms following the 2013-2014 EuroMaidan Revolution. The requirement was suspended after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion but reinstated in October 2023, when Zelensky signed a law restoring mandatory declarations and making them publicly accessible. Ukraine&apos;s National Agency for Corruption Prevention (NACP) re-opened public access to the asset declaration system in December 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelenskys-party-lawmaker-kormyshkina-resigns-after-corruption-charges-mp-says/	2025-02-21T06:57:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167201231.jpg
Most Danes back sending peacekeepers to Ukraine, poll shows	Around 53% of Danes are in favor of sending peacekeepers to Ukraine after Russia&apos;s full-scale war ends, according to a poll published by Ritzau news agency on Feb. 21, Bloomberg reported. The news comes amid growing Western deliberations over stationing peacekeeping forces in Ukraine if negotiations with Russia lead to a ceasefire. The U.S. has ruled out sending its own troops while encouraging European allies to take the lead in securing Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability. The Danish poll showed that around 15% of Danes are against sending peacekeepers, while 32% are undecided or have no opinion. The survey, conducted by Voxmeter research agency, included 1,021 interviews between Feb. 18 and 20. U.K. Prime Minister Starmer is heading to Washington next week to present U.S. President Donald Trump with a plan to station 30,000 European peacekeepers in Ukraine after a ceasefire, provided they are backed by U.S. firepower, the Telegraph reported. While the U.K. and France have backed the deployment of peacekeepers, other countries remain cautious about sending their troops to Ukraine, citing concerns over the escalation and limited military resources. Denmark has provided Ukraine with about $7.5 billion worth of military aid since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. It was also the first country to offer military aid to Ukraine through direct purchases from Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industry.	https://kyivindependent.com/most-danes-back-sending-peacekeepers-to-ukraine-poll-shows/	2025-02-21T06:29:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199052386--1-.jpg
Trump's envoy Kellogg praises Zelensky as 'courageous leader' after talks	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, lauded on Feb. 21 &quot;positive discussions&quot; he held with President Volodymyr Zelensky a day earlier. &quot;A long and intense day with the senior leadership of Ukraine,&quot; Kellogg said on X after his meetings with Zelensky and top Ukrainian officials in Kyiv earlier this week. &quot;Extensive and positive discussions with (President Volodymyr Zelensky), the embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war, and his talented national security team.&quot; Kellogg&apos;s appraisal of Zelensky stands in stark contrast to recent statements from the White House. Earlier this week, Trump has denounced the Ukrainian president as a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; who is doing a &quot;terrible job.&quot; Trump&apos;s aides have linked his displeasure to Kyiv&apos;s reluctance to sign the U.S.-proposed deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources and to Zelensky&apos;s statement that the U.S. president lives in a &quot;disinformation space&quot; after refuting some of his false claims. Zelensky and Kellogg held a bilateral meeting on Feb. 20. Even though the expected joint press conference was canceled at Washington&apos;s request, the Ukrainian president said the meeting &quot;restored hope.&quot; &quot;And we need strong agreements with America &#x2014; agreements that will really work,&quot; Zelensky added. Axios reported on Feb. 20 that after Ukraine refused to sign the natural resource agreement due to a lack of security guarantees, the Trump administration presented an &quot;improved&quot; draft more that was likely to be accepted by the Ukrainian side.	https://kyivindependent.com/kellogg-praises-zelensky-as-courageous-leader-after-talks/	2025-02-21T06:05:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200011457.jpg
5.2 million Ukrainian refugees remain abroad, less than half plan to return, poll says	The share of Ukrainian refugees planning to return home has fallen to 43% by the end of 2024, compared to 74% in December 2022, according to a study by Ukrainian think tank the Center for Economic Strategy (CES) published on Feb. 21. Around 5.2 million Ukrainian refugees remain abroad, according to the report. The mass exodus peaked in March 2022, when 2.5 million people fled Ukraine in a matter of weeks following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The outflow has since slowed, with about 300,000 people leaving Ukraine last year. Most refugees come from Ukraine&apos;s northern and eastern regions, with Kyiv accounting for 18% of those surveyed, followed by Kharkiv (13.8%) and Donetsk (9.5%) oblasts, the study found. The CES projects that between 1.7 and 2.7 million Ukrainians may permanently remain abroad, potentially reducing Ukraine&apos;s annual GDP by 5.1% to 7.8%. &quot;A decrease in those willing to come back home may indicate that some refugees who initially planned to return in early 2024 have already done so,&quot; said Dariia Mykhailyshyna, co-author of the study and senior economist at CES. &quot;Yet, Ukrainians abroad are increasingly adapting, shifting their opinions towards staying abroad.&quot; The main obstacles to return are of both military and economic nature, including ongoing security risks, destroyed housing, low living standards, and challenges in finding employment in Ukraine, according to CES. Women and children remain the predominant demographic among refugees. Adult women make up the largest group at 44%, down from 50% in early 2024. The latest study pointed to a growing proportion of men among Ukrainians living abroad. &quot;The profile of Ukrainian refugees has changed significantly since late 2022. While women and children comprised the vast majority at the start of the war, the proportion of adult men has risen substantially,&quot; said Mykhailyshyna. The study found that women are 31% more likely to want to return than men, and those working remotely for Ukrainian companies are 67% more likely to return than unemployed refugees. Those with higher pre-war incomes are nearly three times more likely to return than those with the lowest incomes. The study found that refugees in Poland are 90% more likely to want to return than those in Germany. Most Ukrainian refugees have settled in Germany (20%) and Poland (18%), while the United States hosts only 5.4% of all refugees. Together with Canada, North American countries have taken in less than 10% of Ukrainian refugees, with most finding refuge in European countries, CES wrote. By the end of November 2024, approximately 4.2 million Ukrainians held temporary protection status in EU countries, with the largest numbers in Germany (1.2 million), Poland (988,000), and the Czech Republic (385,000).	https://kyivindependent.com/5-2-million-ukrainian-refugees-remain-abroad-less-than-half-plan-to-return-poll-says/	2025-02-21T05:46:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2028788729.jpg
EU seeks more US gas to replace Russian supplies	The European Union will seek to increase gas purchases from the U.S. and other countries to replace Russian supplies, EU Energy Commissioner Dan Jorgensen said in a joint media interview, Reuters reported on Feb. 21. Europe began to wean itself off Russian energy commodities after Moscow&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, while Gazprom steadily reduced flows to the EU to pressure Ukraine&#x2019;s allies. Russian gas imports to the EU had dropped by 75% as of January, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. According to Jorgensen, the EU is also looking to develop renewable energy faster to reduce its overall dependence on fossil fuels. &quot;Instead of using taxpayers&apos; money, citizens&apos; money, to pay for gas where the revenue goes into (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&apos;s war chest, we need to make sure that we produce our own energy,&quot; Jorgensen said. Jorgensen added that Brussels is preparing changes to its permitting rules to speed up the construction of renewable energy facilities. He added that the EU is stepping up efforts to find alternative sources of supply for industry and home heating, where gas cannot be quickly replaced by electricity. &quot;There will still be a need for gas, and we will have to look for sources other than Russia, and that could also mean more imports from the U.S.,&quot; Jorgensen said. The U.S. has been boosting its exports of liquified natural gas (LNG) to Europe to reduce the continent&apos;s dependency on Russia. Kyiv&apos;s decision not to prolong a gas transit deal with Gazprom past December 2024 ended the supply of Russian pipeline gas to the EU. European countries continue buying Russian LNG, purchasing record amounts in 2024. The European Union rejected any connection between the possibility of resuming Russian pipeline gas purchases and peace talks on ending the Russia-Ukraine war. The EU imposed its first major restrictions on Russian gas, including LNG, in its 14th sanctions package in June 2024. Russia still remains Europe&apos;s second-largest importer of LNG after the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-seeks-more-us-gas-to-replace-russian-supplies-energy-comissioner-says/	2025-02-21T05:11:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2159134522.jpg
Over 130 Ukrainian NGOs say elections 'impossible' during war	Over 130 Ukrainian civil society organizations said that Russia&apos;s war of aggression makes it impossible for Ukraine to hold presidential and parliamentary elections while martial law is in effect in a joint statement published on Feb. 20. &quot;The legitimacy of the Ukrainian government is the exclusive prerogative of the Ukrainian people,&quot; the statement of the Ukrainian NGOs read. The news comes after U.S. President Donald Trump denounced Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky as a &quot;dictator&quot; while lambasting the country for not holding elections under daily Russian strikes and with one-fifth of its territory occupied. Trump&apos;s statement echoes Russian narratives attacking Zelensky&apos;s presidential legitimacy. Ukraine was set to hold the presidential election in the spring of 2024, but the vote was postponed as martial law, imposed after the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, does not allow elections, according to Ukraine&apos;s constitution. According to the NGO statement spearheaded by the Civil Network Opora, elections must be preceded by a stable ceasefire backed by security guarantees and proper preparations for the election process, including restoring relevant infrastructure. The declaration names the lack of legal mechanisms for ensuring voter participation during wartime as the key obstacle. Zelensky&apos;s administration pledged to hold elections &quot;immediately&quot; after the end of the war, thus allowing soldiers and refugees to safely take part in the vote as well. &quot;The Ukrainian consensus on elections no earlier than six months after the end of martial law is supported by the authorities, the opposition, and the society,&quot; the statement by the Ukrainian NGOs read. According to a February survey, 69% of Ukrainians believe that Zelensky should remain in office until the next elections can be held after the end of martial law. Several opposition politicians also supported this position, warning against Russian attempts to use the elections to divide society.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-130-ukrainian-ngos-say-elections-impossible-during-war/	2025-02-21T04:53:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1156984375.jpg
Kremlin denies demanding NATO eastern rollback in talks with US	Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed on Feb. 21 that Russia did not ask the U.S. to withdraw troops from NATO&apos;s eastern flank during talks in Saudi Arabia. The spokesperson said this in reaction to an article by the Financial Times claiming that during the talks in Riyadh on Feb. 18, Russian delegates demanded the NATO rollback as a condition for &quot;normalizing relations.&quot; &quot;No, this is not true,&quot; Peskov told journalists when asked about the claims, the state new agency TASS reported. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. &quot;Our stance on the expansion of NATO&apos;s military infrastructure over several waves toward our borders is a cause of concern for us. This position is well known; it is no secret to anyone,&quot; Peskov added. The U.S. delegation reportedly rejected the demand, but concerns remain over what concessions President Donald Trump might consider to secure a deal with Russia on ending its war against Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin frequently claims that NATO poses a threat to Russia, accusing the alliance of seeking to expand its borders eastward. Moscow has repeatedly used Ukraine&apos;s possible entry into NATO as one of the justifications for launching its full-scale invasion. Russia previously demanded the NATO rollback from its eastern flank during unsuccessful talks in late 2021 that were meant to stave off the impending full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The alliance rejected the demand at the time.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-denies-demanding-nato-eastern-rollback-in-talks-with-us/	2025-02-21T03:46:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245735181.jpeg
63% of Ukrainians approve Zelensky as president, poll shows	Around 63% of Ukrainians approve of Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s actions as a president, according to a survey carried out by the Identity and Borders in Flux: The case of Ukraine (IBIF) project in partnership with the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) and published on Feb. 19. The poll was published shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump alleged that Zelensky holds a &quot;4% approval rating&quot; without providing a source to back his claim. Soon after, Trump dubbed Zelensky as a &quot;dictator.&quot; The survey was conducted between November 2024 and January 2025 with the participation of 1,600 respondents. The IBIF project is primarily funded by the British Academy, with additional funding from ZOiS and George Washington University&apos;s Institute for European, Russian, and Eurasian Studies. Some 26.1% of Ukrainians said they fully approve of Zelensky, while another 36.9% said they tend to approve of him. The overall figure is higher than in polls conducted before Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and in the spring of 2024. The poll showed that 14.4% fully disapprove of Zelensky&apos;s actions as a president, while 18.3% said they tend to disapprove of him. A total of 73% of respondents said they could call Zelensky an &quot;intelligent person,&quot; while 63% called him a &quot;strong leader.&quot; Zelensky remains the most popular Ukrainian politician, leading in polls for the future presidential election, KIIS wrote. Around 26%-32% of Ukrainians are ready to vote for Zelensky in the first round, according to the survey. Zelensky significantly outpaces his predecessor, businessman and lawmaker Petro Poroshenko, who polled at 5%-6%. &quot;A potential contender in a run-off could be a popular military figure General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, former &#x441;ommander-in-&#x441;hief and current Ukrainian ambassador to the U.K., but he has not voiced publicly any political ambitions,&quot; KIIS said. Another KIIS poll published on Feb. 19 showed that, as of February, around 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky, an increase of five percentage points since December. Ukraine was to hold the presidential election in the spring of 2024 but the vote was postponed due to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The Ukrainian constitution does not permit elections during martial law. Russia has sought to use this to undermine Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy as president, a narrative more recently promoted by Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/63-of-ukrainians-approve-zelensky-as-president-poll-shows/	2025-02-21T03:14:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199789864-2.jpg
Sweden suspects sabotage after new undersea cable damage	The Swedish authorities have launched a sabotage investigation after an undersea telecoms cable was damaged in the Baltic Sea, the Swedish newspaper Goteborgs-Posten reported on Feb. 21. The news comes following a string of cases of damaged undersea infrastructure in the region, with some officials connecting the incidents to hybrid attacks and Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; The fiber-optic cable running between Finland and Germany was damaged near Gotland Island within the Swedish exclusive economic zone, Sweden&apos;s Coast Guard said. The Finnish telecom operator Cinia described the damage as minor and said it did not impact the cable&apos;s functionality. According to the Finnish media, this is the third time the cable has been damaged in a short span of time. The Swedish Coast Guard said the incident was first recorded on Feb. 20, but it remains unclear when it occurred. &quot;We take all reports of potential damage to infrastructure in the Baltic Sea very seriously,&quot; Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on X. &quot;As I have already said, these incidents must be viewed in the context of the existing serious security situation.&quot; NATO has ramped up its presence in the Baltic Sea following multiple cases of damaged infrastructure, deploying additional patrol vessels to ward off potential sabotage. While Russian-linked vessels have been detained in connection to the incidents, some voices in the U.S. and European intelligence community believe them to be the result of simple accidents. The suspicions nevertheless add to the tensions between NATO and Russia as the West threw its support behind Ukraine in the face of the Russian invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/sweden-suspects-sabotage-after-new-undersea-cable-damage/	2025-02-21T02:49:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197221651.jpg
Ukrainian edtech company Headway joins global entrepreneur network Endeavor	Educational technology company Headway has become the first Ukraine-born business selected to join Endeavor, a global network of entrepreneurs, the company announced in a press release on Feb. 21. The selection marks a milestone for Ukraine&apos;s tech sector, coming almost three years after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and following Endeavor&apos;s launch in the country in October 2024. The membership gives Headway access to Endeavor&apos;s network of 2,800 entrepreneurs and potential funding through Endeavor Catalyst, the organization&apos;s investment fund that can invest up to $2 million in member companies. &quot;This is a powerful signal for Ukrainian startups: our companies are visible to the whole world and have a great chance of entering global markets,&quot; said Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, noting that Endeavor&apos;s network includes companies like Glovo, Amazon, and Netflix. Headway, founded in 2019, develops educational applications focused on lifelong learning and has reached more than 130 million users worldwide. The company operates in over 170 countries, including the U.S. and the U.K. &quot;It&apos;s a mark of quality, as Endeavor brings together companies with a high level of trust &#x2014; they all undergo a rigorous selection process,&quot; said Headway founder Anton Pavlovsky. The organization evaluates approximately 5,000 companies annually, selecting only 80-90 for membership. Currently, Endeavor Ukraine is reviewing about 100 companies with Ukrainian roots for potential membership, with several already undergoing the selection process. Vargha Moayed, who helped build UiPath into a $20 billion company and participated in Headway&apos;s evaluation, praised the company&apos;s track record. &quot;Headway has proven success, having bootstrapped the company,&quot; Moayed said. &quot;The company&apos;s leaders remain eager to scale the business further.&quot; Sviatoslav Sviatnenko, Endeavor Ukraine&apos;s founding managing director, aims to select at least three companies with Ukrainian roots annually. &quot;For a long time, Ukraine&apos;s tech ecosystem remained somewhat isolated from international hubs, networks, and markets,&quot; Sviatnenko said. He added that Endeavor Catalyst might make its first investment in Ukraine in 2025. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Ukraine-Moldova American Enterprise Fund (UMAEF) supported Endeavor&apos;s launch in Ukraine. The organization&apos;s board includes Vital Laptenok, Flyer One Ventures general partner and Genesis co-founder, as chair. Founded in 1997, Endeavor operates in 45 countries across Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and the United States. The organization&apos;s portfolio companies generate $67 billion in revenue and provide 4.1 million jobs globally. One in six Endeavor portfolio companies has reached a $1 billion valuation.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-edtech-company-headway-joins-global-entrepreneur-network-endeavor/	2025-02-21T02:03:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/472748632_1675389803406063_6407089676055390814_n.jpg
Russia wants to declare 'victory' over Ukraine on Feb. 24, Ukrainian intel claims	Russia is instructing its propagandists to declare &quot;victory&quot; in the war &quot;against Ukraine and NATO&quot; on Feb. 24, the third anniversary of its full-scale invasion, Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) claimed on Feb. 21. After Russia failed to take over Ukraine within days in 2022 and suffered several defeats in 2022, the Kremlin began to push the false claim that Russia was at war with NATO. Western partners have been providing Ukraine with weapons since the beginning of the all-out war but have never sent troops to Ukraine, fearing escalation. According to the intelligence agency, Russia aims to sow despair among Ukrainians, destabilize the situation in the country, and discredit Ukraine among its allies. Russian intelligence services plan to spread the narrative that &quot;Ukraine has been betrayed&quot; by the West and the U.S., HUR claimed. Russian propaganda will also keep on questioning the legitimacy of President Volodymyr Zelensky and &quot;the corrupt Ukrainian officials who steal U.S. aid.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s allies had generally ignored a propaganda narrative about Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy until U.S. President Donald Trump accused Ukraine of starting the war and appeared to echo the Kremlin&apos;s lines, dubbing Ukraine&apos;s president as a dictator. This claim ignores the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. As a result, Zelensky&apos;s term has been extended, which constitutional lawyers argue is permitted under Ukrainian law. HUR says that the Kremlin may use the recent U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia to impose its terms of peace on the world, trying to portray governments in Europe that back Kyiv as &quot;enemies of peace.&quot; No concrete decisions were announced following the meeting between American and Russian delegations, but Ukraine&apos;s exclusion sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-wants-to-declare-victory-over-ukraine-on-feb-24-military-intelligence-claims/	2025-02-21T01:37:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200027818.jpg
Azerbaijan suspends local BBC News office	Baku has ordered the suspension of the BBC News Azerbaijani office, allowing only one journalist to remain active in the country, the BBC said on Feb. 20. The British broadcaster confirmed that it had taken the &quot;reluctant decision&quot; to close the office following verbal instructions from the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry. Azerbaijani authorities did not disclose reasons for the decisions but said their steps are always &quot;guided by the principle of reciprocity in all its decisions and relations with the media of foreign countries.&quot; Observers have pointed to deteriorating freedom of the press in the South Caucasus state, which Reporters Without Borders ranked 164th out of 180 countries last year. &quot;We deeply regret this restrictive move against press freedom, which will hinder our ability to report to and from Azerbaijan for our audiences inside and outside the country,&quot; the BBC said in a statement. The BBC News Azerbaijani has been in operation since 1994, providing Azerbaijani-language news to roughly 1 million people weekly via radio and online platforms, the news agency said.	https://kyivindependent.com/azerbaijan-suspends-local-bbc-news-office/	2025-02-21T01:28:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1134811110.jpg
UK, Norway discuss Arctic defense pact over Russian threat	The U.K. and Norway on Feb. 20 launched discussions on a major defense pact to deter possible Russian aggression in the Arctic region. The agreement, designed to bolster British and Norwegian armed forces while deepening industrial cooperation, comes amid mounting tensions between Russia and NATO and concerns about the U.S.&apos;s commitment to Europe&apos;s security. &quot;With Russia continuing to militarise the High North and Arctic, this new agreement will boost security for the U.K., Norway, and our NATO allies, bolstering defenses on NATO&#x2019;s northern flank,&quot; the British government said in a statement. The discussions also concern the protection of undersea infrastructure after several cables were damaged in recent months with suspected Russian involvement. &quot;The U.K. is determined to play a leadership role on European security, supporting the foundations for our security and prosperity at home and showing our adversaries that we are united in our determination to protect our interests,&quot; U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said. European countries are looking to jointly strengthen security as the Trump administration signals reduced presence on the continent and urges Europe to take up responsibility for backing Ukraine against Russian aggression. After two European summits earlier this week, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is planning to visit Washington to meet Trump and reportedly pitch a plan for 30,000 European peacekeepers in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-norway-discuss-arctic-defense-pact-over-russian-threat/	2025-02-21T00:48:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/brit.jpg
Trump-Putin meeting depends on progress on ending war, Rubio says	A possible meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin will largely depend on whether &quot;we can make any progress&quot; on ending the war in Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview with journalist Catherine Herridge aired on X on Feb. 20. Rubio discussed a potential Trump-Putin meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Saudi Arabia, the U.S. secretary of state said. Trump said he would &quot;probably&quot; meet Putin before the end of February. When asked if he expected the meeting later in 2025, the U.S. secretary of state replied that he did not know the timing. &quot;There isn&#x2019;t going to be a meeting until we know what the meeting is going to be about,&quot; he said. American and Russian delegations met in Riyadh on Feb. 18. No concrete decisions on peace talks were announced following the talks, but Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the meeting sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe. Rubio voiced uncertainty about whether Moscow was serious about ending the war, adding that Trump wanted to know the answer before a possible meeting. &quot;The only way is to test them, to basically engage them and say, okay, are you serious about ending the war, and if so, what are your demands? &#xA0;Are your public demands and your private demands different?&quot; Rubio said. &quot;It may turn out that they don&#x2019;t want to end the war. &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t know; we&#x2019;re going to find out.&quot; Rubio said the necessity for peace talks was &quot;the only thing&quot; the U.S. and Russia agreed on. &quot;What they (Russia) offer, what they&apos;re willing to give up, what they&apos;re willing to consider will determine whether they&apos;re serious about peace or not,&quot; he added. Following U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia, Rubio told alarmed European officials that the Trump administration has no plans to impose the terms of any bilateral agreements with Russia on Ukraine and Europe, the New York Times reported on Feb. 21, citing an obtained summary of the call. According to Rubio, Washington clearly understood that Russia could try to use the talks to split the West or to weaken Moscow&apos;s isolation in the world, according to the NYT. He also reportedly told European partners that Washington would not lift U.S. sanctions against Russia without a marked change in Russia&apos;s stance, but he did not rule out a limited easing of some sanctions if Moscow took the steps the U.S. administration wanted. Trump has pushed to mediate a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia while using increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Kyiv. After accusing Ukraine of starting the war, Trump dubbed President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator without elections.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/the-only-way-is-to-test-them-trump-putin-meeting-depends-on-progress-on-ending-russian-war-rubio-says/	2025-02-21T00:27:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1152488863.jpg
Ukraine launching faster drone supply model for military	Ukraine&apos;s Defense Procurement Agency is launching a new supply model for delivering drones to the front line within weeks rather than months, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Feb. 20. Kyiv has ramped up domestic drone production over the past year. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks throughout the full-scale with Russia. According to the new model, military units will be able to choose the unmanned systems best suited to their needs. The system also aims to support manufacturers through advance orders, allowing them to plan for scaling up their production. The model aims to boost transparency in procurement as it establishes clear supply mechanisms and stimulates competition. The structure is based on the DOT-Chain, an IT system already used by the State Rear Operator (DOT), an agency dealing with non-lethal procurement for the military. DOT-Chain is designed to streamline and digitize procurement processes while reducing delivery time. &quot;Together with manufacturers, we are working to ensure that no soldier waits for weeks or months for what they need,&quot; Umerov said after a meeting with representatives of 200 drone manufacturers.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-launching-faster-drone-supply-model-for-military/	2025-02-20T23:51:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1242279354.jpg
12 killed, 6 injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks across Ukrainian oblasts killed at least 12 civilians and injured at least six over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 21. Russia launched 160 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force said. Eighty-seven drones were shot down, while 70 were lost without causing damage, according to the statement. Russian forces also reportedly fired two Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles against Odesa Oblast, the Air Force reported, without providing details on the consequences. During Russian attacks against the Nikopol district in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, two men aged 57 and 73 were killed, and a woman was injured, Governor Serhii Lysak said. Two enterprises, two shops, a cafe, two high-rise buildings, six houses, and other buildings were damaged. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast killed seven people and injured two, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. An airstrike against the city of Kostiantynivka killed five people, injured one, and damaged multiple buildings. Two more people were reported killed in Mykolaivka and Vesele, and one civilian was injured in Pokrovsk, according to Filashkin. In Kherson Oblast, two people were killed and two injured in Russian attacks, said the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. Fifteen houses and a multi-story building were damaged. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, a man was killed during a Russian attack against Huliaipole, and a woman was injured during a strike on Bilenke, according to Governor Ivan Fedorov.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-130/	2025-02-20T23:09:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-20_15-07-53.jpg
No appetite' for new Ukraine aid bill, US House speaker says	There is no appetite for another assistance bill for Ukraine, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said in an interview with Newsmax on Feb. 20 amid growing tensions between Washington and Kyiv. U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed to mediate a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia while using increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Kyiv. After accusing Ukraine of starting the war, Trump dubbed President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator without elections.&quot; &quot;We have to bring (the war) to an end. And I can tell you that our European allies understand the necessity as well. It&apos;s (dragged) on too long,&quot; Johnson said. Johnson, a Republican and staunch Trump supporter, has served as the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives since October 2023. He delayed aid to Kyiv for six months by refusing to hold a vote on various iterations of a $61 billion foreign assistance bill but eventually reached a deal to pass the legislation in April 2024. The speaker voiced support for the U.S. president, saying he is &quot;the brute force&quot; that can end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Trump&apos;s plan to end the war remains unclear. His special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, said the war could end this year, pledging to &quot;engage all parties&quot; within 180 days to achieve this. American and Russian delegations met in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. No concrete decisions were announced following the talks, but Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the meeting sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe. Unofficial U.S. and Russian representatives have also reportedly been quietly meeting in Switzerland in recent months for informal discussions regarding Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/no-appetite-for-new-ukraine-aid-bill-us-house-speaker-says/	2025-02-20T22:59:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2036326775-1.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 864,860 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 864,860 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 21. This number includes 1,280 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,146 tanks, 23,462 armored fighting vehicles, 38,104 vehicles and fuel tanks, 23,462 artillery systems, 1,295 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,080 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 26,156 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-864-860-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-02-20T22:08:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1250886494.jpeg
Europe needs 'massive defense plan,' US 'can't be weak' with Putin, Macron says	Europe needs a &quot;massive defense plan&quot; to face the growing threat from Russia, French President Emmanuel Macron said in a wide-ranging social media live feed on Feb. 20. Macron&apos;s remarks come ahead of his planned visit to Washington, D.C., where the French president is set to meet next week with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss peace negotiations in Ukraine. &quot;I&apos;m going to tell him (Trump) &apos;You can&apos;t be weak with (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin. That&apos;s not who you are, it&apos;s not your trademark, it&apos;s not in your interest,&apos;&quot; Macron said on Feb. 20. Macron has been rallying European leaders in recent days to discuss European and Ukrainian security in the wake of shifting U.S. policy towards Russia. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer will join Macron in Washington and will also speak with Trump in a separate meeting. In his Feb. 20 remarks, Macron slammed Russia as a &quot;dangerous military power that has become imperialist.&quot; He said Russia had &quot;globalized&quot; the war in Ukraine by bringing in North Korean troops, and said a worldwide conflict was not off the table. Macron called on Europe to come together to create a &quot;massive defense plan&quot; for the continent. Europe is not likely to form a common army, Macron clarified, but can work to create joint defense capabilities and autonomy from the U.S. Regarding Ukraine, France is open to providing Kyiv with security guarantees, including deploying peacekeeping forces to monitor a potential ceasefire. &quot;I have not decided to send troops to Ukraine tomorrow, no,&quot; Macron added. &quot;What we are considering instead is sending forces to guarantee peace once it has been negotiated.&quot; In partnership with the U.K., France is ready to consider sending experts or even a limited number of troops beyond the front line to demonstrate solidarity and help Ukraine defend itself, Macron said. Supporting NATO membership for Ukraine is among a number of ways France is ready to support Ukraine in its battle against Russia&apos;s aggression, he added. While Macron on Feb. 18 said he would not send combat troops to Ukraine, the French president has been at the forefront of calls to deploy European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire. The U.K. is reportedly going to pitch Trump a plan to deploy 30,000 peacekeepers to Ukraine as a post-ceasefire security guarantee. Trump has said he wants Europe to take over the responsibility of funding and monitoring Ukraine&apos;s defense.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-needs-massive-defense-plan-us-cant-be-weak-with-putin-macron-says/	2025-02-20T21:46:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2033880055.jpg
China backs US-Russia 'consensus' on Ukraine war	China supports the &quot;recent consensus&quot; reached by U.S. and Russian officials regarding the war in Ukraine, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement published Feb. 21. The statement came days after a U.S. delegation sat down with high-level Russian officials in Saudi Arabi on Feb. 18 to discuss ending the war against Ukraine &#x2014;&#xA0;without the participation of Ukraine itself. &quot;China supports all efforts committed to peace, including the recent consensus reached by the United States and Russia, and hopes that all parties concerned can find a sustainable and lasting solution that takes into account each other&apos;s concerns,&quot; the ministry&apos;s statement read. The statement echoed Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi&apos;s remarks at the Group of 20 (G20) foreign ministers meeting in Johannesburg on Feb. 20. Wang also met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the G20 meeting. Beijing is prepared &quot;to play a constructive role in the political settlement of the crisis,&quot; the ministry said. China has remained a key ally of Russia throughout the full-scale invasion, deepening economic ties and becoming Moscow&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods &#x2014; equipment the Russian military uses in its war against Ukraine. Despite these ties, China has insisted it is a neutral party to the war and has long positioned itself as a potential mediator in the conflict. Chinese officials have offered to host a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Feb. 13. In recent days, the Trump administration has upended years of U.S. foreign policy towards Russia and Ukraine. Trump spoke to Putin directly in a phone call on Feb. 12, before calling President Volodymyr Zelensky later that day. Soon after, the U.S. and Russia held talks on Ukraine without Ukraine. Along with ending Moscow&apos;s political isolation, Trump also began parroting Kremlin talking points in his public comments. He repeated false claims about Ukrainian elections and called Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; on social media.	https://kyivindependent.com/china-backs-us-russia-consensus-on-ukraine-war/	2025-02-20T21:02:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200862383.jpg
Tusk proposes 3-point plan to strengthen Ukraine, European security	Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Feb. 20 proposed a three-point plan to strengthen Ukraine in its fight against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and enhance European security. Tusk currently represents the rotating presidency of the EU Council. European leaders have called for increased support for Ukraine and are rethinking security in response to U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s threats to stop supporting security on the continent. Tusk renewed calls to finance Ukraine aid with funds from Russian frozen assets, the majority of which are held in EU banks. &quot;Let&apos;s finance our aid for Ukraine from the Russian frozen assets,&quot; he &#xA0;said in a social media post on Feb. 20. &quot;Let&apos;s strengthen air policing, the Baltic sentry, and the EU borders with Russia. Let&apos;s swiftly adopt new fiscal measures to immediately fund security and defense.&quot; Tusk&apos;s comments come as a shift in U.S. foreign policy towards Ukraine is pushing European officials to consider stepping up support for Kyiv and further toughening their stance on Russia. The U.S. ended a years-long policy of isolating Moscow when American and Russian officials sat down in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 for preliminary talks about ending the war in Ukraine. Neither Ukraine nor Europe were represented at the talks. Trump previously spoke directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call on Feb. 12, holding a separate phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky the same day. The U.S. President has vowed to bring about a speedy end to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;We have no doubt that the threat to Europe is Vladimir Putin&apos;s Russia, Trump&apos;s phone call to Putin was a mistake,&quot; Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said on Feb. 16. The EU introduced a 16th sanctions package against Russia on Feb. 19, targeting Russian aluminum and oil exports in response to Moscow&apos;s continued armed aggression against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/tusk-proposes-3-point-plan-to-strengthen-ukraine-european-security/	2025-02-20T20:08:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183928589.jpg
US, Russian participants held unofficial talks on Ukraine in Switzerland, Reuters reports	Unofficial U.S. and Russian representatives have been quietly meeting in Switzerland in recent months for informal discussions regarding Ukraine, Reuters reported on Feb. 21. The disclosure comes shortly after Russia and the U.S. held preliminary peace talks between high-level officials in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 without Ukraine&apos;s participation. The informal meetings were described as &quot;track two meetings,&quot; a type of unofficial diplomacy meant to lower tension, Reuters reported, citing three unnamed sources. Russia and the U.S. exchanged communication following U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s election victory on Nov. 5, sources said. A few of Trump&apos;s advisors are aware of the informal meetings, one of the unnamed sources with direct knowledge of the meetings told Reuters. The informal meetings held in Switzerland occurred as recently as days ago, coinciding with the Munich Security Conference. The two sides met in Geneva while the conference was still ongoing, two sources said. It is uncertain when the informal meetings began and whether or not Ukrainian representatives were involved, one source said. The attendees are not state officials but held security and diplomatic experience, two of the sources said. It is not clear if their governments sent them to participate in these meetings. The unnamed sources declined to name the attendees of the informal meetings. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Trump&apos;s re-election signaled a dramatic shift in U.S. foreign policy toward Russia. Following the Feb. 18 talks in Riyadh, relations between Kyiv and the Trump administration degenerated further, with Trump going so far as to call President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; &#x2014; a Kremlin talking point meant to undermine the Ukrainian government&apos;s legitimacy. Ukrainian and European officials have warned against holding negotiations about Ukraine without Ukraine&apos;s participation. Ukraine will not accept a peace deal negotiated behind its back, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 17.	https://kyivindependent.com/unofficial-russian-and-u-s-representatives-quietly-met-to-discuss-ukraine-in-switzerland-reuters-reports/	2025-02-20T18:54:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1248858240.jpeg
Meeting with Kellogg 'restores hope,' Zelensky says	U.S. Special Envoy Keith Kellogg&apos;s visit to Kyiv &quot;restores hope,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said following their meeting on Feb. 20. Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, spoke to Zelensky earlier in the day as part of Washington&apos;s efforts to broker a resolution in Russia&apos;s full-scale war. It was &quot;a meeting that restores hope,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;(A)nd we need strong agreements with America &#x2014; agreements that will really work.&quot; The meeting occurred on the backdrop of mounting tensions between Washington and Kyiv in recent days. Ukraine was not invited when the U.S. and Russia held talks in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. Trump praised the U.S.-Russia talks and shortly thereafter began parroting Kremlin talking points in his public remarks, calling Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and lying about his approval rating. Zelensky objected to Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the Riyadh talks and shot back at Trump&apos;s false claims, saying he would &quot;like there to be more truth in Trump&apos;s team.&quot; When Kellogg arrived in Ukraine on Feb. 19, he said his aim was to &quot;listen&quot; to Kyiv&apos;s concerns and relay his findings to the White House. Kellogg had been sidelined from the talks in Saudi Arabia, possibly because the Russian delegation disliked his perceived pro-Ukraine stance. Kellogg met with top Ukrainian military and government officials during his visit. While Zelensky sounded a hopeful note after his meeting with Kellogg, Washington requested that there be no joint press briefing following the conversation. Zelensky said the talks focused on front-line developments, prisoners of war (POWs) in Russian captivity, and Ukraine&apos;s need for long-term security guarantees. &quot;We all need peace: Ukraine, Europe, America, everyone in the world,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/meeting-with-kellogg-restores-hope-zelensky-says/	2025-02-20T18:20:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200014655.jpg
UK’s Lammy sees no Russian willingness for peace at G20 meeting	U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that the Kremlin shows no interest in pursuing peace in Ukraine, following a speech by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at a closed-door session of the G20 foreign ministers&apos; meeting in Johannesburg on Feb. 20. Speaking to reporters after the session, Lammy criticized Lavrov&#x2019;s remarks, saying they did not indicate any willingness to negotiate a settlement, according to the Associated Press. He also noted that Lavrov left the room before Lammy had the chance to deliver his own speech. The G20 meeting, taking place in South Africa, follows recent U.S.-Russia bilateral talks over ending the war in Ukraine&#x2014;talks that excluded both Ukraine and its European allies. Tensions have been further heightened by U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s comments blaming Ukraine for the war and his criticism of President Volodymyr Zelensky. In his speech, released by the U.K. Foreign Office, Lammy accused Russia of engaging in &quot;Tsarist imperialism&quot; and failing to learn from historical colonial wars. He expressed disappointment in Lavrov&#x2019;s speech, saying he had hoped for acknowledgment of civilian suffering and a commitment to a durable peace, but instead heard what he described as &quot;the logic of imperialism.&quot; Lammy dismissed Lavrov&#x2019;s remarks as &quot;tired fabrications&quot; and urged G20 members not to be misled by Russia&#x2019;s justifications for its actions. The G20, which includes major global economies alongside the EU and African Union, has struggled to find common ground on key geopolitical issues, particularly Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, in his opening address, urged member states to engage in constructive dialogue amid ongoing global crises, including war, climate change, and economic instability. However, U.S. disengagement from the summit signals the Trump administration&#x2019;s continued prioritization of its &quot;America First&quot; agenda over multilateral cooperation.	https://kyivindependent.com/uks-lammy-sees-no-russian-willingness-for-peace-at-g20-meeting/	2025-02-20T16:34:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172936127.jpg
US objects to 'Russian aggression' language in G7 statement, straining unity on Ukraine, FT reports	The United States is opposing the use of the term &quot;Russian aggression&quot; in a planned G7 statement marking the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, creating tensions among allied nations, an official familiar with the matter told the Financial Times (FT). Traditionally, G7 leaders issue a joint declaration on Feb. 24 reaffirming their support for Ukraine, but U.S. envoys have objected to language that explicitly blames Russia, according to Western officials. Meanwhile, President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s participation in the virtual G7 summit has not yet been confirmed, and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has announced she will not take part. &quot;We are adamant that there must be a distinction made between Russia and Ukraine. They are not the same,&quot; the official told the Financial Times. &quot;The Americans are blocking that language, but we are still working on it and hopeful of an agreement.&quot; The shift in U.S. rhetoric follows statements from President Donald Trump, who has blamed Ukraine for the war, accused Zelensky of acting like a &quot;dictator,&quot; and suggested that Russia should be invited back into the G7. Trump has also engaged directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin, authorizing bilateral talks aimed at ending the war. These moves have alarmed Ukraine and European allies, who see them as a departure from Washington&#x2019;s previous firm stance against Russian military actions. The U.S. State Department has increasingly used the phrase &quot;Ukraine conflict&quot; instead of referring to Russian aggression, signaling a broader policy shift. Adding to tensions, a scheduled news conference between Zelensky and Trump&#x2019;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, was canceled at Washington&#x2019;s request. While Zelensky described his discussions with Kellogg as constructive and detailed, the cancellation reinforced concerns about the changing US approach. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz escalated criticism of Kyiv, saying Trump was frustrated with Zelenskyy&#x2019;s perceived lack of gratitude for US support. Waltz also suggested Ukraine should reopen talks on a critical minerals deal, after Trump claimed the US was owed $500 billion worth of Ukrainian resources in exchange for military aid. In the US, Republican leaders have signaled growing reluctance to approve additional funding for Ukraine. House Speaker Mike Johnson stated that there is &#x201C;no appetite&#x201D; for another aid package, adding that the conflict must be brought to an end. Tech billionaire Elon Musk, a key Trump ally, echoed the US president&#x2019;s criticisms of Zelensky, falsely claiming that he is unpopular in Ukraine and has avoided holding elections. However, polling by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology contradicts this, showing Zelensky&#x2019;s approval rating at 57%, an increase from 52% in December. French President Emmanuel Macron has announced plans to meet Trump in Washington to discuss Ukraine, warning that the US must not appear weak in dealing with Putin. Macron defended Zelensky&#x2019;s legitimacy, adding that elections are impossible under wartime conditions. Meanwhile, Meloni&#x2019;s absence from the G7 call has raised questions about how she will navigate the growing divide between Trump&apos;s administration and European leaders. While she has been a strong supporter of Ukraine, her alignment with Trump could position her as a key EU liaison with the White House in future discussions on the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-objects-to-russian-aggression-language-in-g7-statement-straining-unity-on-ukraine-ft-reports/	2025-02-20T14:44:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2161853322.jpg
Russian hackers target Signal accounts in growing espionage effort	Google&#x2019;s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) has identified a rise in Russian state-backed hacking attempts aimed at compromising Signal messenger accounts. These attacks primarily target individuals of interest to Russia&apos;s intelligence services, including military personnel, government officials, journalists, and activists. While these efforts are currently tied to Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine, experts warn that similar tactics may soon be adopted by other threat actors worldwide. The broader concern extends beyond Signal, as Russian-aligned groups have also been observed targeting messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram using comparable methods, according to the group&apos;s latest report published on Feb. 19. Experts warn that these attacks signal a growing global trend in cyber espionage, where governments and hacking groups are increasingly seeking to infiltrate secure messaging apps. The primary technique used in these attacks involves exploiting Signal&#x2019;s &quot;linked devices&quot; feature, which allows users to connect additional devices to their accounts. Hackers have crafted malicious QR codes that, when scanned, link a victim&#x2019;s Signal account to a hacker-controlled device. This enables them to intercept messages in real-time without needing direct access to the victim&#x2019;s phone. Phishing campaigns distributing these malicious QR codes have been disguised as legitimate Signal security alerts, group invitations, or even official device-pairing instructions from the Signal website. In some cases, hackers have embedded these QR codes within fake applications designed to mimic software used by the Ukrainian military. Beyond remote phishing, Russian cyber operatives have also deployed this tactic in battlefield scenarios. The group APT44&#x2014;also known as Sandworm, a unit linked to Russia&#x2019;s military intelligence agency (GRU)&#x2014;has reportedly used the method on captured devices. Soldiers&#x2019; Signal accounts are being linked to Russian-controlled infrastructure, allowing continued surveillance of sensitive conversations. This approach is difficult to detect because Signal does not have a centralized system for flagging new linked devices, meaning a successful breach could remain unnoticed for an extended period. Signal, in collaboration with Google, has since strengthened its security measures to counter these phishing attempts. The latest updates for both Android and iOS include enhanced protections designed to prevent unauthorized device linking. Users are urged to update their apps to the newest version and remain cautious of suspicious QR codes or unexpected device-linking requests.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-hackers-target-signal-accounts-in-growing-espionage-effort/	2025-02-20T14:17:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2150495001.jpg
Trump administration presents 'improved' minerals draft to Ukraine after Zelensky's rejection, Axios reports	The U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration has presented Ukraine with an &quot;improved&quot; draft of a minerals agreement after President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected the initial proposal, Axios reported on Feb. 20, citing sources familiar with the matter. &quot;This is a negotiation. And in a negotiation, you negotiate. Ukraine wants to negotiate minerals, so we&apos;re talking about it,&quot; a White House official was quoted as saying. Following his meeting with Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Zelensky signaled Kyiv&apos;s openness to a &quot;strong, beneficial agreement&quot; with the U.S. on investments and security. &quot;We have proposed the quickest and most constructive way to achieve results,&quot; he said. According to Axios, several of Zelensky&apos;s aides encouraged him to sign the updated deal to avoid further tensions with Trump and allow the president to justify continued American support for Ukraine. The revised draft has reportedly been &quot;significantly improved&quot; to align with Ukrainian law. Trump previously suggested that new aid shipments could depend on trade deals the U.S. negotiates with Ukraine. On Feb. 3, Trump said he wanted to provide Kyiv with weapons and aid in exchange for &quot;rare earths and other things.&quot; The original U.S. proposal reportedly sought a 50% interest in Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas, as well as stakes in ports and other key infrastructure through a joint investment fund. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered the initial draft to Zelensky during his visit to Kyiv last week. Ukraine&apos;s leader said Kyiv is not ready to sign the document as it did not include any security guarantees. The proposal comes amid growing tensions between Kyiv and Washington, as Trump has made multiple false claims about Ukraine in recent days, including calling Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and accusing him of refusing to hold elections. Trump&apos;s remarks ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. A Ukrainian official told the Kyiv Independent that Washington had initially sought to condition Ukraine&apos;s signing of the memorandum on Zelensky&apos;s meeting with U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14. Vance also criticized Zelensky on Feb. 19, calling his public remarks about Trump &quot;counterproductive&quot; after the Ukrainian president dismissed Trump&apos;s claim that his support in Ukraine had fallen to 4%, labeling it Russian disinformation. A Feb. 19 poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) showed that 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky, marking a five-point increase since December.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-administration-presents-improved-minerals-draft-to-ukraine-after-zelenskys-rejection-axios-reports/	2025-02-20T12:45:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198422010.jpg
Exploitation or opportunity? Ukrainian business sees potential in Trump resource deal — if done right	Within weeks of U.S. President Donald Trump saying he wanted to do a deal with Kyiv on its &#x201C;rare earths and other things,&#x201D; it became clear the U.S. wasn&#x2019;t just interested in Ukraine&#x2019;s critical minerals and rare earth elements. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent visited Kyiv on Feb. 12 to present a deal to President Volodymyr Zelensky. After the Ukrainian president refused to sign citing a lack of security guarantees in it, details of the proposed agreement began to surface, setting off a wave of panic the U.S. was asking for too much. According to several reports and a leaked version of the deal, the U.S. was looking for a 50% interest in mineral resources, oil and gas resources, ports, and other infrastructure through a joint investment fund. Such a deal would potentially include some of the country&#x2019;s largest companies, including state-owned oil and gas giants. The proposal, particularly for stakes in Ukraine&#x2019;s large oil and gas sector, hasn&#x2019;t gone over well. Reactions to the deal have included calling it &quot;colonial,&quot; and amounting to asking a country that was invaded to pay reparations, and to its ally. &#x201C;We are not a colony, and there are no other examples of when allies demanded (this) in the middle of the war from their friends. The proposal definitely looks like reparations,&#x201D; said Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a Ukrainian MP. Scott Bessent, US Treasury secretary, left, and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine&apos;s president, during a meeting in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Wednesday. Feb. 12, 2025. (Andrew Kravchenko/Bloomberg via Getty Images)The deal is, however, likely just in its early phases. It could be that the Trump administration started the negotiations by asking for a lot with the expectation that the two sides will meet somewhere in the middle, said the President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine, Andy Hunder, who is familiar with the deal. &#x201C;The new administration team came in like a bull into a china shop. So yeah, of course, they&apos;re going to break some cups and plates.&#x201D; Reuters reported on Feb. 20 that the White House may opt for a simplified agreement with details sorted out down the line. If a happy middle ground is found, business people in Ukraine and experts believe the deal could be an opportunity to inject fresh capital into Ukraine&#x2019;s economy, particularly some of its struggling state-owned companies. &#x201C;Our understanding was that the (proposed) deal would help professional fund managers bring better returns to state-owned enterprises &#x2014; many of which have been mismanaged over the past number of years,&#x201D; said Hunder. A deal that includes more than Ukraine&#x2019;s mineral resources or rare earth minerals, may also be due to the fact that the actual volume and value of Ukraine&#x2019;s critical minerals are hugely speculative and hotly debated with official figures based on optimistic Soviet estimates of $12 trillion. On the flip side, Ukraine is known to be rich in natural gas and its ports are strategically located on the Black Sea at the crossroads between Europe and Western Asia. Despite the public outcry against the deal, Kyiv isn&#x2019;t casting it aside. In addition to looking to tie any agreement on resources to security guarantees to bolster its defense, Ukraine&#x2019;s struggling economy needs investment. If done right, the deal could be a win-win situation for both Ukraine and the U.S., said Oleksandr Kharchenko, managing director of the Energy Industry Research Center, a consultancy in Kyiv. &#x201C;In any kind of development in the Ukrainian oil and gas sector, we need money and technology. It&apos;s not something which you can take and it will generate profit. You have to invest a lot to make money in this business,&#x201D; he said. Ukraine&#x2019;s energy sector is lucrative. State oil and gas giant Naftogaz earned 32.4 billion hryvnia ($779 million) in profit in the first nine months of 2024. DTEK, the largest private energy company, earned a gross profit of Hr 4.6 billion ($111 million) from oil and gas production in the first half of 2024, despite the war. State-owned companies have a checkered history of corruption and mismanagement. Large parts of Ukraine&#x2019;s economy have long been dominated by oligarchs. U.S. investors in Ukraine&#x2019;s state-owned enterprises could lead to positive corporate reforms and attract more money, Kharchenko said. More financing and access to American technology will boost Ukraine&#x2019;s oil and gas production, he noted. In turn, Ukraine will have more gas to sustain itself, expand its influence on the gas market, and help replace Russian gas in Europe, an issue that persists despite the EU&#x2019;s efforts to diversify. While it would be &quot;beneficial for international players to come in, Ukraine&#x2019;s interests should be preserved&quot; in any deal, said a representative of a Ukrainian energy company, speaking on condition of anonymity. Zelensky has batted away the idea of Ukraine becoming a piggy bank for countries exploiting its natural resources. Speaking to CNN Turk on Feb. 19, he emphasized Ukraine wants to be &quot;friends and partners&quot; rather than a &#x201C;center for the extraction of raw materials for any continent.&#x201D; One path is offering investment opportunities in return for the liberation of occupied territories, where resources like lithium and gas are located. &#x201C;It&apos;s wise to propose the large share of (occupied resources) to the U.S. if they are able to help us to liberate them,&#x201D; said Zhelezniak.

(Christopher Occhicone/Bloomberg via Getty Images)The question still remains of how the U.S. will offer protection guarantees in the long run although NBC reported that Washington may deploy troops to guard the resources. There is an underlying concern that Trump is not interested in the security of Ukraine as a whole but instead seeking to exploit a vulnerable ally. &#x201C;It is not in anyone&#x2019;s interest to see Ukraine in the future being a devastated land under constant missile and drone bombardment by Russia, with a few plants or resource sites guarded by U.S. special forces &#x2014; like what we saw in Iraq and Syria until very recently,&#x201D; said Roman Sulzhyk, a partner at Ukraine Breakthrough Investments, an investment firm. &#x201C;A more equitable deal would involve only future revenue, from resources developed with U.S. investment and expertise, and tangible security guarantees &#x2014; not just for the sites where Americans operate, but for the whole country,&#x201D; he added. Part of the reaction to the deal may be due to its messaging. If the Trump administration had presented the deal as a concession or a private-public partnership (PPP), it would have offered a different understanding, Hunder said. &#x201C;If you come along and say: &#x2018;give us this,&#x2019; then it&#x2019;s going to be perceived very differently.&#x201D; Ukraine is no stranger to PPPs. Big institutions like the International Finance Corporation (IFC) have overseen billions of dollars in projects in the last decades including in the energy and transportation sectors. Zhelezniak agrees that overall, joint ventures of some kind are &#x201C;a good idea.&#x201D; &#x201C;But it&#x2019;s better to just privatize (state enterprises) and sell them to foreign investors,&#x201D; he said, referencing the sale of UMC Titanium, a state titanium producer that was sold to Cemin Ukraine in October 2024.

(Vincent Mundy/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Since investments in natural resources are a long-term commitment rather than a short-term gain, Zhelezniak emphasizes the need to ensure the agreement is clear and sustainable. It shouldn&#x2019;t be vulnerable to revisions when new governments come into Washington and Kyiv. There is also a legal question. The U.S. proposed governing the deal under New York law, but that could change. Establishing how any part of the deal would be governed will be key, especially given the Ukrainian court system&apos;s bad reputation. Moreover, Ukraine&#x2019;s constitution states the resources belong to the people so it is unclear whether the president has the power to even make this type of deal. Doing so could require constitutional changes. Any deal will &#x201C;have to be ratified and explained to the Ukrainian people. If not, it will create a lot of noise, and zero investments,&#x201D; said Zhelezniak.

Ukraine war latest: Zelensky-Kellogg meeting ends with no joint statements at US request, spokesperson says	Key developments on Feb. 20: President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, in Kyiv on Feb. 20. &quot;We discussed in detail the situation on the battlefield and how to return all our POWs (prisoners of war), as well as effective security guarantees,&quot; the president said on Telegram after the meeting. According to Zelensky, Ukraine is ready for a strong, beneficial agreement with the U.S. regarding investments and security. &quot;We have proposed the quickest and most constructive way to achieve results,&quot; he said. The meeting in Kyiv was expected to be followed by a press briefing, but Washington requested that no joint statements be made, Zelensky&apos;s spokesperson, Serhii Nykyforov, told reporters. Kellogg arrived in Ukraine on Feb. 19 as part of Washington&apos;s efforts to broker a resolution to Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Upon arrival, he said his primary mission was to &quot;listen&quot; to Kyiv&apos;s concerns and relay his findings to the White House. The visit follows U.S.-Russia negotiations in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, where American and Russian officials discussed the war without Ukrainian participation. Zelensky strongly rejected the idea of peace talks being conducted behind Ukraine&apos;s back. Zelensky&apos;s meeting with Kellogg comes amid growing tensions between Kyiv and Washington, as Trump has made several false remarks about Ukraine in recent days, including calling Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and accusing him of refusing to hold elections. His claims ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. During his visit to Ukraine, Kellogg also met with top Ukrainian military and government officials. Kellogg&apos;s role in Trump&apos;s peace efforts remains unclear, as he was not involved in the Feb. 18 talks in Saudi Arabia. Some experts suggest he has been sidelined due to his perceived pro-Ukraine stance and alleged Russian objections to his participation. Trump&apos;s recent remarks have raised concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about Washington&apos;s shifting stance on the war. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer will present U.S. President Donald Trump with a plan to deploy up to 30,000 European troops to monitor a possible ceasefire in Ukraine, the Telegraph reported on Feb. 19, citing undisclosed Western officials. Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron are going to travel to the U.S. next week to discuss the prospects of peace negotiations with Trump. European leaders gathered in Paris on Feb. 17 for an emergency summit amid concerns that Washington is advancing peace talks with Moscow without Europe&#x2019;s involvement. A broader meeting was held on Feb. 19, after which Macron reaffirmed the &quot;united&quot; stance of France and its allies on Ukraine. Starmer is reportedly planning to reveal details of how European troops would be able to enforce any ceasefire brokered by Trump. According to the plan, European troops would be deployed in Ukrainian cities, ports, and other critical infrastructure such as nuclear power plants &quot;far away from the current front lines,&quot; the Telegraph wrote. The U.S. has ruled out sending its own troops while encouraging European allies to take the lead in securing Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability. A Western official claimed the mission would rely on &quot;technical monitoring,&quot; including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, as well as drones and satellites. They also added that sufficient firepower would support the mission to &quot;monitor and shoot those attacks down&quot; to reopen Ukraine&apos;s airspace and allow commercial flights. The purpose of this support is to ensure that &quot;whatever forces are deployed will not be challenged by Russia,&quot; a source told the newspaper. According to the Telegraph, Starmer will urge Trump to keep U.S. fighter jets and missiles in NATO countries in Eastern Europe ready to respond to any future Russian aggression. Apart from the U.K. and France, other countries remain cautious about sending their troops to Ukraine, citing concerns over the escalation and limited military resources, according to the Washington Post. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Kyiv had made significant progress in securing a foreign military presence on its territory. On Jan. 22, Zelensky said the number of European peacekeepers required to maintain peace in Ukraine would depend on the size of Ukraine&apos;s own military. The U.S. is refusing to co-sponsor a UN resolution marking the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, which reaffirms Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity and condemns Moscow&apos;s aggression, Reuters reported on Feb. 20, citing sources familiar with the matter. &quot;In previous years, the United States has consistently co-sponsored such resolutions in support of a just peace in Ukraine,&quot; a source told Reuters. The upcoming UN vote, considered a key indicator of global support for Ukraine, can proceed without U.S. backing but may struggle to gain widespread support in the General Assembly. The U.S. also opposed directly calling Russia the &quot;aggressor&quot; in a G7 statement marking the anniversary of the invasion, according to the Financial Times. This is the first time the U.S. has pushed back on such language. The reports follow recent diplomatic efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration to engage with Russia, as well as a number of Trump&apos;s false accusations against Ukraine and its President Volodymyr Zelensky. On Feb. 18, Secretary of State Marco Rubio led a U.S. delegation to Saudi Arabia for direct talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Trump has made several controversial statements about Ukraine in recent days, including calling President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and falsely accusing him of refusing to hold elections. His claims ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. Trump has also suggested that Ukraine should repay the U.S. for its military assistance through a deal involving the country&apos;s natural resources, claiming &#x2014; without evidence &#x2014; that Kyiv had &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a deal worth $500 billion. On Feb. 19, Zelensky said that Ukraine&apos;s wartime military expenses had totaled $320 billion, with the U.S. and EU providing a combined $200 billion in defense support. &quot;We, the people of Ukraine, (covered) $120 billion, the U.S. and the EU &#x2014; $200 billion. We are talking about arms; this is a weapons package worth $320 billion,&quot; Zelensky said in Kyiv. Trump&apos;s recent remarks have raised concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about Washington&apos;s shifting stance on the war. U.S. President Donald Trump said that Russia holds &quot;the cards&quot; in any peace talks with Ukraine as they occupy a significant part of Ukrainian territory, the BBC reported on Feb. 20. &quot;I think the Russians want to see the war end, I really do. I think they have the cards a little bit, because they&apos;ve taken a lot of territory. They have the cards,&quot; Trump told journalists on Air Force One. A U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio met top Russian officials for talks in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, marking the highest-level meeting between the two sides since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022. Ukraine was not invited to participate. No concrete decisions were announced following the U.S.-Russia talks, though both Moscow and Washington praised the meeting as constructive. Ukraine&apos;s exclusion sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe. The U.S. and Russia signaled that a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin could occur before the end of February. Speaking after the Riyadh talks, Trump voiced his belief that Russia wishes to end the war and laid the blame for the ongoing hostilities on Ukraine. He subsequently attacked President Volodymyr Zelensky as a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; while pressing the besieged country to hold a vote. Kremlin propaganda has pushed the narrative that Zelensky is an illegitimate leader, relying on the premise that his first presidential term was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. Trump&apos;s claim ignores the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. A Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) operation was behind the detonations of goggles for first-person-view (FPV) drones used by Russian soldiers, a HUR source told the Kyiv Independent on Feb. 20. The news comes after Russian pro-war Telegram channels reported a series of explosions of FPV goggles while they were being used by Russian drone operators. According to the source, HUR bought a large batch of FPV goggles for the operation and rigged them with explosives and a detonation mechanism. According to the source, a large batch of FPV goggles was bought for the operation and equipped with explosives and a remote detonation function. (HUR source)&quot;Russian volunteers&quot; subsequently donated the goggles to Russian drone units &quot;in coordination&quot; with the agency, according to the source.&quot;Today, the horrors of war are literally happening right before the eyes of Russian FPV pilots. This is a well-deserved punishment for the war crimes that the Russian occupiers commit against Ukraine every day,&quot; the HUR source said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Throughout Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing warfare. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks by Ukrainian troops. FPV drones are cheap to manufacture and can be precisely flown into targets, allowing their users to destroy much more expensive military equipment. Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in its Kursk Oblast captured by Ukraine, senior Russian General Staff officer Sergei Rudsky claimed in an interview with the Russian Defense Ministry newspaper published on Feb. 20. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. According to Rudsky, Ukrainian soldiers are in control of about 500 square kilometers (193 square miles) out of 1,268 square kilometers (490 square miles) initially seized by Kyiv. The Russian general claimed that Russian troops were now advancing in Kursk Oblast in all directions, and the Ukrainian army was &quot;retreating from their positions.&quot; The Ukrainian military has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed on Feb. 18 that Russian forces had crossed into Ukrainian territory from Kursk Oblast, which Ukraine&apos;s General Staff dismissed. Despite months of being on the defensive, Ukrainian forces reportedly advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in the region in a new offensive in early February. Over six months of fighting in the region, Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000 personnel, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 6. Another 909 have been reportedly taken as prisoners of war. Ukraine is likely looking to use its foothold in Kursk Oblast as leverage in potential peace talks. Russia&apos;s forces in Kursk Oblast have been bolstered by North Korean troops, deployed last fall to help counter the Ukrainian incursion. President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that the offensive disrupted Russia&apos;s ability to carry out large-scale operations in northeastern and southern Ukraine.

Moscow demanded NATO withdrawal from eastern Europe during US-Russia talks, FT reports	During U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia, Moscow allegedly demanded that the U.S. withdraw NATO forces from eastern Europe as a condition for &quot;normalizing relations,&quot; the Financial Times (FT) reported on Feb. 20, citing two officials in the region. The U.S. delegation reportedly rejected the demand, but concerns remain over what concessions President Donald Trump might consider to secure a deal with Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer are set to visit Washington next week for talks with Trump, where they are expected to urge him not to concede to Russia&apos;s demands. One unnamed eastern European official told the FT that regional governments are increasingly worried about the trajectory of U.S.-Russia talks and whether their concerns will be taken seriously in the White House. Cristian Diaconescu, the Romanian president&apos;s chief of staff, warned that the U.S.-Russia dialogue risks a &quot;new Yalta,&quot; referring to the 1945 conference where the Allies divided post-war Europe into spheres of influence. Russian President Vladimir Putin frequently claims that NATO poses a threat to Russia, accusing the alliance of seeking to expand its borders eastward. Moscow has repeatedly used Ukraine&apos;s possible entry into NATO as one of the justifications for launching its full-scale invasion. Kyiv argues that joining the alliance would provide it with a vital security guarantee, preventing any future invasion of its territory. The Saudi Arabia meeting on Feb. 18 marked the highest-level U.S.-Russia talks since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. No concrete decisions were announced, but Moscow and Washington described the discussions as constructive. Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the talks has sparked concerns in Kyiv and Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/moscow-demands-nato-withdrawal-from-eastern-europe-in-us-russia-talks-ft-reports/	2025-02-20T11:41:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199670478.jpg
‘We cannot survive’ without foreign weapons, say Ukrainian soldiers fearing looming Trump cuts	A looming dropoff in U.S. weapons deliveries is threatening to strain Ukraine&#x2019;s budding domestic arms production to the breaking point. As U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s administration prepares negotiations with their Russian counterparts, Ukrainians fear being cut out of negotiations &#x2014; and cut off from future U.S. support, including weaponry. Despite Ukraine placing massive bets on localizing arms production, the outlook is grim for a self-sustained Ukrainian war effort. Clever front-line improvisations in drones and electronic warfare have yet to overcome Russia&#x2019;s wartime output of tanks, mortars, missiles, and mines. Russia&#x2019;s drones are, moreover, not half bad. When it comes to armor, Ukraine is often left rehabbing old Soviet vehicles. Ukraine&#x2019;s military still needs to ask the West for a steady stream of long-range missiles and precision air defense. Continuing failures in artillery reveal a core weapons industry that cannot deliver simple weapons en masse. Ukraine has a &#x201C;very low chance of survival&#x201D; without U.S. weapons, President Volodymyr Zelensky told NBC News on Feb. 15. Ukraine has built out its domestic arms production in a big way since the Russian war machine rolled in on Feb.24, 2022. Speaking to Piers Morgan last month, President Volodymyr Zelensky said 40% of Ukraine&#x2019;s weapons are made in Ukraine, as opposed to 10% of total arms used at the outset of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. One of the points of Russia&#x2019;s greatest advantage since the outset of the war is artillery. Specifically, mortar shells &#x2014; a disparity that Ukraine has tried hard to balance. Ukraine&#x2019;s Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin has said that Ukraine already produced 50% of its artillery ammunition in 2024, and will produce &#x201C;just about everything we use&#x201D; in 2025. Smetanin&#x2019;s recently reassigned predecessor Alexander Kamyshin said in September that Ukraine had begun producing 155 mm shells &#x2014; a NATO standard size for howitzers, as opposed to the Soviet 152 mm. But the problem is simple, says Roman &#x201C;Cat&#x201D; Kotliarov, an artillerist in the Ukrainian military who recently relocated from Donbas to man a 122 mm mortar in northern Kharkiv Oblast, near the Russian border. &#x201C;Those shells are no good,&#x201D; referring to Ukrainian-made mortar shells. &#x201C;If you&apos;re talking about Ukrainian mortar shells, which are produced in Ukraine, they&#x2019;re very low quality. I don&apos;t like to work with them,&#x201D; Kotliarov told the Kyiv Independent. Ukrainian soldiers preparing a mortar in the direction of Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk Oblast on Feb. 9, 2024. (Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu via Getty Images)About 70% of the ammunition that reaches Kotliarov and his team these days is made in Ukraine. His four-man crew is scared to use them. &#x201C;Last time I was in a position where my guys were fighting, they put a shell in the mortar. It made a boom and the shell fell five meters away from them,&#x201D; Kotliarov said. &#x201C;It&apos;s very dangerous. Thank god my guys are alive and everything&#x2019;s ok.&#x201D; An embarrassing series of investigations from Ukrainian outlet Suspilne forced the Strategic Industries Ministry to recall some 30,000 defective mortar shells in January. In addition to incompetence, those reports suggest a siphoning off of powder somewhere along the supply line. Accounts like Kotliarov&#x2019;s show that bad shells continue to dog soldiers rebuffing Russian assaults. The functional mortar shell supply remains dependent on international detritus. &#x201C;The U.S., Poland, Italy &#x2014; we even get mortar rounds from India. Foreign shells are more or less ok,&#x201D; he continued. &#x201C;Ukrainian shells, where my president spent a lot of money &#x2014; they&#x2019;re trash.&#x201D; Another soldier, a captain by the call sign of &#x201C;Artem&#x201D; who recently rebased after two and a half years in frontline artillery to a desk job in Kyiv, is similarly critical of Ukraine&#x2019;s local production of the mortars themselves. &#x201C;The only Ukrainian-made mortar I used was made in Sumy. In 1942,&#x201D; he told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;It weighed maybe 800 kilograms.&#x201D; Contrary to government announcements, the situation, he says, has not improved. The struggle with shells is just one striking case study in the broader reality of Ukrainian manufacturing of traditional weapons. As for armored vehicles and tanks, local production is too often just refurbishment of Soviet-era equipment. And indeed Ukrainian local war vehicle makers like Ukrainian Armor have converted their factories to produce shells. A representative for the Strategic Industries Ministry declined to comment, other than to describe the shell industry as &#x201C;sensitive.&#x201D; Kotliarov was more forthcoming. &#x201C;Without (U.S.) assistance, we cannot survive,&#x201D; said Kotliarov. The mishmash of shells from different countries and eras required Artem&#x2019;s team to empty, weigh, and reapportion gunpowder between them in various warehouses near the front. Gunpowder is a key issue. A global arms race in response to Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine has led nations to scrape the bottom of the powder barrel. As one example, General Dynamics&#x2019; ordnance subsidiary, among the largest ammunition manufacturers in the world, said in its February annual report that it plans to grow its potential powder production from 5 million to 16 million pounds by 2028. Ukraine makes none of its own powder, despite tentative experiments to grow cotton to turn into powder.

(Vincenzo Circosta / Anadolu via Getty Images)So while local shell producers have emerged, they&#x2019;re limited. Steel Hornets, for instance, produces the empty casings for shells, but leaves it up to soldiers receiving the shells to fill them, a representative told the Kyiv Independent. While Western nations have given Ukraine much of their old arms stockpiles, it&#x2019;s been less generous with raw materials that Ukrainian industry could use to make its own equipment. &#x201C;Western countries are not interested in supplying raw materials,&#x201D; says Kateryna Bondar, a Ukrainian fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. &#x201C;They see a market for European defense companies in Ukraine.&#x201D; On the plus side for Ukraine, Russian equipment is riddled with many identical problems &#x2014; Soviet flotsam and jetsam rehabbed and presented as something shiny and new. On the downside, Russia&#x2019;s top-down arms industry is nonetheless producing traditional military gear at a scale that Ukraine simply cannot match. The growth of the Ukrainian defense industry has also depended on foreign money. Information Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration released in its twilight hours claimed that the U.S. had put over $2 billion into Ukraine&#x2019;s much-vaunted domestic drone industry. At Davos, Zelensky continued to plead for foreign money into Ukrainian drones as key to Europe&#x2019;s future security. The U.S. weapons supply is at risk of crumbling, calling into question Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to defend itself unaided. &#x201C;I think the general intention and idea is to cut off any military support,&#x201D; Bondar says, describing the Trump administration&#x2019;s posture toward Ukraine. The fault is far from Ukraine&#x2019;s alone. The EU and the U.S. are failing to keep up with collective quotas. Despite having an economy less than a tenth the size of either the U.S. or EU, Russia is still outproducing the entire West in key areas like ammunition for artillery. Western arms giants ranging from the German Rheinmetall to the U.S. Northrop Grumman have announced factory agreements to set up production inside of Ukraine. Their output within Ukraine is questionable. Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger, last year the subject of a foiled Russian assassination attempt, told German news outlet DW that the firm&#x2019;s 155mm factories in Ukraine won&#x2019;t be up and running until 2026. 155 mm artillery shells that are ready to be shipped are stored at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, U.S. on April 12, 2023. (Hannah Beier/Getty Images)That&#x2019;s not to say all of Ukraine&#x2019;s weapon localization is stalled or glitching. The wartime birth of local mass production of technological weapons, especially drones, electronic warfare, and communications systems has been impressive &#x2014; and vitally useful. But when it comes to high-tech traditional weapons like long-range missiles, Ukraine remains in a bind, partially because it is dependent on a goodwill supply of Western components like high-end inertial guidance modules or jet engines that Russia gets from China or via sanctions evasion. On the plus side, the U.S. may well have overestimated its own weapons deliveries to Ukraine, meaning that they make up a smaller proportion of existing arms. And at least politically, the EU remains more supportive of Ukraine than the new Trump administration, and European leaders are at least talking about escalating their own weapons production as U.S. protection looks less stable. But the largest economies of the EU have been slow to deliver on promised military industry expansion and have run through much of their pre-2022 stockpiles. That&#x2019;s especially true from neighbors from the former USSR or broader Warsaw Pact, who have been proportionately the most generous to Ukraine and who, like Ukraine, had Soviet weaponry lying around. Ukrainians consequently fear a pending cliff in weapons deliveries from both the U.S. and EU. The question is what Ukraine can and can&#x2019;t make on its own. &#x201C;I think Ukraine is very far away from being self-sufficient because the front line is huge, and the adversary is powerful and backed up by China,&#x201D; says Bondar. &#x201C;Ukraine is not able to sustain and not able to defend itself.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/we-cannot-survive-without-us-weapons-ukrainian-soldiers-cast-doubt-on-local-arms-industry/	2025-02-20T11:40:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2195734247.jpg
How Ukraine should deal with Trump, according to Ukrainians	Despite a long history of controversial and bombastic statements, U.S. President Donald Trump still managed to stun those watching this week by calling President Volodymyr Zelesnky a &quot;dictator&quot; and blaming Ukraine for Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Trump&apos;s comments were the latest example of increasingly hostile rhetoric towards Ukraine that has, in recent days, become disturbingly close to long-standing Kremlin propaganda lines. As well as the dictator comment, Trump has also criticized Zelensky for not holding elections, echoing comments from Moscow that have questioned the president&apos;s legitimacy. All of this has come at the same time as a concerted push from the White House to end the war, which so far has taken the form of a high-level meeting in Saudi Arabia between U.S. and Russian officials &#x2014; but not Ukraine&apos;s, adding to increasing fears that a peace negotiation could be reached that would be beneficial to Moscow at the expense of Kyiv. On the streets of Kyiv on Feb. 19, opinions about Trump and his outbursts over recent days weren&apos;t hard to find. &quot;It&apos;s complete nonsense. I think he&apos;s either an idiot, or he&apos;s pretending to be one,&quot; Yevhen, a charity fund employee told the Kyiv Independent. While blunt, the comment does highlight an important question &#x2014; are Trump&apos;s personal attacks on Zelensky and Ukraine just that, or is there a wider strategy at play? Benjamin Tallis, director of the Berlin-based Democratic Strategy Initiative, told the Kyiv Independent he believes there are three options. The first, he says, is a strategy all about &quot;putting the Europeans on notice.&quot; &quot;Saying, you need to toughen up, you need to take responsibility and to actually make a point in a way that has not been made before by effectively abandoning Europe,&quot; he said, adding this possibility is &quot;looking increasingly unlikely&quot; and Trump&apos;s cosying up to Putin suggests something else. The second option could be that the Trump administration is looking at the wider geo-political situation, identifies China as its biggest threat, and is therefore trying to &quot;split off Russia from China, to use Russia against China in the ongoing geopolitical competition.&quot; &quot;But the thing that mitigates against that is it seems strange on many levels to embrace such an unreliable potential partner as Russia when you have what would be a much more obvious partner and a richer partner in Europe,&quot; he says. Which leaves option three &#x2014; that Trump has &quot;moved over to the side, or embraced his position on the side of the dictators and the anti-freedom axis.&quot; &quot;And that&apos;s the nightmare scenario because that means that if Europe is in a systemic competition of free world versus the authoritarians of democracies versus dictatorships, we&apos;re basically on our own,&quot; Tallis said. Marci Shore, author and professor of European intellectual history at Yale University, gave a similarly downbeat assessment of the situation, bluntly stating that &quot;we&apos;re staring into a nihilist abyss.&quot; &quot;There are no first principles, no values, nothing beyond narcissism. Trump and Putin are alike in that the lives of other people mean absolutely nothing to them &#x2014; which gives them both a free hand,&quot; she told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Ukrainians &#x2014; and Zelensky personally &#x2014; should absolutely not count on and not trust us now &#x2014; this American administration is unpredictable, unreliable, and unhinged. This applies both domestically and globally. I say this as an American filled with shame and disgust.&quot; We asked three Ukrainian political experts how they think Ukraine should handle this very delicate, and hugely consequential moment. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks after signing two executive orders in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S. on Feb. 14, 2025. (Andrew Harnik / Getty Images)Dr. Volodymyr Dubovyk Expert on U.S.-Ukrainian relations and head of Odesa National University&apos;s Center for International Studies I do not believe that this is some sort of sophisticated strategy here on Trump&#x2019;s part. It is just Trump being Trump. He can&#x2019;t stand anyone opposing him, or standing in his way. Zelensky saying that Trump is wrong, even when he says that in the most reserved, polite way is bad enough for Trump. Only flattery works with him, but this is not a time for flattery if you are Ukraine&#x2019;s leader. Besides, he has a history with Ukraine and Zelensky, and that is a negative history. He is surrounded by people who have no regard for Ukraine. He is getting his view of Ukraine from people who wish it ill. Initially, I suppose, Trump tried to appear fair and balanced. But he has a bad temper and no patience, so his intrinsic thinking came to the surface really quickly. Zelensky is in a hard bind here &#x2014; he cannot not react to Trump&#x2019;s insinuations. Besides, he needs to position himself clearly with Ukraine&#x2019;s interests in the current situation, in light of a high-speed rapprochement with Moscow. On the other hand, of course, he does not want to antagonize Trump. That is why he appears animated and emotional, but still doing his best to be reserved and calm, not to cross certain lines. It would be wise, I think, for President Zelensky not to dive into this vicious cycle of back-and-forth mocking and poking, trading accusations. Perhaps, not all things Trump says call for a reproach. Expert on North American policy at the foreign policy think tank Ukrainian Prism When Zelensky and Trump first met in the US&#x2026; he was very praising of Trump. He was a good friend to him. So basically, Zelensky got it right on how to talk to Trump. And I do believe he should return to the strategy of interpersonal communication, of building bridges with Trump, of being his good buddy. First and foremost, we should once again make it personal, but on the good side of Trump. So to some extent, we should play by Trump&apos;s playbook. Of course, some may say it&apos;s a lame game to play, but if it provides weapons for Ukraine, if it provides security for Ukraine, and if it provides guarantees and a good deal for Ukraine, I don&apos;t care what means we use, we should save our country. The second point is don&apos;t look weak. Trump will never deal with somebody who is weak, who is losing, who is getting prepared to lose, or who is just giving up on all positions. It&apos;s not about being only nice. It&apos;s also about being a strong partner on whom Trump can rely, both economically, politically, security-wise, etc. We should play all our cards well. We should present all our pluses, especially the security and military ones. Ukraine should use all the pluses that Ukraine has and then just work, work, work, constant communication, constant exchanges, and just be there, just be present in Trump&apos;s informational bubble. Research advisor at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation If Trump believes Putin is ready to make peace and start negotiations, there is a high probability that because of the Russian approach &#x2014; they are not flexible and will try to push, push, push &#x2014; it may create a backlash from the United States, including from Trump himself. And as we know, Trump can always change his mind on matters. Right now he looks very disappointed by Zelensky, and is very aggressive towards him, repeating Russian arguments. But we don&apos;t know what will happen in one or two months&apos; time. So he may change his approach, and his approach to Russia may become harder, he may listen more carefully to Ukrainian arguments. It&apos;s very difficult to predict, frankly speaking. We can only hope.	https://kyivindependent.com/how-ukraine-should-deal-with-trump-according-to-ukrainians/	2025-02-20T11:39:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199467761.jpg
Zelensky-Kellogg meeting ends with no joint statements at US request, spokesperson says	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, in Kyiv on Feb. 20. &quot;We discussed in detail the situation on the battlefield and how to return all our POWs (prisoners of war), as well as effective security guarantees,&quot; the president said on Telegram after the meeting. According to Zelensky, Ukraine is ready for a strong, beneficial agreement with the U.S. regarding investments and security. &quot;We have proposed the quickest and most constructive way to achieve results,&quot; he said. The meeting in Kyiv was expected to be followed by a press briefing, but Washington requested that no joint statements be made, Zelensky&apos;s spokesperson, Serhii Nykyforov, told reporters. Kellogg arrived in Ukraine on Feb. 19 as part of Washington&apos;s efforts to broker a resolution to Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Upon arrival, he said his primary mission was to &quot;listen&quot; to Kyiv&apos;s concerns and relay his findings to the White House. The visit follows U.S.-Russia negotiations in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, where American and Russian officials discussed the war without Ukrainian participation. Zelensky strongly rejected the idea of peace talks being conducted behind Ukraine&apos;s back. Zelensky&apos;s meeting with Kellogg comes amid growing tensions between Kyiv and Washington, as Trump has made several false remarks about Ukraine in recent days, including calling Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and accusing him of refusing to hold elections. His claims ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. During his visit to Ukraine, Kellogg also met with top Ukrainian military and government officials. Kellogg&apos;s role in Trump&apos;s peace efforts remains unclear, as he was not involved in the Feb. 18 talks in Saudi Arabia. Some experts suggest he has been sidelined due to his perceived pro-Ukraine stance and alleged Russian objections to his participation. Trump&apos;s recent remarks have raised concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about Washington&apos;s shifting stance on the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-kellogg-talks-end-with-no-joint-statements-at-us-request-spokesperson-says/	2025-02-20T10:21:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200011457.jpg
Ukraine needs to 'tone it down,' sign US minerals deal, Waltz says	U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz on Feb. 20 urged Kyiv to &quot;tone down&quot; its stance and sign a minerals deal that President Volodymyr Zelensky refused to make. &quot;They need to tone it down and take a hard look and sign that deal,&quot; Waltz told Fox News, referring to the memorandum presented by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Feb. 12. Kyiv had earlier announced that it was not ready to sign the U.S.-proposed agreement on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources. Zelensky said Ukraine is open to investment but argued that the memorandum lacks concrete security guarantees. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration reportedly seeks a 50% interest in Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas, and stakes in ports and other critical infrastructure through a joint investment fund. Waltz said Ukraine&apos;s rejection of the deal and resistance to Trump&apos;s approach to peace talks is &quot;completely unacceptable.&quot; Zelensky earlier reiterated his commitment to ending Russia&apos;s war in 2025, emphasizing the need for a resolution that is &quot;not just quick but fair and reliable.&quot; Trump has made multiple false statements about Ukraine in recent days, including calling Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and claiming that he refuses to hold elections. His remarks ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. U.S. Vice President JD Vance also criticized Zelensky on Feb. 19, saying his public remarks about Trump were &quot;counterproductive.&quot; The comment came after Zelensky dismissed Trump&apos;s claim that his support among Ukrainians had fallen to 4%, calling it Russian disinformation. A poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published on Feb. 19 showed that 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky, a five-point increase since December. Trump&apos;s recent remarks have sparked concerns in Kyiv and among European allies over a shift in his administration&apos;s stance on the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-needs-to-tone-down-sign-us-minerals-deal-waltz-says/	2025-02-20T10:04:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193394562.jpg
Confused about Zelensky’s legitimacy? Here’s what you need to know	U.S. President Donald Trump claimed on Feb. 19 that President Volodymyr Zelensky was a &quot;modestly successful comedian&quot; turned &quot;dictator&quot; who &quot;refused to have elections.&quot; This was the latest in a series of false accusations Trump has made about Ukraine while his team is engaging in peace negotiations with Russia, a country that wages a war of aggression against Ukraine. Trump&apos;s words led Ukraine&apos;s European allies to reaffirm their support for Zelensky and address that they see him as the legitimate president of Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized that Zelensky was Ukraine&apos;s &quot;democratically elected leader.&quot; It is &quot;perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during wartime as the U.K. did during World War II,&quot; the readout of Starmer&apos;s call with Zelensky on Feb. 19 said. We&apos;ve collected our articles and videos to help you understand why Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy is being questioned and how that plays into Russia&apos;s hands. The Kremlin has long sought to portray Zelensky as &quot;illegitimate&quot; in an attempt to discredit Kyiv. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 18 that Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has ruled Russia for over 20 years, is ready for talks with Zelensky, but &quot;legal aspects related to his legitimacy&quot; must be considered. Ukraine&apos;s allies had generally ignored this propaganda narrative until Trump appeared to echo the Kremlin&apos;s lines. Watch this video on our YouTube channel to understand why Russia is using this narrative: No, Zelensky did not cancel elections. The reason why Ukraine has not had elections during Russia&apos;s full-scale war is because they cannot be held under martial law. Martial law in Ukraine was declared on Feb 24., 2022, hours after Russia launched its full-scale invasion. Moreover, Ukrainian law requires an election to be safe, equal, and uninterrupted. This is impossible during a full-scale war, with Russia continuing to attack civilians and civic infrastructure. Read our guide to any potential elections in Ukraine: Zelensky was elected democratically in the 2019 Ukrainian presidential elections, winning 73% of the vote and beating then-incumbent President Petro Poroshenko. &#x201C;The presidential election was competitive and fundamental freedoms were generally respected,&#x201D; election observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) declared at the time. &quot;Ukraine is a democracy. Putin&apos;s Russia is not,&quot; European Commission spokesperson Stefan de Keersmaecker said on Feb. 20. Watch our video to learn about Zelensky&apos;s 2019 election campaign and how he came to power: If Ukraine had not been under martial law, Ukraine&apos;s next presidential election would have been held on March 31, 2024, and Zelensky&#x2019;s term would have ended on May 20, 2024. Read this article from May 2024 to understand why Zelensky stayed on as Ukraine&apos;s president past that date: According to a survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published on Feb. 19, around 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky as of February, marking an increase of five percentage points since December, when his approval rating polled at 52%. The day before, Trump claimed that Zelensky was down to a 4% approval rating. Trust in Zelensky skyrocketed after Russia launched its full-scale invasion and he remained in Kyiv to lead the country&apos;s fight. His approval rating began to drop in 2024 as the battlefield stalemate gave way to grinding Russian advances.

Explosion kills Russian occupation official in Berdiansk, Ukraine's intelligence claims	An explosion in Russian-occupied Berdiansk on Feb. 20 killed Yevgeny Bogdanov, deputy head of the local occupation administration, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) claimed. The intelligence agency accused him of committing multiple war crimes against Ukrainian citizens. Bogdanov oversaw financial management for the occupation administration and coordinated the construction of fortifications in Russian-occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia Oblast. A gray Renault Duster exploded and burned completely, according to HUR. Bogdanov was inside the vehicle, the agency claimed. Bogdanov reportedly arrived in Berdiansk immediately after Moscow&apos;s troops occupied the city in early 2022 and was appointed to the local administration on orders from Russian special services. Berdiansk, a key transport hub on the Azov Sea, remains strategically important for Russia, particularly for shipping looted Ukrainian grain and resources. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, multiple assassinations of Russian-appointed officials and military commanders in occupied Ukraine have been reported, often involving car bombs. In December, Vasyl Nechet, the Russian-installed head of Berdiansk, was injured in a similar car explosion. In October, Russian Major Dmitry Pervukha was killed in occupied Luhansk under similar circumstances.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-occupation-official-killed-in-berdiansk-ukraines-hur-accuses-him-of-war-crimes/	2025-02-20T08:48:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1242319542.jpg
Ukraine moves to nationalize Ferrexpo's mining subsidiary	Ukraine&apos;s State Bureau of Investigation and Justice Ministry are preparing to nationalize Poltava Mining, a subsidiary of London-listed Ferrexpo, which is majority owned by oligarch Konstantin Zhevago, the SBI announced on Feb. 20. The move comes amid Ukraine&apos;s broader crackdown on assets linked to sanctioned oligarchs during wartime. Ferrexpo is one of the country&apos;s largest iron ore exporters and employers in central Ukraine. The lawsuit seeks to transfer 49.5% of Poltava Mining and its assets to state ownership, including 541 properties, 172 land plots, and over 2,300 railway cars with tracks. Half of Ferrexpo&apos;s shares belong to Zhevago, who was arrested in absentia in July 2024 on embezzlement charges of Hr 1.4 billion ($33.6 million) in a case involving Finance and Credit Bank. Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) recently announced sanctions and criminal proceedings against against a number of Ukrainian businessmen and former high-ranking officials, including Zhevago. Poltava Mining in February was also hit by a civil claim for Hr 157 billion ($3.78 billion) over illegal mining in Ukraine and the sale of waste products. &quot;Initial accusations on the illegal sale of waste products have transformed into accusations that FPM is illegally mining and selling subsoil, which is said to have caused damage to the environment,&quot; Ferrexpo said in a statement on Feb. 4. The company denied the allegations, declaring its intentions to defend its position in the Ukrainian courts. The lawsuit does not affect the company&apos;s operations, the statement said. Earlier, in September 2024, the SBI sent a case to court against seven Poltava Mining officials for illegal mining and sale of minerals worth Hr 370 million ($8.9 million).	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-moves-to-nationalize-ferrexpos-mining-subsidiary/	2025-02-20T08:08:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-680305212.jpg
EU defense commissioner pushes back against Trump	After the Trump administration accused European allies of not pulling their weight in the support for Ukraine, the Kyiv Independent sat down with the EU&apos;s first-ever defense commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, to discuss whether Europe is ready to step up. Speaking on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14, Kubilius pushed back against Washington&apos;s accusations while underscoring the strides made by the European defense industry since 2022. Nevertheless, catching up with Russia&apos;s wartime arms production remains a challenge, the commissioner warns.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-defense-commissioner-pushes-back-against-trump/	2025-02-20T07:52:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/IMG_0436.JPG
US refuses to co-sponsor UN resolution condemning Russia, resists labeling Moscow 'aggressor' in G7 statement, media report	The U.S. is refusing to co-sponsor a UN resolution marking the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, which reaffirms Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity and condemns Moscow&apos;s aggression, Reuters reported on Feb. 20, citing sources familiar with the matter. &quot;In previous years, the United States has consistently co-sponsored such resolutions in support of a just peace in Ukraine,&quot; a source told Reuters. The upcoming UN vote, considered a key indicator of global support for Ukraine, can proceed without U.S. backing but may struggle to gain widespread support in the General Assembly. The U.S. also opposed directly calling Russia the &quot;aggressor&quot; in a G7 statement marking the anniversary of the invasion, according to the Financial Times. This is the first time the U.S. has pushed back on such language. The reports follow recent diplomatic efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration to engage with Russia, as well as a number of Trump&apos;s false accusations against Ukraine and its President Volodymyr Zelensky. On Feb. 18, Secretary of State Marco Rubio led a U.S. delegation to Saudi Arabia for direct talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Trump has made several controversial statements about Ukraine in recent days, including calling President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and falsely accusing him of refusing to hold elections. His claims ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. Trump has also suggested that Ukraine should repay the U.S. for its military assistance through a deal involving the country&apos;s natural resources, claiming &#x2014; without evidence &#x2014; that Kyiv had &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a deal worth $500 billion. On Feb. 19, Zelensky said that Ukraine&apos;s wartime military expenses had totaled $320 billion, with the U.S. and EU providing a combined $200 billion in defense support. &quot;We, the people of Ukraine, (covered) $120 billion, the U.S. and the EU &#x2014; $200 billion. We are talking about arms; this is a weapons package worth $320 billion,&quot; Zelensky said in Kyiv. Trump&apos;s recent remarks have raised concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about Washington&apos;s shifting stance on the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-refuses-to-co-sponsor-un-resolution-condemning-russia-resists-g7s-language-on-moscow/	2025-02-20T07:50:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1754907256.jpg
Ceasefire likely in 2025, Ukraine's spy chief says	Ukrainian military intelligence head Kyrylo Budanov believes that Ukraine and Russia will reach a ceasefire this year, he said in an interview with Azerbaijani journalist Eynulla Fatullayev published on Feb. 18. Budanov described the situation as &quot;paradoxical&quot; since the positions of Kyiv and Moscow are drastically opposite. &quot;At the same time, I think we will reach a ceasefire this year,&quot; Budanov said. &quot;How long it will be, how effective it will be, is another question. But I think it will happen. Most of the components needed for this to happen are there.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed to mediate a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia while using increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Kyiv. A day before dubbing President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator,&quot; he accused Ukraine on Feb. 19 of starting the war. This was preceded by a meeting of the American and Russian delegations in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 and a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which took place before Trump&apos;s call with Zelensky. No concrete decisions were announced following the U.S.-Russia talks, but Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the meeting sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe. According to the spy chief, while the NATO membership issue remains &quot;very complicated,&#x201D; there is no other relevant format for security guarantees. He also questioned the effectiveness of deploying a peacekeeping mission to Ukraine, saying that such a step has never met expectations in other war-torn countries. Previously, Zelensky said that European partners would need to station 100,000 to 150,000 soldiers in Ukraine to effectively deter Russia. The U.K. and France are considering deploying a much smaller European-led peacekeeping force with up to 30,000 soldiers, the Telegraph reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-russia-ceasefire-can-be-reached-in-2025-budanov-says/	2025-02-20T05:54:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2156902920.jpg
Kellogg meets Sybiha, Syrskyi, Yermak during Kyiv visit	Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, met with top Ukrainian military and government officials as part of his visit to the country that began on Feb. 19. Kellogg&apos;s visit comes amid a tense atmosphere as Trump adopts increasingly hostile rhetoric toward President Volodymyr Zelensky while planning a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. On his first day in Kyiv, Kellogg met Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak, and intelligence and security chiefs, Zelensky revealed. During the meeting, Yermak stressed that Kellogg should have &quot;complete and objective information about the events on the front and about the Ukrainians&apos; ability and desire to end the war with a just and lasting peace,&quot; the Presidential Office said. On Feb. 20, Kellogg also met Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha &quot;to discuss ways toward a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s top diplomat said. &quot;I affirmed Ukraine&apos;s willingness to achieve peace through strength and our vision for the necessary steps. I also reiterated that the security of Ukraine and the transatlantic is indivisible,&quot; Sybiha said on social media. Kellogg is expected to meet Zelensky later on Feb. 20. The Ukrainian president suggested that Trump&apos;s envoy could visit the front to inspect the situation there. &quot;We understand the need for security guarantees. We understand... the importance of the sovereignty of this nation,&quot; Kellogg said after arriving in Kyiv. &quot;Part of my mission is to sit and listen and see what your concerns are,&quot; he said, adding he will relay his findings to the White House. Trump&apos;s Ukraine envoy previously met with Zelensky and other top Ukrainian officials during the Munich Security Conference to discuss the war and the U.S.-proposed memorandum on Ukraine&apos;s rare earth minerals and other resources. Recent developments indicate that Kellogg is being sidelined in Trump&apos;s peace efforts as he was not involved in the talks in Saudi Arabia held on Feb. 18. Some experts attribute this to Kellogg&apos;s pro-Ukraine stances and Russia&apos;s alleged objections to him.	https://kyivindependent.com/kellogg-meets-sybiha-syrskyi-yermak-during-kyiv-visit/	2025-02-20T05:38:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GkOwkA1XwAAtUyM.jpg
Russia claims to retake 64% of Kursk Oblast territories seized by Ukraine	Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in Kursk Oblast captured by Ukraine, senior Russian General Staff officer Sergei Rudsky said in an interview with the Russian Defense Ministry newspaper published on Feb. 20. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. According to Rudsky, Ukrainian soldiers are in control of about 500 square kilometers (193 square miles) out of 1,268 square kilometers (490 square miles) initially seized by Kyiv. The Russian general claimed that Russian troops were now advancing in Kursk Oblast in all directions, and the Ukrainian army was &quot;retreating from their positions.&quot; The Ukrainian military has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed on Feb. 18 that Russian forces had crossed into Ukrainian territory from Kursk Oblast, which Ukraine&apos;s General Staff dismissed. Despite months of being on the defensive, Ukrainian forces reportedly advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in the region in a new offensive in early February. Over six months of fighting in the region, Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000 personnel, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 6. Another 909 have been reportedly taken as prisoners of war. Ukraine is likely looking to use its foothold in Kursk Oblast as leverage in potential peace talks. Russia&apos;s forces in Kursk Oblast have been bolstered by North Korean troops, deployed last fall to help counter the Ukrainian incursion. President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that the offensive disrupted Russia&apos;s ability to carry out large-scale operations in northeastern and southern Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-regains-control-of-64-of-seized-kursk-oblast-territories-russian-general-claims/	2025-02-20T05:21:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2166312603.jpg
EU's Costa, von der Leyen to visit Kyiv on Feb. 24	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will visit Kyiv on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale war, Costa announced on Feb. 20. The visit aims to reaffirm the EU&apos;s &quot;support to the heroic Ukrainian people and to the democratically elected President Volodymyr Zelensky,&quot; Costa said on X.	https://kyivindependent.com/eus-costa-von-der-leyen-to-visit-kyiv-on-feb-24/	2025-02-20T05:01:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2190670425.jpg
Europe, rearming is cheaper than war	Europe urgently needs to rearm. Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, and the broader threat that Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s regime poses to Europe, requires nothing less. U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s administration has also now made clear that neither Ukraine nor America&#x2019;s NATO allies can count on continued U.S. support. Perhaps this particularly brutal wake-up call will finally jolt European governments out of their complacency. If so, the big question is how to finance the requisite increase in military investment at a time when Europe&#x2019;s economies are weak, public finances are stretched, and many voters are loath to accept cuts to other government spending. The scale of the challenge is indeed daunting. Russia&#x2019;s economy is on a war footing, its army is battle-hardened, and it has a huge stockpile of nuclear weapons. Even though Europe&#x2019;s economy dwarfs Russia&#x2019;s, a recent report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies estimates that, after adjusting for purchasing power, Russia&#x2019;s military expenditure last year ($462 billion) was higher than Europe&#x2019;s ($457 billion). Europe&#x2019;s big powers have struggled to meet NATO&#x2019;s previously agreed peacetime target of spending at least 2% of GDP on defense. France and Germany managed barely more than that last year, while the United Kingdom reached 2.3% of GDP. These figures are woefully inadequate for an age when war has returned to the continent and Europe must provide for its own security. Trump wants NATO&#x2019;s European members to raise their defense spending to 5% of GDP, while NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte acknowledges the need for &#x201C;considerably more than 3%.&#x201D; Poland has already upped its military spending to over 4% of GDP, with the aim of reaching 5%, and other front-line states such as Estonia and Lithuania are not far behind it. Now the rest of Europe must follow suit. But how should they finance the effort? With European economies stagnant and many Europeans struggling, governments are not keen to raise taxes or slash welfare spending. While such measures may ultimately be necessary nonetheless, the politically obvious solution for now is to borrow. This would make economic sense, too, since higher defense spending is, in fact, an investment in Europe&#x2019;s future. True, high government debts, EU fiscal rules, and domestic political constraints make increased borrowing tricky for many countries. But there are at least three options for mitigating these factors. The first is to exclude investment in defense from the bloc&#x2019;s fiscal rules, which broadly limit government borrowing to 3% of GDP. Last year, the European Commission launched an &#x201C;excessive deficit procedure&#x201D; against Poland, which rightly argued that its increased borrowing was necessary to protect the country &#x2014; and the rest of Europe &#x2014; from the heightened Russian threat. Fortunately, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen seems to have come around to the Polish position. She is proposing to activate the Stability and Growth Pact&#x2019;s escape clause (which allows higher borrowing during crises) to permit increased defense investment. While Germany and other fiscally frugal countries have previously objected to granting such additional flexibility, that may change after the German elections on February 23, given the country&#x2019;s belated awareness of its vulnerability. Since Germany itself has low public debt and a small budget deficit, EU fiscal rules would not prevent it from borrowing more to upgrade its feeble defenses. But it is shackled by its own constitutional &#x201C;debt brake,&#x201D; which then-Chancellor Angela Merkel introduced in 2009, and which the country&#x2019;s powerful constitutional court aggressively enforces. Again, though, there could be greater openness to amending this measure after the election. Fiscal rules are not the only constraint, however; so, too, are bond markets. France&#x2019;s public debt already exceeds 110% of GDP, and its minority government has struggled to pass a budget that would trim its bulging budget deficit (6.1% of GDP). The country&#x2019;s precarious political situation has further increased the premium that it must pay relative to German debt. Indeed, the interest rate on French debt briefly exceeded that of Greece last year. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk (L), French President Emmanuel Macron (C), and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (R) at a joint meeting in Berlin, Germany, on March 15, 2024. (Christoph Soeder/picture alliance via Getty Images)A second option, then, is for European governments to borrow collectively to finance a one-off investment in defense capacity, as French President Emmanuel Macron has suggested. There is a precedent for this: the EU&#x2019;s 750 billion euro ($782 billion) COVID-19 recovery fund. Another round of joint borrowing to the tune of 500 billion euros (3% of EU GDP) could amplify member states&#x2019; defense spending, help to rationalize European defense procurement, and potentially bolster European defense firms. The hitch is that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb&#xE1;n is openly pro-Putin, while four other EU countries (Austria, Ireland, Cyprus, and Malta) have maintained their official neutrality vis-&#xE0;-vis Russia. Moreover, fiscally frugal northern European countries have hitherto been reluctant to sanction further EU borrowing. One potential workaround is for a coalition of willing governments to set up a special purpose vehicle separate from the EU, which could issue joint bonds backed by guarantees from participating governments. This would not only bypass recalcitrant EU members; it would also allow for participation by non-EU defense partners such as Norway and the U.K.. The relatively new U.K. Labour government might find this especially attractive, given its own domestic fiscal constraints. Finally, the third option is to expand the scope of European Investment Bank lending. While the EIB can already finance dual-use (civilian/military) projects, such as those producing drones and satellites, 19 EU governments recently suggested that it should also be permitted to finance wholly military spending, such as investments in tank and ammunition manufacturing. However it is financed, Europe needs to rearm now. Upping defense spending to avert Ukraine&#x2019;s defeat and deter broader Russian aggression is much less costly than fighting an all-out war. Otherwise, as Rutte warns, Europeans will need either to learn Russian or to move to New Zealand. Editor&#x2019;s Note: Copyright, Project Syndicate.

Kremlin 'concerned' by Starmer's reported peacekeeper plan for Ukraine	Moscow is worried about recent discussions by NATO countries about a potential deployment of peacekeepers in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, the pro-Kremlin news agency Interfax reported on Feb. 20. Peskov made the statement in reaction to a recent Telegraph story saying that U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer plans to propose to U.S. President Donald Trump the deployment of up to 30,000 European troops to monitor a potential ceasefire deal in Ukraine. &quot;We are, of course, following all these reports most closely... This is a cause for concern because the discussion is about sending NATO military contingents to Ukraine,&quot; Peskov said at a press briefing. The Kremlin spokesperson reiterated earlier statements by the Russian Foreign Ministry that a deployment of NATO troops on Ukrainian soil would be &quot;unacceptable&quot; for Russia. The peacekeeper deployment has been discussed as a possible security guarantee for Ukraine in case of a ceasefire. Washington has supported the idea, with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth saying that the ceasefire should be &quot;backed by capable European and non-European troops&quot;&#x2014; with the exclusion of U.S. soldiers. While France, the U.K., and several other countries voiced support for the idea, European countries have yet to reach a consensus on the issue. According to Starmer&apos;s plan, European troops would be deployed in Ukrainian cities, ports, and other critical infrastructure such as nuclear power plants &quot;far away from the current front lines,&quot; the Telegraph wrote. Starmer reportedly also plans to urge Trump to keep U.S. fighter jets and missiles in NATO countries in Eastern Europe ready to respond to any future Russian aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-concerned-by-starmers-reported-peacekeeper-plan-for-ukraine/	2025-02-20T04:00:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2159849194--1-.jpg
Ukraine behind FPV goggles explosions in Russia, source claims	A Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) operation was behind the detonations of goggles for first-person-view (FPV) drones used by Russian soldiers, a HUR source told the Kyiv Independent on Feb. 20. The news comes after Russian pro-war Telegram channels reported a series of explosions of FPV goggles while they were being used by Russian drone operators. According to the source, HUR bought a large batch of FPV goggles for the operation and rigged them with explosives and a detonation mechanism. According to the source, a large batch of FPV goggles was bought for the operation and equipped with explosives and a remote detonation function. (HUR source)According to the source, a large batch of FPV goggles was bought for the operation and equipped with explosives and a remote detonation function. (HUR source)&quot;Russian volunteers&quot; subsequently donated the goggles to Russian drone units &quot;in coordination&quot; with the agency, according to the source.&quot;Today, the horrors of war are literally happening right before the eyes of Russian FPV pilots. This is a well-deserved punishment for the war crimes that the Russian occupiers commit against Ukraine every day,&quot; the HUR source said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Throughout Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing warfare. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks by Ukrainian troops. FPV drones are cheap to manufacture and can be precisely flown into targets, allowing their users to destroy much more expensive military equipment.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-behind-fpv-goggles-explosions-in-russia-source-claims/	2025-02-20T03:21:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2190445244.jpg
Russian vessel sanctioned over North Korean arms shipments entering European waters, researchers say	The Russian munitions carrier Maia-1 passed the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean Sea as it is likely heading for the Russian port of Ust-Luga in the Baltic Sea, the Open Source Center (OSC) research group said on Feb. 19. This would mark the first time that the Russian-flagged vessel, sanctioned by the U.S. and the EU, entered European waters, the Financial Times noted. Maia-1, owned by the sanctioned MG-Flot company, has reportedly made at least nine voyages to North Korea in the past five months. North Korea has become Moscow&apos;s leading supporter in its war against Ukraine, providing artillery, shells, ballistic missiles, and over up to 12,000 soldiers for deployment in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. The MarineTraffic monitoring channel shows Maia-1 north of Egypt&apos;s Mediterranean coast and well past the Suez Canal as of Feb. 20, heading west. The content of Maia-1&apos;s cargo remains unclear. Joe Byrne, a senior OSC analyst, told the Financial Times that Maia-1&apos;s trip is meant to &quot;test&quot; the Western resolve in enforcing sanctions. Ust-Luga, Maia-1&apos;s declared destination, lies in Russia&apos;s northeastern Leningrad Oblast, only some 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the border with NATO member Estonia. The city&apos;s port has reportedly served as a key hub for Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; tankers used to avoid sanctions. Russia has also been building a new liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal at the Baltic port, though Western sanctions have hampered the process. A Ukrainian drone strike against the Ust-Luga port was reported in January, while an oil tanker exploded at the port under unclear circumstances the following month.	https://kyivindependent.com/vessel-sanctioned-over-north-korean-arms-shipments-heading-to-russias-baltic-port-researchers-say/	2025-02-20T02:57:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-478570656.jpg
Russian mass attack targets Ukraine's gas facilities, energy minister says	Russian forces targeted Ukraine&apos;s gas infrastructure in a mass drone and missile attack overnight on Feb. 20, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukrainian energy infrastructure with missiles and drones over the course of the war, including gas storage facilities in Ukraine&apos;s west. Russia launched 161 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones and 14 Kh-101/55SM cruise missiles, Kalibr/Iskander-K cruise missiles, and Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles against Ukraine this night, the Air Force said. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 80 drones over 11 oblasts, while 78 drones were lost without causing damage, according to the statement. The attack damaged gas production facilities, Halushchenko said, without disclosing their locations. Explosions were reported in Kyiv, Odesa, and the adjacent regions. Russian aerial strikes targeted an energy facility of Ukraine&apos;s DTEK company in Odesa Oblast. A total of 49,000 consumers remained without power as of 9 a.m. local time, Governor Oleh Kiper said. The full consequences of the Russian attack are being determined. Restoration works are ongoing. &quot;The purpose of these criminal attacks is to stop the production of gas needed to meet the household needs of citizens and centralized heating,&quot; the minister said. In early February, Halushchenko said that Russian strikes had severely impacted Ukraine&apos;s domestic gas production capacity and that the country would need to import an estimated 1 billion cubic meters of gas by the end of the year.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-gas-facilities-targeted-in-russian-mass-attack-energy-minister-says/	2025-02-20T02:04:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1228384175.jpg
Trump may seek simplified resources deal with Ukraine, Reuters reports	The Trump administration may try to push through a simplified initial version of the U.S.-Ukraine deal on natural resources extraction, with details to be sorted out at a later date, Reuters reported on Feb. 20, citing two undisclosed sources. The news comes after U.S. President Donald Trump said that he aims to &quot;resurrect&quot; talks on the agreement, adding that otherwise, &quot;things are gonna not make him (President Volodymyr Zelensky) too happy.&quot; The Trump administration reportedly seeks a 50% interest in all of Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas, as well as stakes in port and other critical infrastructure, through a joint investment fund. In early February, Trump said he wanted to strike a deal with Ukraine involving access to rare earth minerals in exchange for continued aid. Trump later claimed that Kyiv had &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal. The revised approach is one of the several directions being discussed in the White House on how to strike a deal with Kyiv in the coming weeks, according to the news agency. Postponing discussion on the agreement&apos;s details should help Washington bypass numerous legal and logistical obstacles and give the U.S. time to consider issues like revenue sharing at a later stage, Reuters wrote. Sources told Reuters that Trump wants to make a deal before potentially authorizing more U.S. military aid for Kyiv or moving forward with an attempt to broker formal Ukraine-Russia peace talks. Trump considers it important to publicly announce to domestic audiences that the U.S. is getting back the money allocated for assistance, the sources claimed. An undisclosed Trump adviser confirmed for Reuters that the U.S. would continue to pursue the agreement, adding that &quot;we need to get this guy (Zelensky) back to reality.&quot; Other sources told the news agency that Ukraine is open to concluding the deal but hopes it will be less &quot;rapacious&quot; than the original draft. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent passed Zelensky a draft of the Ukraine-U.S. natural resources agreement during his visit to Kyiv last week. Ukraine&apos;s leader said Kyiv is not ready to sign the document as it did not include any security guarantees. A Ukrainian official source told the Kyiv Independent that the U.S. initially wanted to make Ukraine&apos;s signing of the memorandum a condition for Zelensky&apos;s meeting with Vice President JD Vance at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14. After Ukrainian delegates pushed back, the meeting eventually took place, during which both sides discussed their proposals. The source described the talks as constructive. Trump blamed Ukraine for treating Bessent &quot;rather rudely&quot; when he arrived in Kyiv to pen the memorandum. The comments follow Trump&apos;s increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Ukraine. Only a day before dubbing Zelensky &quot;a dictator without elections,&quot; he accused Ukraine of starting the war while praising the U.S.-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-may-try-to-make-simplified-resources-deal-with-ukraine-reuters-reports/	2025-02-20T01:55:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173926230.jpg
Russia holds 'the cards' in possible peace talks, Trump says	U.S. President Donald Trump said that Russia holds &quot;the cards&quot; in any peace talks with Ukraine as they occupy a significant part of Ukrainian territory, the BBC reported on Feb. 20. &quot;I think the Russians want to see the war end, I really do. I think they have the cards a little bit, because they&apos;ve taken a lot of territory. They have the cards,&quot; Trump told journalists on Air Force One. A U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio met top Russian officials for talks in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, marking the highest-level meeting between the two sides since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022. Ukraine was not invited to participate. No concrete decisions were announced following the U.S.-Russia talks, though both Moscow and Washington praised the meeting as constructive. Ukraine&apos;s exclusion sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe. The U.S. and Russia signaled that a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin could occur before the end of February. Speaking after the Riyadh talks, Trump voiced his belief that Russia wishes to end the war and laid the blame for the ongoing hostilities on Ukraine. He subsequently attacked President Volodymyr Zelensky as a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; while pressing the besieged country to hold a vote. Kremlin propaganda has pushed the narrative that Zelensky is an illegitimate leader, relying on the premise that his first presidential term was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. Trump&apos;s claim ignores the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-has-the-cards-in-possible-peace-talks-trump-says/	2025-02-20T01:04:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-872780694.jpg
Starmer to pitch plan on 30,000 European peacekeepers in Ukraine to Trump, Telegraph reports	U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer will present U.S. President Donald Trump with a plan to deploy up to 30,000 European troops in Ukraine backed by U.S. firepower, the Telegraph reported on Feb. 19, citing undisclosed Western officials. Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron are going to travel to the U.S. next week to discuss the prospects of peace negotiations with Trump. European leaders gathered in Paris on Feb. 17 for an emergency summit amid concerns that Washington is advancing peace talks with Moscow without Europe&#x2019;s involvement. A broader meeting was held on Feb. 19, after which Macron reaffirmed the &quot;united&quot; stance of France and its allies on Ukraine. Starmer is reportedly planning to reveal details of how European troops would be able to enforce any ceasefire brokered by Trump. According to the plan, European troops would be deployed in Ukrainian cities, ports, and other critical infrastructure such as nuclear power plants &quot;far away from the current front lines,&quot; the Telegraph wrote. The U.S. has ruled out sending its own troops while encouraging European allies to take the lead in securing Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability. The Western official claimed the mission would rely on &quot;technical monitoring,&quot; including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, as well as drones and satellites. They also added that sufficient firepower would support the mission to &quot;monitor and shoot those attacks down&quot; to reopen Ukraine&apos;s airspace and allow commercial flights. The purpose of this support is to ensure that &quot;whatever forces are deployed will not be challenged by Russia,&quot; a source told the newspaper. According to the Telegraph, Starmer will urge Trump to keep U.S. fighter jets and missiles in NATO countries in Eastern Europe ready to respond to any future Russian aggression. Apart from the U.K. and France, other countries remain cautious about sending their troops to Ukraine, citing concerns over the escalation and limited military resources, according to the Washington Post. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Kyiv had made significant progress in securing a foreign military presence on its territory. On Jan. 22, Zelensky said the number of European peacekeepers required to maintain peace in Ukraine would depend on the size of Ukraine&apos;s own military.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-pm-to-present-trump-plan-to-send-30-000-european-troops-to-ukraine-telegraph-reports/	2025-02-20T00:16:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2159996904.jpg
5 killed, 17 injured in Russian attacks on Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least five civilians and injured at least 17 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 20. Three people were killed and 10 injured in Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Russian forces dropped four guided aerial bombs on the city of Kostiantynivka on the morning of Feb. 19, killing two people and injuring eight while damaging 34 houses, the governor said. One civilian was also killed in Predtechyne, and two were injured in Pokrovsk, according to the statement. In Kharkiv Oblast, two men aged 59 were killed during Russian attacks against Kupiansk, while five other civilians were injured in the town and elsewhere in the region, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported.

Trump wants to 'resurrect' Ukraine resources deal 'or things are not gonna make (Zelensky) too happy'	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 19 that he aims to &quot;resurrect&quot; talks on the agreement for the extraction of Ukraine&apos;s rare earth minerals, CNN reported shortly after the U.S. president accused his Ukrainian counterpart of being a &quot;dictator.&quot; &quot;I think I&#x2019;m gonna resurrect that deal, you know, we&apos;ll see what happens, but I&#x2019;m gonna resurrect it, or things are gonna not make him (President Volodymyr Zelensky) too happy. And look, it&#x2019;s time for elections,&quot; Trump said, without elaborating on the consequences for Ukraine and its president if the deal is not signed. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent passed Zelensky a draft of the Ukraine-U.S. natural resources agreement during his visit to Kyiv last week. Ukraine&apos;s leader said Kyiv is not ready to sign the document as it did not include any security guarantees. &quot;There are no security guarantees,&quot; in the proposed agreement, Zelensky said during the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15, adding that signing the memorandum &quot;was not in our interest today&quot; but did not rule out the possibility of an eventual agreement with the U.S. Trump blamed Ukraine for treating Bessent &quot;rather rudely&quot; when he arrived in Kyiv to pen the memorandum. &quot;They told him no, and Zelensky was sleeping and unavailable to meet him,&quot; the U.S. president claimed. &quot;He went there to get a document signed, and when he got there, he came back empty. They wouldn&#x2019;t sign the document.&quot; Trump did not specify what the terms of the deals could be and how Ukraine could benefit from them. The U.S. is looking to obtain 50% of Ukraine&apos;s rare earth minerals, NBC reported on Feb. 15. Washington has signaled openness to deploy American troops to guard these resources if there is a deal with Russia to end the war, undisclosed American officials told the outlet. Trump said in early February that he wanted to strike a deal with Ukraine involving access to rare earth minerals in exchange for continued aid. Trump later claimed that Kyiv had &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal. The news comes shortly after Trump accused the Ukrainian president of being &quot;a dictator without elections,&quot; saying that &quot;Zelensky better move fast or he won&#x2019;t have a country left.&quot; Kremlin propaganda has pushed the narrative that Zelensky is an illegitimate leader, relying on the premise that his first presidential term was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. Trump&apos;s claim ignores the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. The comments follow Trump&apos;s increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Ukraine. Only a day before dubbing Zelensky a dictator, he accused Ukraine of starting the war while praising the U.S.-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-wants-to-resurrect-us-ukraine-rare-earths-deal-despite-kyivs-refusal/	2025-02-19T23:15:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200472620.jpg
European leaders back Zelensky after Trump's accusations	A number of European leaders on Feb. 19 reaffirmed their support for President Volodymyr Zelensky after U.S. President Donald Trump accused him of being a &quot;dictator&quot; and espousing false claims about Ukraine. &quot;Ukraine has been defending itself against Russia&apos;s merciless war of aggression for almost three years... And it is simply wrong and dangerous to deny President Zelensky&apos;s democratic legitimacy,&quot; German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on X. In his post on the Truth Social platform, Trump accused the Ukrainian president of refusing to hold elections and warned that &quot;Zelensky better move fast, or he won&#x2019;t have a country left.&quot; The U.S. president also falsely claimed that Washington had provided Ukraine with $350 billion in support and that Zelensky had an approval rating of 4%. The Ukrainian president refuted both claims earlier the same day, saying that Trump is trapped in a &quot;disinformation space.&quot; &quot;How do you organize elections with one-fifth of your territory occupied and under daily strikes across the country? Calling the president of such a country dictator requires a great deal of cynicism,&quot; Czech President Petr Pavel said. Kremlin propaganda has pushed the narrative that Zelensky is an illegitimate leader, relying on the premise that his first presidential term was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. But Trump&apos;s claim ignores the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. As a result, Zelensky&apos;s term has been extended, which constitutional lawyers argue is permitted under Ukrainian law. French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who are visiting Washington next week to discuss peace negotiations and support for Ukraine with Trump, also reiterated their support for Zelensky in phone calls. &quot;The Prime Minister (Keir Starmer) expressed his support for President Zelensky as Ukraine&#x2019;s democratically elected leader and said that it was perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during wartime as the U.K. did during World War II,&quot; the readout of Starmer&apos;s call with Zelensky said. In the wake of Trump&apos;s comments, Finnish President Alexander Stubb tried to ease the tension and warned against &quot;hysteria.&quot; &quot;Finland supports Ukraine by all possible means. Finland supports the Ukrainian constitution and the democratically elected President Volodymyr Zelensky,&quot; Stubb said. &quot;The war of aggression was started solely by Russia and (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin. Our job is to have a discussion with Trump about what the consequences are if Putin gets his way.&quot; Trump&apos;s latest comments follow his increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Ukraine. Only a day before dubbing Zelensky a &quot;dictator without elections,&quot; he accused Ukraine of starting and continuing the war while praising the U.S.-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia. Recent statements from Washington have prompted European leaders to seek a united strategy for ensuring Ukraine&apos;s continued defense. European leaders gathered in Paris on Feb. 17 for an emergency summit amid concerns that the U.S. is advancing peace talks with Russia without Europe&#x2019;s involvement. A broader meeting was held on Feb. 19, after which Macron reaffirmed the &quot;united&quot; stance of France and its allies on Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/european-leaders-back-zelensky-after-trumps-accusations/	2025-02-19T22:47:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177153600.jpg
Macron, Starmer to visit Washington next week as they reaffirm support for Ukraine in calls with Zelensky	French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer will visit Washington next week to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump, Fox News reported on Feb. 19. The three leaders will discuss peace negotiations prospects to end Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine, U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said on Fox News. He described recent talks with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia as a &quot;positive step&#x201D; and mentioned the ongoing discussions in Kyiv and at the Munich Security Conference. Waltz also urged European nations to take a more &#x201C;active role&#x201D; in ensuring Ukraine&#x2019;s security. &#x201C;We welcome Europe. We&#x2019;ve been asking for years for Europe to step up and contribute more to not only their own defense but Ukraine&#x2019;s defense,&#x201D; he said. Ahead of their trip, both leaders spoke with President Volodymyr Zelensky, who highlighted the need for strong security guarantees to ensure lasting peace in Europe. Zelensky discussed Macron&#x2019;s recent talks with world leaders and reaffirmed Ukraine&#x2019;s aligned position with France. &quot;I had a great conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron. He shared details of his recent talks with world leaders. Europe needs a reliable and lasting peace&#x2014;one that can only be ensured and built on strong security guarantees. France values freedom just as much as we do. Thank you for your support,&quot; Zelensky wrote on X. In a separate conversation, the Ukrainian president emphasized the U.K.&#x2019;s crucial role in strengthening European security, expressing gratitude for London&apos;s continued support. &quot;I spoke with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The United Kingdom&#x2019;s role in fortifying Europe&#x2019;s defense and security is important for us. We discussed upcoming plans and opportunities. The U.K.&#x2019;s support matters indeed, and we will never forget the respect the British people have shown for Ukraine and our citizens,&quot; Zelensky wrote. European leaders gathered in Paris on Feb. 17 for an emergency summit amid concerns that the U.S. is advancing peace talks with Russia without Europe&#x2019;s involvement. A broader meeting was held on Feb. 19, after which Macron reaffirmed the &quot;united&quot; stance of France and its allies on Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-and-starmer-to-visit-washington-next-week-as-both-leaders-reaffirm-support-for-ukraine-in-calls-with-zelensky/	2025-02-19T22:10:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2168217153.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 863,580 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 863,580 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 20. This number includes 1,190 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,134 tanks, 21,112 armored fighting vehicles, 37,961 vehicles and fuel tanks, 23,410 artillery systems, 1,291 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,078 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 26,021 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-862-390-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-02-19T22:07:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1248375324-1.jpg
Sanctions remain vital for maintaining international pressure on Russia, Deputy PM says	Sanctions against Russia remain a key tool of international pressure, Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said on Feb. 19. &quot;The majority of sanctions, including almost all sovereign assets of the Russian Federation, are frozen specifically in the territory and jurisdictions of the European Union. Therefore, this is precisely the moment when we understand that this is not a reversible issue,&quot; she said to RBC-Ukraine at the opening of the Ukraine&apos;s Path to the EU in Illustrations, Posters, and Artworks exhibition. Stefanishyna noted that Russia raising the issue of sanctions was unsurprising, as it had used similar leverage during negotiations over the Black Sea grain corridor agreement. She expressed uncertainty regarding the position of the U.S. and its next steps, but appeared confident in the EU&#x2019;s commitment to upholding sanctions. &quot;I am confident regarding the European Union. But, in principle, if we take into account the official statements of the US, particularly after the so-called consultations that took place (between the US and Russia), they did not appear radical,&quot; she said. EU envoys approved the 16th package of sanctions against Russia on Feb. 19, and the measures are set to be officially endorsed by EU ministers on Feb. 24, the third anniversary of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The newest sanctions package will target aluminum imports and the &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of oil tankers, referring to aging and poorly insured ships Russia uses to avoid sanctions on the oil trade.	https://kyivindependent.com/sanctions-remain-vital-for-maintaining-international-pressure-on-russia-deputy-pm-says/	2025-02-19T20:27:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2150526931.jpg
Russian court issues first prison sentence under ‘LGBT extremism’ law	A district court in Kemerovo Oblast has issued Russia&#x2019;s first prison sentence under the country&#x2019;s ban on the so-called &#x201C;international LGBT movement,&#x201D; independent Russian outlet Mediazona reported on Feb. 19. The individual, who had been serving a prior prison sentence, was convicted of &#x201C;LGBT extremism&#x201D; and sentenced to six years in a maximum-security facility, with their total sentence adjusted to 15 years. Authorities accused them of &#x201C;involving&#x201D; Russian citizens in the banned &#x201C;international LGBT movement&#x201D; while serving their time. The court&apos;s ruling is the first prison sentence issued under this law, but on Jan. 29, a court in Nizhny Novgorod sentenced a woman to serve five days in administrative detention under this legislation for the crime of wearing frog-shaped earrings that displayed the image of a rainbow. Then, on Feb. 1, a court in Volgograd Oblast found a defendant known as Artyom P. guilty after he posted a picture of an LBGT flag online and ordered him to pay a fine of 1,000 rubles ($11.05). In November 2023, the Russian Supreme Court&apos;s decision to label the &quot;international LGBT movement&quot; as &quot;extremist&quot; has starkly intensified the challenges faced by the LGBTQ+ community in general within the country. This ruling, emerging from a lawsuit by the Justice Ministry accusing the LGBT movement of inciting social and religious discord, has effectively jeopardized all forms of LGBTQ+ rights activism and expression in Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-court-issues-first-prison-sentence-under-lgbt-extremism-law/	2025-02-19T18:21:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-831141052.jpg
Belarus exports rapeseed oil from occupied Ukrainian territories to EU, RFE/RL investigation finds	The Belarusian company Agroproduct has been using raw materials from Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine&#x2019;s southern Kherson Oblast to produce rapeseed oil, which it then exported to the European Union. An investigation by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s (RFE/RL) Schemes&apos; in collaboration with journalists from Lithuania, Latvia, and Belarus, uncovered the supply chain that bypasses existing trade restrictions. Despite a mid-2024 ban on Belarusian food imports, including rapeseed oil, one of the key destinations for Agroproduct&#x2019;s shipments is Lithuania. Data from Russia&#x2019;s state information system Zerno shows that in 2023, Belarus imported nearly 5,000 tons of rapeseed from occupied Kherson, with five companies, including Agroproduct, receiving these shipments. According to Eurostat, EU nations purchased over 90,000 tons of rapeseed oil from Belarus in the first half of 2024, amounting to approximately &#x20AC;67 million. Alongside Lithuania, Latvia has also been identified as a key buyer. The Belarusian opposition group &quot;Community of Railway Workers of Belarus&quot; claims that around 50,000 tons of rapeseed oil exported to these countries last year came solely from Agroproduct. Agroproduct has not been subjected to either European or Ukrainian sanctions. This means the company can not only sell oil to the EU but also purchase rapeseed from European and Ukrainian farmers. Latvian and Lithuanian logistics firms confirmed their cooperation with Agroproduct during conversations with journalists, further linking the company to the illicit trade. Investigators also discovered connections between Agroproduct and the Belarusian government. The company&#x2019;s director, Oleg Teslyuk, has openly boasted about his ties to state authorities but refused to comment on whether the rapeseed used in production was sourced from occupied Ukrainian territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-exports-rapeseed-oil-from-occupied-kherson-to-eu-rfe-rl-investigation-finds/	2025-02-19T15:24:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2151234308.jpg
Oil prices near one-week high amid Russia supply disruptions, sanctions uncertainty	Oil prices remained near a one-week high on Feb. 19 as concerns over supply disruptions in Russia and the U.S. continued to drive the market. Traders are also closely watching developments on potential sanctions relief, as Washington attempts to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. Brent crude settled at $76.04 per barrel, up 20 cents (0.3%), while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude closed at $72.25, gaining 40 cents (0.6%), according to Reuters. Both benchmarks reached their highest level since Feb. 11. Market analysts are weighing several key factors affecting crude prices, including geopolitical risks in Russia, Iran, and OPEC&apos;s supply strategy. Supply concerns were heightened after a Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian oil facility led to a 30-40% reduction in Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) oil flows, which translates to a potential market supply loss of 380,000 barrels per day. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed the attack might have been coordinated with Ukraine&#x2019;s Western allies. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky as &quot;a dictator,&quot; accusing him of refusing to have elections, and repeating false claims about the war in Ukraine. Despite speculation about a U.S.-brokered agreement between Russia and Ukraine, analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that lifting sanctions on Russia is unlikely to significantly boost oil flows, according to Reuters. They argue that Russian crude output is currently limited by its OPEC+ production target of nine million barrels per day, rather than by Western sanctions, which impact where Russian oil is sold rather than total export volumes.	https://kyivindependent.com/oil-prices-near-one-week-high-amid-russia-supply-disruptions-sanctions-uncertainty/	2025-02-19T13:39:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1229695804.jpg
A beginner's guide to elections in Ukraine (also suitable for US presidents)	U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 19 launched an astonishing attack on President Volodymyr Zelensky, calling him a &quot;dictator&quot; with a &quot;very low&quot; approval rating that refuses to hold elections in Ukraine. The comments came a day after similar remarks made at the White House, in which Trump falsely claimed Zelensky had a &quot;4% approval rating,&quot; and suggested Ukraine should hold elections despite Russia&apos;s ongoing war in the country. Speaking a few hours after U.S. and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia for the first time since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago, Trump also falsely accused Ukraine of starting the war, and said Moscow wants &quot;to do something&quot; to &quot;stop the savage barbarianism.&quot; The talks in Saudi Arabia were conducted without Ukraine, prompting Zelensky to reiterate on Feb. 18 &#xA0;that &quot;you can&apos;t make a decision on how to end the war in Ukraine without Ukraine.&quot; &quot;They want a seat at the table, but you could say ... wouldn&#x2019;t the people of Ukraine have a say,&quot; Trump said on Feb. 18, adding: &quot;It&#x2019;s been a long time since we&#x2019;ve had an election.&quot; &quot;That&#x2019;s not a Russian thing, that&#x2019;s something coming from me, from other countries,&quot; he insisted. Russia does. In comments made while the talks in Saudi Arabia were underway, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin is ready for talks with Zelensky, but &quot;legal aspects related to his legitimacy&quot; must be considered. It&apos;s far from the first time that Moscow officials have questioned the legitimacy of Zelensky, which has been a line of attack for almost a year now. A vendor stands by traditional Russian Matryoshka dolls featuring Russian leaders at a gift shop in Moscow, Russia, on March 11, 2024. (Alexander Nemenov / AFP via Getty Images)The false claim is based on the premise that Zelensky&apos;s first term in office was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. But Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and the subsequent declaration of martial law in Ukraine has meant elections have been impossible to hold and his term has been extended, something constitutional lawyers say is allowed under Ukrainian law. Russia has widely repeated the claim in an attempt to &#xA0;discredit the Ukrainian government, but what&apos;s different this time around is the U.S. President appears happy to go along with it. According to Trump, there&apos;s something akin to a constitutional crisis in Ukraine right now, with the country being run by a hugely unpopular &quot;dictator.&quot; &quot;We have a situation where we haven&#x2019;t had elections in Ukraine, where we have essentially martial law in Ukraine, where the leader in Ukraine &#x2014; I mean, I hate to say it, but he&#x2019;s down at 4% approval rating,&quot; he said on Feb. 18. Trump&apos;s comments contain two notable inaccuracies. Firstly, Ukraine is under actual martial law due to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. As mentioned above, Ukrainian law requires the suspension of elections which can only be lifted once the war is over. Crucially, the terms of any peace deal &#x2014; which the U.S. and Russia are currently discussing without Ukraine &#x2014; will be essential for creating conditions under which elections can be held. Fedir Venislavskyi, a member of parliament&#x2019;s Defense Committee and of President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s ruling party, said on Feb. 17 that he &#x201C;does not think martial law can be lifted&#x201D; on just the basis of a ceasefire without &#x201C;the threats going away.&#x201D; A ceasefire &quot;does not mean that Russia has withdrawn its troops from occupied territories or its means of attack that can strike Ukraine,&quot; Venislavskyi said. &quot;Given Putin&#x2019;s mental state, I think we can expect any possible developments. Therefore, without guarantees that this will lead to a lasting peace, I do not think martial law can be lifted,&quot; he added. Secondly, it&apos;s not clear where Trump got his information about Zelensky&apos;s &quot;4% approval rating,&quot; a wildly inaccurate figure. A survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published on Feb. 19 found around 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky as of February, marking an increase of five percentage points since December. The poll was carried out on Feb. 4-9, according to the pollster, but was published on the day after Trump&#x2019;s claims. According to the latest poll from Reuters published Feb. 19, Trump&apos;s own approval rating currently stands at 44%. According to latest poll from the Levada Center, a Russian independent polling organization, Putin&apos;s approval in January was 87%, though Russia is a country where standing at an anti-war rally with a blank piece of paper can land one in jail, and has a leader who has been in power for 24 years, longer than many infamous dictators. Zelensky himself on Feb. 19 did not hold back when he stated where he believed Trump had got the 4% figure from. &quot;We saw this disinformation. We understand it comes from Russia,&quot; he said during a press conference in Kyiv. https://kyivindependent.com/british-volunteer-who-lost-arm-and-leg-evacuating-ukrainian-civilians-russia-is-the-enemy-how-can-you-not-see-it/ When Ukraine eventually does hold elections, it is expected to face multiple challenges to make a vote safe, equal, uninterrupted, and provide a secret ballot, as is required by Ukrainian law. Russia&apos;s constant targeting of Ukrainian population centers across the country in bomb, missile and drone attacks, makes providing a &quot;safe&quot; voting experience impossible while the war is ongoing, not to mention the challenge of arranging voting facilities for soldiers serving on the front lines. Demobilization is possible only after the end of martial law. Olha Aivazovska, head of the election watchdog Opora, said this process should begin at the stage of signing a peace agreement and its ratification. &quot;Then martial law is lifted and a fully-fledged, democratic, transparent electoral process begins,&quot; she told the Kyiv Independent. If the war ends and martial law is lifted, Ukraine&apos;s Central Election Commission (CEC) will announce the start of the election campaign. According to Ukrainian law, starting from that moment, 90 days should pass before presidential elections are to be held, 54 to 60 days before the parliamentary elections, and 50 days before local elections. A man casts his ballot at a polling station during the parliamentary elections in Kyiv, Ukraine, on July 21, 2019 (Sergii Kharchenko / NurPhoto via Getty Images)However, preparations for the post-war elections are expected to take even longer due to extraordinary circumstances caused by Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. According to United Nations (UN) figures, over 6 million Ukrainians left the country as a result of Russia&apos;s war and are currently abroad. &#xA0;Another 3.6 million are internally displaced. With around 18% of Ukraine&apos;s territories occupied by Russia, &quot;millions more&quot; remain in the Russian-occupied territories, according to Zelensky. Another problem is the locations where a vote will be held. Electoral infrastructure, such as schools, has been destroyed in many areas of Ukraine-controlled territory due to Russian attacks. Aivazovska said that it could take up to a year to restore the electoral infrastructure and adopt a separate law to hold the post-war elections following the ceasefire. Any list of potential candidates is purely speculative at this stage, but several well-known politicians, military officers, and volunteers could realistically be in the running. While on the campaign trail, Zelenksy promised to be a one-term president. But when asked during recent interviews whether he is planning to run for another five years in the office, he did not rule out this possibility. &quot;It depends on how this war ends. Basically, it depends on people first and foremost, and of course on my family,&quot; he told American podcaster Lex Friedman last month. Former Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi has never announced the launch of a political career and dodged questions about a possible presidential run. Yet some experts see him as a potential main opponent to Zelensky. Last February, he topped a Ukrainian poll with a trust rating of 94%, higher than Zelensky. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, former Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and now Ambassador of Ukraine to the United Kingdomin Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 5, 2025. (Sergei Supinsky/AFP/Getty Images)Appointed commander-in-chief in the summer of 2021, Zaluzhnyi gained popularity among both the military and the broader population due to his role in leading the military resistance against Russia. He was dismissed in February 2024 following months of speculation about a rift in Ukraine&apos;s leadership. Soon after, the president appointed Zaluzhnyi as Ukraine&apos;s ambassador to the U.K. The leader of the Batkivshchyna party is a veteran politician who appears to have started preparing for the elections. Tymoshenko served twice as Ukraine&#x2019;s prime minister. In 2011, she was jailed by her main political opponent, pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. She was freed three years later after Yanukovych was ousted by the EuroMaidan Revolution.

(Emin Sansar/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)She has been re-elected to parliament twice since then. Labeled as a populist, Tymoshenko used to oppose such notable steps for Ukraine as land sale reform or the legalization of medical cannabis. Poroshenko launched his political career in the 1990s. He was a prominent figure during the two Ukrainian revolutions in 2004 and 2014. He held a number of top positions in Ukraine&#x2019;s government, including economy minister under Yanukovych&apos;s rule. After Yanukovych&apos;s overthrow, Poroshenko was elected Ukraine&#x2019;s fifth president. He served one term from 2014 until 2019, facing Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Crimea and Donbas. Poroshenko pushed for Ukraine&#x2019;s membership in the European Union and NATO, however, his tenure was marred by corruption scandals.

(Andreea Campeanu/Getty Images)For years, the ex-president was listed among the wealthiest people in Ukraine owning the Roshen confectionery and a number of other businesses. In 2019, he transferred his business assets to his son Oleksiy Poroshenko. Zelensky dealt a decisive defeat to Poroshenko in the 2019 election, but the rivalry between the two continued. Shortly before the full-scale invasion, in December 2021, the former president was charged with high treason for what the prosecution said was aiding Russian-controlled militants in the occupied parts of Donetsk Oblast. This month, Zelensky imposed indefinite sanctions on Poroshenko, freezing all his assets. The charges of treason were cited as one of the official reasons for this move. Poroshenko has denied wrongdoing. Boyko, a parliamentary member since 2007 and former deputy prime minister under Yanukovych, has a long history in Moscow-aligned political factions. His joint political project with Viktor Medvedchuk, a former pro-Russian lawmaker accused of high treason, Opposition Platform &#x2014; For Life, secured second place in the 2019 parliamentary elections. The party was banned in 2022 soon after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Lawmaker Yuriy Boyko talks to the press after the morning extraordinary session of Ukraine&apos;s parliament in Kyiv, Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. (Yevhenii Zavhorodnii/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Boyko advocated for Ukraine&apos;s &quot;neutrality and non-alignment&quot; and for granting the Russian language the status of the state language, proposals that echo Putin&apos;s ultimatums. As the all-out war progressed, the politician tried to rebrand himself, but in December 2024 he posted a TikTok video repeating long-standing Russian propaganda points. This was met with public outrage and sparked speculations that he is doing groundwork for the post-war presidential and parliamentary run. Despite being embroiled in a number of high-profile corruption probes, Boyko was never charged. A former world boxing champion, Vitalii Klitschko, launched his political career in the 2000s.

(Oleksii Samsonov/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)In 2014, Klitschko became mayor of Kyiv and has since been re-elected twice. Despite his popularity abroad, he faces criticism in Ukraine for his handling of the capital. Klitschko has had a long-standing conflict with Zelensky. He claims ongoing pressure from government authorities. Before the full-scale war, some reports in Ukrainian media alleged that his younger brother Wladimir Klitschko, also a former boxing star, could follow his brother&#x2019;s footsteps and enter politics. When asked about it in 2021, he neither confirmed nor denied it. Longtime TV presenter and comedian Serhii Prytula entered politics in 2019, joining the newly created Holos party led by Ukrainian rockstar Sviatoslav Vakarchuk. Prytula ran for parliament and mayor of Kyiv but failed to succeed. Due to party infighting, he left Holos in 2021. Shortly before Russia began its full-scale war, Prytula announced plans to launch his own party, which failed to materialize.

Over almost three years of full-scale war, his charity, one of the largest in Ukraine, has raised more than Hr 7 billion ($168 million) for the army, he said. Budanov was appointed as the military intelligence (HUR) head in August 2020, becoming the youngest spy chief in Ukraine&#x2019;s history. The spy chief became a household name in Ukraine amid Russia&#x2019;s war, while his agency is seen as one of the most competent institutions in the country, conducting multiple operations within Russia and the Ukrainian territories.

The spy chief evaded answering questions about a potential political career.	https://kyivindependent.com/a-beginners-guide-to-elections-in-ukraine-also-suitable-for-us-presidents/	2025-02-19T12:36:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1138462758.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Trump calls Zelensky 'dictator,' warns of Ukraine's demise without elections	Key developments on Feb. 19: U.S. President Donald Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; in a post on his social media platform Truth Social, accusing him of refusing to have elections, and repeating false claims about the war in Ukraine. &quot;He refuses to have elections, is very low in Ukrainian polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing (former U.S. President Joe) Biden &apos;like a fiddle,&apos;&quot; Trump wrote. A Feb. 19 poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) showed that 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky, a five-point increase since December. Trump also called the Ukrainian president &quot;a dictator without elections,&quot; saying that &quot;Zelensky better move fast, or he won&#x2019;t have a country left.&quot; Kremlin propaganda has pushed the narrative that Zelensky is an illegitimate leader, relying on the premise that his first presidential term was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. But Trump&apos;s claim ignores the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. As a result, Zelensky&apos;s term has been extended, which constitutional lawyers argue is permitted under Ukrainian law. Trump also referred to Zelensky as a &quot;modestly successful comedian&quot; and accused him of persuading the U.S. to spend $350 billion on Ukraine. &quot;The United States has spent $200 billion more than Europe, and Europe&apos;s money is guaranteed, while the U.S. will get nothing back,&quot; the U.S. president claimed. Trump has repeatedly made unsubstantiated and contradicting claims about the value of assistance the U.S. has provided to Ukraine, most recently putting the figure at $350 billion. Trump earlier said that he wanted the U.S. to be paid back for its assistance to Kyiv with a deal for Ukraine&apos;s natural resources. The U.S. president claimed the deal would be worth $500 billion, and that Kyiv had &quot;essentially agreed to it.&quot; It was unclear where the $500 billion figure had come from. Earlier on Feb. 19, Zelensky said Ukraine&apos;s wartime military costs had totaled $320 billion, with the U.S. and EU combined providing $200 billion of that sum in defense support. &quot;We, the people of Ukraine, (covered) $120 billion, the U.S. and the EU &#x2014; $200 billion. We are talking about arms; this is a weapons package worth $320 billion,&quot; Zelensky said in Kyiv. Trump&apos;s remarks follow his Feb. 18 statement that Ukraine &quot;should hold new elections,&quot; appearing to blame Zelensky&apos;s leadership for the ongoing war. He also claimed, without evidence, that Ukraine should hold elections due to Zelensky&#x2019;s supposed &quot;4% approval rating.&quot; In response, Zelensky addressed the statements, calling them disinformation and saying they had come from Russia. &quot;We understand it comes from Russia. We understand, and we have evidence that those figures have been discussed between the U.S. and Russia.&quot; His comments come amid growing concerns in Kyiv after U.S. and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia &#x2014; without Ukraine &#x2014; to discuss strategies for ending the war. In reference to the Saudi Arabia talks, Zelensky said that the U.S. has effectively helped Russian President Vladimir Putin escape years of isolation. Drones attacked the Syzran Oil Refinery in Russia&apos;s Samara Oblast overnight on Feb. 19, Governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev reported on his Telegram channel. Residents posted videos on social media purportedly showing a large blaze at the refinery. Sounds of explosions were reported at around 2:45 a.m. local time. The strike reportedly caused a fire at the refinery. There were no casualties, according to Fedorishchev. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. The Syzran Oil Refinery, lying around 700 kilometers (430 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border, was opened in 1942 and belongs to the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft. The facility &quot;has a processing capacity of 8.9 million tons of oil per year,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation. &quot;Its products include fuel, aviation kerosene, and bitumen,&quot; Kovalenko said while reporting on the attack. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones. In less than two months of 2025, at least 17 Russian oil facilities were attacked by drones, according to the independent Russian Telegram news channel Astra. On Feb. 17, Ukrainian drones, operated by the Special Operations Forces and Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), hit the Ilsky Oil Refinery in Krasnodar Krai and the Kropotkinskaya oil pumping station in the Kavkazsky district of Kuban. The pumping station was taken out of operation due to the strike. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff refuted claims by President Vladimir Putin that Russian troops had launched an offensive into Ukraine from Kursk Oblast, spokesperson Dmytro Lykhovyi said on Feb. 19. Putin told Russian media on Feb. 18 that Russian forces had crossed into Ukrainian territory from Kursk Oblast, a claim Lykhovyi has dismissed as part of a disinformation campaign. &quot;Since the beginning of the day, 12 combat engagements have been recorded in Kursk Oblast, three of which are still ongoing, while the rest have been repelled,&quot; Lykhovyi said. During one of the attacks, Russian troops attempted to advance toward Ukraine&apos;s state border, according to Lykhovyi. Map showing Ukrainian-controlled territory in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast as of Feb. 19, 2025, with captured areas marked in blue. (DeepState/OpenStreetMap)Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially capturing about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukrainian forces have lost roughly half of that area, they recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in a new offensive. Over six months of fighting in the region, Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000 personnel, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. Another 909 have been taken as prisoners of war. Ukraine is likely looking to use its foothold in Kursk Oblast as leverage in potential peace talks. Russia&apos;s forces in Kursk Oblast have been bolstered by North Korean troops, deployed last fall to help counter the Ukrainian incursion. President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that the offensive disrupted Russia&apos;s ability to carry out large-scale operations in northeastern and southern Ukraine. North Korean security services are telling their troops stationed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast that they are fighting against both the Ukrainian and South Korean militaries, South Korean newspaper Chosun Daily reported, citing captured North Korean soldiers. Two North Korean prisoners of war, captured by Ukrainian forces last month, spoke exclusively to Chosun Daily at a prisoner-of-war (POW) camp in Ukraine. One of the captives admitted that he and his fellow soldiers believed they were fighting South Korean troops, which heightened their morale and aggression. Each battalion, consisting of about 500 soldiers, was monitored by one or two officers from North Korea&apos;s State Security Ministry, one of the prisoners said. These officers oversaw ideological training and discipline. They reportedly informed their soldiers that Ukrainian drone operators were South Korean military personnel. Seoul has not provided military aid to Kyiv since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in August 2024. Their journey to Russia took several months, with a group of 2,500 North Koreans departing on Oct. 10, 2024, traveling by train, then by plane, and finally by bus to Kursk, where they arrived in mid-December, according to one of the captives. The other captured soldier, a sniper trained for reconnaissance, said contact between North Korean troops and Russian forces was minimal, with interaction mainly occurring at the command level for ammunition, supplies, and equipment. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously reported that North Korean forces fighting for Russia had suffered 4,000 casualties, with two-thirds of the losses being soldiers killed. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, attributed the high losses to North Korea&apos;s lack of combat experience and its use of human wave attacks with limited equipment. Ukraine&apos;s cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024 initially seized 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukrainian forces have since lost roughly half that area due to Russian counterattacks, they recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in a renewed offensive. EU ambassadors agreed on a new package of sanctions against Russia, targeting aluminum imports and the &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of oil tankers, Euronews reported on Feb. 19. &quot;I welcome the agreement on our 16th package of sanctions,&quot; European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on X. &quot;The EU is clamping down even harder on circumvention by targeting more vessels in Putin&#x2019;s shadow fleet and imposing new import and export bans.&quot; The EU has already adopted sanctions against some Russian aluminum products, with the latest measures also targeting primary aluminum. Russia represents around 6% of the EU&apos;s imports of the metal. The &quot;shadow fleet&quot; denotes a flotilla of aging and poorly insured ships Russia uses to avoid sanctions on the oil trade. The West believes the vessels are used for other illicit activities, including espionage and sabotage. The aluminum ban will be &quot;phased in,&quot; while the package will also target 13 banks and other entities and individuals seen as helping Russia wage its full-scale war, the Financial Times reported. EU Economy and Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis commented that Brussels must take greater control of its sanctions policy against Russia as U.S. priorities shift. The EU approved its 15th sanctions package against Moscow on Dec. 16. The package targeted 54 individuals and 30 organizations from Russia, China, and North Korea, as well as shipping companies facilitating Russia&apos;s crude oil sales. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio assured European allies that the U.S. would maintain sanctions against Moscow at least until an agreement is reached to end the Russia-Ukraine war, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 19, citing its undisclosed sources. In the nearly three years since the full-scale invasion, the U.S. has implemented several rounds of sanctions on Russia to undermine its efforts to continue its war in Ukraine. Restrictions have been imposed on banks, the gas and oil industries, and the delivery of dual-use goods, among other spheres. Following talks between the U.S. and Russian delegations in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, Rubio suggested that lifting sanctions against Russia would be part of any peace process, saying that &quot;concessions&quot; would have to be made by &quot;all sides&quot; to bring an end to &quot;any conflict.&quot; Rubio added that the EU would &quot;have to be at the table at some point because they have sanctions as well that have been imposed.&quot; According to Bloomberg, Rubio subsequently assured European colleagues in a phone call that the sanctions would not be lifted at least until a settlement could be reached. The State Department&apos;s readout on Rubio&apos;s call with European allies does not mention any sanctions but says that the countries &quot;agreed to remain in close contact&quot; as they work to achieve &quot;a durable end to the conflict in Ukraine.&quot; The role of European nations in the negotiations with Russia remains unclear. Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, previously said that Europe would not be directly involved in the talks but assured that its interests would be considered. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Feb. 19 that he had been briefed on the outcome of U.S.-Russian talks in Riyadh, expressing willingness to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump. &quot;Yes, I&apos;ve been reported. I rate them highly. There is a result,&quot; Putin told Russian media. He added that he would &quot;gladly&quot; meet with Trump but stressed that such a meeting must be carefully prepared. Putin emphasized that he seeks more than just a symbolic meeting, saying key issues, particularly the war in Ukraine, must be &quot;worked out&quot; in advance. The Russian president also confirmed that Trump had told him Ukraine would be included in any negotiation process. &quot;President Trump told me during a telephone conversation, I can confirm that, of course, the United States assumes that the negotiation process will take place with the participation of Russia and Ukraine,&quot; he said. Putin&apos;s remarks come after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio led a delegation to Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 for direct talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and other officials. The meeting marked the first face-to-face negotiations between the U.S. and Russia since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion began. In response to the talks, President Volodymyr Zelensky postponed a planned visit to Saudi Arabia, expressing concerns over Ukraine&apos;s exclusion. While no concrete decisions were announced, the U.S.-Russia meeting has raised alarms in Kyiv and Europe, where officials worry about being sidelined in the negotiation process. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda outlined a six-point action plan on Feb. 19 to support Ukraine and bolster European security as the U.S. sidelines Europe in talks with Russia to end the war, and concerns grow that negotiations could lead to a deal unfavorable to Kyiv. &quot;We must act now to support Ukraine and boost Europe&apos;s security. No more talk shops &#x2014; time for action,&quot; Nauseda wrote on X. His proposal includes security guarantees for Ukraine, emphasizing that &quot;NATO membership should remain on the table.&quot; He also called for immediate funding for arms and a 10-billion-euro ($10.4 billion) investment in Ukraine&apos;s defense industry. Nauseda stressed that Russia must be held accountable for war crimes, and sanctions should remain in place until its aggression ends, frozen assets are seized, and tariffs on Russian and Belarusian imports are implemented. Over $300 billion of Russian central bank reserves remain frozen in Europe, including 191 billion euros ($198 billion) held in the Euroclear depository in Belgium. The Lithuanian president also proposed accelerating Ukraine&apos;s EU accession, setting 2030 as the target date. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s security is part of European security,&quot; he wrote. Neither Ukraine nor Europe was invited to talks between U.S. and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. The move has set off alarm bells that the U.S. and Russia could reach an agreement on the war without Ukraine or Europe&apos;s involvement, and one that would put their future security in jeopardy. The future of U.S. assistance for Ukraine under President Donald Trump&apos;s administration is also uncertain. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Feb. 12 also suggested that Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership is not a &quot;realistic outcome&quot; of ongoing negotiations and that Ukraine may not be able to fully restore its 2014 borders. Ukraine has maintained that firm security guarantees &#x2014; including NATO membership &#x2014; are necessary to prevent Russia from rebuilding its military and potentially launching a new invasion if hostilities were to pause. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously called NATO membership the &quot;cheapest&quot; security guarantee and a geopolitical victory for U.S. President Donald Trump.

Ukrainians react to Trump’s shocking accusation about the war	U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s latest comments about Ukraine are raising eyebrows &#x2014; and spreading misinformation. He claimed that Ukraine was the one who started Russia&apos;s war, said that Ukraine had been &#x201C;blown to smithereens,&#x201D; and claimed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has a 4% approval rating &#x2014; none of which has a factual basis. How do actual Ukrainians feel about Trump&#x2019;s words? The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Masha Lavrova hit the streets of Kyiv to hear their raw, unfiltered reactions.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-react-to-trumps-shocking-accusation-about-the-war/	2025-02-19T11:43:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/telegram-cloud-document-2-5310274466440308620.jpg
British volunteer who lost arm and leg evacuating Ukrainian civilians: ‘Russia is the enemy. How can you not see it?’	It could have been a tragic story costing British volunteer Edward Scott his life. As a humanitarian aid worker with the Ukrainian NGO &quot;Baza&quot; (the &quot;Base&quot; in Ukrainian), 28-year-old Scott has made multiple trips to the front-line areas to evacuate civilian Ukrainians. But the mission on Jan. 30 to the embattled city of Pokrovsk in southern Donetsk Oblast was different. A Russian drone targeted the vehicle of Scott&#x2019;s crew &#x2013; though it was marked with a bright sign reading &quot;evacuation.&quot; The car was carrying two civilians and two volunteers. The driver&apos;s seat &#x2014; where Scott had been sitting &#x2013; was hit hardest, leaving him severely injured. As Russian forces continue to rapidly advance in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian government and volunteers have intensified efforts to evacuate civilians from front-line towns in Donetsk Oblast. With Russian forces just mere kilometers away, Pokrovsk remains under constant artillery and drone attacks, making evacuation missions a high-risk endeavor. &#x201C;(There was) massive explosion. I see this fireball, and the car is knocked out of gear,&quot; Scott recalls the moment of impact. &quot;I&apos;m trying to force it in gear, but my foot is not working, and at the same time, I&apos;m trying to turn the wheel, and I can feel my shoulder turning, but I can see my arm on the wheel, not turning, so I&apos;m like &apos;This is bad.&apos;&quot; &quot;And then the pain hits me, and I start screaming.&quot; What happened next was a brilliant coordination of actions that saved Scott&apos;s life. Seconds after the attack, his mission partner, Pylyp Rozhdestvenskyi, was applying tourniquets to his shredded arm and leg to stop the bleeding. Minutes later, Scott was already in a military car on his way to the neighboring hospital for medical assistance. There, he received a transfusion of about four liters of blood, but severe injuries resulted in amputations of his left arm and leg. Weeks after the brutal attack, with multiple surgeries behind him and more still ahead, Scott, now undergoing treatment at a Kyiv hospital, thinks about how he can continue helping Ukraine &#x2014; the country he now calls home. &quot;I want to primarily help Ukrainians but also show the world that we are fighting people who will happily commit war crimes at the drop of a hat,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent from his hospital bed. Scott paid his first visit to Ukraine in October 2022. By the time Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war began in February that year, he was already becoming more &quot;politically engaged&quot; and &quot;disillusioned&quot; with his former life as a sailor. &quot;It was a fantastic job,&quot; he says. &quot;I had amazing adventures and sailed across the Atlantic nine times. I&apos;ve been to beautiful places. But at the end of the day, I wasn&apos;t helping anyone.&quot; As he was following the U.K. soldiers fighting in Ukraine and humanitarian workers operating there on social media, Scott began to think: &quot;Maybe I can do that.&quot; &quot;So I bought a pickup truck and just drove to Ukraine,&quot; he recalls. &quot;My plan was to come here for three months, to make a difference, to donate a truck at the end of it, and go back to boats.&quot; Edward Scott (L) during his volunteering in Ukraine. (Courtesy)&quot;But very early on, I thought: &apos;No, this is the place to be.&apos;&quot; Since then, Scott has visited some of Ukraine&apos;s hardest-hit areas, including the now-destroyed and occupied city of Bakhmut, delivering various equipment and humanitarian aid. He also supported Ukrainians by helping repair the roofs of their homes alongside other volunteers from the Base NGO. The more he traveled through Ukraine meeting its people, the deeper his appreciation for the country and its culture has become. One of his warmest memories was when an elderly woman gave the volunteers the best homemade meal and care after they helped with repairs at her home. &quot;I met amazing people here,&quot; Scott says, adding that he even became a godfather to the daughter of one of his Ukrainian friends. &quot;I have a family here now.&quot; In December, as intense battles unfolded in the Pokrovsk area, Scott was called to assist with the civilian evacuation effort there. He had just started his second two-week rotation there when he noticed that &quot;things had deteriorated massively.&quot; &quot;(When we started) we could still drive through Pokrovsk, it was kind of okay,&quot; Scott says. &quot;We evacuated people from the last apartment block in the south (of the city).&quot; Edward Scott (L) evacuating a civilian in Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on Dec. 27, 2024. (Madison Tuff)Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on Jan. 19, 2025. (Madison Tuff)&quot;But suddenly, we could no longer go south.&quot; Scott says that each time they entered the area, they could either see Russian drones on the ground or hear them in the air. &quot;The last few days before the hit there were a lot of them.&quot; &quot;We were very aware that it&apos;s very dangerous and we thought we were protecting ourselves by being as civilian as possible, showing that we are not a target. But we got hit as well,&quot; he says. Scott and Rozhdestvenskyi, 31, left their base in the city of Kramatorsk at around 8:20 a.m., heading to Pokrovsk to evacuate a woman whose husband was hit by a Russian drone in his car just a day before. When they found out the woman had fled with another crew, the two started looking for other locals who needed assistance. They ended up evacuating three people in their first drive and returned to pick up two more. According to Rozhdestvenskyi, the road they took was in &quot;quite bad condition,&quot; so the team had to drive relatively slowly. That was when the drone hit their car. &quot;I wasn&apos;t in shock because I had a similar situation two months ago, and I more or less understood what had happened. But this time, the explosion was more powerful than the previous one,&quot; Rozhdestvenskyi says. &quot;Looking at the pictures of the van now, I realize that they didn&apos;t just target the van; they targeted me. They targeted the driver,&quot; Scott says. He was the only one severely injured. A heavily damaged evacuation vehicle is seen with parts of its structure torn apart, in an unspecified location in Ukraine.(Screenshot)When he saw that their car no longer had a roof, Rozhdestvenskyi realized that if there was a second drone attack to follow, they wouldn&apos;t survive. He decided to act immediately. He got out of the car and applied tourniquets on the shredded arm and leg of his mission partner. &quot;I wasn&apos;t sure the tourniquet would work because there were just bones in front of my eyes,&quot; Rozhdestvenskyi says. As he was providing first aid, Rozhdestvenskyi spotted a military vehicle and shouted to the soldier asking for help. He grabbed Scott under his arms, pulled him out of the car, and carried him to the military pickup bed. Scott says he was conscious and remembers the ride. &quot;I could feel myself lying in the back of the truck, and the roads were terrible, so we were obviously moving pretty fast. I was being jostled around with horrific levels of pain,&quot; Scott says. &quot;I remember the weight of my arm on my chest. I was holding my wrist because my arm kept on falling off my chest.&quot; They quickly reached a small medical point nearby, where paramedics and a casevac were already waiting for them to head to the hospital. Rozhdestvenskyi says it took them around 40 minutes from the moment of the attack to reach a hospital in nearby Dobropillia. Upon arrival, Scott had suffered such massive blood loss that doctors had to transfuse around four liters of blood and perform the amputations. But thanks to the unified effort of Rozhdestvenskyi and the military, Scott&apos;s life was saved. &#x41F;&#x435;&#x440;&#x435;&#x433;&#x43B;&#x44F;&#x43D;&#x443;&#x442;&#x438; &#x446;&#x435;&#x439; &#x434;&#x43E;&#x43F;&#x438;&#x441; &#x432; Instagram &#x414;&#x43E;&#x43F;&#x438;&#x441;, &#x43F;&#x43E;&#x448;&#x438;&#x440;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x438;&#x439; BASE UA &#x2014; NGO in Donetsk region (@base_ua_ngo) &quot;I&apos;m lucky in so many ways as so many little things that&#x2026; (could have gone wrong),&quot; he says. Donetsk Oblast Prosecutor&#x2019;s Office told the Kyiv Independent that they were investigating the attack as a potential war crime. A video showing Scott hugging Rozhdestvenskyi at the hospital in Dnipro, where he was transported shortly after the surgery, and thanking him for saving his life went viral across social media. &quot;He did; he really saved my life,&quot; Scott says. &quot;He was the one that did the hard work.&quot; &quot;He is a hero.&quot; Rozhdestvenskyi returns the compliments, saying that Scott &#x201C;is a very tough guy for his age.&#x201D; &quot;He always had a firm stance on helping people and his mission in Ukraine, and I was always impressed by that.&quot; After waking up after surgery, Scott was told that a medevac flight to the U.K. was being prepared for him. &#x201C;The first thing I said was, &#x2018;I&apos;m staying in Ukraine.&#x2019; I turned it down right away.&apos;&quot; His treatment in Ukraine was funded by the U.S. RT Weatherman Foundation, which says it was &#x201C;an honor&#x201D; to help Scott. &#x201C;We were touched by Eddie&#x2019;s service to Ukraine and his sacrifice for its people. &#xA0;When we were asked to help, the RT Weatherman Foundation didn&#x2019;t hesitate &#x2014; days after his injury, we evacuated him from Dnipro to Kyiv so that he could recuperate in the best possible conditions,&#x201D; the foundation&#x2019;s program manager in Ukraine, Roman Zhura, told the Kyiv Independent. Scott&#x2019;s parents visited him in Kyiv, with Ukraine quickly growing on them too. &quot;I&apos;ve changed my life, for better or for worse, but I&apos;ve suddenly changed my family&apos;s. Now (my dad) is telling everyone (in the U.K.): &apos;Ukraine&apos;s amazing.&apos;&quot; Edward Scott in the Hospital in Kyiv on Feb. 14, 2025. (Aria Shahrokhshahi)Supported by his dearest friends, Scott not only envisions his future in Ukraine but also sees a new mission for himself: to advocate for the country and its people, helping in any way he can. Through his difficult journey in Ukraine, Scott says he realized that empathy is something &quot;essential for survival&quot; and something that is &quot;abundant in Ukraine.&quot; &quot;People in the West just lack empathy,&quot; he says. &quot;There&apos;s a serious lack of empathy, especially considering that we&apos;re still fighting this war, three years into the full-scale invasion. And people are still debating whether Russia is the enemy. How can you not see it?&quot; &quot;Russia invaded this country, and that alone should be enough to show who the enemy is. The fact that people still don&apos;t see that and continue to believe the lies coming from the Kremlin &#x2014; it&apos;s a serious lack of empathy, and it&apos;s a real problem,&quot; he says. &#xA0; Hi! Daria Shulzhenko here. I wrote this piece for you. Since the first day of Russia&apos;s all-out war, I have been working almost non-stop to tell the stories of those affected by Russia&#x2019;s brutal aggression.

US-Russia talks are 'the last warning for Europe,' Gabrielius Landsbergis says	Storm clouds are intensifying in Europe as Ukraine approaches the fourth year of the full-scale war with Russia. Initial hopes that U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s new administration might adopt the &quot;peace through strength&quot; approach towards Moscow are beginning to unravel in light of recent statements from Washington. Both Trump and his Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made it clear they do not see Ukraine joining NATO, a step envisioned by Kyiv as not only the best possible security guarantee but its key geopolitical goal. Speaking in Brussels at a Ramstein-format summit, the Pentagon chief also claimed that restoring Ukraine&apos;s pre-2014 borders was &quot;unrealistic&quot; and signaled the U.S.&apos;s attention is no longer focused on the European continent. Adding to tensions, U.S. Vice President JD Vance stunned those watching on Feb. 14 when his speech at the Munich Security Conference turned into a searing attack on Europe&apos;s ideals and a call to embrace far-right political parties. Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania&apos;s foreign minister between 2020 and 2024, says that if there ever was the &quot;last warning&quot; for Europe, this was it. The Kyiv Independent sat down with Landsbergis on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14, where the growing divergence between the U.S. and the EU on NATO and Ukraine was at the center of the discussions. Lithuania&apos;s former chief diplomat, a long-time advocate for more decisive support for Ukraine, laid out how Europe can still turn the tide and help Kyiv achieve a just and lasting peace. Because if Europe doesn&apos;t wake up now, he says, &quot;we might have to declare it dead.&quot; The Kyiv Independent: What&apos;s your reaction to recent statements by top U.S. officials &#x2014; before negotiations even began &#x2014; that Ukraine might not be able to join NATO, that it will not be able to return to pre-2014 borders? Gabrielius Landsbergis: It&apos;s giving all the leverage to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and basically declaring that everything he wanted to achieve with his war against Ukraine, he might get it. So it&apos;s understandable that for many Ukrainians and for many of those who support Ukraine, it sounds like a betrayal. But some of the statements were contradicted just recently again, so it is indeed very confusing. I just hope that Putin is as confused as we are. The Kyiv Independent: U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin are planning to meet. What can European countries do to make sure that Europe and Ukraine are not left out of the negotiation process? Gabrielius Landsbergis: I think you see the way it might happen, and there&apos;s very little that we can do. Putin can meet Trump. They will meet, they will talk, they will call it peace negotiations, and they will declare something. But it doesn&apos;t necessarily need to change the reality on the ground. From Putin&apos;s perspective, it definitely won&apos;t. I don&apos;t think he will stop for any reason. He will put the blame on Ukrainians, on Europeans. Trump might do the same thing. So I think we have to prepare for what&apos;s after. And in this, my only hope is the now absolute and horrible cliche, that Europe wakes up. Because if it doesn&apos;t wake up, we might have to declare it dead. If there&apos;s ever a last warning, it is now. And there are things that Europe can do, honestly. We pride ourselves on a huge economy, 450 million people. (Russia&apos;s economy) is just the size of Spain&apos;s.

(Mikhail Klimentyev/Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images)We have to put something on the table. We have the ability to support Ukraine militarily. We can integrate Ukraine into the European Union. This is one of the instruments that Europe used in the past. And if we take it seriously, we can do that very, very fast. I&apos;m not talking about cutting corners, but basically just guiding (Ukraine) through the process so that it is clear that if Russia decides to attack again, it will attack a country of the European Union. That changes the perception. We can arm Ukraine, we can arm ourselves, we can do many things. The Kyiv Independent: You think that membership in the EU can work as some sort of security guarantee for Ukraine? Gabrielius Landsbergis: Yes, indeed. Or at least (it can work as) deterrence. (French) President (Emmanuel) Macron mentioned a while ago that if Russian troops advance, they might encounter French troops in Odesa. Many in Europe freaked out, saying &quot;it&apos;s not needed yet,&quot; or &quot;maybe we can talk about this later in a different format.&quot; I think this is the time to talk about this. Let&apos;s put European troops in Ukraine and promise to fight alongside Ukrainians in case of another attack. This will bring us respect, not just from Ukraine but also from countries like the United States, China, and others. The Kyiv Independent: A major topic of the Munich Security Conference last year was &quot;Trump-proofing&quot; Western aid for Ukraine, that is, ensuring support for Ukraine will continue even if Donald Trump is elected. Do you think these efforts were successful? Did they achieve something? Gabrielius Landsbergis: No, I don&apos;t think so. It&apos;s like all the exercises before Covid hit, exercises of how we vaccinate thousands of people and how we do this and how we do that, how we contain the pandemic. And then, when the real pandemic hit, nobody was prepared. We had to invent all the rules and start from scratch. So I think it was the same with Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The Americans declared about half a year before (February 2022) that the Russians were going to attack. And they said &quot;let&apos;s prepare.&quot; We started preparing. When the Russians attacked, we said, &quot;Oh, okay, so this is what it means.&quot; It&apos;s quite a different reality. I&apos;m not surprised. This is probably the feature of democracy, the way that it functions. We&apos;re very short-term. In most cases, we look at the next election rather than at the next decade. So when somebody says that there is trouble ahead, we&apos;re not that worried about it because we have more troubles right now that we need to take care of. Even in my country, when we have discussions about what we should do if Trump is elected, if he decides to rethink his stance on Europe and other things, it&apos;s a very difficult conversation. And I don&apos;t think that we have prepared. Ukrainian infantry take up Zero positions on the Kupiansk Frontline, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine on Jan. 27, 2024.

(Libkos/Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Why does the West keep making these mistakes when we look at the past three years of the full-scale invasion? Why hasn&apos;t it learned its lesson? And do you think it&apos;s too late to turn the ship around? Gabrielius Landsbergis: I don&apos;t know. Inside Europe, the problem is that we see problems very differently. There are countries close to Ukraine and Russia that do understand what&apos;s happening. We call them the eastern flank countries. You can add Northern Europe to this group. And then you have a lot of other countries for whom to imagine a Russian attack on Brussels&#x2026; I mean, this will never happen, right? That&apos;s why you have to argue whether you still need 2% of GDP for defense when Poland is spending 4% and Lithuania is spending 3.7%. Estonia, almost 4%. And then you have countries far away from Russia who say that this will never happen, they will never attack us. And this is the division. What we need is leadership. We need somebody who would be willing to risk paying the political price for the solutions needed for Europe. So it&apos;s not a bureaucrat who doesn&apos;t really care, but the person who says: &quot;Okay, if we don&apos;t do this, we are doomed. And if we do this, yes, we might also lose, and I will lose personally, but this is the price I&apos;m willing to pay.&quot; Is it not too late? I don&apos;t think it&apos;s too late. When Covid hit, Europe decided to borrow 750 billion euros ($780 billion). Sounds like a lot of money. But after a session of just eight hours, the German parliament took a decision to borrow 250 billion euros ($260 billion). Yes, it&apos;s one of the biggest economies in the world. But imagine if it&apos;s doable for Germany, what can Europe do in eight hours? The Kyiv Independent: For a long time, Ukraine has said membership in NATO is the only effective security guarantee. But this seems now increasingly unlikely in the light of recent statements from the U.S. What would you consider the most feasible and effective security guarantee for Ukraine? Gabrielius Landsbergis: I still insist that NATO is the most effective (security guarantee) because you have the United States in it. You have a clear commitment to fight alongside (allies) because it&apos;s at the core of the (NATO founding agreement) Washington Treaty. And even in theory, NATO works as a deterrent, because there&apos;s enough ambiguity in the way that NATO is structured, that you don&apos;t want to test it. The Russians might one day be brave enough to test it, but not yet. So if NATO guarantees would be provided now, I think that Ukraine would be safer immediately. If that is completely off the table, we need U.S. security guarantees that would be second-tier. Basically, the U.S. would fight alongside its allies, who would be willing to join the group and Ukraine in case there&apos;s another attack. If that doesn&apos;t work, well, then it&apos;s the Europeans. The question is whether that would be possible. If that doesn&apos;t happen, then we&apos;re in a very dangerous scenario where Ukraine is actually left alone to fight off anything that might come its way. This would be very similar to the Minsk agreements. A ceasefire, no security guarantees, and just a preparation for the next phase. Note from the author: Hi, this is Martin Fornusek.

Vance says Zelensky 'badmouthing' Trump, calls it counterproductive	U.S. Vice President JD Vance criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 19, saying his public remarks about U.S. President Donald Trump were counterproductive. &quot;The idea that Zelensky is going to change the president&apos;s mind by badmouthing him in public media &#x2014; everyone who knows the president will tell you that is an atrocious way to deal with this administration,&quot; Vance told DailyMail. His comments come after Zelensky dismissed Trump&apos;s claim that his support among Ukrainians had fallen to 4%, saying the U.S. president had been misled by Russian disinformation. Trump made the comment as an argument of why Ukraine should hold elections in the near future. A Feb. 19 poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) showed that 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky, a five-point increase since December. Vance rejected that assertion, insisting that Trump&apos;s stance on Ukraine was not influenced by Russian narratives. &quot;Donald Trump is well-versed in geopolitics and has held a strong stance on the matter for a long time,&quot; he claimed. He also suggested that Zelensky had received &quot;bad advice&quot; on dealing with the Trump administration and had been told he &quot;could do nothing wrong&quot; for the past three years. &quot;We obviously love the Ukrainian people. We admire the bravery of the soldiers, but we obviously think that this war needs to come to a rapid close,&quot; Vance added. This follows Trump&apos;s latest criticism of Zelensky, where he labeled the Ukrainian leader a &quot;dictator&quot; in a Truth Social post, accusing him of refusing to hold elections. Trump&apos;s claim ignores the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. Trump has previously suggested that Ukraine should hold new elections, implying that Zelensky&apos;s leadership was a factor in prolonging the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/vance-says-zelensky-badmouthing-trump-calls-it-counterproductive/	2025-02-19T11:05:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198862659.jpg
Lithuania's president unveils 6-point plan to support Ukraine, strengthen European security	Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda outlined a six-point action plan on Feb. 19 to support Ukraine and bolster European security as the U.S. sidelines Europe in talks with Russia to end the war, and concerns grow that negotiations could lead to a deal unfavorable to Kyiv. &quot;We must act now to support Ukraine and boost Europe&apos;s security. No more talk shops &#x2014; time for action,&quot; Nauseda wrote on X. His proposal includes security guarantees for Ukraine, emphasizing that &quot;NATO membership should remain on the table.&quot; He also called for immediate funding for arms and a 10-billion-euro ($10.4 billion) investment in Ukraine&apos;s defense industry. Nauseda stressed that Russia must be held accountable for war crimes, and sanctions should remain in place until its aggression ends, frozen assets are seized, and tariffs on Russian and Belarusian imports are implemented. Over $300 billion of Russian central bank reserves remain frozen in Europe, including 191 billion euros ($198 billion) held in the Euroclear depository in Belgium. The Lithuanian president also proposed accelerating Ukraine&apos;s EU accession, setting 2030 as the target date. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s security is part of European security,&quot; he wrote. Neither Ukraine nor Europe was invited to talks between U.S. and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. The move has set off alarm bells that the U.S. and Russia could reach an agreement on the war without Ukraine or Europe&apos;s involvement, and one that would put their future security in jeopardy. The future of U.S. assistance for Ukraine under President Donald Trump&apos;s administration is also uncertain. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Feb. 12 also suggested that Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership is not a &quot;realistic outcome&quot; of ongoing negotiations and that Ukraine may not be able to fully restore its 2014 borders. Ukraine has maintained that firm security guarantees &#x2014; including NATO membership &#x2014; are necessary to prevent Russia from rebuilding its military and potentially launching a new invasion if hostilities were to pause. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously called NATO membership the &quot;cheapest&quot; security guarantee and a geopolitical victory for U.S. President Donald Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuanias-nauseda-unveils-six-point-plan-to-support-ukraine-strengthen-european-security/	2025-02-19T10:28:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2160823562.jpg
North Korean troops in Russia reportedly told they're fighting South Korean forces	North Korean security services are telling their troops stationed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast that they are fighting against both the Ukrainian and South Korean militaries, South Korean newspaper Chosun Daily reported, citing captured North Korean soldiers. Two North Korean prisoners of war, captured by Ukrainian forces last month, spoke exclusively to Chosun Daily at a prisoner-of-war (POW) camp in Ukraine. One of the captives admitted that he and his fellow soldiers believed they were fighting South Korean troops, which heightened their morale and aggression. Each battalion, consisting of about 500 soldiers, was monitored by one or two officers from North Korea&apos;s State Security Ministry, one of the prisoners said. These officers oversaw ideological training and discipline. They reportedly informed their soldiers that Ukrainian drone operators were South Korean military personnel. Seoul has not provided military aid to Kyiv since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in August 2024. Their journey to Russia took several months, with a group of 2,500 North Koreans departing on Oct. 10, 2024, traveling by train, then by plane, and finally by bus to Kursk, where they arrived in mid-December, according to one of the captives. The other captured soldier, a sniper trained for reconnaissance, said contact between North Korean troops and Russian forces was minimal, with interaction mainly occurring at the command level for ammunition, supplies, and equipment. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously reported that North Korean forces fighting for Russia had suffered 4,000 casualties, with two-thirds of the losses being soldiers killed. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, attributed the high losses to North Korea&apos;s lack of combat experience and its use of human wave attacks with limited equipment. Ukraine&apos;s cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024 initially seized 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukrainian forces have since lost roughly half that area due to Russian counterattacks, they recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in a renewed offensive.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-in-russia-reportedly-told-theyre-fighting-south-korean-ukrainian-forces/	2025-02-19T10:04:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157772464.jpg
Trump calls Zelensky 'dictator,' warns of Ukraine's demise without elections	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. President Donald Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; in a post on his social media platform Truth Social, accusing him of refusing to have elections, and repeating false claims about the war in Ukraine. &quot;He refuses to have elections, is very low in Ukrainian polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden &apos;like a fiddle,&apos;&quot; Trump wrote. A Feb. 19 poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) showed that 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky, a five-point increase since December. Trump also called the Ukrainian president &quot;a dictator without elections,&quot; saying that &quot;Zelensky better move fast, or he won&#x2019;t have a country left.&quot; The claim ignores the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. Trump also referred to Zelensky as a &quot;modestly successful comedian&quot; and accused him of persuading the U.S. to spend $350 billion on Ukraine. &quot;The United States has spent 200 billion dollars more than Europe, and Europe&apos;s money is guaranteed, while the United States will get nothing back,&quot; Trump claimed. Earlier on Feb. 19, Zelensky said Ukraine&apos;s wartime military costs had totaled $320 billion, with the U.S. and EU combined providing $200 billion of that sum in defense support. &quot;We, the people of Ukraine, (covered) $120 billion, the U.S. and the EU &#x2014; $200 billion. We are talking about arms; this is a weapons package worth $320 billion,&quot; Zelensky said in Kyiv. Trump&apos;s remarks follow his Feb. 18 statement that Ukraine &quot;should hold new elections,&quot; appearing to blame Zelensky&apos;s leadership for the ongoing war. His comments come amid growing concerns in Kyiv after U.S. and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia &#x2014; without Ukraine &#x2014; to discuss strategies for ending the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-calls-zelensky-dictator-warns-of-ukraines-demise-without-elections/	2025-02-19T08:39:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2177668198.jpg
Ukraine refutes Putin's claims of Russian offensive from Kursk Oblast	Ukraine&apos;s General Staff refuted claims by President Vladimir Putin that Russian troops had launched an offensive into Ukraine from Kursk Oblast, spokesperson Dmytro Lykhovyi said on Feb. 19. Putin told Russian media on Feb. 18 that Russian forces had crossed into Ukrainian territory from Kursk Oblast, a claim Lykhovyi has dismissed as part of a disinformation campaign. &quot;Since the beginning of the day, 12 combat engagements have been recorded in Kursk Oblast, three of which are still ongoing, while the rest have been repelled,&quot; Lykhovyi said. During one of the attacks, Russian troops attempted to advance toward Ukraine&apos;s state border, according to Lykhovyi. Map showing Ukrainian-controlled territory in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast as of Feb. 19, 2025, with captured areas marked in blue. (DeepState/OpenStreetMap)Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially capturing about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukrainian forces have lost roughly half of that area, they recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in a new offensive. Over six months of fighting in the region, Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000 personnel, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. Another 909 have been taken as prisoners of war. Ukraine is likely looking to use its foothold in Kursk Oblast as leverage in potential peace talks. Russia&apos;s forces in Kursk Oblast have been bolstered by North Korean troops, deployed last fall to help counter the Ukrainian incursion. President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that the offensive disrupted Russia&apos;s ability to carry out large-scale operations in northeastern and southern Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-refutes-putins-claims-of-russian-offensive-from-kursk-oblast/	2025-02-19T08:22:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2166040846.jpg
Putin would 'gladly' meet Trump, says war in Ukraine should be 'worked out' in advance	Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Feb. 19 that he had been briefed on the outcome of U.S.-Russian talks in Riyadh, expressing willingness to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump. &quot;Yes, I&apos;ve been reported. I rate them highly. There is a result,&quot; Putin told Russian media. He added that he would &quot;gladly&quot; meet with Trump but stressed that such a meeting must be carefully prepared. Putin emphasized that he seeks more than just a symbolic meeting, saying key issues, particularly the war in Ukraine, must be &quot;worked out&quot; in advance. The Russian president also confirmed that Trump had told him Ukraine would be included in any negotiation process. &quot;President Trump told me during a telephone conversation, I can confirm that, of course, the United States assumes that the negotiation process will take place with the participation of Russia and Ukraine,&quot; he said. Putin&apos;s remarks come after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio led a delegation to Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 for direct talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and other officials. The meeting marked the first face-to-face negotiations between the U.S. and Russia since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion began. In response to the talks, President Volodymyr Zelensky postponed a planned visit to Saudi Arabia, expressing concerns over Ukraine&apos;s exclusion. While no concrete decisions were announced, the U.S.-Russia meeting has raised alarms in Kyiv and Europe, where officials worry about being sidelined in the negotiation process.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-gladly-open-to-meeting-trump-says-war-in-ukraine-to-be-worked-out-in-advance/	2025-02-19T07:38:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1152488863.jpg
Czechia, Poland preparing decision on status of Ukrainians with temporary protection after ceasefire, war's end	Czechia and the Polish presidency of the EU Council are developing a decision on the status of Ukrainians under temporary protection after a ceasefire is declared or the war ends, Czech Interior Minister Vit Rakusan told Czech news website Novinky on Feb. 18. The EU implemented the Temporary Protection Directive in March 2022 after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The EU Council extended temporary protection in June 2024 until March 2026 for over 4 million Ukrainian refugees. Prague and Warsaw are seeking to prepare a &quot;rough version of the proposal,&quot; as the decision should be made later at the EU level, Rakusan said. In the event of a ceasefire or the end of the war in Ukraine, the Czechia will automatically stop granting temporary status to Ukrainians, but they will still be able to stay in the country for a certain period, a year or a year and a half, according to Rakusan. To continue staying in the country, Ukrainians must re-register under a different status, just like other foreigners, he added. The EU also plans to create special centers for Ukrainians to mediate their return to their homes. According to the minister, discussions have already occurred in Germany, Poland, and Austria. Such a center will also be established in the . &quot;(The centers) would offer work in Ukraine, accommodation, life prospects and conditions under which people would return. At the same time, they would also help Ukrainians who decide to stay here by organizing their relocation to another country,&quot; Rakusan added. Czechia is one of the three European countries with the largest number of Ukrainian refugees. According to the European Commission, as of December 2024, the country has hosted about 390,000 Ukrainians who fled due to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/czechia-poland-preparing-decision-on-status-of-ukrainians-with-temporary-protection-after-ceasefire-wars-end/	2025-02-19T07:18:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1620826063.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Trump wants Ukraine's natural resources, and more	The following is the Feb. 18, 2025 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. It all seemed to be going swimmingly at first. President Volodymyr Zelensky had wooed Republicans and U.S. President Donald Trump with a sweet deal on Ukraine&#x2019;s &#x201C;critical minerals.&#x201D; Trump seemed to take the bait, telling the world he was going to make a deal with Ukraine on its &#x201C;rare earths and other things&#x201D; in exchange for support. Then Trump comes out saying that actually, he would like the U.S. to be paid back for the $350 billion that it had given Ukraine for its war effort &#x2014; a number that doesn&#x2019;t correspond to reality. U.S. assistance to Ukraine since the start of the invasion is somewhere around $100 billion, much of which has gone to paying back the U.S. for weapons it&#x2019;s sent to Ukraine. Trump also claimed at that time that Kyiv had &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a deal on a $500 billion resource deal. &quot;I told them that I want the equivalent of like $500 billion worth of rare earth (minerals), and they&#x2019;ve essentially agreed to do that,&quot; the U.S. president said in an interview with Fox News on Feb. 10. To the public, the deal seemed to be quickly turning into Ukraine &#x2014; the country that was invaded &#x2014; being asked to pay reparations to an ally. The floodgates seemed to break open when U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent showed up in Kyiv with a one-page memorandum of understanding-style document with the terms of the deal the U.S. was proposing. While the contents of the deal weren&#x2019;t revealed to the public, what we did find out pretty quickly was that Bessent asked Zelensky to sign on the spot, but the Ukrainian president refused, wanting more time to review the deal, and namely, because the document made no mention of any security guarantees in exchange for Ukraine&#x2019;s resources. Over the following days, reports surfaced with the details of the proposed deal. Here&#x2019;s what we know: The Trump administration is reportedly seeking a 50% interest in all of Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources &#x2014; not just critical minerals, but valuable natural resources like oil and gas, as well potentially stakes in port and other critical infrastructure, through the creation of a joint investment fund. The deal would give the U.S. half of Ukraine&#x2019;s earnings from resource extraction and the sale of new licenses, as well as priority in purchasing Ukraine&#x2019;s mineral exports, the New York Times and other outlets reported, citing Ukrainian and European officials. The Telegraph got a hold of a copy of the memorandum, reporting that it said explicitly that the proposed deal covers the &#x201C;economic value associated with resources of Ukraine,&#x201D; including &#x201C;mineral resources, oil and gas resources, ports, other infrastructure (as agreed).&#x201D; Current and former senior Ukrainian officials have expressed serious concern about the deal, with one calling it &#x201C;colonial&#x201D; in comments to AP, and saying that Zelensky should not sign it. They see it as audacious that the U.S. would seriously come and ask Ukraine to give up so much when it is the victim of this war. One area that seems to have irked officials the most, according to sources, is the oil and gas part of the proposed deal. Underdeveloped critical mineral deposits &#x2014; fine, but gaining a stake in the country&#x2019;s massive oil and gas sector? Not so fast. Oil and gas giant Naftogaz is one of the country&#x2019;s largest companies and taxpayers, making a profit of over $500 million in the first nine months of 2024. Zelensky and his team have reportedly come up with a counterproposal, but it&#x2019;s unclear yet where that counteroffer stands. One thing to keep in mind, as some of my interlocutors have mentioned, is that the deal presented by Bessent is just the first offer. And to remember that this is all pretty par for the course with Trump, who likes to swing for the fences in negotiations to get the most out of them. The two sides will keep hashing it out, likely to meet somewhere in the middle, they say. It&#x2019;s not just about what the two sides want, either. Ironing out the details of a deal like this will not happen overnight. For one, Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources belong to the Ukrainian people, per the country&#x2019;s constitution &#x2014; no one president can just hand them over without parliament ratifying some sort of agreement. It&#x2019;s also unclear what jurisdiction will govern any future potential joint ventures. The document passed along by Bessent proposes that the deal be &#x201C;governed by New York law, without regard to conflict of laws principles,&#x201D; as the Telegraph revealed. People aren&#x2019;t totally sure about why New York was chosen, and think that&#x2019;s just another layer to this that still needs to be sorted out. But some in the business world don&#x2019;t see the possibility of a deal to create joint ventures in such dire terms. Many of them welcome the idea of American know-how, expertise, and management entering into business with Ukrainian companies &#x2014; some of which, especially the state-owned ones, have languished for years, underdeveloped and poorly-managed, or in some unfortunate cases, owned by shady oligarchs, and breeding grounds for corruption. Stay tuned, as there&#x2019;s sure to be more. Collage of Ukrainian drones. (Lisa Litvinenko/The Kyiv Independent)Defense tech &#x2014; Changing tidesUkrainian weapons startups are finally seeing an inflow of funds from Western investors who have long been intrigued by Ukraine&apos;s defense tech sector but have so far kept their money out of the war-torn country, defense industry reporter Kollen Post writes in his latest. Financial analysis firm Pitchbook provided the Kyiv Independent with data showing a four-fold rise in foreign venture capital deals in Ukraine-headquartered startups after the market flatlined in 2022 and 2023 following Russia&#x2019;s invasion. The total dollar value remains slim &#x2014; just under $20 million by Pitchbook&#x2019;s accounting, and $40 million according to the Ukrainian government. But with most of these new deals coming in at the end of 2024, a dam may be bursting. Western investors have until now been hesitant to hand money over to these Ukrainian firms. But pressure on Europe to expand its military muscle might be changing that. &#x201C;We are getting more and more interest all the time,&#x201D; says Deborah Fairlamb, who runs a U.S.-registered but Ukraine-focused fund, Green Flag VC. &#x201C;There&apos;s been tons of inquiries from governments all over the place.&#x201D; Read the full article here. And in case you missed it &#x2014; Post has also assembled a list of 10 Ukrainian drone makers, producing unmanned aerial vehicles ranging from mass-produced first-person view (FPV) drones to highly secretive deep-strike UAVs that we believe to be the biggest game in town. Check it out here. Ukraine&#x2019;s State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) has detained the director of popular online casino Pin-Up over its alleged Russian ownership and business in Russia, the agency announced in a press release on Feb. 14. An ongoing investigation into the company earlier found that its real owners were Russian citizens. The owners allegedly collected personal data and information about the location of Pin-Up&#x2019;s users, including Ukrainian military personnel. Quantum Systems, a German drone manufacturer operating two plants in Ukraine, plans to double its drone production in the country, Ukraine&apos;s Strategic Industries Ministry announced on Feb. 14. The company last year promised to supply Kyiv with 500 reconnaissance drones by the end of 2024. Meanwhile, Ukraine is set to receive 6,000 AI-powered HX-2 attack drones from the Munich-based defense technology firm Helsing. The HX-2, an electrically propelled precision munition with a range of up to 100 kilometers, is equipped with onboard artificial intelligence, ensuring resilience against electronic warfare. The European Business Association (EBA) urged the Ukrainian government to declassify its information on mineral deposit data in a statement published on Feb. 13. The association argued that current restrictions hinder international agreements and discourage investment. Currently, information on resources such as gold, lithium, titanium, and platinum is classified as secret or &quot;for official use,&quot; limiting Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to engage with global partners. Agricultural trade between Ukraine and the EU reached $17 billion in 2024, exceeding the previous record of $16.5 billion in 2022 by 3%, the Kyiv-based research Institute of Agrarian Economics (IAE) reported. The trade volume is the highest since the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement was signed in 2014, said Mykola Puhachov, deputy director of IAE. Agricultural expert Oleg Nivievskyi told the Kyiv Independent that exports likely increased due to rising prices. European countries have found themselves at &quot;a separate kids&apos; table&quot; in the negotiations on Ukraine because of insufficient investment in their defense, Armin Papperger, chief executive of Rheinmetall, said in an interview with the Financial Times published on Feb. 18. &quot;If you don&apos;t invest, if you&apos;re not strong, they handle you like kids,&quot; Papperger said, adding that over the past 30 years, Europe has considered it acceptable to invest about 1% of GDP in defense. &quot;If parents have dinner, the kids have to sit at another table,&quot; he said. &quot;The U.S. is negotiating with Russia, and no European is at the table &#x2014; it has become very clear that the Europeans are the kids.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-business-roundup-trump-wants-ukraines-natural-resources-and-more/	2025-02-19T07:14:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/unnamed--18-.jpg
Hungary again blocks EU sanctions against Moscow Patriarch Kirill	Hungary negotiated exemptions for Moscow Patriarch Kirill and domestic use of Russian oil products during talks on the EU&apos;s 16th package of sanctions, a Hungarian government spokesperson said on Feb. 19. The statement came after EU ambassadors agreed on the next package of sanctions imposed against Russia, targeting aluminum trade and Moscow&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of oil tankers. &quot;These exemptions allow MOL to use refined Russian oil products domestically, remove maintenance equipment for the Druzhba pipeline from sanctions, and ensure Budapest&#x2019;s metro system can continue receiving necessary servicing and repairs,&quot; spokesperson Zoltan Kovacs said on X. &quot;Hungary also blocked sanctions against 27 individuals and organizations, including Patriarch Kirill, arguing that targeting religious leaders undermines peace efforts,&quot; Kovacs said. This marks yet another instance of Budapest blocking sanctions measures against the head of the Russian Orthodox Church. Patriarch Kirill (secular name Vladimir Gundyayev) has publicly supported Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine and is regarded as a close ally of the Kremlin. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, broadly seen as the most Russian-friendly leader in the EU, has repeatedly obstructed and delayed the bloc&apos;s sanctions against Russia and military aid for Ukraine. &quot;The era of sanctions is over. A new reality is emerging, with promising U.S.-Russia negotiations,&quot; Kovacs said in an apparent reference to a shift in U.S.-Russian relations under U.S. President Donald Trump. Initially threatening Moscow with additional tariffs and sanctions unless Russian President Vladimir Putin agrees to negotiate, Trump has since then adopted more positive rhetoric toward Russia while blaming Ukraine for the war. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who met his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov for talks in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, signaled that the settlement of the war would include the lifting of sanctions. EU Economy and Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis commented that Brussels must take greater control of its sanctions policy against Russia as U.S. priorities shift.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-says-it-negotiated-exemptions-for-patriarch-kirill/	2025-02-19T05:58:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190447641.jpg
Russia offering US deal on natural resources, access to Arctic	Russia is offering the Trump administration a deal on Russian natural resources and access to the Arctic, The Moscow Times reported on Feb. 18, citing Kirill Dmitriev, one of the Russian delegates in recent Saudi Arabia talks. A Russian delegation led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met on Feb. 18 with a U.S. delegation led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, marking the highest-level meeting between the two sides since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian and the U.S. delegates in Riyadh also discussed economic cooperation, including global energy prices. Moscow is suggesting that American oil companies may return to the country and is interested in joint projects with the U.S. in the Arctic, Dmitriev said before the talks started. The statement comes as Kyiv announced it is not ready to sign the U.S.-proposed deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources. President Volodymyr Zelensky commented that Ukraine is open to investment but argued that the memorandum, presented by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Feb. 12, needs more work as it does not include any concrete security guarantees. &quot;We believe that at some point, they (American companies) will come back because why would they start giving up the opportunity to access Russian natural resources that Russia gave them?&quot; Dmitriev said, adding that large American oil companies had &quot;very successful businesses&quot; in Russia. &quot;We should also do joint projects, including, for example, in the Arctic and other areas. Joint projects will allow us to be more successful,&quot; Dmitriev added. U.S. companies allegedly lost $300 billion from sanctions against Russia, and Joe Biden&apos;s administration &quot;gave a lot of wrong messages&quot; about the state of the Russian economy, Dmitriev claimed. Before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, only one major U.S. company, Exxon Mobil, was producing oil in Russia. The company also owns 30% of the Sakhalin 1 oil project. Following the imposition of sanctions against Sakhalin 1, Exxon Mobil tried to sell its stake but failed, according to The Moscow Times. After the outbreak of the all-out war, the leading American oilfield service companies, including Halliburton, Schlumberger, and Baker Hughes, also announced their withdrawal from Russia. Russia is also expecting the U.S. to unfreeze Russian state assets, including those owned by the Central Bank, which were previously invested in American ones. The assets are valued at about $6 billion, the outlet reported. Altogether, nearly $300 billion of the Central Bank&apos;s foreign exchange reserves have been frozen, of which over $200 billion are in Europe. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly assured European allies that the U.S. would maintain sanctions against Moscow at least until an agreement is reached to end the Russia-Ukraine war. Yet, following talks between the U.S. and Russian delegations, Rubio suggested that lifting sanctions against Russia would be part of any peace process, saying that &quot;concessions&quot; would have to be made by &quot;all sides&quot; to bring an end to &quot;any conflict.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-offers-us-deal-on-its-natural-resources-access-to-arctic/	2025-02-19T05:46:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199704911.jpg
US helping Putin escape isolation, Zelensky says after Riyadh talks	The U.S. helped Russian President Vladimir Putin to escape years of isolation, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 19 in reference to recent U.S.-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia. A U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio met on Feb. 18 with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, and Putin&apos;s top aide, Yuri Ushakov, to discuss an end to the Russia-Ukraine war. The talks, which excluded Ukrainian representatives, marked the highest-level meeting between the U.S. and Russia since the outbreak of the full-scale invasion in 2022. &quot;The fact that they are discussing bilateral issues in Saudi Arabia is their right, but I believe that the U.S. helped Putin escape many years of isolation,&quot; Zelensky said during a press conference, adding that Ukraine is nevertheless &quot;ready for anything.&quot; Though the talks in Saudi Arabia concluded without specific decisions on ending the war, U.S. and Russian officials said the meeting was constructive and laid the ground for further discussion. Trump also voiced his intent to meet with Putin in person, &quot;probably&quot; by the end of February. While Trump&apos;s predecessor, U.S. Joe Biden, has not met the Russian leader since the outbreak of the full-scale war, two European leaders &#x2013; Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban &#x2013; separately met Putin in Moscow last year. Rubio claimed on Feb. 16 that the Riyadh talks were an exploratory first step rather than official negotiations and that Ukraine and Europe would participate once the official discussions began. Speaking at the press conference, Zelensky also referred to the Trump administration&apos;s supposed claims that &quot;90% of aid comes from the U.S.&quot; &quot;We understand that the truth is a little different, although we are certainly grateful for the assistance. I would like there to be more truth in Trump&apos;s team,&quot; he added. Ukraine&apos;s head of state refused claims that Washington has provided Kyiv with $500 billion in assistance since 2022, putting the figure at nearly $100 billion in military and financial support. &quot;I think that Putin and the Russians are very happy because issues are being discussed with them. Yesterday, there were signals that they were being regarded as victims. That is something new,&quot; Zelensky noted. Speaking after the Riyadh talks, Trump voiced his belief that Russia wishes to end the war and laid the blame for the ongoing hostilities on Ukraine. He also falsely claimed that Zelensky has an approval rating of 4% and urged Ukraine to hold elections, a step not permitted by the country&apos;s constitution during a war. A survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published on Feb. 19 put Zelensky&apos;s approval rating at 57% as of February. According to the latest poll from Reuters published Feb. 19, Trump&#x2019;s own approval rating currently stands at 44%.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-helping-putin-out-of-isolation-zelensky-says-after/	2025-02-19T05:00:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199687527.jpg
US promises Europe to maintain Russia sanctions at least until Ukraine peace deal, Bloomberg reports	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio assured European allies that the U.S. would maintain sanctions against Moscow at least until an agreement is reached to end the Russia-Ukraine war, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 19, citing its undisclosed sources. In the nearly three years since the full-scale invasion, the U.S. has implemented several rounds of sanctions on Russia to undermine its efforts to continue its war in Ukraine. Restrictions have been imposed on banks, the gas and oil industries, and the delivery of dual-use goods, among other spheres. Following talks between the U.S. and Russian delegations in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, Rubio suggested that lifting sanctions against Russia would be part of any peace process, saying that &quot;concessions&quot; would have to be made by &quot;all sides&quot; to bring an end to &quot;any conflict.&quot; Rubio added that the EU would &quot;have to be at the table at some point because they have sanctions as well that have been imposed.&quot; According to Bloomberg, Rubio subsequently assured European colleagues in a phone call that the sanctions would not be lifted at least until a settlement could be reached. The State Department&apos;s readout on Rubio&apos;s call with European allies does not mention any sanctions but says that the countries &quot;agreed to remain in close contact&quot; as they work to achieve &quot;a durable end to the conflict in Ukraine.&quot; The role of European nations in the negotiations with Russia remains unclear. Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, previously said that Europe would not be directly involved in the talks but assured that its interests would be considered.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-keep-sanctions-against-russia-until-deal-to-end-war-reached-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-19T04:25:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199666749.jpg
War has cost Ukraine $320 billion in weapons, US and EU provided two-thirds, Zelensky says	Ukraine&apos;s wartime military costs have amounted to $320 billion, with the U.S. and the EU providing $200 billion of that sum in defense support, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 19. &quot;We, the people of Ukraine, (covered) $120 billion, the U.S. and the EU &#x2014; $200 billion. We are talking about arms, this is a weapons package worth $320 billion,&quot; Zelensky said during a press conference in Kyiv. The comments came following U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s claim that Kyiv has &quot;essentially&quot; agreed to a deal on $500 billion in Ukraine&apos;s natural resources in exchange for Washington&apos;s support. Trump has also repeatedly made unsubstantiated and contradicting claims about the value of assistance the U.S. has provided to Ukraine since 2022, most recently putting the figure at $350 billion. &quot;In total, the U.S. separately gave us about $67 billion in weapons, and we received $31.5 billion in budget support,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that Ukraine is grateful for the provided support. &quot;But one cannot count up to $500 billion and say, &apos;give us back $500 billion in minerals,&apos; that&apos;s not a serious discussion.&quot; Zelensky reiterated that Ukraine is ready to discuss the U.S.-proposed deal on natural resources as long as Kyiv provides security guarantees. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered a draft of the agreement to Zelensky on Feb. 12, but Ukraine refused to sign unless the document included clear security commitments.	https://kyivindependent.com/war-has-cost-320-billion-us-and-eu-covered-two-thirds-zelensky-says/	2025-02-19T03:31:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169777527.jpg
Ukraine doesn't want to become 'center for extraction of raw materials,' Zelensky says	Ukraine is open to investment but does not want to become a &quot;center for the extraction of raw materials for any continent,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with CNN Turk published on Feb. 19. The comment comes after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered a draft of the agreement to Zelensky on Feb. 12. The president said Ukraine is not ready to sign the document as it did not include any security guarantees. &quot;Ukraine is ready for investment, provided that the occupied territories are liberated and natural resources are protected,&quot; Zelensky told CNN Turk. &quot;We do not want to become a center for the extraction of raw materials for any continent. It is more important for us to be friends and partners, not just a source of raw materials,&quot; he added. A Ukrainian delegation led by Zelensky discussed the deal with U.S. delegates led by Vice President JD Vance during the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14. Kyiv praised the talks as constructive, even though they did not result in the signing of the memorandum. &quot;Without security guarantees, the deal will not be fair. If we want to give something, we must get something in return,&quot; Zelensky said. The U.S. is looking to obtain 50% of Ukraine&apos;s rare earth minerals, NBC reported on Feb. 15. Washington has signaled openness to deploy American troops to guard these resources if there is a deal with Russia to end the war, undisclosed American officials told the outlet. U.S. President Donald Trump said in early February that he wanted to strike a deal with Ukraine involving access to rare earth minerals in exchange for continued aid. Trump later claimed that Kyiv had &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-doesnt-want-to-become-center-for-extraction-of-raw-materials-for-any-continent-zelensky-says/	2025-02-19T03:06:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1843522320.jpg
Russia behind Trump's false claim of 4% approval rating, Zelensky says	Ukraine understands that U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s false claim that President Volodymyr Zelensky holds a 4% approval rating comes from Russia, Zelensky said during a press conference on Feb. 19. &quot;We saw this disinformation. We understand it comes from Russia. We understand, and we have evidence that those figures have been discussed between the U.S. and Russia,&quot; Zelensky said. Trump made the claim on Feb. 18 without providing evidence, presenting it as an argument that Ukraine should hold elections soon. Speaking the same day when a U.S. delegation met top Russian officials for talks in Saudi Arabia without Ukraine&apos;s participation, Trump also laid the blame for the war on Kyiv. Kremlin propaganda has pushed the narrative that Zelensky is an illegitimate leader, relying on the premise that his first presidential term was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. The false allegation ignores the fact that the Ukrainian constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which went into effect after Russia launched the full-scale invasion in 2022. While voicing his respect for Trump and the American people, Zelensky said that the U.S. president &quot;sadly lives in this disinformation space.&quot; Zelensky also pointed to the latest survey that put the president&apos;s approval rating at 57%, adding that efforts to replace him at this moment would not be successful.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-disinformation-behind-trumps-claim-of-4-approval-rating-zelensky-says/	2025-02-19T02:52:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1850432035.jpg

Zelensky's trust rating increases to 57%, survey shows, contradicting Trump's claims	Around 57% of Ukrainians trust President Volodymyr Zelensky as of February, marking an increase of five percentage points since December, according to a survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published on Feb. 19. The poll, carried out between Feb. 4 and 9, was published shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump alleged that Zelensky holds a &quot;4% approval rating&quot; without providing a source to back his claim. The latest survey shows that Zelensky continues to enjoy support from the majority of Ukrainians, even marking a slight increase in trust after a year of steady decline in popularity throughout 2024. Around 37% of respondents said they do not trust the president, a two-point drop since December. &quot;If some international partners and allies are worried about the legitimacy of the President in the context of possible peace negotiations and consider it appropriate to insist on elections, then from the point of view of Ukrainian citizens themselves, there are no problems with this,&quot; said Anton Hrushetskyi, the executive director of KIIS. Kremlin propaganda has pushed the narrative that Zelensky is an illegitimate leader, relying on the premise that his first presidential term was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. The false allegation ignores the fact that the Ukrainian constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which went into effect after Russia launched the full-scale invasion in 2022. Pushing to broker a quick peace deal, Trump has begun pressuring Ukraine to hold elections while blaming Zelensky&apos;s administration for the continuation of the war. &quot;That&apos;s not a Russia thing. That&apos;s something coming from me,&quot; Trump said on Feb. 18 about the need to hold elections in Ukraine, claiming that his views were not influenced by Moscow&apos;s narratives. The KIIS survey was conducted by phone, with the participation of 1,000 respondents living in Ukraine-controlled territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-trust-in-zelensky-increases-to-57-survey-shows/	2025-02-19T02:22:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/DSC06351------.jpg
Trump to 'probably' meet Putin before end of February	U.S. President Donald Trump said he would &quot;probably&quot; meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin before the end of February, CNN reported on Feb. 19. Since the first days after his return to the White House, Trump has been voicing his intent to meet with Putin to discuss how to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine as soon as possible. Answering a journalist&apos;s questions at a press conference in Mar-a-Lago about whether the meeting would take place before the end of the month, Trump said &quot;probably&quot; without mentioning a specific date. Trump spoke to Putin in a phone call for nearly 90 minutes on Feb. 12, holding a separate call with President Volodymyr Zelensky soon after. The U.S. president has vowed to quickly end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine after taking office. Later, Trump announced that his first meeting with Putin would take place in Saudi Arabia as part of efforts to negotiate an end to Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. On Feb. 18, a U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and other officials in Saudia Arabia, marking the first direct negotiations between the two countries since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion began. No concrete decisions were announced following the U.S.-Russia talks, but Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the meeting sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe. Trump also previously said he would meet with Zelensky in Washington, but the U.S. or Ukraine have not confirmed any specific plans.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-to-probably-meet-putin-before-end-of-february/	2025-02-19T01:57:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1152460187.jpg
Slavoj Žižek: Fate no longer smiles on us, Europeans	The second line of the Ukrainian national anthem &#x2014; &#x201C;Fate/luck still smiles on us, fellow Ukrainians&#x201D; &#x2014; sadly no longer holds. Much worse, we should extend this retreat of luck to Europe itself: Fate/luck no longer smiles on us, fellow Europeans. The situation is now so serious that the same old points should be repeated again and again&#x2014;perhaps they will find more resonance today now that the crisis has broken out openly. To anyone who follows our media, it is more than obvious how U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s new administration has thrown our time out of joint in both domestic and foreign policy. But why should Europe be the one chosen to set the time straight? The reason is not just that it seems to be the big loser of Trump&#x2019;s new global politics. Some of us still remember the famous opening of &#x201C;The Communist Manifesto&#x201D;: &#x201C;A specter is haunting Europe &#x2014; the specter of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies...&#x201D; Could we not use the same words to characterize the status of &#x201C;Europe&#x201D; in today&#x2019;s public perception? A specter is haunting the world &#x2014; the specter of Eurocentrism. All the powers of old Europe and of the new world order have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter: Nigel Farage and Russian President Vladimir Putin, AfD and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb&#xE1;n, pro-immigrant anti-racists and protectors of traditional European values, Latin American leftists and Arab conservatives, West Bank Zionists and Chinese &#x201C;patriotic&#x201D; communists&#x2026; There is a profound similarity between Trump&#x2019;s attacks on the triad of environmentalism, political correctness, and LGBT+ rights and the conflict between Russia and Europe. One should ask a simple question: Which civilization today fully embodies the triad attacked by Trump? Only one: European civilization, as the latest form of Enlightenment. In an interview on July 15, 2018, just after a stormy meeting with EU leaders, Trump mentioned the European Union as the first in the line of &#x201C;foes&#x201D; of the U.S., ahead of Russia and China. What Trump tries to do is dissolve European unity, and his efforts are finding an echo in more and more European states (Hungary, Germany, Austria, the U.K.). During the Munich Security Conference, the first act of U.S. Vice President JD Vance was to launch a brutal ideological assault on Europe, accusing its leaders of suppressing free speech, failing to halt illegal migration, and running in fear from voters&#x2019; true beliefs. He openly questioned whether current European values warranted defense by the U.S. &#x201C;Europe&#x201D; today is a terrain of ideological and political struggle. Many ideas of Europe compete and exist in a kind of superposition: the conservative notion of Europe as a space of Christian sovereign states, the technocratic vision of Europe as an economic unity, and more. So which Europe bothers Trump as well as European populists? It is the Europe of transnational unity, the Europe vaguely aware that, to cope with the challenges of our moment, we must move beyond the constraints of nation-states. It is the Europe that also desperately strives to remain faithful to the old Enlightenment motto of solidarity with victims, the Europe aware that humanity is now one &#x2014; that we are all on the same boat (or, as we say, on the same Spaceship Earth), so that others&#x2019; misery is also our problem. This brings us to the scandalous performance called the Munich Security Conference. Timothy Garton Ash raised the question apropos of the Munich conference: &#x201C;Will the peace be like Chamberlain&#x2019;s peace for our time?&#x201D; My answer is that it could turn out to be even worse because our time is a new time of BRICS multipolarity. Both prospects of peace in which Trump&#x2019;s administration is now engaged &#x2014; Gaza and Ukraine &#x2014; are exemplary cases of how the BRICS world that is now emerging will function. Yes, it will be multipolar, but in the sense of a few strong states each defining its own sphere of influence and limiting the sovereignty of its smaller neighbors. Trump&#x2019;s foreign policy fully fits the BRICS world: He admits Ukraine is in Russia&#x2019;s sphere of influence while insisting that Canada, Greenland, Mexico, and Panama are in the U.S. sphere of influence. That&#x2019;s why he immediately engaged in negotiations with Putin, openly excluding Europe from peace talks. Even when Trump and Putin disagree on many things, they already speak the same language. No wonder Trump also said that Russia should rejoin the G7, signaling a general re-normalization of Russia. So it is not just that Europe should unite to become one more big power within the BRICS space; it should become an exception, a place that offers support to the victims of the new BRICS superpowers, each of which defines its own sphere of influence. The announced U.S. takeover of Gaza demonstrates what happens within a superpower&#x2019;s sphere of influence: To put it bluntly, you do what you want, dropping all pretense. When Trump announced his plan to take over Gaza, we found ourselves back at the two-state solution rejected by Israel, only with one minor detail changed: The two states are not Israel and Palestine but Israel and the United States. So what will happen if Trump succeeds and peace prevails in an ethnically cleansed greater Israel? Shakespeare wrote, &#x201C;The evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones.&#x201D; The horror with Trump is even worse: If his evil deeds succeed, they will be remembered as good, as something that brought peace. The peace plan advocated by the U.S. will leave Ukraine caught between two colonizations. The eastern part will be directly annexed by Russia, while the western part will be turned into a de facto economic colony, with large portions of its fertile land already owned by Western corporations, its natural resources plundered, etc. For Trump, a &#x201C;peace guarantee&#x201D; means guarantees from both sides (Ukraine and Russia) that the U.S. will have free access to Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources to cover the costs of its military aid to Ukraine. So Russia will keep (part of) its cake, and the U.S. will eat (part of) it, with Ukraine left with nothing &#x2014; at best, some symbolic titles.

(Roberto Schmidt / AFP via Getty Images)So what can Europe do in what former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis describes as &#x201C;Europe&apos;s last chance to seize autonomy from the U.S.?&#x201D; Many things. Regarding Gaza, Europe could go beyond condemning the Trump takeover and simply organize a large relief operation, bringing food, medical equipment, tents, and other necessities by sea and from Egypt. If the U.S., not just Israel, were to block this aid, the already obvious truth would be even harder to ignore. As for Ukraine, Europe must draw the consequences of what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in Munich on Feb. 15, 2025: &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s be honest. Now we can&#x2019;t rule out the possibility that America might say no to Europe on an issue that threatens it. Many, many leaders have talked about Europe needing its own military &#x2014; an army of Europe.&#x201D; Ukraine now faces a difficult choice between the U.S. and Europe. Until now, it has been able to rely on both, but the crack is now wide open. The U.S. message is clear: negotiations will begin between Washington and Moscow, with Kyiv joining later &#x2014; its role reduced to signing whatever the two major powers decide. The implicit threat? If Kyiv refuses, it will be left to fend for itself &#x2014; alongside Europe, which is conspicuously excluded from the talks, despite the war unfolding on its soil. Statements by U.S. Vice President JD Vance against Europe make it clear that the real target of the U.S.&#x2019; shift on Ukraine is not Ukraine itself but Europe &#x2014; specifically, its emancipatory legacy. The question that lingers behind all this is: Will Putin take the negotiations seriously at all, or are they just another step in Russia&#x2019;s continuous expansion? The answer is not buried deep in Russia&#x2019;s soul &#x2014; it depends largely on how others respond to Russian politics. So, again, what should and could Europe do to assert itself as an autonomous power? First, Europe must clearly (re)define itself &#x2014; and here, problems already arise, with states and populist forces opposing both a united Europe and its emancipatory legacy. Second, part of this redefinition is military autonomy. John Bolton predicts that Trump will withdraw the U.S. from NATO &#x2014; let&#x2019;s hope this happens and NATO becomes the armed force of a united Europe. Third, Europe will have to rethink its economic policy toward greater coordination and&#x2014;to use the prohibited word&#x2014;planning. Large-scale, obligatory planning, not just vague &#x201C;coordination&#x201D; or &#x201C;collaboration,&#x201D; is the only way to confront the crises threatening our very survival. Planning in times of multiple crises must combine features that may appear mutually exclusive: while outcomes cannot be fully predicted, let alone planned, this very unpredictability demands rigorous preparation. In short, even though crises cannot be planned, they require a great deal of planning. After carefully outlining competing tendencies, we must act with full awareness that unexpected consequences may force us to shift course. Does this sound utopian? Absolutely not &#x2014; just look at some of the world&#x2019;s most successful economies, where the state plays a central role in regulating and directing economic activity, from Switzerland and Singapore to South Korea. In other words, the stance Europe should adopt today is one of principled pragmatism. Groucho Marx once said, &#x201C;These are my principles, and if you don&#x2019;t like them&#x2026; well, I have others.&#x201D; This is the formula of unprincipled pragmatism &#x2014; when those in power change their principles merely to stay in power. In the ongoing negotiations about peace in Ukraine, Trump presents himself as a pragmatic realist, urging all sides to choose the lesser evil. But as none other than Jerry Garcia put it, &#x201C;Constantly choosing the lesser of two evils is still choosing evil.&#x201D; On the other hand, there is the dogmatic advocacy of principles &#x2014; sticking to them even at the cost of economic and social disruption. Principled pragmatism does not seek a middle ground between these two extremes; it means something much more precise: when circumstances change radically, we must adjust many of our particular positions precisely to remain faithful to our core principles. For Europe, the principle at stake is unconditional fidelity to the Enlightenment legacy, while the pragmatic aspect involves navigating unpredictable and difficult decisions. Europe is clearly no longer treated as the U.S.&#x2019;s primary ally, so one option to consider is a strategic alliance with China against the emerging axis of the U.S., Russia, and India. Although China is closer to Russia in the war against Ukraine, it has sent clear signals that it does not fully support Russia&#x2019;s aggressive politics. Europe should seize this crisis as an opportunity to reassert itself and regain strength. French President Emmanuel Macron was right to convene an urgent summit of European leaders in Paris, but the real question is how far this group can and will go. Will it be just another declaration &#x2014; an excuse to do nothing? In recent decades, Europe has been full of such declarations. So my conclusion is not cautiously optimistic but pessimistic &#x2014; with a hope that miracles can still happen. The battle is almost lost, but not yet fully lost. We constantly hear that Europe is lagging behind the U.S. and China in digitalization and AI. However, sometimes being late is an advantage: it allows us to watch others make inevitable mistakes and enter the process in a more informed way. It is here that we should recall Nietzsche&#x2019;s maxim: &#x201C;What doesn&#x2019;t kill me makes me stronger.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/slavoj-zizek-fate-no-longer-smiles-on-us-europeans/	2025-02-19T01:31:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-810261630.jpg
EU ambassadors reportedly agree on 16th package of Russia sanctions	EU ambassadors agreed on a new package of sanctions against Russia, targeting aluminum imports and the &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of oil tankers, Euronews reported on Feb. 19. The measures will be formally adopted on Feb. 24, the day marking the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the outlet reported. The EU has already adopted sanctions against some Russian aluminum products, with the latest measures also targeting primary aluminum. Russia represents around 6% of the EU&apos;s imports of the metal. The &quot;shadow fleet&quot; denotes a flotilla of aging and poorly insured ships Russia uses to avoid sanctions on the oil trade. The West believes the vessels are used for other illicit activities, including espionage and sabotage. The news comes as U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that a settlement of the Russia-Ukraine war would include relief from the economic restrictions imposed on Moscow. A Rubio-led delegation met Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and top presidential aide Yuri Ushakov for talks in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, marking the highest-level U.S.-Russia meeting since the outbreak of the full-scale war. EU and Ukrainian representatives were not included in the discussion. The U.S. diplomacy chief said that the EU would later take part in the peace process as it is part of the sanctions regime against Russia but assured European partners that the Western sanctions would remain in place until a settlement is reached. EU Economy and Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis commented that Brussels must take greater control of its sanctions policy against Russia as U.S. priorities shift. The EU approved its 15th sanctions package against Moscow on Dec. 16. The package targeted 54 individuals and 30 organizations from Russia, China, and North Korea, as well as shipping companies facilitating Russia&apos;s crude oil sales.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-ambassadors-reportedly-agree-on-16th-package-of-russia-sanctions/	2025-02-19T00:59:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2151615401.jpg
Russia will try to divide us' — Kallas on US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia	European foreign ministers and EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas spoke to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio after the U.S.-Russia talks in Riyadh, Kallas said on X on Feb. 18. A U.S. delegation met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and top presidential aide Yuri Ushakov in Riyadh on Feb. 18 to initiate talks on ending the war, the first official meeting between the two sides since the full-scale invasion began. Ukraine was excluded entirely from the discussions. &quot;Russia will try to divide us. Let&apos;s not walk into their traps. By working together with the U.S., we can achieve a just and lasting peace &#x2014; on Ukraine&apos;s terms,&quot; Kallas wrote on X. No concrete decisions were announced following the U.S.-Russia talks, but Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the meeting sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe. President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly stressed that no decisions about Ukraine&apos;s future can be made without Ukraine&apos;s participation. Rubio claimed on Feb. 16 that the Riyadh talks were an exploratory first step rather than official negotiations and that Ukraine and Europe would participate once the official discussions began.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-will-try-to-divide-us-kallas-on-us-russia-talks-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-02-19T00:36:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2189729487.jpg

1 killed, 14 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks across multiple Ukrainian oblasts over the past day killed at least one civilian and injured at least 14, including two children, regional authorities reported on Feb. 19. Russia launched 167 Shahed-type drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight and fired two Iskander-M or KN-23 ballistic missiles against Sumy Oblast, the Air Force reported. As of 9 a.m. local time, 106 Russian drones have been shot down over 14 oblasts, while 56 drones were lost without causing damage, according to the statement. A massive drone strike against the energy infrastructure of Odesa and the region injured four people, including a child, and left 160,000 Odesa residents without heating and electricity, according to the authorities. A kindergarten, children&apos;s clinic, and residential buildings were damaged in the attack. The missile strike against Sumy damaged the windows of a non-residential building but inflicted no casualties, the regional military administration reported. In Donetsk Oblast, a Russian attack killed one person and injured two in Kostiantynivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Another civilian was reported injured in Pokrovsk. Seven people, including a child, were injured during Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. Three apartment buildings and eight houses were reportedly damaged in the strikes. Russia regularly attacks Ukrainian regions with missiles, drones, and other weaponry, inflicting civilian casualties on a daily basis.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-127/	2025-02-18T23:53:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-19_01-29-08.jpg
Reported drone strike against Russian oil refinery in Samara Oblast causes fire	Drones attacked the Syzran Oil Refinery in Russia&apos;s Samara Oblast overnight on Feb. 19, Governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev reported on his Telegram channel. Residents posted videos on social media purportedly showing a large blaze at the refinery. Sounds of explosions were reported at around 2:45 a.m. local time. The strike reportedly caused a fire at the refinery. There were no casualties, according to Fedorishchev. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. The Syzran Oil Refinery, lying around 700 kilometers (430 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border, was opened in 1942 and belongs to the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft. The facility &quot;has a processing capacity of 8.9 million tons of oil per year,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation. &quot;Its products include fuel, aviation kerosene, and bitumen,&quot; Kovalenko said while reporting on the attack. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones. In less than two months of 2025, at least 17 Russian oil facilities were attacked by drones, according to the independent Russian Telegram news channel Astra. On Feb. 17, Ukrainian drones, operated by the Special Operations Forces and Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), hit the Ilsky Oil Refinery in Krasnodar Krai and the Kropotkinskaya oil pumping station in the Kavkazsky district of Kuban. The pumping station was taken out of operation due to the strike.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-attack-at-syzran-oil-refinery-in-russias-samara-oblast-causes-fire/	2025-02-18T23:18:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-19-09_00_05.jpeg

Russian strike on Odesa injures 4, causes massive power outages	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. A massive Russian drone strike against the southern city of Odesa and Odesa Oblast overnight on Feb. 19 injured at least four people, including a child, Governor Oleh Kiper reported. All the victims have been hospitalized and are in a condition of moderate severity. A children&apos;s clinic, a kindergarten, high-rise buildings, and cars were damaged in the attack, according to Kiper. The strike resulted in massive power outages in the city, with 14 schools, 13 kindergartens, and over 500 houses left without electricity and heating, said Mayor Hennadii Trukhanov. The governor said that emergency power shutdowns are also in effect elsewhere in Odesa Oblast as all relevant services are working to resolve the situation. Odesa, a port city on Ukraine&#x2019;s Black Sea coast with a population of around 1 million, has been a frequent target of Russian attacks throughout the full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-strike-on-odesa/	2025-02-18T22:16:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-19_08-00-19.jpg
Ukraine and Moldova sign cooperation memorandum on EU accession	Ukraine and Moldova have signed a memorandum of cooperation to strengthen their efforts toward European Union integration and accession, Ukraine&#x2019;s government press service reported on Feb. 18. The agreement, signed by Ukraine&#x2019;s Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna and Moldova&#x2019;s Deputy Prime Minister Cristina Gherasimov, aims to enhance collaboration in the accession process. It outlines key areas of cooperation, including EU enlargement negotiations, legal harmonization, judicial reform, and financial support. The memorandum also promotes the exchange of knowledge and experience in democratic governance, economic policies, and the fight against corruption. &#x201C;Despite the times of global turbulence, European integration remains an unchanging goal for our countries, and we are ready to go to it hand in hand,&#x201D; Stephanishyna said. An action plan will be developed to implement these initiatives through joint meetings, training sessions, and working groups. Ukraine received EU membership candidate status in June 2022. The European Commission recommended launching accession talks with Ukraine and Moldova in November 2023, and the European Council agreed on it a month later. Moldova lies between Ukraine and EU member Romania. As an EU candidate, it aims for membership by 2030 but remains committed to its neutral status. Moldova does not intend to join NATO but plans to strengthen partnerships with various countries and international organizations to bolster its defense capabilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-and-moldova-sign-cooperation-memorandum-on-eu-accession/	2025-02-18T20:48:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2154602469.jpg
Russian Shahed drones more dangerous after modifications, military intelligence reports	Significant modifications have been observed in the Shahed-136 drones that Russia mass produces, Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Feb. 18. The Shahed-136 drones, given the name Geran-2 in Russia, now feature a heavier warhead and additional ballast installed in the UAV design. The upgraded Shahed-136 now carries a 90-kilogram warhead, nearly double the explosive capacity of the previous 50-kilogram version. This significantly enhances its destructive capability. However, due to the heavier payload, the drone&#x2019;s range has decreased from 1,350 kilometers (839 miles) to about 650 kilometers (404 miles), limiting its reach but making it deadlier in closer-range attacks. A sticker labeled &#x201C;agricultural equipment parts&#x201D; in English and Chinese, with a 2024 production date, was found on an antenna used in the drones. Russia is increasingly using Chinese-made electronics to replace Western components, including critical circuit chips. Russia has launched thousands of cheap but effective Iranian-designed Shahed drones against Ukraine since the fall of 2022. Shahed-type drones are often used for strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-shahed-drones-more-dangerous-after-modifications-military-intelligence-reports/	2025-02-18T19:10:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/shahed.jpg
Macron rules out sending French troops to Ukraine's frontlines	France will not send its soldiers to the frontline in Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron said in a television interview on Feb. 18. Macron invited European leaders to an emergency summit in Paris on Feb. 17 in response to U.S. officials saying Europe will not participate in Ukraine peace talks. France is set to host a second summit on Feb. 19 to continue discussions of security guarantees for Ukraine. &quot;France is not preparing to send combat ground troops to the front,&quot; Macron said. In partnership with the British, France is ready to consider sending experts or even a limited number of troops beyond the frontline to demonstrate solidarity and help Ukraine defend itself, Macron said. Supporting NATO membership for Ukraine is among the several ways France is ready to support Ukraine in its battle against Russia&apos;s aggression, Macron added. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer signaled that his country is prepared to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a European-led peacekeeping force on Feb. 16. U.S. President Donald Trump said he is not opposed to European peacekeepers monitoring a ceasefire in Ukraine on Feb. 18. Macron called for Ukraine&apos;s &quot;automatic membership in NATO&quot; in the event of a violation by Russia in a potential ceasefire at an emergency summit held in France on Feb. 17.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-rules-out-sending-french-troops-to-ukraines-frontlines/	2025-02-18T17:17:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1258320110.jpg
Canada wants to participate in talks on Ukraine's security guarantees, official says	Canada is interested in partaking in conversations about security guarantees for Ukraine, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said on Feb. 18. &quot;We want to be part of these conversations regarding security guarantees,&quot; Joly told reporters in Brussels on Feb. 18. &quot;We want to be part of conversations linked to more Canadians being involved in protecting Ukraine.&quot; Joly&apos;s comments come a day before Canada is set to join European countries for a high-level summit in Paris, where leaders will discuss security options for Ukraine. The summit comes on the heels of a Feb. 18 meeting between U.S. and Russian delegations in Saudi Arabia that did not include Ukraine. Canada is asking the U.S. to keep Ukraine at the table in any talks with Russia, Joly said. The West cannot &quot;let Russia go unchecked,&quot; she said. &quot;Many Canadians have been inspired by what is going on in Ukraine because we know they&apos;re fighting for the right reasons.&quot; The election of U.S. President Donald Trump has disrupted the Western alliance supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Trump has said he expects Europe to replace the U.S. as Kyiv&apos;s chief source of military aid, and that the U.S. will not send troops to Ukraine as part of any future Western peacekeeping force. Canada, home to one of the world&apos;s largest Ukrainian populations, has been a key ally of Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Ottawa has provided over $3 billion in military assistance to Kyiv, including advanced weaponry, drones, and vehicles.	https://kyivindependent.com/canada-is-interested-in-being-part-of-protecting-ukraine-official-says/	2025-02-18T16:13:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/joly.jpg
Western intelligence shows Putin not ready for 'real peace,' NBC News reports	Russian President Vladimir Putin is not serious about reaching a peace deal with Ukraine, NBC News reported on Feb. 18, citing unnamed Western intelligence officials and U.S. congressional officials. Russian and U.S. delegations met in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 to discuss potential steps towards peace negotiations. Ukraine was not invited to participate in the talks. &quot;We have zero intelligence that Putin is interested in a real peace deal right now,&quot; a U.S. congressional offical told NBC News. &quot;He thinks he&apos;s winning,&quot; a Western official added. One Western intelligence official said that Putin is unconcerned about high casualties in the Russian army. He is still interested in occupying all of Ukraine and believes Russia can outlast Ukraine and Europe, officials said. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 18 that he was &quot;much more confident&quot; in securing a peace deal following the U.S.-Russia talks in Riyadh. He called the talks &quot;very good&quot; and claimed Russia was ready to begin the peace process. Trump reportedly wants to secure a ceasefire in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine by Easter, which falls on April 20. Over the past week, the U.S. has made several moves to advance its Russia-Ukraine agenda &#x2014; some of which have alarmed European and Ukrainian officials. European leaders met in Paris on Feb. 17 at an emergency summit in response to the U.S. holding bilateral talks with Russia without Ukraine or the EU. France will host a second summit on Feb. 19. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-intelligence-shows-putin-not-ready-for-real-peace-nbc-news-reports/	2025-02-18T15:03:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2161636677.jpg
Massive demolition site' — Trump claims Ukraine in ruins while pressing Zelensky to hold elections	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 18 that he believes Ukraine should hold new elections, as the country has become a &quot;massive demolition site&quot; under President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s wartime leadership. Trump&apos;s comments come after U.S. and Russian officials earlier in the day met in Saudi Arabia &#x2014;&#xA0;without Ukraine &#x2014; to discuss strategies for ending the full-scale war. Ukraine should hold elections because Zelensky holds a &quot;4% approval rating,&quot; Trump alleged without evidence while speaking to reporters on Feb. 18. Recent polling from the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology shows that as of December 2024, 52% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky. The Kremlin has pushed the narrative that Zelensky is an illegitimate leader in its propaganda to discredit the Ukrainian government. The false claim is based on the premise that Zelensky&apos;s first term in office was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. Under the Ukrainian consitution, elections cannot be held during martial law, which went into effect after Russia launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Trump distanced himself from the Russian narrative, claiming that it was his personal opinion that Ukraine should hold elections. &quot;That&apos;s not a Russia thing. That&apos;s something coming from me,&quot; he said. Trump went on to describe the destruction of Ukraine in exaggerated terms, falsely claiming that the majority of its cities had been &quot;blown to smithereens.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t know how anybody even lives there,&quot; he said. Instead of condemning Russia for launching daily attacks against Ukraine for nearly three years, Trump appeared to lay the blame in part on Zelensky&apos;s government. &quot;You have leadership now that&apos;s allowed the war to go on,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/massive-demolition-site-trump-claims-ukraine-in-ruins-while-pressing-zelensky-to-hold-elections/	2025-02-18T14:44:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198556036.jpg
Trump 'much more confident' in peace deal after 'very good' US-Russia talks	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. President Donald Trump is &quot;much more confident&quot; that he will secure a ceasefire deal between Russia and Ukraine following talks between U.S. and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. A U.S. delegation met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and other officials in Riyadh on Feb. 18 to initiate talks on ending the war. Ukraine was excluded entirely from the discussions. &#xA0; Speaking to reporters from his Mar-a-Lago residence, Trump called the talks &quot;very good.&quot; Trump claimed that &quot;a lot more people than you think&quot; had been killed during the war in Ukraine and said that Russia was prepared to end the &quot;barbarianism.&quot; He also dismissed the idea that Ukraine might feel betrayed at its exclusion from the negotiating table in Saudi Arabia. &#xA0; &quot;They&apos;ve had a seat for three years,&quot; he said. The U.S. president said that he was not opposed to the possibility of European peacekeeping forces monitoring an eventual ceasefire in Ukraine. &quot;If they want to do that, that&apos;s great, I&apos;m all for it,&quot; he said. &quot;We won&apos;t have to put any over there, because you know, we&apos;re very far away.&quot; Trump also said the U.S. is not looking to withdraw its own troops stationed in Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-much-more-confident-in-peace-deal-after-very-good-us-russia-talks/	2025-02-18T14:09:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197144376--1-.jpg
Smaller Western force could guarantee security in Ukraine, Guardian reports	A relatively small contingent of Western troops could successfully provide security guarantees to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire with Russia, U.K. defense sources told the Guardian on Feb. 18. Previously, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the Guardian that European partners would need to station 100,000 to 150,000 troops on Ukraine&apos;s front lines to effectively deter Russia. A much smaller European-led peacekeeping force could rely on intelligence, surveillance, and long-range monitoring to enforce a ceasefire rather than large numbers of troops on the ground, unnamed U.K. defense sources said. &#xA0; Such a force could number in the tens of thousands, or even fewer, sources said. In one proposed alternative scenario, long-range monitoring replaced European troops altogether. Other U.K. military sources said that in the most likely scenario, the U.K. would contribute one or two brigades to the European peacekeeping effort in Ukraine. A brigade consists of a few thousand soldiers. European leaders will convene in France on Feb. 19 for a high-level summit on Ukrainian security. The meeting is the second emergency summit on the topic that Paris has hosted this week and comes one day after U.S. and Russian officials met for talks in Saudi Arabia that excluded Ukraine and Europe altogether. During the meeting, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Moscow would not accept the deployment of any NATO troops in Ukraine after a ceasefire deal. French President Emmanuel Macron has been the leading voice behind the proposal of European ground troops as an alternative security guarantee for Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has signaled willingness to deploy British troops as part of such a plan. Participating European nations could send between 25,000 and 30,000 soldiers to Ukraine, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Feb. 17, citing unnamed sources familiar with the discussions. U.K. sources would not confirm this figure while talks were underway, but indicated to the Guardian that a force of that size was more likely than Zelensky&apos;s proposed number. Starmer will visit Washington, D.C. next week, where he is expected to press U.S. President Donald Trump to provide more security assurances for Kyiv to support the European peacekeeping effort. Trump has repeatedly said he wants Europe to shoulder the burden of funding and monitoring Ukrainian security.	https://kyivindependent.com/smaller-western-force-could-guarantee-security-in-ukraine-guardian-reports/	2025-02-18T13:48:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199589329.jpg
Saudi Arabia wanted Ukraine represented at US-Russia talks, Bloomberg reports	Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, wanted President Volodymyr Zelensky to be represented in talks between U.S. and Russian officials in Riyadh, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 18, citing a person with knowledge of the plans. A U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and other officials in Saudia Arabia on Feb. 18, marking the first direct negotiations between the two countries since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion began. Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the talks was not Saudi Arabia&apos;s choice, a source with knowledge of the Saudi preparations told Bloomberg. U.S. and Russian officials reportedly insisted to Mohammed bin Salman that they wanted to hold the meeting without Ukrainians present. The prince had intended to brief Zelensky on Saudi Arabia&apos;s role in hosting the discussions and his own talks with Moscow and Washington. Zelensky postponed a planned visit to Saudia Arabia due to the talks between Russia and the U.S. &quot;We were not invited to this Russian-American meeting in Saudi Arabia. It was a surprise for us. I don&apos;t want any coincidences, so I&apos;m not going to Saudi Arabia,&quot; Zelensky said after a meeting with Turkish President Recep Erdogan. Zelensky said he had spoken with bin Salman and rescheduled his visit to Riyadh for March 10. No concrete decisions were announced following the U.S.-Russia talks, but Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the meeting sparked alarm in Kyiv and across Europe. Zelensky has repeatedly stressed that no decisions about Ukraine&apos;s future can be made without Ukraine&apos;s participation. Rubio claimed on Feb. 16 that the Riyadh talks were an exploratory first step, rather than official negotiations, and that Ukraine and Europe would participate once the official discussions began.	https://kyivindependent.com/saudi-arabia-wanted-ukraine-represented-at-us-russia-talks-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-18T12:39:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199708861.jpg
Plokhy argues in Chornobyl occupation book that Russia’s nuclear blackmail is ‘warning for the future’	The specter of nuclear war cast a long shadow over the 20th century, serving as a reminder of humanity&apos;s capacity for self-destruction. Now, as the world seems to shrug off Russia&#x2019;s nuclear saber-rattling against Ukraine &#x2014; and by extension, all of humanity &#x2014; a haunting question calls for an answer: Have we grown dangerously numb to the threat of a looming apocalypse? Ukrainian historian Serhii Plokhy&#x2019;s book &#x201C;Chernobyl Roulette&#x201D; chronicles the 35-day occupation of the Chornobyl nuclear plant at the start of the full-scale war, highlighting the harrowing day-to-day experiences that the nearly 300 Ukrainians &#x2014; firefighters, operators, and members of the National Guard &#xA0;&#x2014; who were stationed there had to endure. (Plokhy, somewhat perplexingly, distinguishes between the Ukrainian &quot;Chornobyl&quot; and the Russian &quot;Chernobyl,&#x201D; in the book, using Ukrainian spelling to refer to the territory under independent Ukraine, while the latter refers to the nuclear plant and the site of the infamous disaster during Soviet times). Among the recollections from plant workers are instances such as having to persuade the occupying Russian soldiers not to disturb the 1986 disaster site in their misguided quest for &#x201C;proof&#x201D; of hidden nuclear weapons. They believed that there were hidden &#x201C;American laboratories allegedly working on the production of Ukrainian nuclear weapons,&#x201D; as Plokhy writes. After an initial search turned up nothing, the Russian soldiers reportedly considered digging into the mounds erected over the debris from the 1986 nuclear disaster. The plant workers convinced them otherwise, warning that doing so would only put the Russian soldiers at risk of nuclear contamination. As Plokhy puts it, the Russian soldiers realized upon listening to them they &#x201C;would be digging their own radioactive grave.&#x201D; Despite such tense standoffs during the occupation, the bravery and quick thinking of Chornobyl&apos;s workers helped prevent another nuclear disaster. Yet, nearly three years later, Russia continues its nuclear blackmail. The gap between those who rely on logic and those driven by blind propaganda has only widened, leaving little room for persuasion or reason. On Feb. 14, Russia launched a long-range Shahed drone at the nuclear plant, breaking through the &#x201C;sarcophagus,&#x201D; &#xA0;the protective structure covering the remnants of reactor number four, which exploded in the 1986 disaster. Emergency personnel watch as people inspect the damage to the radiation containment shield of Reactor 4 at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant following a Russian drone strike in Chornobyl, Ukraine, on Feb. 14, 2025.

(Andrew Kravchenko / Bloomberg via Getty Images)In the most extensively documented war in modern history, where each passing week unveils a new, seemingly unimaginable tragedy that risks overshadowing the last, a book that chronicles a decisive moment of the war is not only valuable but essential. The erasure of history, after all, is a key force driving Russian soldiers to take up arms and invade a neighboring country, fueling Russian leader Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s delusional claims that Russia&#x2019;s mission is to &quot;denazify&quot; Ukraine. That ignorance was laid bare during the occupation of Chornobyl when Russian soldiers, upon seizing the nuclear plant, demanded that leadership surrender &quot;Banderites&quot; and members of the Right Sector, a coalition of ultra-nationalist groups that have come to be seen as a sort of Ukrainian boogeyman in Russian propaganda. Plokhy describes in the book how Valentyn Heiko, a night shift foreman at the station, inquired about their criteria for identifying such individuals and was met with silence; he boldly suggested they start with him. Plokhy also writes how Heiko was among those who dealt with Russian forces directly during the occupation, striving to negotiate conditions that would allow the Ukrainian staff at the plant to continue their work undisturbed. Defiant yet pragmatic, Heiko told the Russian soldiers at the start of the occupation, &#x201C;Even though I detest you, I swore before the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to uphold nuclear security,&#x201D; and emphasized that Chornobyl was not just any nuclear facility, but a post-accident plant with unique, critical concerns. The Russian capture of Chornobyl had been swift and without violence. As Plokhy highlights throughout the book, the plant&#x2019;s workers were constantly &#x201C;trying to balance loyalty to their families, their homeland, and innocent civilians in Ukraine and beyond who would suffer the consequences of a nuclear accident should it occur.&#x201D; Russian soldiers&apos; threats to attack the Chornobyl plant &#x2014; despite the 1986 disaster being a shared history between Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus &#x2014; left many Ukrainians who came of age during that period in disbelief. &#x201C;We liquidated the (consequences of the) accident together. For them to do this to us now just makes me feel sorry for (those people),&#x201D; Ivan Kovalchuk, a firefighter involved in the 1986 cleanup, remarked.

(Andrey Borodulin / AFP via Getty Images)Southward, in Enerhodar, Zaporizhzhia Oblast &#x2014; a city where nearly a quarter of the 53,000 residents worked at Europe&#x2019;s largest nuclear plant &#x2014; efforts unfolded to defend the plant and prevent another occupation of a nuclear facility. Plokhy recounts how the initial Russian attempt to seize the city was thwarted by defiant locals who outright rejected them. Russian forces, &quot;surprised not to have been welcomed,&quot; initially turned back before launching their assault. As Russian forces opened fire on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Plokhy writes, its employees scrambled to reduce the power level of an active reactor, broadcasting a desperate plea over the loudspeaker: &#x201C;Stop shooting at a dangerous nuclear facility! Stop shooting immediately! You are threatening the security of the whole world!&#x201D; The warning went unheeded. Citing reports from Ukrainian military intelligence, Plokhy also writes about how Russian occupiers mined the area surrounding the plant. Those remaining in Enerhodar are forced to take Russian passports under threat of violence. One of the most striking critiques in Plokhy&apos;s book is his examination of the IAEA&apos;s muted response at the onset of the full-scale war. While Ukrainian nuclear plant workers pushed themselves to the brink, both physically and mentally, to avert a global catastrophe, the IAEA initially refrained from directly condemning Russia for its nuclear blackmail, a silence that raises troubling questions about accountability. One example is Director General Rafael Grossi&#x2019;s statement on Feb. 25, 2022, when he referred to &#x201C;unidentified armed forces&#x201D; at the nuclear plant. While there were technically no insignia identifying the soldiers as Russian citizens, as was the case during the illegal annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, &#x201C;everyone knew who the occupiers were&#x201D; at that point, as Plokhy writes. The IAEA &#x201C;would take not hours or days but weeks&#x201D; to condemn Russia by name. Even in the aftermath of the recent Feb. 14 attack, which penetrated the sarcophagus, the IAEA did nothing to condemn Russia. In a post on X, the official account&#x2019;s statement only read that &#x201C;the IAEA team at the Chornobyl site heard an explosion&#x201D; and that they &#x201C;were informed&#x201D; that a drone had struck the roof. One possible explanation for the IAEA&#x2019;s measured response could lie in its relationship with Russia itself. As Plokhy points out, Russia plays a significant role as a major donor to the IAEA. Moreover, one of Director General Grossi&apos;s six deputy directors, Mikhail Chudakov, is a seasoned figure from Russia&apos;s nuclear industry. Chudakov&apos;s role at the IAEA has raised significant concerns about conflicts of interest, particularly due to his leadership of its Department of Nuclear Energy. This department, which oversees the expansion of nuclear energy into new markets, aligns with the strategic interests of companies like Rosatom, the Russian state-owned nuclear energy giant with which Chudakov had prior professional associations. Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) meets International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi (R) in Sochi, Russia on March 6, 2024. (Kremlin Press Office / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images)&#x201C;It was only the outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian War and Rosatom&#x2019;s involvement in the takeover of the Chernobyl nuclear plant that attracted global attention to Grossi&#x2019;s deputy,&#x201D; Plokhy writes. The Swiss energy counselor wrote to Grossi, urging that Chudakov be excluded from any dealings related to Ukraine and that his access to classified information be restricted. As of this book review, however, Chudakov remains one of Grossi&#x2019;s deputy director generals and continues to lead the IAEA&#x2019;s Department of Nuclear Energy. The success of the Ukrainian counteroffensive in northern Kyiv Oblast led to the Russian withdrawal from Chornobyl by the end of March 2022. Simultaneously, several Russian soldiers were diagnosed with acute radiation poisoning, as it was later revealed that they had been digging fortifications in the Red Forest, one of the most highly contaminated areas on the planet. Russian soldiers&#x2019; ignorance led them to believe they were invading Ukraine to &quot;save&quot; its people, just as they were wrong in their understanding of the plant&apos;s operations, convinced that American-supplied plutonium for Ukrainian nuclear weapons could be stored there without the knowledge of international organizations like the IAEA. Despite the plant workers repeatedly exposing their ignorance during the occupation, the Russian soldiers remained steadfast in their delusions, even attempting &#x2014; unsuccessfully &#x2014; to recruit some as collaborators. Although another catastrophe at Chornobyl has been avoided, the ongoing Russian aerial attacks and the occupation of Europe&apos;s largest nuclear plant in Ukraine&apos;s Zaporizhzhia Oblast underscore the precariousness of the situation and Russia&#x2019;s continued nuclear blackmail against the world. Meanwhile, Russia&apos;s continued membership in organizations like the United Nations and the IAEA raises doubts about the effectiveness and integrity of the international institutions meant to avoid such conflicts. Regardless of how the coming weeks and months unfold in the war, Plokhy warns that Russia&apos;s nuclear threats serve as a stark &#x201C;warning for the future&#x201D; in an increasingly conflict-ridden world.

US-Russia talks on Ukraine peace — why Putin will be ‘very happy’	Russia on Feb. 18 ended years of political isolation sparked by its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as a delegation of Kremlin officials met with their U.S. counterparts in Saudi Arabia to discuss how to end the very war it started. The talks ended with little in the way of concrete agreements, but the very fact it happened &#x2014; without Ukraine &#x2014; is a huge win for Moscow. &quot;Even if nothing comes of it, the fact that Russian and American senior officials sat down together behind closed doors and talked about this issue without the Ukrainians there &#x2014; that&apos;s huge,&quot; Jenny Mathers, a Russian political expert and lecturer at the U.K.&apos;s Aberystwyth University, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;That&apos;s absolutely huge, and (Russian President Vladimir) Putin must be very, very happy about all of that.&quot; The talks in Saudi Arabia marked the first direct negotiations between the U.S. and Russia since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion began, with Russia&apos;s delegation, led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, sitting down with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials. &quot;This is only the very tentative start of a bilateral process,&quot; former U.K. Defense Attache in Moscow, John Foreman, told the Kyiv Independent, stressing that &quot;nothing much&quot; had been decided as they&apos;re &quot;talks, not negotiations.&quot; The U.S. delegation was keen to stress that today&apos;s talks were just the start of a &quot;long and difficult journey, though Rubio said he is &quot;convinced&quot; Russia is &quot;willing to begin to engage in a serious process&quot; to end its full-scale invasion. Speaking after the talks concluded, Russia&apos;s Lavrov said three main points had been agreed on &#x2014; restoring embassy staffing for further diplomatic missions, appointing representatives to further the negotiation process, and creating the necessary conditions for restarting U.S.-Russia relations. Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during an awarding ceremony at Moscow State University in Moscow, Russia on Jan. 24, 2025. (Contributor / Getty Images)&quot;Putin will be glad with the photo op and Russia being portrayed as a superpower on the level of the U.S. when it&#x2019;s nowhere near,&quot; Foreman said. The initial response from the Russian delegation was rather muted, with Yuri Ushakov, an advisor to Putin, saying the talks were &quot;not bad,&quot; but it was &quot;hard to say&quot; if the two sides&apos; interests were converging. &quot;We have agreed to take account of each other&apos;s interests and develop bilateral relations, since both Moscow and Washington are interested in this,&quot; he added. While the talks were underway, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Putin is ready for talks with Zelensky, but &quot;legal aspects related to his legitimacy&quot; must be considered. Russia has widely used the claim that Zelensky is illegitimate in its propaganda to discredit the Ukrainian government. The false claim is based on the premise that Zelensky&apos;s first term in office was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. But Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and the subsequent declaration of martial law in Ukraine has meant elections have been impossible to hold and his term has been extended, something constitutional lawyers say is allowed under Ukrainian law. Speaking after the talks ended, Lavrov continued the attacks on Zelensky, saying that he and his team should be &quot;calmed down&quot; following a Ukrainian drone strike on a pumping station in Russia&apos;s Kuban region on Feb. 17.

Mathers said Lavrov being able to say such things on the world stage was &quot;particularly galling,&quot; adding that how the talks were being conducted gave the appearance that there is &quot;absolutely no acknowledgement by the Americans that Russia is the party in the wrong.&quot; Speaking after the talks concluded, Rubio was keen to stress that today&apos;s talks were the &quot;first step of a long and difficult journey, but an important one.&quot; He added that &quot;these are the kind of things&quot; that advance through &quot;hard and difficult diplomacy in closed rooms over a period of time.&quot; &quot;In order for a conflict to end, everyone in that conflict has to be okay with it, it has to be acceptable to them,&quot; he said, adding Trump &quot;wants it to end in a way that&apos;s sustainable and enduring, not that leads to another conflict in two or three years.&quot; But at the same time, U.S negotiator Mike Waltz said Trump is determined to move very quickly on talks over a potential peace deal in Ukraine, adding that &quot;an endless war in Europe is not acceptable to Trump.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any big surprises except that Marco Rubio keeps looking more and more out of his depth,&quot; Mathers said, adding he looks like he &quot;really wishes he were somewhere else.&quot; &quot;Every expression on his face is like &apos;gosh, I&apos;ve fallen in with a bad crowd, haven&apos;t I?&apos; It looks like somebody who&apos;s kind of being held hostage by the mob,&quot; she added. Rubio also suggested that lifting sanctions against Russia would be part of any peace process, saying that &quot;concessions&quot; would have to be made by &quot;all sides&quot; to bring an end to &quot;any conflict.&quot; He added that the EU would &quot;have to be at the table at some point because they have sanctions as well that have been imposed.&quot; Speaking at a press conference in Turkey where he&apos;d arrive the night before, President Volodymyr Zelensky said after the talks ended that he was canceling a planned visit to Saudi Arabia where he had been expected to hold separate talks with U.S. officials. &quot;We were not invited to this Russian-American meeting in Saudi Arabia. It was a surprise for us. I don&apos;t want any coincidences, so I&apos;m not going to Saudi Arabia,&quot; he said. Zelensky reiterated that no decisions about Ukraine&apos;s future can be made without Kyiv&apos;s involvement.

Please, you can discuss anything, but you can&apos;t make a decision on how to end the war in Ukraine without Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said. Explaining how the day&apos;s events were perceived in Kyiv, Ukrainian lawmaker and head of the Ukrainian parliament&apos;s foreign affairs committee, Oleksandr Merezhko, said the Kremlin&apos;s comments about Zelensky&apos;s &quot;legitimacy&quot; and Lavrov&apos;s attacks were a deliberate ploy, made while his top officials were front and center on the international stage. &quot;Russia wants to make Ukraine hold elections before the end of war in the hope that it will undermine unity and stability within the country,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Putin is not going to change. While he stays in power he is bent on destroying Ukraine one way or another, he said, adding: &quot;It is absolutely senseless to negotiate with him. He is using negotiations with the U.S. to pretend that he is not politically isolated.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-russia-talks-on-ukraine-peace-why-putin-will-be-very-happy/	2025-02-18T12:23:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199658460.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 14	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 14 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Feb. 10&#x2013;Feb. 16, 2025. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Selection commission completes initial review of candidates for Bureau of Economic Security director Last week, the selection commission wrapped up its preliminary review of applications for the position of Bureau of Economic Security director. The commission decided to reach out to several candidates whose documentation requires additional details or clarification, particularly concerning their previous experience. This procedural step is part of the technical screening process, after which the commission will determine which candidates will advance to the next stage of the competitive selection process. Parliament backs ARMA reform bill in first reading Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, the Verkhovna Rada has approved, in its first reading, draft law #12374-d, which introduces reforms to the Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA). The draft law, drafted by Anti-Corruption Policy Committee Chair Anastasiia Radina and Economic Committee Deputy Chair Oleksii Movchan, was supported as the committee&#x2019;s consolidated version. The legislation outlines a competitive selection process for ARMA&#x2019;s leadership, giving international experts a decisive vote in the selection commission. Under the Ukraine Facility, the bill must be adopted in full by March 31, 2025, to fulfill the country&apos;s reform commitments. Ukrainian Parliament approves Energoatom&apos;s purchase of Russian-made nuclear reactors from Bulgaria The Verkhovna Rada has passed an amendment to draft law #11392, granting state-owned Energoatom permission to purchase Russian-made nuclear reactors from Bulgaria for the Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant (KhNPP). The deal involves acquiring two Rosatom reactors initially intended for the unfinished Belene Nuclear Power Plant in Bulgaria. Energoatom plans to spend $1 billion on the purchase for further construction of reactor units #3 and #4 at the KhNPP. This decision was made despite the fact that lawmakers haven&#x2019;t yet passed the necessary legislation authorizing the actual construction of the new units. Ukraine&#x2019;s National Security Council imposes price regulation on essential medicines Ukraine&#x2019;s National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) has announced a 30% price reduction on the country&#x2019;s most essential and in-demand medications, effective March 1, 2025. Moreover, the decision includes a recommendation for the Office of the Prosecutor General to work with law enforcement agencies in identifying and preventing potential financial abuses and non-transparent pricing practices in the pharmaceutical sector. Ukrainian business supports general course of reforms but doubts anti-corruption efforts, &#x2013; key findings from the Technology of Progress&apos;s business survey The NGO Technology of Progress and the Gradus research agency conducted a survey of 75 owners, executives, and top management of medium and large businesses in Ukraine. Sixty-one percent of respondents believe that Ukraine is moving in the right direction in implementing reforms in line with international commitments (to the EU, IMF, World Bank, etc.). This indicates a relatively high level of trust in the overall course of reforms in Ukraine. Additionally, 53% assess reform progress in 2024 as &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;high,&quot; while only 14% believe there has been no progress. (Technology of Progress NGO and Gradus research agency)At the same time, survey results reflect a lack of business confidence in the government&#x2019;s anti-corruption efforts. Fifty-three percent of respondents do not believe that the level of corruption in Ukraine decreased in 2024. Moreover, 63% of respondents feel negative pressure from the current economic environment.These results indicate significant economic challenges faced by businesses in Ukraine, likely linked to macroeconomic instability, high business costs, and the impact of the war.

Ukraine war latest: Russia, US conclude Ukraine peace talks in Saudi Arabia, Kremlin advisor calls them 'not bad'	Key developments on Feb. 18: A member of Russia&apos;s delegation that met with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 to discuss ending the war in Ukraine has said the talks were &quot;not bad,&quot; but it was &quot;hard to say&quot; if the two sides&apos; interests were converging. Speaking to the pro-Kremlin Channel One Russia, Yuri Ushakov, an advisor to Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin, said it was a &quot;very serious discussion of all the issues we wanted to touch upon.&quot; &quot;We have agreed to take account of each other&apos;s interests and develop bilateral relations, since both Moscow and Washington are interested in this,&quot; he added. A Russian delegation led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met a U.S. delegation led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, the first official face-to-face contact between the two sides since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Speaking after the talks, U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the meeting was &quot;an important step forward,&quot; but added: &quot;One phone call followed by one meeting is not sufficient to establish enduring peace.&quot; Ushakov also said a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin were discussed, but it was unlikely to take place next week as had been previously speculated. Yet, U.S negotiator Mike Waltz stressed that Trump is determined to move very quickly on talks over a potential peace deal in Ukraine, adding that &quot;an endless war in Europe is not acceptable to Trump.&quot; Separate teams of negotiators from the United States and Russia will start communicating on Ukraine &quot;in due course,&quot; according to Ushakov. The participants of the meeting in Riyadh also decided to restore embassy staffing for further diplomatic missions. &quot;We&apos;re going to need to have vibrant diplomatic missions that are able to function normally in order to be able to continue these conduits,&quot; Rubio said. Answering a question about Europe&apos;s absence in Saudi Arabia, Rubio siad that &quot;no one is being sidelined here.&quot; He added that &quot;some very positive things for the United States, for Europe, for Ukraine, for the world&quot; could emerge, but &quot;the conflict&quot; must end first. &quot;In order for a conflict to end, everyone in that conflict has to be okay with it, it has to be acceptable to them,&quot; Rubio said. &quot;Today is the first step of a long and difficult journey, but an important one,&quot; he added. Russia and the U.S. also held separate talks on economic cooperation, including on global energy prices, Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev told Reuters. Dmitriev added that the recent meeting between Russia and the U.S. has &quot;rejected&quot; the logic of talks under the Joe Biden administration. &quot;There&apos;s a new logic where we need to talk and understand what we agree upon and if there are differences we need to understand what they are,&quot; he said. Though the U.S. and Russia met without Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky will also head to Saudi Arabia this week. NBC reported that the intention is for the U.S. to host a bilateral meeting with Russia, followed by a bilateral meeting with Ukraine, and culminating with talks together. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Feb. 18 that he had postponed his visit to Saudi Arabia amid talks between Russia and the United States. &quot;We were not invited to this Russian-American meeting in Saudi Arabia. It was a surprise for us. I don&apos;t want any coincidences, so I&apos;m not going to Saudi Arabia,&quot; Zelensky said during a briefing following a meeting with Turkish President Recep Erdogan. Zelensky reiterated that no decisions about Ukraine&apos;s future can be made without Kyiv&apos;s involvement. He also said he expects U.S. officials to visit Ukraine, confirming that Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, will arrive in Kyiv on Feb. 19. &quot;Any country has a bilateral track with other countries. Please, you can discuss anything, but you can&apos;t make a decision on how to end the war in Ukraine without Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said. The president also announced that he had spoken with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and rescheduled his visit to Riyadh for Mar. 10. In a Feb. 17 interview with German media network ARD, Zelensky warned against a hastily negotiated peace deal and reaffirmed that Ukraine would not accept an agreement brokered without its participation. Ukraine&apos;s military has received over 10,000 applications from volunteer recruits aged 18 to 24 following the introduction of lucrative &quot;special contracts,&quot; Defense Ministry Spokesperson Dmytro Lazutkin said on Ukrainian TV on Feb. 17. The contracts, aimed at recruiting additional military personnel who are not subject to mobilization, provide a number of benefits, including a Hr 1 million ($24,000) annual salary, 0% interest mortgage rates, and free higher education. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry also said those who complete one year of service would be allowed to travel abroad. Currently, with a few exemptions, all men aged 18-60 are prohibited from travelling overseas while martial law is in place. U.S. lawmakers and NATO allies have continuously urged Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 to address manpower shortages. Currently, Ukrainian men aged 25 to 60 are subject to conscription. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s National Security Advisor Michael Waltz said in January that Ukraine &quot;could generate hundreds of thousands of new soldiers&quot; if it lowered its conscription age to 18. Kyiv has long opposed U.S. pressure to lower the draft age, with President Volodymyr Zelensky arguing it would harm Ukraine&apos;s future prospects. The introduction of &quot;special contracts&quot; appears to be an attempt by Kyiv to bridge the gap with a compromise solution &#x2014; entice young people to sign up voluntarily, boosting the armed forces&apos; manpower, while avoiding expanding forced mobilization. A one-year contract option would likely appeal to those interested in contributing to the war effort for a limited period. The Ukrainian military faces a critical manpower shortage, struggling to replenish infantry gaps left by heavy losses in battle-hardened brigades. Two explosions took place on the oil tanker Seajewel, moored in the Italian city of Savona on Feb. 18, with the vessel allegedly transporting Russian oil to Europe, Italian publication IVG reported. The cause of the blasts remains unknown, but initial evidence suggests possible sabotage, including damage below the waterline and a fish kill near the tanker. The Seajewel, part of Moscow&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; used to evade sanctions, had previously loaded oil in Russia three times in 2024, according to Ukrainian Pravda (UP). The crew reported hearing two loud bangs, and the tanker&apos;s hull showed concave damage, indicating the possible placement of explosive devices. UP revealed that the tanker had recently unloaded in the Romanian port of Constanta after arriving from Turkey and was reportedly heading to Novorossiysk, Russia, for reloading. The Savona Coast Guard is investigating the incident with divers, though no further details have been released. Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; consists of aging tankers used to circumvent sanctions, including those imposed by the EU, U.K., and U.S. Ukraine recently sanctioned captains of these vessels, targeting Russian and Iranian nationals involved in illicit oil exports. A growing portion of Russia&apos;s oil tanker fleet is being forced to reflag as sanctions intensify, disrupting Moscow&apos;s oil export logistics and forcing tankers to re-register in less reputable jurisdictions, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 23. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Feb. 18 that Moscow had not seen a three-point peace plan and warned that Russia would not accept the deployment of Western troops in Ukraine. The alleged plan, which reportedly includes a ceasefire, elections in Ukraine, and a final peace agreement, was revealed by Fox News Senior White House Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich on X. &quot;I have not seen this information, I have not seen these reports,&quot; Lavrov said at a press conference following U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia. Lavrov also warned that Russia would not accept the deployment of NATO military personnel in Ukraine after any potential peace deal. He claimed that even if Western troops operated under EU or national flags, rather than NATO&apos;s, it would still be a &quot;direct threat&quot; to Russia. &quot;The absorption of Ukraine by the North Atlantic Alliance is a direct threat to the interests of the Russian Federation, a direct threat to our sovereignty,&quot; he claimed. Kyiv said that strong security guarantees are essential for any peace agreement. The deployment of peacekeepers in Ukraine has been considered as one possible option. Lavrov further escalated rhetoric against President Volodymyr Zelensky, suggesting that he and his team should be &quot;calmed down&quot; following a Ukrainian drone strike on a pumping station in Russia&apos;s Kuban region. &quot;This should only strengthen everyone in the opinion that this can&apos;t go on, that this man and his entire team should be calmed down, given a slap on the wrist,&quot; he said. Europe is ready and willing to take a leadership role in providing Ukraine with security guarantees, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte wrote on Feb. 17 on X. Rutte&apos;s remarks came after French President Emmanuel Macron hosted a Paris summit of European powers. The summit was held before the beginning of the U.S.-Russia talks on ending the war in Ukraine. &quot;Ready and willing. That&apos;s my take from today&apos;s meeting in Paris,&quot; Rutte wrote. &quot;Europe is ready and willing to step up. To lead in providing security guarantees for Ukraine. Ready and willing to invest a lot more in our security. The details will need to be decided, but the commitment is clear,&quot; Rutte added. During the Paris meeting, the participants discussed the defense capabilities that Europe could provide to Ukraine to ensure reliable security guarantees, including a plan for Ukraine&apos;s &quot;automatic membership in NATO&quot; in the event of Russia&apos;s clear ceasefire violation, according to The Guardian. European leaders are concerned about the potential imposition of neutrality on Ukraine and joint U.S.-Russian powers&apos; sharing of agreed-upon spheres of influence following the negotiations. The European Union must take greater control of its sanctions policy against Russia as U.S. priorities shift, EU Economy and Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said on Feb. 18. &quot;With the current Trump administration, the EU will need to take issues related to the bloc&apos;s security more into its own hands. That also concerns sanctions policy,&quot; Dombrovskis said during a meeting with journalists in Brussels. The commissioner added that work on preparing the 16th package of sanctions against Russia is ongoing. His remarks come as U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio hinted that the EU would eventually need to be involved in discussions over sanctions relief as part of ongoing talks with Russia. &quot;The European Union is going to have to be at the table at some point because they have sanctions as well,&quot; Rubio said after U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia. The Group of Seven (G7) nations agreed to link any future tightening of sanctions against Russia to the progress of upcoming peace negotiations on Feb. 15. The EU approved its 15th sanctions package against Moscow on Dec. 16. The package targeted 54 individuals and 30 organizations from Russia, China, and North Korea, as well as shipping companies facilitating Russia&apos;s crude oil sales. France plans to host another high-level meeting on Feb. 19 to discuss Ukraine and European security, expanding participation to countries left out of the initial summit, Reuters reported on Feb. 18, citing diplomatic sources. French President Emmanuel Macron convened the first Paris summit on Feb. 17, bringing together leaders from Europe&apos;s largest nations and Britain, as well as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and top EU officials. The talks focused on Ukraine&apos;s security, its potential NATO membership, and Europe&apos;s broader defense strategy. According to Reuters, Paris has now invited additional European countries and Canada to join the upcoming meeting, either in person or via video link. The expanded guest list includes Norway, Canada, the Baltic states, the Czech Republic, Greece, Finland, Romania, Sweden, and Belgium. The move follows recent U.S.-Russia negotiations in Saudi Arabia, marking the first direct talks between Washington and Moscow since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Russian delegation, led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, met with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky postponed his planned visit to Saudi Arabia, reiterating that no decisions about Ukraine&apos;s future should be made without Kyiv&apos;s involvement. The role of European nations in the negotiations with Russia remains unclear. Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, previously said that Europe would not be directly involved in the talks but assured that its interests would be considered.

Ukraine summit in Paris exposes divisions, lack of coherent plan, experts say	The emergency Ukraine summit held in Paris by European leaders on Feb. 17 exposed divisions between European countries, highlighting how they have so far failed to agree on a coherent plan for supporting Kyiv, analysts have told the Kyiv Independent. French President Emmanuel Macron convened the summit after Brussels and Kyiv were sidelined from negotiations in Saudi Arabia on ending Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, as concerns mount that both Europe and Kyiv may be left without U.S. support. Adding to tensions on the continent, U.S. Vice President JD Vance stunned those watching on Feb. 14 when his speech at the Munich Security Conference turned into a searing attack on Europe&apos;s ideals and a call to embrace far-right political parties. The Paris summit was attended by leaders of Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands, and Denmark. The participants considered increasing defense spending, providing security guarantees to Kyiv, and sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine. Speaking after the summit, Macron reaffirmed the need for strong security guarantees for Ukraine, warning that a ceasefire without them risks collapsing like the failed Minsk agreements. &quot;Europeans must invest better, more, and together in their security and defense &#x2014; both for today and for the future,&quot; he said in his statement on X. Yet there were no concrete agreements, and little consensus among statements issued by others in attendance. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that he is &quot;prepared to consider committing British forces on the ground, alongside others, if there is a lasting peace agreement.&quot; German Chancellor Olaf Scholz gives a statement following the informal summit of European leaders on the situation in Ukraine and European security, at the German Embassy in Paris, on Feb. 17, 2025. (Behrouz Mehri / AFP via Getty Images)But German Chancellor Olaf Scholz argued that it was &quot;highly inappropriate&quot; to discuss sending peacekeepers before a specific peace plan is approved. Here&#x2019;s what five European experts think about the results of the Paris summit and what Europe should do next to support Ukraine: European Council on Foreign Relations Looking at the outcome of the Paris meeting, it is still clear that Europeans do not agree on how, and to what degree to support Ukraine, particularly if they need to defy the United States to do so. This extends to issues beyond just the headline question of deploying European troops to Ukraine and extends to issues such as security guarantees, the level and kind of military assistance, reconstruction aid, and even the definition of victory. Unless and until they reach such agreement, Europeans will not have much if any say in the negotiations. Whether they feel they need that and whether they are willing to put in more resources and make compromises with their EU partners is, I guess, a question they need to ask themselves. a researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs We Europeans still have difficulties accepting that &#x2014; at least for now and for this presidency &#x2014; the United States is no longer a reliable ally, and is possibly even an opponent. Regime change has happened in Washington, however, and the informal summit in Paris tried to come to terms with the implications &#x2014; that Europe will have to do a lot more to support Ukraine. The emphasis here is on &quot;do,&quot; rather than just &quot;say&quot; things that help Ukraine. Europe&apos;s problem is that it will find that difficult even if it wants to support Ukraine, beyond providing money &#x2014; too many countries in Europe have neglected their defenses and their defense industries for too long. a defense and security expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations My sense is that European leaders are converging on a set of financial measures to mobilize additional money for defense. The goal is to allow European states to boost defense spending to build up their own armed forces and sustain military aid to Ukraine as US support for both Ukraine and European security more broadly is perceived to be crumbling. Two big questions remained unanswered in Paris on Monday. One, will Europeans deploy troops to Ukraine, under which conditions, and with what mandate? And two, what is the right balance to strike between favoring the European defense industry to assert greater sovereignty from the U.S., and procuring equipment from the U.S. to keep the Trump administration engaged in European security affairs? We&#x2019;ll probably learn more next week after Germany&#x2019;s Feb. 23 federal election. It seems that the democratic parties of the political center have agreed on the contours of a plan to reform Germany&#x2019;s debt break to boost defense spending sooner rather than later and to expand Germany&#x2019;s role as a key security provider in Europe. But they&#x2019;re keeping their cards close to their chest to not add fuel to the populist fire being stirred by the far-right and far-left parties, both of which are decidedly pro-Russian.

(Christophe Petit Tesson / AFP via Getty Images)Pavel Havliceka research fellow at the Association for International Affairs The meeting was a clear political reaction to the Munich Security Conference that brought some bad news for the EU and Ukraine, and demanded a political follow-up at the highest level. Only some of the EU countries were invited, especially those that are prominent and powerful enough as well as capable of delivering financial support and dedication to Ukraine. But the results are mixed, exposing the existing divisions among the EU countries and states that want to join the peace-keeping efforts in Ukraine, and those that remain rather lukewarm on this. At the same time, the wide consensus was on more military spending and investments as well as maintaining political unity and a strong Transatlantic bond. At the same time, it is clear that Europe needs both more time and vigilance to respond to the ongoing challenges, and to stand up to the challenges from Russia and more pressure from the United States too. This is both the case when speaking to the general public in the EU as well as when securing additional financial support, investments, and more projects and military capabilities. a senior fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs Yes, Europe certainly still needs to do much more. My expectation from the meeting on Monday would have been that the participants agree to come up with a draft plan within the next week or two of how European countries can provide security guarantees for Ukraine. Since it is unrealistic to do this without some form of U.S. support, the plan should indicate where this support is essential, i.e. what would be the minimal amount of support needed from the U.S. for the plan to succeed. It should also detail what the Europeans are able to provide. This needs to be a realistic assessment but also one which &quot;hurts,&quot; i.e. where the European countries leave their comfort zone and pledge to provide the maximum possible support. Even if this requires them to take actions which will negatively affect their own security, they need to do it, because their security is being protected in Ukraine, and if they fail to help protect it there then they will have to sacrifice much more in order to defend it on their own territory or that of allied NATO countries. Even if (U.S. President) Donald Trump is unpredictable, his statements recently and during his first administration leave no doubt that he expects Europe to do more for its own security. So relying on some sort of vague hope that he might change his mind and continue to provide the same amount of support for European security as has previously been the case is naive and dangerous. Unfortunately we did not see any sort of plan, or indication of a forthcoming plan, coming out of the meeting in Paris. European leaders need to realize that in order to have a seat at tables they consider relevant for them in the future, they will need to back up their rhetoric with much more convincing action, and they will need to begin immediately. defense and security senior programme manager at Globsec The interesting decision not to invite all EU leaders was poorly received by the rest of the bloc, once again providing figures like (Hungarian Prime Minister) Viktor Orban and (Slovakian Prime Minister) Robert Fico with an opportunity to push narratives of conflicting interests and divisions among EU member states. The real danger here is that public perception may shift toward believing in a division within the EU &#x2014; between &quot;warmongers&quot; and &quot;peace supporters.&quot; At this stage, rather than wake up calls, we should talk about &quot;final call&quot; for the EU to prove its voice matters and support Ukraine in the negotiation talks. Years of effort to back Ukraine&#x2019;s fight for survival would be wasted if a poor deal is reached &#x2014; affecting the credibility of the EU project for years to come. This is the EU&#x2019;s final call to show leadership. It is up to (EU Chief) Ursula von der Leyen to engage with the U.S. and ensure that any agreement reached serves Ukraine&#x2019;s best interests &#x2014; rather than merely ticking an item off a diplomatic to &#x2014; do list. It is time to honour the promises the EU has made, for Ukraine, for Europe and for all of us believing in a democratic free world.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-summit-in-paris-exposes-divisions-lack-of-coherent-plan-experts-say/	2025-02-18T11:49:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199562091.jpg
EU plans $6.2 billion military aid package for Ukraine ahead of US-Russia talks, Politico reports	The European Union is discussing a military aid package for Ukraine worth at least 6 billion euros ($6.2 billion) to bolster Kyiv&apos;s strategic position ahead of U.S.-led talks with Russia, Politico reported on Feb. 18, citing sources familiar with the matter. The package is expected to include 1.5 million artillery shells, air defense systems, and equipment for military brigades. According to Politico, the value of the aid could increase to 10 billion euros ($10.8 billion) depending on individual EU member states&apos; contributions. The initiative comes as U.S. President Donald Trump urges Europe to take on a greater role in security and military support for Ukraine. EU nations will have the option to contribute either financially or through direct military assistance, with contributions expected to be proportional to their gross national income. EU foreign ministers are expected to discuss the package at their upcoming meeting in Brussels next week. Unanimous approval is unlikely due to opposition from Hungary, meaning the aid may be structured as a coalition of willing countries rather than a formal EU-wide initiative. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, widely regarded as the EU&apos;s most Russia-friendly leader, has consistently opposed sanctions on Moscow and criticized military aid for Ukraine, arguing it prolongs the war. Ukraine remains heavily reliant on U.S. military assistance, but funds previously approved by Congress during the former U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration are nearly depleted. Future weapons aid is now contingent on congressional approval and Trump&apos;s decisions, giving him significant leverage in shaping U.S. support for Ukraine. Zelensky has estimated that U.S. weapons account for about 40% of Ukraine&apos;s total arms supply, underscoring Washington&apos;s continued role in Kyiv&apos;s defense despite efforts to ramp up domestic production and secure greater European military support.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-plans-6-2-billion-military-ukraine-aid-package-ahead-of-us-russia-talks-politico-reports/	2025-02-18T11:33:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1494251171-1.jpeg
As Trump’s Ukraine envoy is partially sidelined, Middle East negotiator takes lead in Russia talks	As U.S.-Russian talks on ending the war in Ukraine kicked off in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, appears to have been partially sidelined from the negotiations. Kellogg will focus on talks with Ukraine and Europe, while Steve Witkoff is emerging as a key negotiator with Russia despite his role as Trump&apos;s Middle East envoy. Some experts attribute this to Kellogg&apos;s more pro-Ukrainian stance and Russia&apos;s alleged objections to him. He has advocated peace through strength and security guarantees for Ukraine. In contrast with Kellogg, Witkoff&apos;s views on Ukraine and Russia are unclear. There are fears that he might be more willing to agree to Russia&apos;s conditions. Witkoff brokered the Jan. 15 ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, and Trump may hope that he could achieve something similar in Ukraine, experts say. &quot;What he brings to the table in terms of Moscow&apos;s war in Ukraine, other than his friendship with Trump, is not clear,&quot; John Herbst, an expert at the Atlantic Council and a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, told the Kyiv Independent. On Feb. 11, Witkoff negotiated the release of Marc Fogel, a teacher who had been arrested in Russia on charges of bringing medical marijuana into the country in 2021. Fogel was flown out of the country on Witkoff&#x2019;s plane. When asked who he worked with in Russia to secure Fogel&apos;s release, Witkoff said that he had cooperated with someone named Kirill. Reuters reported on Feb. 12, citing a source close to negotiations, that Kirill Dmitriyev, head of the state-run Russian Direct Investment Fund, had taken part in talks on Fogel. Following Fogel&#x2019;s release, Trump announced on Feb. 12 that he had held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and agreed to &quot;immediately&quot; start negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Trump said that he had tasked Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, and John Ratcliffe, head of the Central Intelligence Agency, with leading the negotiations. Kellogg&apos;s name was notably missing from the list. Trump also said on Feb. 12 that his first meeting with Putin would take place in Saudi Arabia. Witkoff, Waltz and Rubio later traveled to Saudi Arabia and launched negotiations with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Feb. 18. There, the U.S. and Russia agreed to start the process on Ukrainian settlement, appoint ambassadors to each other, lift &quot;obstacles to diplomatic missions&quot; and create conditions for starting U.S.-Russian cooperation, according to Lavrov. Kellogg is scheduled to visit Ukraine on Feb. 19 but is not taking part in talks with Russia on ending the war. He has co-authored a peace plan that would freeze the front line in Ukraine, take NATO accession off the table for an extended period, and partially lift sanctions imposed on Russia. At the same time, Kellogg has publicly stated that Ukraine should negotiate from a position of strength. According to his proposals, the U.S. will continue sending military aid to Ukraine and provide security guarantees to Kyiv to prevent further Russian aggression. The plan does not stipulate a reduction in the Ukrainian army&apos;s size or recognizing occupied territories as Russian de jure. Herbst argued that &quot;the Russians did not like Kellogg, because he is the one who is talking about tough measures to get Moscow to negotiate, and negotiate in good faith.&quot; General Keith Kellogg, US special envoy for Ukraine, participates in the panel discussion &quot;Peace through Strength - A Plan for Ukraine&quot; at the 61st Munich Security Conference in Munich, Germany on Feb. 15, 2025. (Johannes Simon / Getty Images)&quot;Kellogg was the most outspoken, the toughest,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;And of course, I always felt that Putin would want to make sure that the key channel between Russia and the United States was Putin to Trump, not anything less. And certainly (Russia did not want) the guy who has been talking tough &#x2014; Kellogg.&quot; Jenny Mathers, a lecturer in international politics at the U.K.&apos;s Aberystwyth University, agreed, saying that &quot;Kellogg certainly seems to be the member of this administration who is the most sympathetic to Ukraine, although he is by no means a fervent supporter of all the terms that the Ukrainian government has identified as necessary for a genuine and sustainable peace.&quot; Mykhailo Minakov, head of the Ukrainian Research Program at the Kennan Institute, said that Kellogg is &quot;one of the oldest and most experienced people in the team.&quot; &quot;He offers a strong balance with respect for Ukraine&#x2019;s national interests,&quot; Minakov told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;He also listens to the European Commission. He represents knowledge, understanding, and a certain wisdom related to the interests of Kyiv and the EU.&quot; Some experts argue that Kellogg has been effectively sidelined. Daniel Hamilton, a foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution, said that &quot;Trump has said Kellogg will play a role, but he no longer seems to be in the lead regarding the negotiations.&quot; Mathers said that &quot;it does look as though Kellogg is being given the work of visiting the European capitals, including Kyiv, whereas Witkoff has already been to Moscow, which is clearly regarded by Trump as the center of power.&quot; &quot;Kellogg has also not been included in the negotiating team that Trump has just named, which may be an oversight rather than a deliberate snub (this administration is not great on getting details right),&quot; Mathers said. &quot;But even if it is an oversight and he will be added later, it does reveal that Kellogg is not one of the people that Trump thinks of immediately in this context, despite appointing him as a special envoy to deal with Ukraine and Russia.&quot; Kellogg clarified on Feb. 15 that he would be focusing on negotiations with Ukraine and Europe, and Witkoff would be focusing on talks with Russia. Witkoff, a real estate investor and billionaire, is a long-time friend of Trump. After graduating from law school in 1983, Witkoff worked for the New York-based real estate law firm Dreyer &amp; Traub, and Trump was one of his clients. During Trump&apos;s first presidency, Witkoff was a member of the Great American Economic Revival Industry Group, which was created by Trump in 2020 to combat the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. &quot;Witkoff is a long-time personal friend of Trump&apos;s and, like Trump, made his fortune in the New York real estate sector,&quot; Mathers said. &quot;Trump is more comfortable around people he knows well and trusts, with personal loyalty being the key criteria for advancement in this administration.&quot; US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff attends an interview after meeting with Russian officials at Diriyah Palace, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Feb. 18, 2025. (Evelyn Hockstein / AFP via Getty Images)Aron Lund, a Middle East analyst at Century International, also said that &quot;Trump just trusts this guy on a personal level.&quot; &quot;We know he does not trust the U.S. governmental institutions very much, but this guy is an old friend of his, from a similar background,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We seem to be in for a period in which U.S. diplomacy gets more personality-centered and where proximity to the president may matter more than institutional positions.&quot; Lund added that Witkoff is going to run negotiations in both the Middle East and Ukraine and is &quot;about to become some sort of general presidential point man for tricky foreign business.&quot; Meanwhile, Herbst emphasized that Witkoff &quot;is not a professional diplomat and not a person who has done foreign affairs in his career&quot; but &quot;a successful businessman who is a friend of Trump.&quot; After being elected for a second term on Nov. 5, 2024, Trump nominated Witkoff as his special envoy for the Middle East. Even before Trump took office on Jan. 20, Wifkoff took part in brokering the Jan. 15 ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. The deal envisages exchanging all Israeli hostages held by Hamas for Palestinians held by Israel and Israel&apos;s gradual withdrawal from Gaza. Witkoff pressured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept the agreement, saying that Trump wanted this deal done, according to sources cited by the New York Times. Witkoff&apos;s Middle Eastern contacts appear to have played a role in his negotiations with Russia as well. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman took part as an intermediary in talks with Russia on Fogel&apos;s release, Reuters reported on Feb. 12, citing a source close to the negotiations. &quot;Witkoff proved himself to Trump by working with the (former ex-President Joe) Biden administration to arrange the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, and then to negotiate the release of U.S. teacher Mark Fogel from Russia,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;Witkoff has proven himself as a fixer and negotiator. He is assuming a larger role than his title suggests.&quot; Julien Barnes-Dacey, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the European Council on Foreign Relations, argued that &quot;Witkoff doesn&#x2019;t really come to the job with deep experience in the Middle East or Russia and Ukraine but plays to Trump&#x2019;s desire to have someone who can get things done in transactional businessman style.&quot; &quot;On Gaza Witkoff was reportedly much more willing to enforce Trump&apos;s desires on Israel and it could be that we see something similar on Ukraine where he doesn&#x2019;t play nice but delivers Trump&#x2018;s message in no uncertain terms,&quot; he added. Mathers said that &quot;both Gaza and Russia/Ukraine involve hostages and the potential for trading hostages, so that may be the common factor and what unites them in Trump&apos;s mind.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump (C) in the Oval Office at the White House, in Washington, DC on Feb. 14, 2025. (Andrew Harnik / Getty Images)The fact that peace negotiations with Russia are being held in Saudi Arabia may be linked to Witkoff&apos;s role as Middle East envoy. &quot;My guess is that Witkoff&apos;s Ukraine role is an outgrowth from his Middle East negotiations,&quot; Lund said. &quot;It seems that Witkoff was involved in stitching together the Putin-Trump summit, which Trump says he thinks will happen in Saudi Arabia. We know that Witkoff has been meeting the Saudis to discuss Gaza, Israel, and other things, so I assume that&apos;s where the summit location comes from.&quot; He added that Trump and Witkoff may &quot;hope to leverage the summit as a favor to the Saudis.&quot; &quot;The idea would be that since they get to host this major international event, with all the attention and prestige that entails, they should give something in return on Gaza or related to Israeli-Saudi normalization,&quot; Lund said. Despite Witkoff&apos;s role in talks on ending the war in Ukraine, his views on Ukraine and Russia are unknown, analysts say. Mathers said that she has not &quot;seen anything specific to indicate Witkoff&apos;s views on Russia, but Trump clearly regards him as a trusted envoy.&quot; Although Witkoff has been praised for brokering the Gaza deal, the implementation of the agreement has faced some problems, which may foreshadow similar difficulties if he hammers out a deal with Russia. On Feb. 10, Hamas accused Israel of violating the ceasefire and said it would suspend the release of the remaining 76 hostages. Trump said that &quot;all hell is going to break out&quot; if hostages were not released, and Netanyahu threatened to resume fighting. As a result, Hamas said on Feb. 13 that the hostages would be released. Another move that has caused a backlash from Palestinians and Arab countries is Trump&apos;s Feb. 4 proposal that the U.S. take over the Gaza Strip and that Palestinians should leave it. Michael Sahlin, a Middle East expert at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, said that it is not clear if the Gaza deal will lead to a sustainable and stable peace. But he believes that Witkoff&#x2019;s role in the Middle East and his talks with Russia may be connected. &#x201C;I have a suspicion that there could be a link between a big Trump package deal about the Middle East and a big package deal about Ukraine,&#x201D; he told the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/as-trumps-ukraine-envoy-is-partially-sidelined-middle-east-negotiator-takes-lead-in-russia-talks/	2025-02-18T11:25:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199704934.jpg
France to host second summit on Ukraine, European security, Reuters reports	France plans to host another high-level meeting on Feb. 19 to discuss Ukraine and European security, expanding participation to countries left out of the initial summit, Reuters reported on Feb. 18, citing diplomatic sources. French President Emmanuel Macron convened the first Paris summit on Feb. 17, bringing together leaders from Europe&apos;s largest nations and Britain, as well as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and top EU officials. The talks focused on Ukraine&apos;s security, its potential NATO membership, and Europe&apos;s broader defense strategy. According to Reuters, Paris has now invited additional European countries and Canada to join the upcoming meeting, either in person or via video link. The expanded guest list includes Norway, Canada, the Baltic states, the Czech Republic, Greece, Finland, Romania, Sweden, and Belgium. The move follows recent U.S.-Russia negotiations in Saudi Arabia, marking the first direct talks between Washington and Moscow since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Russian delegation, led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, met with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky postponed his planned visit to Saudi Arabia, reiterating that no decisions about Ukraine&apos;s future should be made without Kyiv&apos;s involvement. The role of European nations in the negotiations with Russia remains unclear. Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, previously said that Europe would not be directly involved in the talks but assured that its interests would be considered.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-to-host-another-summit-on-ukraine-european-security-reuters-reports/	2025-02-18T10:41:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2033880055.jpg
Trump is trading Ukraine’s future for a quick win	As many others have now concluded, this year&#x2019;s Munich Security Conference (MSC) was pretty remarkable. Indeed, it may have been as defining an event as Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s infamous 2007 speech, which marked a shift toward a more openly hostile Russian policy toward the West. That shift led to Russia&#x2019;s subsequent invasion of Georgia in 2008, its initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014, and ultimately, the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Figures like U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and U.S. Vice President JD Vance sent a clear message: Europe can no longer rely on the American security backstop. That realization hit hard. With Vance&#x2019;s speech, the realization also set in that Europe and U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s America no longer share the same values or interests. Europe places far greater importance on the rule of law, fighting corruption, and curbing kleptocracy. Free speech laws also diverge. These are the longer-term implications for Europe: First, Europe must prepare to defend itself without the U.S. If NATO is no longer viable, European nations will need to drastically increase defense spending &#x2014; potentially from 2% of GDP to 3% or perhaps even 5%. Second, Europe may need alternative security alliances &#x2014; potentially involving Turkey, Gulf states, or even China. The so-called &#x201C;Reverse Nixon&#x201D; strategy, where a Trump-Putin alliance seeks to isolate China, has been floated by the likes of Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin and American political commentator Tucker Carlson. However, building an alternative security and defense arrangement to save Europe will take time. Europe must assume that Putin will not stop in Ukraine. It would be reckless not to prepare for further Russian aggression &#x2014; whether in Moldova, the Baltic states, or beyond. The best defense remains ensuring that Ukraine does not lose. A Ukrainian buffer buys Europe time to reinforce its defenses. The challenges herein are Trump&#x2019;s &#x201C;peace&#x201D; overtures to Putin and the looming Russia-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia. Having given away much of the West&#x2019;s leverage, including NATO membership prospects and security guarantees for Ukraine, it&#x2019;s hard to imagine what Trump could deliver to ensure Ukraine&#x2019;s security. What, then, does Trump expect in return? So far, the Trump administration has made concession after concession to Russia. Putin likely sees Trump as a weak, incompetent negotiator and will push for maximum concessions &#x2014; such as restrictions on Ukraine&#x2019;s future military capabilities, regime change in Kyiv, or even constitutional changes that give Russia veto power over Ukraine&#x2019;s future. Russia will either exploit the limitations to invade again or the lack of security in Ukraine will ensure its future economic development fails. That would be a recipe for Ukraine&#x2019;s collapse. If Ukraine is destabilized, the consequences for Europe would be severe. Millions of Ukrainians could flee westward, overwhelming European economies and fueling far-right movements. Additionally, if Russia absorbs Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industry &#x2014; the largest in Europe after Russia&#x2019;s own &#x2014; it would present an existential threat to Europe.

(Saul Loeb / AFP via Getty Images)No doubt, European politicians have argued the above to Trump until they were blue in the face. But to Trump, Ukraine, like Gaza, is just another real estate asset to be leveraged. That mindset was evident in U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant&#x2019;s visit to Kyiv, where he pressured Ukraine to sign away half of its natural resources in exchange for vague promises of future support. That mindset was evident in U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant&#x2019;s visit to Kyiv, where he pressured Ukraine to sign away half of its natural resources in exchange for vague promises of future support. Trump frames this as repayment for U.S. aid&#x2014;but the reality is that total U.S. assistance since 2022 remains under $100 billion, far from the &quot;hundreds of billions&quot; he claims. It is obscene to demand payment from a country that has lost hundreds of thousands of lives defending Western democracy. If Trump and Putin broker a deal that offers Ukraine no real security guarantees, Ukraine will likely reject it outright. Why agree to a ceasefire that leaves the country vulnerable to future Russian aggression? Trump clearly wants a speedy deal to secure his Nobel Peace Prize. Ukraine does still have significant leverage: nearly 1 million troops in the field, the ability to produce 40% of its own munitions, over $140 billion in reserves, and European support, as European leaders understand that Ukraine&#x2019;s survival is in their own best interest. For Russia, this means an extended war, continued sanctions, and a long-term military and economic drain. If Putin wants victory, he will still have to win it on the battlefield. Meanwhile, Ukraine can use its position to expose the U.S. as weak in the face of aggression, undermining U.S. credibility in the broader geopolitical struggle against China. Ukraine has little reason to cooperate with Trump&#x2019;s so-called peace plan, which amounts to a sellout. And for Europe, the stakes couldn&#x2019;t be higher.

EU must take Russia sanctions into 'its own hands,' commissioner says	The European Union must take greater control of its sanctions policy against Russia as U.S. priorities shift, EU Economy and Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said on Feb. 18. &quot;With the current Trump administration, the EU will need to take issues related to the bloc&apos;s security more into its own hands. That also concerns sanctions policy,&quot; Dombrovskis said during a meeting with journalists in Brussels. The commissioner added that work on preparing the 16th package of sanctions against Russia is ongoing. His remarks come as U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio hinted that the EU would eventually need to be involved in discussions over sanctions relief as part of ongoing talks with Russia. &quot;The European Union is going to have to be at the table at some point because they have sanctions as well,&quot; Rubio said after U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia. A Russian delegation led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held face-to-face negotiations with a U.S. delegation in Riyadh, marking the first direct talks between the two sides since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Group of Seven (G7) nations agreed to link any future tightening of sanctions against Russia to the progress of upcoming peace negotiations on Feb. 15. The EU approved its 15th sanctions package against Moscow on Dec. 16. The package targeted 54 individuals and 30 organizations from Russia, China, and North Korea, as well as shipping companies facilitating Russia&apos;s crude oil sales.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-must-take-control-over-russia-sanctions-into-its-hands-commissioner-says/	2025-02-18T10:09:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1258502154.jpg
Turkey 'ideal host' for peace talks on Russia-Ukraine war, Erdogan says	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Feb. 18 that Turkey is an ideal host for potential peace talks on Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, offering Ankara as a venue for future negotiations. &quot;Our country is an ideal host for the negotiations that are likely to begin between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States,&quot; Erdogan said during a press conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Erdogan highlighted Turkey&apos;s previous mediation efforts, including the Black Sea grain deal, which enabled Ukrainian agricultural exports until Russia withdrew in 2023. He reaffirmed that during his talks with Zelensky, Turkey expressed its support for Ukraine&apos;s complete territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence. &quot;At the same time, I emphasized that we would provide any support to complete the negotiations and establish sustainable peace. This war must end,&quot; Erdogan added. Zelensky, who postponed a planned visit to Saudi Arabia amid ongoing U.S.-Russia talks, reiterated that Ukraine must be included in any negotiations over its future. The Saudi talks on Feb. 18 marked the first direct discussions between U.S. and Russian officials since the full-scale invasion began, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov meeting U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. U.S. President Donald Trump earlier confirmed he plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia &quot;very soon,&quot; though no date has been specified.	https://kyivindependent.com/turkey-ideal-host-for-peace-talks-on-russia-ukraine-war-erdogan-tells-zelensky/	2025-02-18T08:59:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/7daa8d5b756b4e1bf885ca6864040a32_1739881481.jpeg
Russia's Lavrov denies 3-point peace plan, warns against Western peacekeepers in Ukraine	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Feb. 18 that Moscow had not seen a three-point peace plan and warned that Russia would not accept the deployment of Western troops in Ukraine. The alleged plan, which reportedly includes a ceasefire, elections in Ukraine, and a final peace agreement, was revealed by Fox News Senior White House Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich on X. &quot;I have not seen this information, I have not seen these reports,&quot; Lavrov said at a press conference following U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia. Lavrov also warned that Russia would not accept the deployment of NATO military personnel in Ukraine after any potential peace deal. He claimed that even if Western troops operated under EU or national flags, rather than NATO&apos;s, it would still be a &quot;direct threat&quot; to Russia. &quot;The absorption of Ukraine by the North Atlantic Alliance is a direct threat to the interests of the Russian Federation, a direct threat to our sovereignty,&quot; he claimed. Kyiv said that strong security guarantees are essential for any peace agreement. The deployment of peacekeepers in Ukraine has been considered as one possible option. Lavrov further escalated rhetoric against President Volodymyr Zelensky, suggesting that he and his team should be &quot;calmed down&quot; following a Ukrainian drone strike on a pumping station in Russia&apos;s Kuban region. &quot;This should only strengthen everyone in the opinion that this can&apos;t go on, that this man and his entire team should be calmed down, given a slap on the wrist,&quot; he said. The talks in Saudi Arabia mark the first direct negotiations between the U.S. and Russia since the full-scale invasion began. The Russian delegation, led by Lavrov, met with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials. Zelensky announced on Feb. 18 that he postponed his visit to Saudi Arabia amid talks between Russia and the United States. He reiterated that no decisions about Ukraine&apos;s future can be made without Kyiv&apos;s involvement.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-lavrov-denies-knowledge-of-three-point-peace-plan-warns-against-western-troops-in-ukraine/	2025-02-18T08:15:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1485172048.jpg

Zelensky postpones Saudi Arabia visit amid Russia-US talks	President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Feb. 18 that he had postponed his visit to Saudi Arabia amid talks between Russia and the United States. &quot;We were not invited to this Russian-American meeting in Saudi Arabia. It was a surprise for us. I don&apos;t want any coincidences, so I&apos;m not going to Saudi Arabia,&quot; Zelensky said during a briefing following a meeting with Turkish President Recep Erdogan. The talks in Saudi Arabia mark the first direct negotiations between the U.S. and Russia since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion began. Russia&apos;s delegation, led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, met with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials. Zelensky reiterated that no decisions about Ukraine&apos;s future can be made without Kyiv&apos;s involvement. He also said he expects U.S. officials to visit Ukraine, confirming that Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, will arrive in Kyiv on Feb. 19. &quot;Any country has a bilateral track with other countries. Please, you can discuss anything, but you can&apos;t make a decision on how to end the war in Ukraine without Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said. The president also announced that he had spoken with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and rescheduled his visit to Riyadh for Mar. 10. In a Feb. 17 interview with German media network ARD, Zelensky warned against a hastily negotiated peace deal and reaffirmed that Ukraine would not accept an agreement brokered without its participation. It remains unclear to what extent Ukraine will be involved in future discussions between Washington and Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-postpones-saudi-arabia-visit-amid-russia-us-talks/	2025-02-18T07:23:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1843522320.jpg
Explosions hit Russian shadow fleet oil tanker in Italy	Two explosions took place on the oil tanker Seajewel, moored in the Italian city of Savona on Feb. 18, with the vessel allegedly transporting Russian oil to Europe, Italian publication IVG reported. The cause of the blasts remains unknown, but initial evidence suggests possible sabotage, including damage below the waterline and a fish kill near the tanker. The Seajewel, part of Moscow&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; used to evade sanctions, had previously loaded oil in Russia three times in 2024, according to Ukrainian Pravda (UP). The crew reported hearing two loud bangs, and the tanker&apos;s hull showed concave damage, indicating the possible placement of explosive devices. UP revealed that the tanker had recently unloaded in the Romanian port of Constanta after arriving from Turkey and was reportedly heading to Novorossiysk, Russia, for reloading. The Savona Coast Guard is investigating the incident with divers, though no further details have been released. Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; consists of aging tankers used to circumvent sanctions, including those imposed by the EU, U.K., and U.S. Ukraine recently sanctioned captains of these vessels, targeting Russian and Iranian nationals involved in illicit oil exports. A growing portion of Russia&apos;s oil tanker fleet is being forced to reflag as sanctions intensify, disrupting Moscow&apos;s oil export logistics and forcing tankers to re-register in less reputable jurisdictions, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 23.	https://kyivindependent.com/explosions-hit-russian-linked-oil-tanker-in-italy-raising-sabotage-suspicions/	2025-02-18T07:00:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1241200421.jpg
A ceasefire in Ukraine could end martial law — what would lifting restrictions mean?	For nearly three years, all of Ukraine has been living under martial law. The introduction of martial law temporarily suspended some civilian rights and freedoms and gave the government additional emergency powers in order to fight off Russia&#x2019;s invasion. Mandatory curfews keep people off the streets at night. Elections are suspended until martial law ends. Military-aged men are restricted from leaving the country unless granted an exception. Financial caps prevent most money from leaving Ukraine. If the current peace negotiations end in a ceasefire, Ukraine will soon face the question of how and when to lift its martial law restrictions. The process requires a delicate balancing act. If lifted right away, it could mean an outflow of money and men that may compromise Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to fend off further attacks if a peace agreement falls apart. Fedir Venislavskyim, a member of parliament&#x2019;s Defense Committee and of President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s ruling party, said on Feb. 17 that he &#x201C;does not think martial law can be lifted&#x201D; on just the basis of a ceasefire without additional security guarantees. A ceasefire &#x201C;does not mean that Russia has withdrawn its troops from occupied territories or its means of attack that can strike Ukraine,&#x201D; Venislavskyim said. &#x201C;Given Putin&#x2019;s mental state, I think we can expect any possible developments. Therefore, without guarantees that this will lead to a lasting peace, I do not think martial law can be lifted,&#x201D; he added. Here&#x2019;s what you need to know about the restrictions currently in place and what lifting them could look like. Martial law is a special legal status that introduces military rule, typically imposed in situations of war or other extreme emergencies. The exact specifics depend on the country imposing it. In Ukraine, people&apos;s rights and limitations under martial law are determined by Ukraine&#x2019;s constitution and a series of laws passed by parliament. Three key aspects of martial law are the complete suspension of all elections, restrictions on military-aged men traveling abroad with some exceptions, and a mandatory curfew imposed across the country. Presidential, parliamentary, and local elections are all explicitly banned by the Martial Law Act. If not for the war, parliamentary elections would have been held in 2023, and President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s term would have ended in May of 2024. Their terms have instead continued. Carrying out elections during the war would require ensuring the safety of polling places, and would need to guarantee the participation of soldiers at the front, refugees abroad, internally displaced civilians, and Ukrainians living in or closest to the fighting.

Ukraine has also banned almost all travel abroad for men between the ages of 18 and 60, except with special permission in cases like medical emergencies, business trips, international sports events, or cross-border transportation of humanitarian goods. Nighttime curfews are in place, requiring everyone to stay inside and off the streets unless issued a special pass. In Kyiv and many major cities, curfew lasts from midnight until 5 a.m. though curfew varies from region to region and typically lasts longer closer to the fighting. Except for overnight trains, public transport is suspended during curfew. Because workers and patrons need to be inside before curfew, commercial establishments close well in advance of the curfew hour. These are only a few of the relevant aspects of martial law &#x2014; the provisions extend far beyond these situations and touch many aspects of Ukrainian life. For example, public holidays are converted from days off to working holidays, sending money out of the country is restricted, and property can be seized for the needs of the state if reimbursed. The European Commission consistently has assessed that Ukraine&#x2019;s martial law has been proportionate overall given the security situation. Ukraine&#x2019;s martial law has been in place without any interruptions since Feb. 24, 2022, the first day of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. The same evening of the invasion, President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree approved by parliament to introduce martial law for a period of 30 days to &#x201C;ensure Ukraine&apos;s defense, public safety and state interests.&#x201D; More than a dozen decrees extending martial law have been signed since then &#x2014; first as 30-day extensions, but now extending it for 90 days at a time. Bills to extend martial law are among those gathering the broadest support across the political spectrum and pass easily. The most recent extension was signed earlier this month and will last until May 9. While this period has been Ukraine&#x2019;s most widespread and lengthiest period of martial law in modern history, it&#x2019;s not the country&#x2019;s first. Former President Petro Poroshenko temporarily imposed martial law in 2018, following the Kerch Strait Incident, in which Russian ships opened fire at three Ukrainian naval boats crossing the Kerch Strait. It was the first time that Russian forces attacked Ukraine openly while identifying themselves as Russian, rather than hiding behind proxy forces. In that case, martial law was only applied to limited regions in the east and was not renewed after the 30-day period expired. A ceasefire alone is unlikely to convince Ukrainian officials to end martial law, and it won&#x2019;t trigger an end automatically. Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament will need to decide whether it is safe to lift martial law and then choose not to extend it when it expires or vote to lift it. The exact timing and structure of martial law&#x2019;s end will depend on the outcome of the ongoing peace negotiations, including Ukraine&#x2019;s confidence in whether Russia is likely to attack again. When restrictions lift, there will likely be a rapid outflow of people and money that were previously barred from leaving the country.

(Michael Sorrow / Anadolu via Getty Images)Around a fifth of Ukrainians say they would want to move abroad if travel restrictions were lifted, according to a poll published last month by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation and the Razumkov Center. Those numbers were higher for men and young people &#x2014; with a quarter of men and a third of Ukrainians between the ages of 18 and 29 saying they would want to move. Such a substantial outflow would significantly weaken Ukraine&#x2019;s military readiness if the ceasefire is violated and hostilities resume. Separately, a sudden complete lifting could destabilize the country in other ways, like aggravating the current labor shortage. One potential arrangement could be Ukraine gradually easing restrictions overtime after a ceasefire is reached and security guarantees are in place.	https://kyivindependent.com/a-ceasefire-in-ukraine-could-bring-an-end-to-martial-law-what-restrictions-have-been-in-place-and-what-would-their-end-mean/	2025-02-18T06:59:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2105335422.jpg
North Korea gaining military experience in Ukraine, improving its missiles' accuracy, Budanov says	North Korea is participating in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine to gain combat experience and modernize its military technology, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) chief Kyrylo Budanov said in an interview South Korean news outlet The Chosun published on Feb. 17. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in early August 2024. &quot;Despite heavy casualties, North Korean forces remain actively engaged in joint operations with Russian troops,&quot; Budanov said. &quot;This war has mobilized the full military capabilities of the nations involved. Only three countries &#x2014; Ukraine, Russia, and North Korea &#x2014; are gaining direct experience in full-scale 21st-century warfare. The North Korean military of the future will be fundamentally different from its past,&quot; Budanov added. The number of North Korean artillery on the battlefield has increased, and North Korean missiles have become more precise, according to Budanov. &quot;Initially, their accuracy was severely flawed, with an error margin of 500 to 1,500 meters,&quot; he said. &quot;But Russian missile experts made technical modifications, resolving the issue. The missile is now significantly more precise and a far greater threat.&quot; &quot;North Korea is using this war to gain combat experience and modernize its military technology,&quot; Budanov said. &quot;This will have lasting consequences for the security landscape in the Asia-Pacific region.&quot; North Korea and Russia have significantly strengthened their relations over the past three years, particularly in the context of geopolitical alignment against Western nations, posing significant challenges to international stability. In the fall of 2024, Russia and North Korea ratified a strategic partnership agreement which includes the development of trade, scientific, technical, and defense cooperation. However, the agreement did not mention the treatment of wounded Russian soldiers. Military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang also deepened in 2024, with Russian President Vladimir Putin signing a mutual defense pact with Kim in June. Soon after, North Korea escalated its involvement in Russia&apos;s war from providing weapons &#x2014; including artillery ammunition and ballistic missiles &#x2014; to sending soldiers. Ukraine placed North Korean losses to as many as 4,000 killed and injured. Budanov nevertheless predicted that North Korea might soon send reinforcements to Russia, namely gun and rocket artillery units.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-gaining-military-experience-in-ukraine-improving-its-missiles-accuracy-budanov-says/	2025-02-18T05:47:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1733350996.jpeg
We agreed to consider each other's interests' — Russian negotiator Ushakov on talks in Saudi Arabia	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. A member of Russia&apos;s delegation that met with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 to discuss ending the war in Ukraine has said the talks were &quot;not bad,&quot; but it was &quot;hard to say&quot; if the two sides&apos; interests were converging. Speaking to the pro-Kremlin Channel One Russia, Yuri Ushakov, an advisor to Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin, said it was a &quot;very serious discussion of all the issues we wanted to touch upon.&quot; &quot;We have agreed to take account of each other&apos;s interests and develop bilateral relations, since both Moscow and Washington are interested in this,&quot; he added. Ushakov also said a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin were discussed, but it was unlikely to take place next week as had been previously speculated.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-agreed-to-consider-each-others-interests-russian-negotiator-ushakov-on-talks-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-02-18T04:41:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199687527.jpg
Putin ready for talks with Zelensky, Kremlin says, repeats false 'legitimacy' claims	Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin is ready for talks with Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky, but &quot;legal aspects related to his legitimacy&quot; must be considered, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 18 in an interview with Russian news agency Interfax. Russia has widely used the claim that Zelensky is illegitimate in its propaganda to discredit the Ukrainian government. The false claim is based on the premise that Zelensky&apos;s first term in office was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. But Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and the subsequent declaration of martial law in Ukraine has meant elections have been impossible to hold and his term has been extended, something constitutional lawyers say is allowed under Ukrainian law. &quot;Putin himself has repeatedly said he would be ready to negotiate with Zelensky if necessary. At the same time, the legal fixation of the agreements is subject to serious discussion, considering the reality,&quot; Peskov said. When asked about a potential meeting between Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump, Peskov said he did not know when it would occur. &quot;No, there is no such understanding, but perhaps there will be some attempts based on the results of today&apos;s talks (in Riyadh). But we will find out about it later, after the end of this dialog,&quot; he said. Under the martial law act passed by Ukraine after Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, presidential, parliamentary and local elections are banned. If martial law had not been imposed, the next presidential election would have been held on March 31, 2024, and Zelensky&apos;s term would have ended on May 20, 2024. Earlier, Putin said that Russia is prepared to hold talks with U.S. President Donald Trump regarding the war in Ukraine. On Feb. 18, U.S. and Russian officials began talks in Saudi Arabia on how to end Moscow&apos;s war in Ukraine. A Russian delegation led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is meeting a U.S. delegation led by State Secretary Marco Rubio.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-ready-for-talks-with-zelensky-but-his-legitimacy-to-be-considered-kremlin-says/	2025-02-18T04:25:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166726414.jpg
Europe at 'kids' table' in talks on Ukraine, Rheinmetall chief says	European countries have found themselves at &quot;a separate kids&apos; table&quot; in the negotiations on Ukraine because of insufficient investment in their defense, Armin Papperger, chief executive of Rheinmetall, said in an interview with the Financial Times published on Feb. 18. Papperger&apos;s comments come as Russia and the U.S. began talks in Saudi Arabia on ending the war in Ukraine. Neither Ukraine nor Europe has been invited to the main discussion, setting off alarm bells in Kyiv and capitals across the continent that U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin could reach an agreement without Ukraine and Europe&#x2019;s involvement, and one that puts their future security in jeopardy. Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, previously said that Europe will not be directly involved in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, but its interests will be considered. &quot;If you don&apos;t invest, if you&apos;re not strong, they handle you like kids,&quot; Papperger said, adding that over the past 30 years, Europe has considered it acceptable to invest about 1% of GDP in defense. As a result of insufficient investment in defense, Europe is now perceived as a child who must sit at a separate table while adults negotiate over Ukraine&apos;s future, according to Papperger. &quot;If parents have dinner, the kids have to sit at another table,&quot; he said. &quot;The U.S. is negotiating with Russia, and no European is at the table &#x2014; it has become very clear that the Europeans are the kids.&quot; Papperger doubted that Trump&apos;s peace talks will really lead to Russia &quot;stopping firing.&quot; He also said that his company would benefit even if there was a ceasefire because Europe would continue to invest in armaments as it confronted the threat of potential Russian aggression. Rheinmetall is one of the largest arms manufacturers in Europe. The company provides weapons, ammunition, and equipment to Ukraine under contracts with the German government, such as 155 mm artillery rounds, Leopard 1 tanks, mortar shells, and drone surveillance systems, among other weapons. Rheinmetall also opened a military vehicle repair facility in Ukraine in June 2024, the first of four plants it plans to open in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-has-found-itself-at-separate-table-for-kids-in-talks-on-ukraine-rheinmetall-chief-says/	2025-02-18T03:18:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2076692591.jpg
New video shows Australian POW Oscar Jenkins alive but injured in Russian captivity	An Australian volunteer soldier fighting for Ukraine has appeared in a video uploaded to YouTube on Feb. 8, alive but injured. In the video, a man identifies himself as 32-year-old Oscar Jenkins who went missing on Dec. 16 in 2024 while on a combat mission near the village of Mykolaivka in Luhansk Oblast. A man behind the camera says the date at the time of filming is Jan. 17, around the same time reports circulated that Jenkins had been executed by his Russian captors. Jenkins says he feels &quot;weak&quot; and has &quot;lost a lot of weight,&quot; and that he has a broken arm. He is then asked to confirm that reports about his death are untrue. &quot;Correct,&quot; he replies. Jenkins was serving in the 402nd Separate Rifle Battalion, which is part of Ukraine&apos;s 66th Separate Mechanized Brigade, the Ukrainian investigative journalism outlet Slidstvo.Info reported on Jan. 17. In a video that emerged on Russian Telegram channels in late December, Jenkins is seen in military fatigues, interrogated by Russian captors. The man behind the camera asks the captive about his name and background and whether he wants to live while beating him over the head. Unverified reports began circulating in mid-January that the soldier was executed by his Russian captors, prompting Australian officials to make urgent inquiries to Russia about his whereabouts. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on Jan. 29 that Jenkins was alive but that &quot;we still hold serious concerns for Mr Jenkins as a prisoner of war,&quot; Russia has been repeatedly accused of summarily executing Ukrainian POWs throughout the war. The Geneva Conventions mandate all warring parties to treat POW with respect and dignity, while executing POWs is considered a gross violation of international law and a war crime. Unlike most other foreigners volunteering to join Ukraine&apos;s resistance against Russia, Jenkins has had no military experience. The Australian media described the man as &quot;much loved&quot; by his community in Australia, a talented cricket and football player who studied biomedical sciences before working as a lecturer in China. He is believed to have traveled to Ukraine in 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/new-video-shows-australian-pow-oscar-jenkins-alive-but-injured-in-russian-captivity/	2025-02-18T02:58:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Oscar-Jenkins.png
Now is a critical moment' — EU chief von der Leyen meets Kellogg to discuss Ukraine	European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen met with U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg in Brussels on Feb. 18, to discuss ending Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The meeting comes on the same day that Russia and the U.S. began talks in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine is not participating in the talks, but President Volodymyr Zelensky is due to arrive in the country in the coming days for an official visit. &quot;Financially and militarily, Europe has brought more to the table than anyone else. And we will step up. We want to partner with the U.S. to deliver a just and lasting peace for Ukraine,&quot; von der Leyen wrote on X. &quot;Now is a critical moment,&quot; she added. Important discussion with @generalkellogg on Ukraine.Financially and militarily, Europe has brought more to the table than anyone else. And we will step up.We want to partner with the US to deliver a just and lasting peace for Ukraine.Now is a critical moment. Concerns have been raised about Ukraine&apos;s role in the negotiations, with European officials emphasizing that Kyiv must not be sidelined. European leaders held an emergency summit in Paris on Feb. 17, reflecting growing European concerns that Trump and Putin may be negotiating over European security without the direct involvement of European leaders. U.S. President Donald Trump reaffirmed on Feb. 16 that Zelensky would have a say in the process and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine. Kellogg is expected to visit Ukraine on Feb. 19 to focus on diplomatic and military support and potential pathways to peace. Kellogg did not confirm whether he would visit the front lines, as President Volodymyr Zelensky previously suggested.	https://kyivindependent.com/now-is-a-critical-moment-eu-chief-von-der-leyen-meets-kellogg-to-discuss-ukraine/	2025-02-18T02:23:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1662120631.jpg
Alternatives to Trump's Russia appeasement	U.S. President Donald Trump says he wants to bring peace to Ukraine. But his approach cannot work, because it fails to address the problem of security guarantees. There will be no peace as long as Ukraine must face Russia on its own. But perhaps this flaw can be overcome. In theory, technical innovation in the miniaturization of warfare might offer new ways of ensuring peace, and France and the United Kingdom &#x2014; both nuclear powers &#x2014; could step in as America steps back. Now is the time to consider such possibilities. Speaking at the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Brussels last week, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth appears to have just surrendered many of the key elements that would have been subject to negotiations. Before talks have even begun, the U.S. says it will impose territorial losses on Ukraine and bar it from joining NATO. Worse, these comments were immediately followed by a euphoric social media post from Trump about a conversation he had with Russian President Vladimir Putin. With both parties in the war near exhaustion, it is not foolish to explore the options for achieving a lasting peace in the absence of complete capitulation by one side. But the path Trump has chosen leads directly into an impossible thicket. A lasting and credible solution requires removing the cause of war. But what is that cause? For Ukrainians, it is Putin&#x2019;s decision to launch a full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. Removing the cause thus would require a change in the Russian government &#x2014; an unlikely outcome. For Putin, the cause is what he sees as an illegitimate government in Ukraine. Indeed, as he made clear in a wide-ranging essay published in July 2021, he denies the legitimacy of Ukrainian independence itself. Removing the cause thus would require eliminating Ukraine as a sovereign nation-state. History is full of ironies, and the latest flurry of peace initiatives comes just before the Munich Security Conference, a meeting held a few hundred yards away from the site of the most notorious failed peacemaking attempt in modern history. It was there, in 1938, that Adolf Hitler managed to convince Britain and France that Czechoslovakia, not Nazi Germany, was the cause of conflict on the continent. After a month of crisis diplomacy, the British, French, and Italian leaders met Hitler at the F&#xFC;hrerbau (&#x201C;the F&#xFC;hrer&apos;s building&#x201D;) in Munich and imposed a political settlement on Czechoslovakia, stripping it of the so-called Sudetenland, a western region with a substantial German-speaking minority that had been radicalized by Nazi propaganda. Although peace agreements are often driven by a revulsion to the horrors of war, they also often set the stage for new conflicts. In a Sept. 27, 1938 radio address to the British people, U.K. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain reflected on, &#x201C;How horrible, fantastic, incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas-masks here because of a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing.&#x201D; Within a year, Britons were putting on gas masks and building defenses. Then-U.K. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain waves to the crowd at Heston Airport after returning from signing the Munich Agreement, proclaiming &quot;Peace in our time,&quot; in London, England, in September 1938. (Hulton-Deutsch Collection / Corbis via Getty Images)Meanwhile, in France, the argument for peace (appeasement) in 1938 and 1939 was distilled in the question: &#x201C;Mourir pour Dantzig?&#x201D; (&#x201C;To die for Gdansk?&#x201D;). But those who believed they had kept themselves safe through clever diplomacy were soon dying for France. The language of failed peacemaking follows a familiar pattern. First, we are told that the big boys will handle it by sidelining bothersome smaller countries with their complicated histories. As Trump said of his conversation with Putin, &#x201C;We both reflected on the Great History of our Nations.&#x201D; The big European powers exhibited the same arrogance in 1938. Second, we are told that simple logic will suffice. Or as Trump put it, &#x201C;President Putin even used my very strong campaign motto of, &#x2018;common sense.&#x2019;&#x201D; It was also common sense that the Sudeten question, not Hitler&#x2019;s desire to unite Europe under Nazi rule, was at the heart of the 1938 crisis. Third, the peacemongers invoke the threat of civilizational collapse. Russia has consistently threatened nuclear war, and similar fears of escalation shaped British decision-making in the late 1930s. &#x201C;The real triumph,&#x201D; Chamberlain told the House of Commons on Oct. 3, 1938, &#x201C;is that... representatives of four great Powers can find it possible to agree on a way of carrying out a difficult and delicate operation by discussion instead of by force of arms, and thereby they have averted a catastrophe which would have ended civilization as we have known it.&#x201D; Likewise, effective deterrence is the key to ensuring that the conflict in Ukraine remains truly frozen, and that Russia does not just use the freeze to build up its military capacity until it can apply irresistible force. During the Cold War, such deterrence was achieved with the threat of mutual assured destruction. The same mechanism could offer a way out now. It could be applied by France and the U.K., which, along with the U.S. and Russia, are parties to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, whereby Ukraine agreed to give up more than 1,700 Soviet-era nuclear weapons in exchange for the other parties&#x2019; promise to ensure Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial integrity. Either France or the U.K. &#x2014; or preferably both &#x2014; could supply nuclear weapons to Ukraine and any other vulnerable targets of Russian aggression. Had Britain and France been capable of arming Czechoslovakia effectively in 1938, there would have been no German invasion, and maybe no World War II. But this simply wasn&#x2019;t possible at the time. Today is different. France and Britain do possess the means of deterrence, and technological transfers are much easier. There has long been talk of finding a new form of multilateralism in a world that is becoming more fragmented and multipolar. France and Britain have a chance to show how this might work, and how it could restore some peace and security to a world that is tottering on the edge of the abyss.

Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, injure 26 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed two and injured 26 civilians over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 18. Russian forces launched 176 drones from the Russian cities of Orel, Bryansk, Kursk, Shatalovo, Millerovo, Primosk-Akhtarsk, and Russian-occupied Crimea at Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 103 drones over Kharkiv, Sumy, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Vinnytsia, Kirovohrad, Kherson, Mykolaiv, and Kyiv oblasts, the Air Force said. Another 67 drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are usually decoys. Russia sends them alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. In Donetsk Oblast, one person was killed and another was injured in the city of Pokrovsk, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In the village of Illinivka, one person suffered injuries, while in the town of Kostiantynivka, one civilian, two rescuers, and two police officers were injured. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, an 80-year-old man was killed in an artillery attack against the town of Orikhiv. His body was pulled from the rubble, the local military administration reported. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 32 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, eight people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian forces attacked the Nikopol district with drones and artillery, targeting the Chervonohryhoriv community and the town of Nikopol. The attacks resulted in seven injured civilians, according to Governor Serhii Lysak. In Kharkiv Oblast, three men, aged 23, 49, and 50, suffered injuries after the Russian strike with an FPV (first-person-view) drone in the village of Kutkivka. Another FPV drone strike injured a 38-year-old man in the village of Prystin, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. In Sumy Oblast, Russia carried out several strikes with FPV drones, injuring one person in the Myropillia community, according to the local military administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-2-injure-26-over-past-day/	2025-02-18T01:24:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-18-11_15_09.jpeg
Europe is ready and willing to step up' — Rutte on security guarantees for Ukraine	Europe is ready and willing to take a leadership role in providing Ukraine with security guarantees, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte wrote on Feb. 17 on X. Rutte&apos;s remarks came after French President Emmanuel Macron hosted a Paris summit of European powers. The summit was held before the beginning of the U.S.-Russia talks on ending the war in Ukraine. &quot;Ready and willing. That&apos;s my take from today&apos;s meeting in Paris,&quot; Rutte wrote. &quot;Europe is ready and willing to step up. To lead in providing security guarantees for Ukraine. Ready and willing to invest a lot more in our security. The details will need to be decided, but the commitment is clear,&quot; Rutte added. Ready and willing. That&#x2019;s my take from today&#x2019;s meeting in Paris. Europe is ready and willing to step up. To lead in providing security guarantees for Ukraine. Ready and willing to invest a lot more in our security. The details will need to be decided but the commitment is clear. pic.twitter.com/Y4ClrX94Qe During the Paris meeting, the participants discussed the defense capabilities that Europe could provide to Ukraine to ensure reliable security guarantees, including a plan for Ukraine&apos;s &quot;automatic membership in NATO&quot; in the event of Russia&apos;s clear ceasefire violation, according to The Guardian. European leaders are concerned about the potential imposition of neutrality on Ukraine and joint U.S.-Russian powers&apos; sharing of agreed-upon spheres of influence following the negotiations. The talks between Russia and the U.S. began on Feb. 18. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff are meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Kremlin foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-is-ready-and-willing-to-step-up-rutte-on-security-guarantees-for-ukraine/	2025-02-18T00:25:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2184023227.jpg
US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia begin	U.S. and Russian officials on Feb. 18 began talks in Saudi Arabia on how to end Moscow&apos;s war in Ukraine. A Russian delegation led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is meeting a U.S. delegation led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, the first official face-to-face contact between the two sides since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Though the U.S. and Russia are meeting without Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky will also head to Saudi Arabia this week. NBC reported that the intention is for the U.S. to host a bilateral meeting with Russia, followed by a bilateral meeting with Ukraine, and culminating with talks together. Neither Ukraine nor Europe has been invited to the main discussion, setting off alarm bells in Kyiv and capitals across the continent that U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin could reach an agreement without Ukraine and Europe&#x2019;s involvement, and one that puts their future security in jeopardy. Zelensky warned against a hastily negotiated peace deal from the Trump administration during a wide-ranging interview with German media network ARD published Feb. 17, reaffirming that Ukraine would not accept a peace deal negotiated without the country&apos;s involvement. &quot;Everything that Russia and the U.S. can agree on &#x2013; if they even want to agree on something &#x2013; concerns their bilateral relations. They certainly cannot negotiate about our people and our lives. About an end to the war without us,&quot; Zelensky told ARD. After an emergency summit of European leaders in Paris on Feb. 17, French President Emmanuel Macron reaffirmed the need for strong security guarantees for Ukraine, warning that a ceasefire without them risks collapsing like the failed Minsk agreements. The Paris summit, convened by Macron on short notice, reflected growing European concerns that Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin may be negotiating over European security without the direct involvement of European leaders. &quot;We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine,&quot; Macron said. &quot;To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians.&quot; He stressed that without such measures, any ceasefire could be short-lived and ineffective.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-russia-talks-in-saudi-arabia-begin/	2025-02-17T23:51:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199658460.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 861,090 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 861,090 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 18. This number includes 1,170 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,101 tanks, 21,075 armored fighting vehicles, 37,679 vehicles and fuel tanks, 23,275 artillery systems, 1,285 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,068 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 25,586 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-861-090-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-02-17T22:40:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1832663506.jpg
Ukrainian draft officer injured during violent attack in Lviv Oblast	A Ukrainian draft officer was injured in a violently attack on Feb. 17 in the city of Zhovkva in Lviv Oblast while escorting two mobilized individuals to a medical evaluation. The unnamed officer was attacked around 11:45 a.m. local time by two unidentified individuals. The officer suffered lacerations after being cut by an unknown sharp object, the Lviv Oblast Territorial Recruitment Center said. The suspects in the case fled the scene and is currently at large. No information was immediately available as to the status of the injured officer. Investigators, who opened a criminal investigation into the matter, believe that the likely motive was to help one of the escorted conscripts escape the draft officer. The incident follows a series of recent attacks against military enlistment officers. Last week, a Ukrainian Armed Forces service member was injured in a violent attack at a military enlistment office in Kharkiv on Feb. 12. In another recent incident, Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) revealed that Russia recruited the perpetrator of an explosion at a draft office in Rivne on Feb. 1 that injured eight service members and killed the suspected bomber. A separate attack on Jan. 31 saw a draft officer shot dead in Poltava Oblast, with the perpetrator detained soon after. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, condemned the recent attacks and called for a full investigation and prosecution of those responsible. Kyiv faces challenges in mobilizing troops amid battlefield losses and the need to rotate soldiers who have been on the front lines since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-draft-officer-attacked-in-lviv-oblast/	2025-02-17T21:24:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2105335403.jpg
Media investigation identifies over 93,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine	The BBC and the independent outlet Mediazona have identified the names of 93,641 Russian soldiers who have been killed during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Since the media outlets&apos; last update in late-January, the names of 2,582 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties. The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, regional media reports, and statements from local authorities. The confirmed death toll now includes 22,000 volunteers, 15,600 recruited prisoners, and 10,700 mobilized soldiers, according to the media outlets. Over 4,700 officers have also been confirmed to have been killed. The media also revealed that nine generals and 500 soldiers with the rank of lieutenant colonel and higher were among the killed. The journalists note that at least 12,000 Russian soldiers are missing amid the war. Russia has gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast in recent months but at the cost of heavy casualties as well as equipment losses. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 15 during his speech at the Munich Security Conference that almost 250,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in the war, including nearly 20,000 soldiers in the battles for Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast alone. Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures, though a Defense Ministry official let slip in December that the department received 48,000 requests to identify missing soldiers. In an interview with NBC published on Feb. 16, Zelensky said over 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and 380,000 injured on the battlefield. As of Feb. 17, Russia has lost a total of 859,920 troops since the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported. The estimate, which is broadly in-line with estimates made by Western intelligence agencies, likely includes those killed, captured, wounded, and missing.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-investigation-identifies-over-93-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine/	2025-02-17T20:51:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1241060998.jpg
Ukraine wins 30 medals at Invictus Games	Team Ukraine secured a total of 30 medals during the 2025 Invictus Games, including 12 gold, 12 silver, and six bronze medal finishes. The international sporting event, held in Vancouver and Whistler, Canada, ran from Feb. 8 to 17 and featured 35 injured Ukrainian soldiers &#x2014; the largest Ukrainian delegation to participate in the games. Ukraine&apos;s total medal count marks the country&apos;s second best result at the Invictus Games, with the country finishing in fourth place overall in terms of medal count. Ukraine has participated in the Invictus Games since 2017, winning a record 34 medals in the last competition in 2023. The United States placed first with 55 medals in total. Ukraine&apos;s top athlete, Ukrainian Armed Forces Servicemember Ihor Oliinyk won a total of six medals, including three gold and three silver in various swimming events. This year&#x2019;s games featured 550 athletes with disabilities, injuries, and illnesses from 25 different countries, competing across 11 sports, from Alpine skiing to swimming. The Invictus Games, created in 2014 by Prince Harry, has sought to create a community for service members, bringing people together through the games themselves and creating a larger network of service members who have lived through the experience of war. The Economist estimates that nearly 400,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been injured and are unable to return to the front line. After coming back from the battlefield or captivity, soldiers are often left to deal with their physical and mental trauma alone. As of July 2024, there are 1.3 million veterans in Ukraine, of whom nearly 80% are mobilized, Suspilne reported, citing the Veterans Affairs Ministry.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-wins-30-medals-at-invictus-games/	2025-02-17T19:58:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/gettyimages-2200119860-612x612.jpg
Over 10,000 applications to join military submitted by young recruits following introduction of 'special contracts,' Defense Ministry says	Ukraine&apos;s military has received over 10,000 applications from volunteer recruits aged 18 to 24 following the introduction of lucrative &quot;special contracts,&quot; Defense Ministry Spokesperson Dmytro Lazutkin said on Ukrainian TV on Feb. 17. The contracts, aimed at recruiting additional military personnel who are not subject to mobilization, provide a number of benefits, including a Hr 1 million ($24,000) annual salary, 0% interest mortgage rates, and free higher education. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry also said those who complete one year of service would be allowed to travel abroad. Currently, with a few exemptions, all men aged 18-60 are prohibited from travelling overseas while martial law is in place. U.S. lawmakers and NATO allies have continuously urged Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 to address manpower shortages. Currently, Ukrainian men aged 25 to 60 are subject to conscription. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s National Security Advisor Michael Waltz said in January that Ukraine &quot;could generate hundreds of thousands of new soldiers&quot; if it lowered its conscription age to 18. Kyiv has long opposed U.S. pressure to lower the draft age, with President Volodymyr Zelensky arguing it would harm Ukraine&apos;s future prospects. The introduction of &quot;special contracts&quot; appears to be an attempt by Kyiv to bridge the gap with a compromise solution &#x2014; entice young people to sign up voluntarily, boosting the armed forces&apos; manpower, while avoiding expanding forced mobilization. A one-year contract option would likely appeal to those interested in contributing to the war effort for a limited period. The Ukrainian military faces a critical manpower shortage, struggling to replenish infantry gaps left by heavy losses in battle-hardened brigades.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-10-000-applications-to-join-military-received-from-young-recruits-following-introduction-of-special-contracts-defense-ministry-says/	2025-02-17T19:04:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2145253264.jpg
US is saying things that are very pleasant for Putin' — Zelensky warns against peace deal without Ukraine's participation ahead of US-Russia meeting	President Volodymyr Zelensky warned against a hastily negotiated peace deal from the Trump administration during a wide-ranging interview with German media network ARD published Feb. 17, reaffirming that Ukraine would not accept a peace deal negotiated without the country&apos;s involvement. &quot;Everything that Russia and the U.S. can agree on &#x2013; if they even want to agree on something &#x2013; concerns their bilateral relations. They certainly cannot negotiate about our people and our lives. About an end to the war without us,&quot; Zelensky told ARD. Zelensky&apos;s comments come ahead of an anticipated meeting on Feb. 18 between a U.S. and Russian delegation as negotiations about how to end the war in Ukraine begin. Kyiv has not received an invitation to attend the meeting in Riyadh, with President Volodymyr Zelensky telling reporters that he found out about the meetings through media reports. &quot;Ukraine knew nothing about it. And Ukraine considers any negotiations on Ukraine without Ukraine (as such) to be futile,&quot; Zelensky said during a press briefing in the United Arab Emirates. NBC News reported on Feb. 16, citing two U.S. officials, that the intention is for the U.S. to host a bilateral meeting with Russia, followed by a bilateral meeting with Ukraine, and culminating with talks together. During his interview, Zelensky also warned against a peace plan that included unfavorable terms for Ukraine, emphasizing that Ukraine &quot;will not give up&quot; its land in a permanent ceasefire. Zelensky rebuked comments made by U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Feb. 12 that Ukraine is unlikely to restore its 2014 borders in any negotiations with Moscow on ending its war. Experts and officials in Ukraine and Europe have criticized Hegseth&apos;s comments for undermining Ukraine&apos;s leverage before peace talks with Russia have even started. &quot;The U.S. is saying things today that are very pleasant for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin. I think that is the crux of the matter. Because they want to please him. Do you know why? To meet each other and to have a quick success,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky added that Hegseth &quot;should delve deeper into the details&quot; and that &quot;he needs time for that.&quot; &quot;Of course, we will reclaim everything. Respect for international law will return &#x2014; if not today, then tomorrow,&quot; Zelensky concluded, noting that ceasefire negotiations must include security guarantees from the United States. Concerns have been raised about Ukraine&apos;s role in the negotiations, with European officials emphasizing that Kyiv must not be sidelined. European leaders held an emergency summit in Paris on Feb. 17 reflected growing European concerns that Trump and Putin may be negotiating over European security without the direct involvement of European leaders. Trump reaffirmed on Feb. 16 that Zelensky would have a say in the process and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-is-saying-things-that-are-very-pleasant-for-putin-zelensky-says-ahead-of-us-russia-meeting/	2025-02-17T18:16:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198893921.jpg
Macron pushes for strong security guarantees for Ukraine after talks with Trump, Zelensky	French President Emmanuel Macron has reaffirmed the need for strong security guarantees for Ukraine, warning that a ceasefire without them risks collapsing like the failed Minsk agreements. His Feb. 17 statement came after urgent talks with European leaders, followed by separate calls with U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Paris summit, convened by Macron on short notice, reflected growing European concerns that Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin may be negotiating over European security without the direct involvement of European leaders. &quot;We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine,&quot; Macron said. &quot;To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians.&quot; He stressed that without such measures, any ceasefire could be short-lived and ineffective. Macron emphasized Europe&#x2019;s responsibility to strengthen its own security: &quot;Europeans must invest better, more, and together in their security and defense&#x2014;both for today and for the future,&quot; he said in his statement on X. Macron also underscored the importance of close coordination with the U.S. and Ukraine in shaping a sustainable security framework. &quot;We will work on this together with all Europeans, Americans, and Ukrainians. This is the key,&quot; he said. French president&apos;s comments reflect growing European concerns about Trump&#x2019;s approach to negotiations with Russia and the potential for a U.S.-brokered deal that does not fully account for Ukrainian and European security needs.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-pushes-for-strong-security-guarantees-for-ukraine-after-talks-with-trump-zelensky/	2025-02-17T16:17:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1977990485.jpg
Starmer urges US support for European peacekeeping force in Ukraine	U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called on U.S. President Donald Trump to provide American military backing for a proposed European peacekeeping force in Ukraine, arguing that only a U.S. security guarantee can deter Russia from launching further aggression. His appeal came after an emergency summit in Paris on Feb. 17, where European leaders debated increasing defense spending and discussed the potential deployment of European forces, according to the Guardian. Starmer reiterated his willingness to send British troops as part of a multinational force but insisted that U.S. involvement was essential to ensure its effectiveness. The Paris summit, convened by French President Emmanuel Macron on short notice, reflected growing European concerns that Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin may be negotiating over European security without the direct involvement of European leaders. While some leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, opposed discussions on deploying a European force, Starmer pushed forward, arguing that European troops would need American logistical and military support. U.K. defense officials have stressed that even a non-combat peacekeeping force of 30,000 troops would require NATO&#x2019;s protection, particularly in terms of air cover and logistics. Scholz, while agreeing that a European force could not operate without U.S. backing, dismissed the timing of the debate as premature. He criticized discussions about troop deployment while Russia continues its war in Ukraine, arguing that the focus should remain on military and financial support for Kyiv. Other European leaders, including Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, emphasized the urgent need to boost European defense spending to counter Russia&#x2019;s military power. Tusk warned that unless European countries take immediate steps to strengthen their defenses, they will struggle to provide meaningful support for Ukraine. If we, Europeans, fail to spend big on defence now, we will be forced to spend 10 times more if we don&#x2019;t prevent a wider war. As the Polish PM I&#x2019;m entitled to say it loud and clear, since Poland already spends almost 5% of its GDP on defence. And we will continue to do so. Concerns over Trump&#x2019;s potential approach to peace negotiations with Russia dominated the summit, as European leaders fear he may push for a ceasefire that does not account for Ukrainian interests. Senior U.S. and Russian diplomats are set to meet in Riyadh to follow up on a phone call Trump initiated with Putin last week. U.S. President Donald Trump reaffirmed on Feb. 16 that Zelensky would have a say in the process and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine. Rubio echoed similar comments, adding that Ukraine and Europe must play a role in serious negotiations with the U.S. and Russia to end the war. European diplomats are increasingly worried that Trump might make unilateral concessions to Russia, such as lifting key sanctions or withdrawing U.S. troops from Europe, as part of a broader deal with Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/starmer-urges-us-support-for-european-peacekeeping-force-in-ukraine/	2025-02-17T14:54:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177726362.jpg
US envoy Kellogg to visit Ukraine on Feb. 19	U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, will arrive in Ukraine on Feb. 19, traveling by overnight train from Poland. His visit will last three days, though the schedule is still being finalized. Speaking to journalists in Brussels on Feb. 17, Kellogg confirmed his travel plans, saying he would first head to Warsaw on Tuesday before taking a night train to Kyiv. &quot;I&#x2019;m taking the train tomorrow night and will be there (in Kyiv) on Wednesday morning,&quot; he said in response to a question from Interfax-Ukraine. His meetings with Ukrainian officials are expected to focus on diplomatic and military support and potential pathways to peace. Kellogg&apos;s visit comes at a critical time as the U.S. intensifies efforts to help end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. However, concerns are mounting in Kyiv and European capitals that they may be sidelined from crucial negotiations, potentially jeopardizing their interests and long-term regional security. Kellogg did not confirm whether he would visit the front lines, as President Volodymyr Zelensky previously suggested. &quot; I want to go to the front with him, and he will go to the front with me. I don&apos;t think he will refuse,&quot; Zelensky said on Feb. 17. Kellogg added that his itinerary remains under discussion but confirmed meetings with Ukrainian officials. &quot;Regarding my trip to Ukraine, it is still being finalized. Will I go? Yes. Will I meet with President Zelensky? Yes,&quot; he said. Speaking during the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15, Kellogg stressed that both Ukraine and Russia would have to make concessions to end the war. &quot;When you say concessions, of course, they&apos;re concessions that both sides are going to have to give,&quot; Kellogg said, without specifying what concessions the countries would have to make. &quot;If you think you&apos;re going to kill your way out of this, you&apos;re wrong because you have a lousy view of history,&quot; Kellogg continued, noting that Russia was &quot;willing to sacrifice&quot; large number of Russian soldiers on the battlefield, invoking memories of the 700,000 Russian soldiers lost in the Battle of Stalingrad during World War II.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-envoy-kellogg-to-visit-ukraine-on-feb-19/	2025-02-17T13:25:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199092179.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia's Lavrov rules out territorial concessions as part of Ukraine peace talks	Key developments on Feb. 17: Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Feb. 17 said there could be &quot;no thought of&quot; territorial concessions to Ukraine on the eve of talks with the U.S. over how to end Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion. Russia illegally annexed Ukraine&apos;s Crimea peninsula in 2014, as well as the Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts in 2022. Russia&apos;s claims to have annexed the four oblasts in their entirety were made despite not controlling all of them, including two regional capitals - Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that as a condition for peace negotiations, Ukrainian troops must leave Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. &quot;Territorial concessions to what is now called Ukraine were made by the Soviet leadership during the formation of the USSR,&quot; Lavrov said in comments reported by Reuters. Lavrov also said he saw no role for Europe in negotiations over how to end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;If they&apos;re going to come up with some crafty ideas about freezing the conflict like this, and they themselves... have in mind the continuation of the war, then why invite them?&quot; he said. Lavrov&apos;s comments came after it was announced that he and Kremlin foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov will fly to Saudi Arabia for talks with a U.S. delegation about how to end the war in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 17. &quot;They are expected to hold a meeting with their American counterparts on Tuesday, which will focus primarily on restoring the entire complex of Russian-American relations,&quot; Peskov said. The U.S. delegation will be led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. NBC News reported on Feb. 16, citing two U.S. officials, that the intention is for the U.S. to host a bilateral meeting with Russia, followed by a bilateral meeting with Ukraine, and culminating with talks together. U.S. President Donald Trump reaffirmed on Feb. 16 that Zelensky would have a say in the process and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine. Rubio echoed similar comments stating that Ukraine and Europe must play a role in serious negotiations with the U.S. and Russia to end the war. Ukrainian drones, operated by the Special Operations Forces (SSO) and Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), hit the Ilsky Oil Refinery in Krasnodar Krai and the Kropotkinskaya oil pumping station in the Kavkazsky District of Kuban overnight on Feb. 17, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The SBU and SSO of the Armed Forces continued the introduction of &apos;drone sanctions&apos; against two important Russian enterprises that work for the enemy military-industrial complex,&quot; the source said. Residents earlier posted videos on social media purportedly showing a large blaze at the refinery in the Seversky district of Krasnodar Krai. Around 1:30 a.m. local time, the sounds of explosions were also reported. Negotiations are one thing, but Russian oil refineries won&#x2019;t shut themselves down. In Russia&apos;s Krasnodar region, the Ilsky oil refinery&#x2014;already targeted multiple times&#x2014;was hit again. As always, observers are delighted. pic.twitter.com/JLCvHv1dOE The attack caused a fire at the plant, which includes six oil refining units with a total capacity of 6.6 million tons per year, the source said. In February 2024, SBU drones also hit this oil refinery, damaging a primary oil-refining unit worth $50 million, according to the source. Ukrainian drones also hit the Kropotkinskaya oil pumping station, the largest in Russia&apos;s Caspian Pipeline Consortium. As a result of the attack, the station was taken out of operation. Oil is now being pumped out, bypassing the station, the source added. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify claims. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones. European nations considering deploying troops to Ukraine as part of a potential ceasefire monitoring mission could send between 25,000 and 30,000 soldiers, the Washington Post reported on Feb. 17, citing sources familiar with the matter. The discussions come amid growing Western deliberations over stationing peacekeeping forces in Ukraine if negotiations with Russia lead to a ceasefire. While the U.S. has ruled out sending troops, Washington has encouraged European allies to take the lead in securing Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability. According to the Post, the estimated troop numbers emerged in response to a U.S. questionnaire sent to European countries asking them to assess their capabilities to support Kyiv. The planned force would not be deployed along the front line but would be positioned to respond swiftly if Russian forces resumed hostilities. France has reportedly conducted the most detailed military planning for such a mission and could commit up to 10,000 troops. The U.K. has also indicated willingness to contribute forces, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer signaling support for a European-led initiative on Feb. 16. Other European nations remain cautious, citing concerns over the escalation and limited military resources, according to the Washington Post. Countries like Poland and Germany are cautious about making major moves ahead of their upcoming national elections. Some are reportedly hesitant to take risks without increased U.S. involvement. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Kyiv had made significant progress securing a foreign military presence on its territory. On Jan. 22, Zelensky said the number of European peacekeepers required to maintain peace in Ukraine would depend on the size of Ukraine&apos;s own military. President Volodymyr Zelesnky said on Feb. 17 he hopes the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, will visit the front lines when he visits later this week. In comments reported by Interfax-Ukraine, Zelensky said Kellogg will arrive in Kyiv on Feb. 20 and could stay for &quot;two days and maybe more.&quot; &quot; I want to go to the front with him, and he will go to the front with me. I don&apos;t think he will refuse,&quot; he added. Kellogg&apos;s visit comes amid several significant developments in the U.S. push to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Kremlin foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov will fly to Saudi Arabia for Feb. 18 talks with a U.S. delegation.

Rubio echoed similar comments stating that Ukraine and Europe must play a role in serious negotiations with the U.S. and Russia to end the war. Bloomberg reported on Feb. 15 that the talks in Saudi Arabia will only include U.S. and Russian officials as a means to pave the way for a potential leaders&#x2019; summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin later this month. The upcoming meetings come amid an official visit by Zelensky to the United Arab Emirates, with planned trips to Saudi Arabia and Turkey in the coming days. Ukraine will &quot;never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia&quot; regarding the outcome of peace negotiation without Ukraine&apos;s participation, President Volodymyr Zelensky told NBC News in an interview published Feb. 16. Zelensky&apos;s comments, which were made during the Munich Security Conference, come amid reports that a U.S. delegation is set to meet with its Russian counterparts on Feb. 18 in Saudi Arabia for the start of negotiations aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. &quot;We have this place at the table at the very beginning, and we are the first who are at this table because the war is in Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky added, noting that Ukrainians would never accept a peace deal that was negotiated on their behalf. &quot;We are thankful for all the support, unity in the U.S. around Ukraine support - even bipartisan support - we are thankful for all of this, but there is no leader in the world that can make a deal with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin without us, about us.&quot; Concerns have been raised about Ukraine&apos;s role in the negotiations, with European officials emphasizing that Kyiv must not be sidelined. Kyiv has not received an invitation to attend the meeting in Riyadh, with President Volodymyr Zelensky telling reporters that he found out about the meetings through media reports. &quot;We didn&apos;t talk about it. The media printed something. I saw that someone said that there would be a meeting in Saudi Arabia. I do not know what it is,&quot; Zelensky said on Feb. 15. Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Zelensky, denied on Feb. 15 that Ukraine will participate in an upcoming meeting between Russia and the United States in Saudi Arabia. &quot;There is nothing on the negotiating table that would be worth discussing,&quot; Podolyak said on Ukrainian TV, adding that &quot;Russia is not ready for negotiations.&quot; Earlier in the day on Feb. 16, Trump reaffirmed that Zelensky would have a say in the process and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine. Soldiers of Ukraine&apos;s 3rd Separate Special Forces Regiment on Feb. 17 released footage of what they claim was a successful operation to clear an industrial enterprise behind Russian lines. In a post accompanying the video, the unit said a concentration of enemy troops was spotted by reconnaissance drones in an unidentified area of the front line. Ukrainian troops reportedly held their positions for two days amid &quot;intense fighting,&quot; during which 23 Russian soldiers were killed, with Kyiv&apos;s troops eventually withdrawing without suffering any losses. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage shared by Ukraine&apos;s Special Operation Forces that purports to show an engagement with Russian troops.

Nearly 380,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been injured since the start of the all-out war, Zelensky told NBC. &quot;Ten of thousands&quot; of Ukrainian troops are currently missing in action or being held in Russian captivity, according to the president. According to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff estimates, Russia has lost a total of 859,920 troops since the start of the war. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured.

Hot phase' of war in Ukraine may 'end soon' with new US leadership, Russian UN envoy says	With the Trump administration now in power in the U.S., there is a chance that the &quot;hot phase&quot; of Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine could soon end, Russian UN Representative Vasily Nebeznya said on Feb. 17 as cited by pro-Kremlin outlet Kommersant. Nebeznya claimed that a ceasefire and freezing hostilities alone would not resolve the conflict, outlining Moscow&apos;s conditions for a settlement. The ambassador&apos;s remarks come ahead of talks between Russian and U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia, where both sides are expected to discuss ending the war. According to Nebeznya, Ukraine should be a &quot;demilitarized, neutral state&quot; outside any alliances, a position Kyiv rejects, warning that without security guarantees, Russia could launch another invasion. Nebenzya also claimed that Ukraine had &quot;irrevocably lost&quot; Crimea, as well as Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. On the same day, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed the idea of making territorial concessions to Ukraine. Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014 and parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts in 2022, despite not fully controlling all of them, including the regional capitals of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. The Kremlin has previously said that any peace talks must be based on Ukrainian forces completely withdrawing from the annexed regions. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 15 that Russia must pull back its troops to the front line as it was before the full-scale invasion in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-un-envoy-says-hot-phase-of-ukraine-invasion-may-soon-end-with-republican-us-leadership/	2025-02-17T11:35:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2159683499.jpg
Ukraine calls for Europe to appoint high-level negotiator for US, Russia peace talks	Ukraine has called on European countries to appoint a high-level representative for potential negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 17, citing Presidential Office Deputy Head Ihor Zhovkva. The news comes after U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said on Feb. 15 that Europe would not be directly involved in peace talks but that its interests would be considered. Zhovkva stressed the urgency of appointing a European representative, saying, &quot;It should be a quickly made decision. I hope right after the Paris meeting. We should act, not reflect.&quot; The official did not name potential candidates but said the person should hold a leader-level position to match the status of President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump, and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Zelensky, speaking in the United Arab Emirates, also backed the idea, emphasizing that Europe should have its own representative to ensure its voice is heard in negotiations. European leaders are gathering in Paris on Feb. 17 for an emergency summit amid concerns that the U.S. is advancing peace talks with Russia without Europe&#x2019;s involvement. At the Munich Security Conference, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic called for the EU to appoint a special envoy to avoid being sidelined from talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-calls-for-europe-to-appoint-high-level-negotiator-for-us-russia-peace-talks/	2025-02-17T10:30:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1400436478.jpeg
An expert's guide to US-Russia Ukraine peace talks in Saudi Arabia	After years of political isolation sparked by the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, U.S. and Russian officials will meet in Saudi Arabia this week to discuss how to bring an end to the war. Neither Ukraine nor Europe has been invited to the main discussion, setting off alarm bells in Kyiv and capitals across the continent that U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin could reach an agreement without Ukraine and Europe&#x2019;s involvement, and one that puts their future security in jeopardy. Announcing that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov would lead their delegation, the Kremlin set an ambitious agenda for the talks. &quot;They are expected to hold a meeting with their American counterparts on Tuesday, which will focus primarily on restoring the entire complex of Russian-American relations,&quot; Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 17. The U.S. delegation will be led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. Though the U.S. and Russia will meet without Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky will also head to Saudi Arabia this week. NBC reported that the intention is for the U.S. to host a bilateral meeting with Russia, followed by a bilateral meeting with Ukraine, and culminating with talks together. Meanwhile, such is the sense of urgency in Europe over the course of events: European leaders are gathering in Paris on Feb. 17 for an emergency summit. So what should we expect from the historic meeting in Saudi Arabia and is the direction of peace negotiations as alarming as many believe? The Kyiv Independent asked Ambassador Kurt Volker, who served as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations in 2017-2019, and U.S. ambassador to NATO in 2008-2009, for his thoughts. The Kyiv Independent: There has been a lot of panic in Ukraine and Europe about the possibility of the U.S. and Russia negotiating a peace agreement over their heads &#x2014; is this justified? Ambassador Kurt Volker: &#xA0;People were upset about (being excluded from the table) and I have to keep telling people there isn&apos;t a table. There is (U.S.) President Trump picking up the phone, calling Putin, calling Zelensky, people having meetings at NATO, people having meetings in Munich. It&apos;s going to be like that. It&apos;s going to be a lot of consultation, a lot of conversations, but there&apos;s no single negotiation going on. Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) looks at U.S. President Donald Trump during the welcoming ceremony before the G20 Summit&apos;s Plenary Meeting in Buenos Aires, Argentina on Nov. 30, 2018. (Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images)In fact, we don&apos;t even know if it&apos;s going to be possible with Russia. I think there are several things going on and a lot of it is being misread, but there are some things to be watching as well. First off, as we knew, President Trump was going to reach out to Putin in order to try to urge him to end the war, and he&apos;s followed that up now by sending a team to meet with the Russians in Saudi Arabia. I think there was a lot of media excitement over different comments that different people said in the past week, and I think some of them were maybe just not careful enough and the media ran with it. For example, when (U.S. Defense Secretary) Pete Hedgeseth at the NATO meeting said that it&apos;s not realistic for Ukraine to take its territory back (to the 2014 borders), that&apos;s not that different from what President Zelensky was saying in January about not being able to take the territory back militarily, but having to pursue that by other means, provided there were security guarantees for the rest of Ukraine. That&apos;s not that different. Similarly with NATO, (Trump) said it&apos;s not realistic to think that NATO membership would be a result of these negotiations, which I think is absolutely right, because Russia would not agree to that, and we shouldn&apos;t even be talking to Russia about that. That&apos;s none of their business. I think those comments were blown out of proportion a bit. The Kyiv Independent: The meeting between the U.S. and Russia has been talked about as if it&apos;s the first stage of negotiations, but is it perhaps more the U.S. testing the waters and seeing what Russia has to offer and how receptive they might be to things? Ambassador Kurt Volker: It&#x2019;s a great question because I know what Russia&apos;s going to do. Russia&apos;s going to show up and put out all of these issues about a global strategic agenda and all these things that they want, and try to blur the picture as much as possible. And I would hope that what the U.S. will do is put all that to one side and say &apos;Yeah, we can get there, but first you have to stop the war in Ukraine. Stop the fighting and then we can talk about if there&apos;s any scope for other things.&#x2019; I hope they have the clarity to do that, but I&apos;m not sure where they are right now. They may just be in listening mode to say &apos;Okay, what is it that Russia is saying and is there scope for ending the war, and is anything they&apos;re talking about reasonable or of interest to the U.S.?&#x2019; They may just be in listening mode and then will come back and report to Trump. It&apos;s really very hard to say at this stage. The Kyiv Independent: What does Europe need to be doing this week? Do they need to assume that the U.S. has stepped out and assume a much bigger role? Or do they need to sit back and wait and see how this week pans out as well? Ambassador Kurt Volker: This is an interesting thing. I&apos;m very glad the Europeans are meeting in Paris and talking about what contributions they can make to a peace settlement in Ukraine, to security guarantees, to perhaps a European troop presence. It&apos;s exactly the kind of thing that they should be doing. It&apos;s a shame that they&apos;re doing it out of anger and fear because they think that Trump is abandoning them. They should be doing it in order to be constructive, to say &apos;We want to see peace and security for Ukraine. Here&apos;s what we can do. Here&apos;s what we want to do to work with the U.S. to bring this about.&apos; So I think they&apos;re getting to this point for some of the wrong reasons. But if they get to that point and actually have a concept of what to do, that would be a good thing. The Kyiv Independent: How concerned should Ukrainians be about the direction things have been heading in recent days? Ambassador Kurt Volker: I don&apos;t think they should overreact or be overly concerned. In fact, I thought that President Zelensky in Munich could have been suggesting things more proactively rather than reacting somewhat bitterly or negatively to the atmosphere in Munich and to President Trump.

(Alex Kraus/Bloomberg via Getty Images)We have strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the Congress. People are already putting forward legislation on how to be able to continue supporting Ukraine militarily through a Lend-Lease program. The dynamics are going to be first seeing whether there&apos;s any scope of possibly ending the war with Russia. And if not, Trump has already said he&apos;s going to increase sanctions and be prepared to increase pressure. So there&apos;s a long way to go. And I wouldn&apos;t overreact in the short term or assume the worst. This is the first time we&apos;ve had any effort and momentum into ending the conflict in three years. We have to see where it goes.	https://kyivindependent.com/an-experts-guide-to-us-russia-ukraine-peace-talks-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-02-17T10:24:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1256148982.jpg
Up to 30,000 European troops reportedly could be deployed to monitor Ukraine ceasefire, Washington Post reports	European nations considering deploying troops to Ukraine as part of a potential ceasefire monitoring mission could send between 25,000 and 30,000 soldiers, the Washington Post reported on Feb. 17, citing sources familiar with the matter. The discussions come amid growing Western deliberations over stationing peacekeeping forces in Ukraine if negotiations with Russia lead to a ceasefire. While the U.S. has ruled out sending troops, Washington has encouraged European allies to take the lead in securing Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability. According to the Post, the estimated troop numbers emerged in response to a U.S. questionnaire sent to European countries asking them to assess their capabilities to support Kyiv. The planned force would not be deployed along the front line but would be positioned to respond swiftly if Russian forces resumed hostilities. France has reportedly conducted the most detailed military planning for such a mission and could commit up to 10,000 troops. The U.K. has also indicated willingness to contribute forces, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer signaling support for a European-led initiative on Feb. 16. Other European nations remain cautious, citing concerns over the escalation and limited military resources, according to the Washington Post. Countries like Poland and Germany are cautious about making major moves ahead of their upcoming national elections. Some are reportedly hesitant to take risks without increased U.S. involvement. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Kyiv had made significant progress securing a foreign military presence on its territory. On Jan. 22, Zelensky said the number of European peacekeepers required to maintain peace in Ukraine would depend on the size of Ukraine&apos;s own military.	https://kyivindependent.com/up-to-30-000-european-troops-may-be-reportedly-deployed-to-monitor-ukraine-ceasefire/	2025-02-17T09:53:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1241758892.jpg
Poroshenko claims Zelensky’s office requested parliament votes in exchange for avoiding sanctions	Former President and current lawmaker Petro Poroshenko on Feb. 17 accused the Presidential Office of offering to support his faction&apos;s involvement in drafting legislation on the Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) in exchange for avoiding sanctions. President Volodymyr Zelensky approved a National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) decision on Feb. 13 to impose indefinite sanctions on several high-profile figures, including Poroshenko. The ex-president denounced the sanctions as unconstitutional and politically motivated. Poroshenko&apos;s faction has opposed a recent bill to purchase two Russian-made reactors from Bulgaria for the KNPP, a move Zelensky called critical for Ukraine&apos;s energy independence. &quot;I was offered that if the faction voted for the bill on the KNPP, I would not have any problems with sanctions,&quot; Poroshenko claimed in an interview with Ukrainian Pravda. Some lawmakers have criticized the deal, calling the reactors outdated and costly. Parliament has faced repeated delays in passing the law, leading Bulgaria to extend the deal&apos;s deadline to March. &quot;I was attacked because we demanded and are now demanding the withdrawal of mandates from the Opposition Platform for Life party and because we demand an end to Russian oil transit through Ukraine,&quot; Poroshenko said. Although Zelensky banned all pro-Kremlin political projects, including the Opposition Platform, in March 2022, the party&apos;s dissolved parliamentary faction left individual lawmakers with their mandates. Poroshenko also accused Zelensky of overstepping his authority with the sanctions and criticized Ukraine&apos;s 2022 anti-oligarch law, which defines oligarchs as individuals with significant media influence, political involvement, and assets exceeding Hr 2.27 billion ($54 million). &quot;Zelensky dreamed maniacally of sanctions,&quot; he said, adding that only a strong response from the Venice Commission had halted the law&apos;s adoption. On Feb. 14, Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office announced criminal proceedings against individuals on the NSDC sanctions list for &quot;serious and especially serious crimes.&quot; Poroshenko was charged with high treason in 2021 for allegedly conspiring with Russian-backed separatists in a coal supply scheme between November 2014 and January 2015, which reportedly generated Hr 3 billion ($72 million) in profits. He has dismissed the charges and sanctions as politically driven.	https://kyivindependent.com/poroshenko-claims-political-motive-behind-sanctions-tied-to-khmelnytskyi-reactor-deal/	2025-02-17T08:46:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2055613178.jpg
Expert guide to US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia	The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Chris York speaks with Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations, about the upcoming U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia and why he thinks Ukraine should not be overly concerned about U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s first steps toward peace negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/expert-guide-to-us-russia-talks-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-02-17T08:24:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/IMG_0343.JPG
Ukraine 'progresses meaningfully' in talks on foreign troop presence, Zelensky says	Ukraine has made progress towards establishing a foreign military contingent on its territory, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 17, following his visit to the United Arab Emirates. Zelensky described the development as a concrete step beyond diplomatic discussions, signaling a shift toward tangible international security cooperation. The announcement comes amid growing discussions in the West about deploying peacekeeping forces to Ukraine if a ceasefire agreement with Russia is reached. While the U.S. has ruled out sending troops, Washington has urged European allies to take the lead. The president also said establishing a foreign contingent could be the first step toward creating a unified European armed force. &quot;I believe that this is the first platform for the future creation of such a force &#x2014; the Armed Forces of Europe, such an army that will be able to respond in the sky, on water, on land, with drones in artificial intelligence, as well as in the event of a Russian offensive,&quot; he said. Zelensky clarified that a foreign military presence does not necessarily mean troops stationed on Ukrainian soil but could include air defense systems and weapons to enhance security. &quot;In the issue of the foreign contingent, it is very important not to lose the United States of America in one form or another,&quot; Zelensky added. A group of European countries is reportedly working on a plan to deploy peacekeepers to Ukraine, reflecting concerns about shifting U.S. security priorities. On Feb. 16, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer indicated Britain&apos;s willingness to contribute troops as part of a European-led initiative, potentially increasing pressure on Germany and other allies to participate. Zelensky first called on Europe to establish its armed forces during a speech at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15, citing concerns over the long-term reliability of U.S. support.	https://kyivindependent.com/foreign-military-contingent-in-ukraine-could-lead-to-unified-european-force-zelensky-says/	2025-02-17T07:58:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178138302.jpg
Ukraine’s long-awaited weapons tech investment boom is finally kicking off	Ukrainian weapons startups are finally seeing an inflow of funds from Western investors who have long been intrigued by the Ukraine&apos;s defense tech sector but have so far kept their money out of the war-torn country. Financial analysis firm Pitchbook provided the Kyiv Independent with data showing a four-fold rise in foreign venture capital deals in Ukraine-headquartered startups after the market flatlined in 2022 and 2023 following Russia&#x2019;s invasion. The total dollar value remains slim &#x2014; just under $20 million by Pitchfork&#x2019;s accounting, and $40 million according to the Ukrainian government. But with most of these new deals coming in at the end of 2024, a dam may be bursting. The new deals are almost all defense-related. The largest publicly disclosed investment rounds topped out at around $3 million, and include Ukrainian AI drone navigation firm Swarmer, AI disinformation fighters Osavul, and Buntar Aerospace, which makes reconnaissance drones. Russia&#x2019;s invasions in both 2014 and 2022 crippled ascendant Ukrainian economies, including a fast-growing tech sector. After 2022, a whole new generation of Ukrainian defense startups cropped up &#x2014; both to arm Ukraine&#x2019;s military and to bank on a rapidly growing global arms industry for a post-war Ukrainian economy. Western investors have until now been hesitant to hand money over to these Ukrainian firms. But pressure on Europe to expand its military muscle might be changing that. Ukrainian sources also show a significant uptick in recent months. The first seed round for many defense start-ups in Ukraine came from Brave1, a government fund launched in 2023 to link militarized techies with both Ukrainian soldiers and foreign money. Brave1 also keeps tabs on that incoming investment. Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov wrote at the end of October that Brave1 had pulled in $25 million in international investment into Ukrainian military tech firms since the start of 2024. By comparison, 2023 topped out at $5 million. Viktoriia Kovalchuk, a Brave1 spokesperson, told the Kyiv Independent that the $25 million rose to $40 million by the end of 2024, just two months later. Fedorov predicted $100 million over the course of 2025. Investments into Ukrainian tech startups in 2014-2024. (Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)The discrepancy with Pitchbook data is at least in part due to Pitchbook limiting its figures to Ukrainian-registered companies. Many Ukrainian defense tech companies use corporate entities in the EU, U.K., or the U.S. for fundraising. Moreover, many Ukrainian defense start-ups are touchy about reporting numbers, leaving many deals in Pitchbook&#x2019;s data registering as $0. For those involved in Ukrainian investing, the trend is palpable. &#x201C;We are getting more and more interest all the time,&#x201D; says Deborah Fairlamb, who runs a U.S.-registered but Ukraine-focused fund, Green Flag VC. &#x201C;There&apos;s been tons of inquiries from governments all over the place.&#x201D; The uptick in foreign money is good news for a literally and metaphorically embattled Ukrainian economy. Foreign investment could fill in for dwindling foreign aid. Even prior to U.S. President Donald Trump slashing USAID, the National Bank of Ukraine noted a serious jump in the outflow of money from Ukraine. The bank wrote that the shift was largely &#x201C;fueled by significantly lower volumes of grants from international partners.&#x201D; Even Fedorov&#x2019;s hoped-for $100 million isn&#x2019;t enough to prop up a national economy. But, aside from helping defend Ukraine, these defense start-ups are hoping to become serious exporters to countries eyeing a truculent Russia with concern. While Silicon Valley remains the spiritual home of the world&#x2019;s venture capital, and Washington commands the largest weapons budget in the world, the new money into Ukraine&#x2019;s defense start-ups doesn&#x2019;t seem to be coming from the U.S. Fairlamb is herself an American national and longtime resident of Ukraine. Green Flag aims squarely at the budding Ukraine military tech world with investments of between $100,000 and $500,000. But newly interested investors reaching out to Green Flag have increasingly come from the European Union. &#x201C;We have seen in the last three months definite interest from European-based (limited partners),&#x201D; Fairlamb explained.

(Andrew Harnik / Getty Images)&#x201C;When Trump was nominated, Europe finally sort of sat up and said, &#x2018;We might need to get our own house in order.&#x2019; Because that was when I saw a notable increase,&#x201D; says Fairlamb. In large part, the reticence of American money is also due to simple geography. &#x201C;I cannot tell you how much VCs like to be able to visit their companies,&#x201D; says Fairlamb. U.S. weapons investment is also focused heavily on companies that can sell to the U.S. Defense Department as soon as possible. &#x201C;Money doesn&#x2019;t chase the products, products chase the money,&#x201D; she said. Many of Ukraine&#x2019;s start-ups advertise their use in active battle as a key selling point. A ceasefire would not, Fairlamb says, smother the newborn market. &#x201D;Ukraine is going to continue to build up its defense ecosystem even after the war ends, because they are never, ever again going to be reliant on the rest of the world to deliver weapons,&#x201D; says Fairlamb.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-long-awaited-weapons-tech-investment-boom-is-finally-kicking-off/	2025-02-17T07:51:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156532377.jpg
Russia close to deal with Syria for post-Assad military presence, Bloomberg reports	Russia is reportedly nearing a deal with Syria to maintain a limited military presence in the country after the fall of former President Bashar al-Assad&apos;s regime, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 17, citing sources familiar with the matter. Since Assad&apos;s overthrow in December, Russia has begun withdrawing military assets from Syria, raising doubts about its future role in the region. The Kremlin is seeking continued access to the naval base in Tartus and the Khmeimim airbase, which have served as key military footholds in the region. Russia deployed troops to Syria in 2015 to bolster Assad&apos;s regime, which used Moscow&apos;s backing, in the form of ground troops and aerial bombardment, to gain the upper hand in the country&apos;s protracted civil war. In exchange for maintaining its military facilities, Moscow may assist Damascus in countering the Islamic State group, which remains active in eastern Syria, according to Bloomberg sources. Russia&apos;s presence could also help balance Turkey&apos;s influence in the country. The reported deal follows the first official phone conversation between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syria&apos;s new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, on Feb. 12. Syrian Defense Minister Murhaf Abu Qasra suggested earlier this month that Russia&apos;s ability to retain its military bases would depend on what it offers in return. Syria&apos;s new government has reportedly demanded that Moscow hand over Assad and his close aides, Reuters reported on Jan. 28. Ukraine has also engaged with Syria&apos;s new government regarding Russia&apos;s military presence. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha visited Damascus on Dec. 30 and later indicated that Kyiv and Damascus share similar views on the matter. Western officials have been cautious in their approach to Syria&apos;s new government. EU chief diplomat Kaja Kallas warned that while humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts are being scaled up, sanctions could be reinstated if Damascus takes &quot;wrong steps.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-close-to-deal-with-syria-for-post-assad-military-presence-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-17T07:11:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1183207523.jpg
Russia's Lavrov rules out territorial concessions as part of Ukraine peace talks	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Feb. 17 said there could be &quot;no thought of&quot; territorial concessions to Ukraine on the eve of talks with the U.S. over how to end Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion. Russia illegally annexed Ukraine&apos;s Crimea peninsula in 2014, as well as the Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts in 2022. Russia&apos;s claims to have annexed the four oblasts in their entirety were made despite not controlling all of them, including two regional capitals - Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that as a condition for peace negotiations, Ukrainian troops must leave Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. &quot;Territorial concessions to what is now called Ukraine were made by the Soviet leadership during the formation of the USSR,&quot; Lavrov said in comments reported by Reuters. Lavrov&apos;s comments came after it was announced that he and Kremlin foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov will fly to Saudi Arabia for talks with a U.S. delegation about how to end the war in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 17. &quot;They are expected to hold a meeting with their American counterparts on Tuesday, which will focus primarily on restoring the entire complex of Russian-American relations,&quot; Peskov said. The U.S. delegation will be led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. NBC News reported on Feb. 16, citing two U.S. officials, that the intention is for the U.S. to host a bilateral meeting with Russia, followed by a bilateral meeting with Ukraine, and culminating with talks together. U.S. President Donald Trump reaffirmed on Feb. 16 that Zelensky would have a say in the process and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine. Rubio echoed similar comments stating that Ukraine and Europe must play a role in serious negotiations with the U.S. and Russia to end the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-lavrov-rules-out-territorial-concessions-as-part-of-ukraine-peace-talks/	2025-02-17T06:10:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2050986119.jpg
Film 'Rock, Scissors, Paper' about war in Ukraine wins BAFTA award	The film &quot;Rock, Paper, Scissors&quot; won the Best British Short Film award at the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTA) on Feb. 16. The film was directed by Franz Bohm, a 26-year-old British man of German descent. It stars Ukrainian actors Oleksandr Rudynskyi, Serhii Kalantai, Yurii Radionov, and Oleksandr Yatsenko. The plot is based on real events that happened during Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The main character is an 18-year-old boy named Ivan, whose father has been working as a surgeon in the shelter since the first days of the Russian invasion. However, information about the shelter reaches the Russian troops. To protect his family and the wounded, Ivan joins the army and goes to the battlefield. When Rudynskyi, who played the main character, received the award, he said he was dedicating it to Yevhen Svitlychnyi, a 29-year-old Ukrainian actor and a soldier who died in the Kharkiv sector of the front line on July 19, 2023. &quot;I dedicate this award to my friend Zhenya (Yevhen) Svitlychnyi, who died in the war five days before the start of filming. And to all those who defend my country and make it independent. Many thanks to BAFTA, and glory to Ukraine!&quot; Rudynskyi said on the stage during the award ceremony. The world premiere of the film took place in 2024 at the Show Me Shorts Film Festival. In 2024, another film about the war in Ukraine, the Ukrainian documentary &quot;20 Days in Mariupol,&quot; won an award for best documentary at the British Academy Film Awards. The film was directed by Ukrainian journalist Mstyslav Chernov, who reached Mariupol with two Associated Press colleagues the day the full-scale invasion was launched and remained in the city for 20 days under heavy bombardment.	https://kyivindependent.com/film-rock-scissors-paper-about-war-in-ukraine-wins-bafta-award/	2025-02-17T06:07:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200037515.jpg
Zelensky to visit Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, Reuters reports	President Volodymyr Zelensky will arrive in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, he said during a press briefing in the United Arabic Emirates, Reuters reported. The Ukrainian president&apos;s visit coincides with the U.S.-Russia talks on ending the war in Ukraine, which will take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Zelensky said that Ukraine would not participate in these talks. &quot;Ukraine knew nothing about it. And Ukraine considers any negotiations on Ukraine without Ukraine (as such) to be futile,&quot; Zelensky said during a press briefing in the United Arabic Emirates. &quot;And we cannot recognize anything or any arrangements about us without us. And we will not recognize such an arrangement,&quot; Zelensky added. Zelensky stressed that his official visit to Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with &quot;the things that are happening in Saudi Arabia at the level of representatives of the U.S. and Russia.&quot; The president added that he would discuss negotiations with Saudi Arabia&apos;s Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman. On Feb. 16, Saudi Arabia and Ukraine delegations met to discuss increased investment and bilateral cooperation between the two nations. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff are expected to hold meetings with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Kremlin foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov on the exact dates. U.S. President Donald Trump also announced that he would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia as part of efforts to negotiate an end to the war. It remains unclear to what extent Ukraine will be involved in these discussions.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-visit-saudi-arabia-on-feb-18-reuters-reports/	2025-02-17T05:13:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1250849333.jpg
Zelensky hopes Kellogg will visit front lines during trip to Ukraine	President Volodymyr Zelesnky said on Feb. 17 he hopes the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, will visit the front lines when he visits later this week. In comments reported by Interfax-Ukraine, Zelensky said Kellogg will arrive in Kyiv on Feb. 20 and could stay for &quot;two days and maybe more.&quot; &quot; I want to go to the front with him, and he will go to the front with me. I don&apos;t think he will refuse,&quot; he added. Kellogg&apos;s visit comes amid several significant developments in the U.S. push to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Kremlin foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov will fly to Saudi Arabia for Feb. 18 talks with a U.S. delegation. The U.S. delegation will be led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. NBC News reported on Feb. 16, citing two U.S. officials, that the intention is for the U.S. to host a bilateral meeting with Russia, followed by a bilateral meeting with Ukraine, and culminating with talks together. U.S. President Donald Trump reaffirmed on Feb. 16 that Zelensky would have a say in the process and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine. Rubio echoed similar comments stating that Ukraine and Europe must play a role in serious negotiations with the U.S. and Russia to end the war. Bloomberg reported on Feb. 15 that the talks in Saudi Arabia will only include U.S. and Russian officials as a means to pave the way for a potential leaders&#x2019; summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin later this month. The upcoming meetings come amid an official visit by Zelensky to the United Arab Emirates, with planned trips to Saudi Arabia and Turkey in the coming days.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-hopes-kellogg-will-visit-front-lines-during-trip-to-ukraine/	2025-02-17T04:55:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193307307.jpg
Ukraine calendar: Events to look out for this week	Editor&apos;s note: This article is an on-site version of KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter covering events from Feb. 17-Feb. 23. Sign up here to start your week with an agenda of Ukraine-related events, delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday. European leaders will hold an emergency summit in Paris on Feb. 17 to discuss security and Ukraine&#x2019;s peace negotiation in the wake of the alarming (though not surprising) statements by US figures at the Munich Security Conference. The session will include leaders of the main European states, NATO, and the European Council and Commission. It remains unclear whether President Zelensky will be invited. US President Donald Trump and his administration members&#x2019; comments on Ukraine in the past week have acted as a (incredibly belated) wake-up call for European leaders who now appear to be scrambling to maintain any relevance in the negotiations &#x2013; and to define what a post-US security architecture on the continent could look like. Trump&#x2019;s special Ukraine-Russia envoy Keith Kellogg will visit Kyiv on Feb. 20. He was expected in Kyiv twice before, but never arrived. After meeting with the Ukrainian delegation in Munich, he will head to Brussels then Kyiv, providing a fig leaf for the Trump administration&#x2019;s dismissive stance on the European and Ukrainian roles in peace talks.The main (previously planned) diplomatic event will be the G20 foreign ministers meeting in Johannesburg on Feb. 20-21, with South Africa hosting as the current G20 chair. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced via X, that he will not participate in the meeting (also, he may be in Saudi Arabia), following President Donald Trump&#x2019;s recent threat to withdraw financial support from the country.Relations between the U.S. and South Africa have sharply deteriorated since Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on account of what the US government (especially South Africa-born Elon Musk) describes as &#x201C;racist policies&#x201D; &#x2013; notably the land expropriation law &#x2013; towards minority white Afrikaaners (whom they have offered refugee status in the US).On Feb. 23, Germany will hold a snap election with Christian Merz&#x2019;s conservative CDU/CSU leading in polls. The latter have signaled stronger backing for Ukraine, but would need a coalition, likely with Olaf Scholz&#x2019;s SPD (which has been hesitant, wary of &#x201C;escalation&#x201D;; reports suggest this was driven by Scholz himself, though). The far-right and Ukraine-sceptic AfD is on the rise; in total, a third of votes could go to extremist (and anti-Ukraine) parties.For Ukraine, Germany&#x2019;s political instability raises concerns over future aid and military commitments. Although Berlin has allocated &#x20AC;37 bn in support, key weapons like Taurus missiles remain undelivered. The election will determine whether Germany steps into a leadership role or remains mostly reactive.Meanwhile, speculation continues over potential government changes in Ukraine, particularly regarding Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. Various sources suggest that his position may be at risk as of this week, amid an open anti-corruption probe and investigation of possible abuse of power.If you have an upcoming event that you would like featured in our newsletter, please get in touch via insights@kyivindependent.com	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-calendar-events-to-look-out-for-this-week/	2025-02-17T04:19:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2021278696.jpg
Drone sanctions' — Ukraine strikes Ilsky Oil Refinery in Russia's Krasnodar Krai, SBU source says	Ukrainian drones, operated by the Special Operations Forces (SSO) and Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), hit the Ilsky Oil Refinery in Krasnodar Krai and the Kropotkinskaya oil pumping station in the Kavkazsky District of Kuban overnight on Feb. 17, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The SBU and SSO of the Armed Forces continued the introduction of &apos;drone sanctions&apos; against two important Russian enterprises that work for the enemy military-industrial complex,&quot; the source said. Residents earlier posted videos on social media purportedly showing a large blaze at the refinery in the Seversky district of Krasnodar Krai. Around 1:30 a.m. local time, the sounds of explosions were also reported. Negotiations are one thing, but Russian oil refineries won&#x2019;t shut themselves down. In Russia&apos;s Krasnodar region, the Ilsky oil refinery&#x2014;already targeted multiple times&#x2014;was hit again. As always, observers are delighted. pic.twitter.com/JLCvHv1dOE The attack caused a fire at the plant, which includes six oil refining units with a total capacity of 6.6 million tons per year, the source said. In February 2024, SBU drones also hit this oil refinery, damaging a primary oil-refining unit worth $50 million, according to the source. Ukrainian drones also hit the Kropotkinskaya oil pumping station, the largest in Russia&apos;s Caspian Pipeline Consortium. As a result of the attack, the station was taken out of operation. Oil is now being pumped out, bypassing the station, the source added. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify claims. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hit-oil-refinery-in-russias-krasnodar-krai-largest-oil-pumping-station-of-caspian-pipeline-consortium-sbu-source-says/	2025-02-17T03:30:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/--------_---_----.png
Russia's Lavrov to meet US delegation in Saudi Arabia for Ukraine peace talks, Kremlin says	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Kremlin foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov will fly to Saudi Arabia for talks with a U.S. delegation about how to end the war in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 17. &quot;They are expected to hold a meeting with their American counterparts on Tuesday, which will focus primarily on restoring the entire complex of Russian-American relations,&quot; Peskov said. The U.S. delegation will be led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. NBC News reported on Feb. 16, citing two U.S. officials, that the intention is for the U.S. to host a bilateral meeting with Russia, followed by a bilateral meeting with Ukraine, and culminating with talks together.

Macron hosts summit of European powers to discuss plan for Ukraine's 'automatic NATO membership'	French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting a Paris summit of European powers on Feb. 17 to discuss Ukraine&apos;s potential NATO membership, among other issues, The Guardian reported. The summit will be held on the same day a U.S. delegation arrives in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for talks with Russian officials on ending the war in Ukraine. Macron is planning to convene European leaders to demand that the U.S. stop blocking Europe and Kyiv from the negotiation process, The Guardian reported. The Paris meeting will discuss the defense capabilities that Europe could provide to Ukraine to ensure reliable security guarantees, including a plan for Ukraine&apos;s &quot;automatic membership in NATO&quot; in the event of Russia&apos;s clear ceasefire violation, the newspaper reported. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk will attend the meeting. Italy and Denmark, representing the Baltic and Scandinavian countries, as well as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, will also join the summit, the media reported citing undisclosed European diplomatic sources. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is scheduled to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in talks between the U.S. and Russia. This will be the first meeting between the two countries at this level in the last two years. European leaders are concerned about the potential imposition of neutrality on Ukraine and joint U.S.-Russian powers&apos; sharing of agreed-upon spheres of influence following the negotiations. The summit will also have to determine how to respond to a U.S. request to clarify whether EU leaders are willing to contribute troops to a stabilization force in the event of a ceasefire, according to The Guardian. Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. While NATO members asserted at the 2024 summit in Washington, D.C., that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; they have yet to extend a formal invitation. Ukraine has relied on NATO member states for military aid in its defense against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Ukraine regularly holds visits and summits with NATO leaders.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-gathers-summit-of-european-defense-powers-to-discuss-ukraines-automatic-nato-membership/	2025-02-17T02:56:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1977990485.jpg
23 invaders destroyed' — Ukraine's special forces release video of operation behind Russian lines	Soldiers of Ukraine&apos;s 3rd Separate Special Forces Regiment on Feb. 17 released footage of what they claim was a successful operation to clear an industrial enterprise behind Russian lines. In a post accompanying the video, the unit said a concentration of enemy troops was spotted by reconnaissance drones in an unidentified area of the front line. Ukrainian troops reportedly held their positions for two days amid &quot;intense fighting,&quot; during which 23 Russian soldiers were killed, with Kyiv&apos;s troops eventually withdrawing without suffering any losses. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage shared by Ukraine&apos;s Special Operation Forces that purports to show an engagement with Russian troops.

Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces are active on various fronts. Last month its 8th Regiment published a video of a large assault group of purportedly North Korean soldiers in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast crossing an open field and forest, followed by close combat footage with only dozens of meters between the two sides. In the end, graphic footage shows killed soldiers claimed to be North Koreans. &quot;At the ninth hour of the battle, the Special Operations Forces had only a third of their ammunition left. They spent the rest on destroying (North Korean forces),&quot; the Telegram post read. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage shared by Ukraine&apos;s Special Operation Forces that purports to show an engagement with North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast.

Nearly 380,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been injured since the start of the all-out war, Zelensky told NBC. &quot;Ten of thousands&quot; of Ukrainian troops are currently missing in action or being held in Russian captivity, according to the president. According to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff estimates, Russia has lost a total of 859,920 troops since the start of the war. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured.	https://kyivindependent.com/23-invaders-destroyed-ukraines-special-forces-release-video-of-operation-behind-russian-lines/	2025-02-17T02:44:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-17-at-12_39_28.png
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 3, injure 8 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed three and injured eight civilians over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 17. Russian forces launched 147 drones from the Russian cities of Orel, Bryansk, Kursk, Shatalovo, Millerovo, and Primosk-Akhtarsk at Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 83 drones over Kharkiv, Sumy, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Odesa, Kirovohrad, &#xA0;Zaporizhzhia, and Kyiv oblasts, the Air Force said. Another 59 drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are usually decoys. Russia sends them alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. In Donetsk Oblast, two people were killed in the attack against the town of Bilytske, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian forces attacked the town of Marhanets overnight with artillery, injuring four people, including a 64-year-old woman and three men, aged 22, 26, and 54. One of the injured was hospitalized in a moderate severity condition, according to Governor Serhii Lysak. The day prior, Russia struck the Nikopol district with drones and artillery. As a result of the attacks, a 52-year-old man was killed, while a 74-year-old man suffered a leg injury, Lysak reported. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 32 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, two people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Kyiv Oblast, Russian forces attacked several settlements with drones. A man suffered a hand injury in the attack against the Borysil district, local military administration reported. He was treated at the scene of impact.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-3-injure-8-over-past-day/	2025-02-17T00:14:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-17-09_19_36.jpeg

Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures, though a Defense Ministry official in recent months let slip that the department received 48,000 requests to identify missing soldiers. In an attempt to mitigate casualties among Russian citizens, Moscow has also made an effort to recruit foreigners into their army. Russia has cooperated with North Korea, with Pyongyang reportedly dispatching 10,000-12,000 soldiers to assist Russia with its war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-46-000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-since-start-of-war-zelensky-says/	2025-02-16T23:41:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2163893306--1-.jpg

Ukraine will 'never accept' outcome of peace negotiations without Ukraine's participation, Zelensky says	Ukraine will &quot;never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia&quot; regarding the outcome of peace negotiation without Ukraine&apos;s participation, President Volodymyr Zelensky told NBC News in an interview published Feb. 16. Zelensky&apos;s comments, which were made during the Munich Security Conference, come amid reports that a U.S. delegation is set to meet with its Russian counterparts on Feb. 18 in Saudi Arabia for the start of negotiations aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. &quot;We have this place at the table at the very beginning, and we are the first who are at this table because the war is in Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky added, noting that Ukrainians would never accept a peace deal that was negotiated on their behalf. &quot;We are thankful for all the support, unity in the U.S. around Ukraine support - even bipartisan support - we are thankful for all of this, but there is no leader in the world that can make a deal with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin without us, about us.&quot; Concerns have been raised about Ukraine&apos;s role in the negotiations, with European officials emphasizing that Kyiv must not be sidelined. Kyiv has not received an invitation to attend the meeting in Riyadh, with President Volodymyr Zelensky telling reporters that he found out about the meetings through media reports. &quot;We didn&apos;t talk about it. The media printed something. I saw that someone said that there would be a meeting in Saudi Arabia. I do not know what it is,&quot; Zelensky said on Feb. 15. Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Zelensky, denied on Feb. 15 that Ukraine will participate in an upcoming meeting between Russia and the United States in Saudi Arabia. &quot;There is nothing on the negotiating table that would be worth discussing,&quot; Podolyak said on Ukrainian TV, adding that &quot;Russia is not ready for negotiations.&quot; Earlier in the day on Feb. 16, Trump reaffirmed that Zelensky would have a say in the process and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-will-never-accept-outcome-of-peace-negotiations-without-ukraines-participation-zelensky-says/	2025-02-16T21:09:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164821112.jpg
Fire reported at oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar Krai following 'massive' drone attack	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A large fire reportedly erupted at the Ilsky oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai overnight on Feb. 17 following large-scale Ukrainian drone attacks on the region, Russian Telegram media channels reported. Videos posted on social media by local residents purportedly show a large blaze at the refinery located in the Seversky district of the region. Residents reported hearing sounds of explosions around 1:30 a.m. local time. Regional Governor Veniamin Kondratyev claimed earlier in the evening that Ukrainian drones carried out a &quot;massive attack&quot; on the region, damaging 12 homes and injuring a woman &#x2014; although Kondratyev made no mention of the attack on the refinery. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify claims made by Russian officials. Emergency crews are currently on-scene. No information was immediately available as to any casualties at the refinery or the extent of the damage. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones. The purported attack follows just days after Ukraine&apos;s military attacked the Afipskiy oil refinery in Krasnodar Krai on Feb. 10. The attack targeted the key facility which processes 6.25 million tons of oil annually.	https://kyivindependent.com/fire-reported-at-oil-refinery-in-russias-krasnodar-krai-following-massive-drone-attack/	2025-02-16T20:12:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1209343722.jpg
Putin 'wants to stop fighting,' Trump says, dismisses Russia's territorial ambitions	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 16 that he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;wants to stop fighting&quot; Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, dismissing Moscow&apos;s territorial ambitions in the embattled country. &quot;I think he wants to stop fighting. I see that. We spoke long and hard,&quot; Trump told reporters, referring to a phone call he held with Putin on Feb. 12 in which the two leaders agreed negotiations to end the war in Ukraine would start &quot;immediately.&quot; &quot;They have a big, powerful machine. You understand that,&quot; Trump added. &quot;And they defeated Hitler and they defeated Napoleon. You know, they&#x2019;ve been fighting a long time... But I think he would like to stop fighting.&quot; Trump&apos;s comments come as a U.S. delegation led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff readies to meet its Russian counterparts on Feb. 18, Axios reported. Concerns have been raised about Ukraine&apos;s role in the negotiations, with European officials emphasizing that Kyiv must not be sidelined. Kyiv has not received an invitation to attend the meeting in Riyadh, with President Volodymyr Zelensky telling reporters that he found out about the meetings through media reports. &quot;We didn&apos;t talk about it. The media printed something. I saw that someone said that there would be a meeting in Saudi Arabia. I do not know what it is,&quot; Zelensky said on Feb. 15 during the Munich Security Conference. Zelensky seemingly rebuffed Trump&apos;s opinion on Putin&apos;s motives during an interview with NBC News on Feb. 16. &quot;There are risks that this can be Poland and Lithuania, because we believe that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will wage war against NATO,&quot; he said. Russia is training 150,000 troops in Belarus for a large-scale operation that could happen as early as this summer, Zelensky said. The preparations could signal a plan to invade a NATO country. European leaders, who will participate in an emergency summit in Paris on Feb. 17 over concerns that the U.S. is advancing peace talks with Russia without Europe, have shared similar concerns over Russia&apos;s territorial ambitions. When asked by reporters whether he believes Russia seeks to seize the entire Ukrainian territory, Trump dismissed the prospects. &quot;I think he wants to stop. That was my question to him. Because if he&#x2019;s going to go on, that would have been a big problem for us, and that would have caused me a big problem, because you just can&#x2019;t let that happen.&quot; Earlier in the day, Trump reaffirmed that Zelensky would have a say in the peace negotiations and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-wants-to-stop-fighting-trump-says-dismisses-russias-territorial-ambitions/	2025-02-16T19:32:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1152488863.jpg
US, Russian officials to meet on Feb. 18 in Saudi Arabia, Axios reports	A U.S. delegation is set to meet with its Russian counterparts on Feb. 18 in Saudi Arabia, Axios reported on Feb. 16, citing two sources with direct knowledge of the meeting. The delegation, led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, is set to begin negotiations aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. It was not immediately clear as to who will be a part of the Russian delegation, although one source told Axios that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was likely to attend. Concerns have been raised about Ukraine&apos;s role in the negotiations, with European officials emphasizing that Kyiv must not be sidelined. Kyiv has not received an invitation to attend the meeting in Riyadh, with President Volodymyr Zelensky telling reporters that he found out about the meetings through media reports. &quot;We didn&apos;t talk about it.

Rubio echoed similar comments stating that Ukraine and Europe must play a role in serious negotiations with the U.S. and Russia to end the war. Bloomberg reported on Feb. 15 that the talks in Saudi Arabia will only include U.S. and Russian officials as a means to pave the way for a potential leaders&#x2019; summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin later this month. The upcoming meetings come amid an official visit by Zelensky to the United Arab Emirates, with planned trips to Saudi Arabia and Turkey in the coming days. Zelensky said he has no plans to meet with any Russian or U.S. delegations while in the Middle East.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-russian-officials-to-meet-on-feb-18-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-02-16T18:27:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194087620.jpg
Trump confirms Zelensky will take part in Ukraine peace talks as US, Russia prepare Saudi meeting	A team of advisers to U.S. President Donald Trump is set to meet with Russian officials next week in Saudi Arabia to begin negotiations aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, two U.S. government officials familiar with the matter told CBS News. The delegation, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, will represent Trump in discussions following his recent phone calls with President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump confirmed the efforts, adding that the U.S. is working hard to facilitate peace and assuring that Zelensky will be involved in the talks. Concerns have been raised about Ukraine&apos;s role in the negotiations, with European officials emphasizing that Kyiv must not be sidelined. Trump reaffirmed that Zelensky would have a say in the process and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine. However, he expressed skepticism about Zelensky&#x2019;s warning that Russia could escalate its war beyond Ukraine if the U.S. withdraws from NATO. Rubio, speaking on CBS&apos; &quot;Face the Nation,&quot; on Feb. 16 said Trump would quickly determine whether Russia&#x2019;s interest in peace is genuine or merely a tactic to buy time. Discussions between the U.S. and Russia have already begun, with Rubio speaking to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov over the weekend, according to CBS. The potential terms of an agreement remain unclear. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said that &quot;everything is on the table&quot; but suggested Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership is unlikely. Trump echoed this sentiment, saying that Russia has long opposed Ukraine joining the alliance and implying that this stance would not change. Hegseth also cast doubt on Ukraine&apos;s ability to reclaim all its territory, including Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. Further high-level discussions are expected, with Trump confirming that he plans to meet with Putin in Saudi Arabia &quot;very soon,&quot; though he did not specify a date.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-confirms-zelensky-will-take-part-in-ukraine-peace-talks-as-us-russia-prepare-saudi-meeting/	2025-02-16T16:35:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1993704243.jpg
Starmer open to deploying British troops for Ukraine peacekeeping effort	U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has signaled that his country is prepared to send troops to Ukraine as part of a European-led peacekeeping force to enforce a future peace deal. In an article for the Telegraph, Starmer acknowledged the gravity of such a decision, emphasizing that he did not take lightly the idea of placing British servicemen and women in harm&#x2019;s way: &quot;But any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine&#x2019;s security is helping to guarantee the security of our continent, and the security of this country.&quot; His remarks come ahead of a key meeting in Paris, where European leaders will discuss security commitments for Ukraine amid growing concerns over reduced U.S. involvement in European defense. The Paris summit, convened by French President Emmanuel Macron, was prompted by the exclusion of European nations from early peace talks between the U.S. and Russia, as well as indications that a future Donald Trump administration would scale back security guarantees for Europe. &quot;I am heading to Paris with a very clear message for our European friends. We have got to show we are truly serious about our own defense and bearing our own burden. We have talked about it for too long &#x2013; and President (Donald) Trump is right to demand that we get on with it,&quot; Starmer said. Starmer&apos;s statement is expected to increase pressure on allies, particularly Germany, to support a European-led initiative aimed at ensuring Ukraine&#x2019;s long-term security. He also suggested that the U.K. could serve as a crucial link between Europe and the United States in brokering sustainable peace. While Russia and the U.S. are set to begin peace discussions in Saudi Arabia, Ukraine has been seemingly left out of the negotiations&#x2014;a move Starmer strongly criticized. Drawing parallels to the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, he warned that sidelining Kyiv could lead to a fragile ceasefire that fails to deter future Russian aggression. The prime minister reiterated Britain&#x2019;s long-term support for Ukraine, including its pledge of three billion ($3.6 billion) pounds annually for military aid until at least 2030, and said that the U.K. is willing to contribute troops to ensure security guarantees. &quot;We must be clear that peace cannot come at any cost. Ukraine must be at the table in these negotiations because anything less would accept Putin&#x2019;s position that Ukraine is not a real nation,&quot; Starmer wrote. The specifics of a European peacekeeping force remain uncertain, but one proposal under discussion involves deploying European troops behind Ukrainian forces rather than directly along the front lines of a potential ceasefire. Some estimates suggest that as many as 100,000 soldiers may be required to make such a mission effective, raising questions about whether European nations would commit sufficient forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/starmer-open-to-deploying-british-troops-for-ukraine-peacekeeping-effort-telegraph-reports/	2025-02-16T15:38:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194219228.jpg
Ukraine’s place in EU, NATO non-negotiable, Finnish president says	Finnish President Alexander Stubb has emphasized that Ukraine&#x2019;s membership in the European Union and NATO is non-negotiable, adding that these alliances are essential for ensuring the country&#x2019;s sovereignty and security. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 16, Stubb outlined a three-stage process that he believes Ukraine must go through to achieve peace, highlighting the importance of continued Western support. The first stage, according to Stubb, involves initial negotiations where Ukraine should receive military aid and increased international pressure must be applied on Russia. This would include expanded sanctions and asset freezes. He noted that during this phase, the United States may propose temporary security guarantees for Ukraine, but the timeline for these discussions remains unclear. Stubb described the second stage as a ceasefire, stressing that this would not mark the beginning of a peace process but rather serve as an interim measure. He suggested that a ceasefire should include border demarcation, international monitoring, and humanitarian agreements such as prisoner exchanges and the return of kidnapped Ukrainian children. Additionally, he argued that if Russia were to launch another attack, Ukraine should immediately be granted NATO membership as a deterrent. Drawing on Finland&#x2019;s own historical experience, Stubb stressed that any resolution must uphold Ukraine&#x2019;s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. He recalled how Finland, despite maintaining its sovereignty after World War II, was forced to cede some territory and accept foreign policy restrictions. In Ukraine&#x2019;s case, he made it clear that no such compromises should be made on its future alliances. Stubb added that full recognition of Ukraine as a sovereign European state, backed by security guarantees and NATO integration, must be the end goal of any diplomatic efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-place-in-eu-nato-non-negotiable-finnish-president-says/	2025-02-16T15:23:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199284056.jpg
Zelensky arrives in UAE, hints at humanitarian, economic cooperation	President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with First Lady Olena Zelenska for an official visit on Feb. 16. The trip comes directly after Zelensky&apos;s appearance at the Munich Security Conference and kicks off a regional tour that includes official visits to Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Zelensky and Zelenska met UAE officials upon their arrival in the country on Feb. 16. &quot;Our top priority is bringing even more of our people home from captivity,&quot; Zelensky said. The visit will center on economic partnership and bilateral cooperation in investment, Zelensky added. Zelensky hinted at a possible important agreement between the two nations, mentioning a &quot;large-scale humanitarian program&quot; in his announcement. Zelensky told reporters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference that he intends to pay official visits to the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Delegations from Saudi Arabia and Ukraine met on Feb. 16 to discuss increased investment and bilateral cooperation between the two nations ahead of Zelensky&apos;s visit. The president&apos;s Middle Eastern tour begins as senior U.S. and Russian officials prepare to meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to discuss Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Zelensky said he has no plans to meet with any Russian or U.S. delegations in the Middle East.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-arrives-in-the-uae-hints-at-humanitarian-and-economic-cooperation/	2025-02-16T13:54:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-16-at-3_54_01-PM.png
A colonial agreement' — former Ukrainian official slams US minerals deal, AP reports	The United States offered Ukraine &quot;a colonial agreement&quot; on exchanging Ukrainian rare earth minerals for U.S. military aid, a former senior Ukrainian official told the Associated Press (AP) on Feb. 16. The comment comes after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered a draft of the agreement to President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 12. Zelensky refused to sign the document, saying it did not sufficiently protect Ukraine&apos;s interests. &quot;For me is very important the connection between some kind of security guarantees and some kind of investment,&quot; Zelensky said. The president did not give details as to the problems with the document. &quot;It&apos;s a colonial agreement and Zelensky cannot sign it,&quot; a former senior Ukrainian official told the AP. The former official spoke under the condition of anonymity in order to speak freely. The current and former senior Ukrainian officials who spoke to the AP said that the U.S. delegates at the Munich Security Conference did not offer any security guarantees in exchange for Ukraine&apos;s rare earth minerals. According to the senior Ukrainian official, the U.S. delegates were more focused on the commercial aspects of a future partnership and did not have &quot;ready answers&quot; to how Ukraine&apos;s mineral deposits could be protected in the event of ongoing Russian aggression. White House National Security Council Spokesperson Brian Hughes said Zelensky&apos;s refusal to sign the agreement was &quot;short-sighted.&quot; National Security Adviser Mike Waltz also encouraged Zelensky to take the deal in comments to Fox News on Feb. 16. &quot;Zelensky would be very wise to enter into this agreement with the United States,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re talking about growing the pie for the Ukrainian economy.&quot; Waltz has previously said that the U.S. needs to &quot;recoup&quot; the costs of former military aid packages to Ukraine. The U.S. is looking to obtain 50% of Ukraine&apos;s rare earth minerals, NBC reported on Feb. 15. Washington has signaled openness to deploy American troops to guard these resources if there is a deal with Russia to end the war, unnamed American officials said. U.S. President Donald Trump said in early February that he wanted to strike a deal with Ukraine involving access to rare earth minerals in exchange for continued aid. Trump later claimed that Kyiv has &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal. Ukraine has signaled that it is open to developing a partnership in resource extraction with the U.S. and other partners in exchange for security guarantees.	https://kyivindependent.com/a-colonial-agreement-former-ukrainian-official-slams-us-minerals-deal-ap-reports/	2025-02-16T13:21:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-680305234.jpg
Trump wants ceasefire in Ukraine by Easter, Bloomberg reports	U.S. President Donald Trump wants to secure a ceasefire in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine by Easter, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 16, citing unnamed officials. Trump has previously promised to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours. Since his victory in the U.S. presidential election, that timeline has been revised. The U.S administration has told European officials that it hopes to achieve a ceasefire agreement by Easter, which falls on April 20, Bloomberg reported. Trump&apos;s plan for a quick resolution to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine is ambitious and &quot;potentially unrealistic,&quot; an unnamed source said. It is more likely Trump will be able to obtain a ceasefire in Ukraine by the end of the year and not by Easter, one person said. Over the past week, the U.S. has made several moves to advance its Russia-Ukraine agenda &#x2014;&#xA0;some of which have alarmed European and Ukrainian officials. Trump spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call on Feb. 12, holding a separate phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky later the same day. &quot;We have no doubt that the threat to Europe is Vladimir Putin&apos;s Russia, Trump&apos;s phone call to Putin was a mistake,&quot; Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, shocked European leaders on Feb. 15 when he said Europe won&apos;t be directly involved in peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. France plans to host an emergency summit on Feb. 17 for European leaders to discuss strategies toward Russia and Ukraine amid fears that the U.S. will shut the EU out of the negotiations process.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-looking-to-have-a-ceasefire-in-ukraine-by-easter-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-16T12:35:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198721894.jpg
Ukraine preparing for Zelensky to visit Saudi Arabia	Delegations from Saudi Arabia and Ukraine met on Feb. 16 to discuss increased investment and bilateral cooperation between the two nations, ahead of a planned visit by President Volodymyr Zelensky. The news comes as senior U.S. officials prepare to travel to Saudia Arabia for talks with unspecified Russian representatives. Ukraine will reportedly not be taking part in these discussions. The Ukrainian delegation is preparing with local officials for Zelensky&apos;s visit to Saudia Arabia, during which he will sign economic agreements with various countries in the region, First Deputy Prime Minister and Economic Minister Yulia Svyrydenko announced on Feb. 16. &quot;I am convinced that we have prospects for even more active involvement in investment from Middle Eastern countries,&quot; she said. &quot;Today, we saw significant interest, mainly in infrastructure projects, energy projects, innovation proposals, (and) agribusiness, primarily fertilizer production where Saudi Arabia has expertise.&quot; Days before Svyrydenko&apos;s announcement, Zelensky told reporters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference that he intends to pay official visits to Saudia Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey, but has no plans to meet with any Russian or U.S. delegations in these countries. &quot;I will not meet with Russians, but then I will not meet with Americans there,&quot; he said. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff are expected to hold meetings with Russian officials in the coming days. The representatives from the Russian delegation have not been identified. Rubio characterized the talks as preliminary and said that &quot;real negotiations&quot; on ending the war will include Ukraine and Europe. U.S. President Donald Trump recently said he is planning to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia as part of his efforts to broker a ceasefire deal between Kyiv and Moscow. Ukrainian officials denied reports that a Ukrainian delegation would participate in the talks between U.S. and Russian officials in Riyadh. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky, said that there was &quot;nothing on the negotiating table that would be worth discussing.&quot; &quot;Russia is not ready for negotiations,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-delegation-in-saudi-arabia-discuss-bilateral-trade-and-investment/	2025-02-16T12:12:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/SverydenkoSArabia.jpg
One year following Navalny's death, West, Navalnaya condemn Putin's Russia	Yuliya Navalnaya, widow of late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, and Western leaders decried repression in Russia on Feb. 16, the anniversary of Navalny&apos;s death. Navalny, an outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was arrested on politically motivated charges in January 2021. He was convicted and later died in an Arctic penal colony in February 2024. Western countries, including Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, issued a joint statement on the anniversary of Navalny&apos;s death. &quot;We reiterate that the ultimate responsibility for his death lies with the Russian authorities. One year on, Russia&apos;s dire human rights record continues to deteriorate ... All to serve its own interests,&quot; the statement read. The statement condemned Russia for holding over 800 political prisoners who are tortured and forced into psychiatric detention. &quot;The Kremlin crushes peaceful dissent, maintains a climate of fear, and undermines the rule of law,&quot; it said. The countries also claimed that Russia uses the threat of imprisonment to quash opposition to the full-scale war against Ukraine. &quot;Many (are) imprisoned for speaking out against the Kremlin&apos;s illegal invasion of Ukraine and the brutality shown towards the Ukrainian people,&quot; the statement said. The anniversary of Navalny&apos;s death falls during the Munich Security Conference, where European and U.S. officials convened to discuss the status of the war as it approaches its third year. EU High Representative Kaja Kallas issued her own statement regarding Navalny on Feb. 16. &quot;Navalny gave his life for a free and democratic Russia. Today, his lawyers are unjustly imprisoned along with hundreds of political prisoners,&quot; she said. &quot;Russia is increasingly waging an illegal war of aggression against Ukraine while continuing its domestic repression, persecuting those who advocate for democracy ... The EU calls on Russia to stop its brutal repression of civil society, media, and opposition figures.&quot; Navalny&apos;s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, also posted a video commemorating her late husband one year after his death. &quot;To whom he opened their eyes to the truth of Putin&apos;s regime, it is important to continue supporting (Navalny),&quot; she said. Since her husband&apos;s death, Navalnaya has emerged as a key Russian opposition figure. She spoke at the Munich Security Conference at a panel alongside Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, warning against attempts to negotiate with Putin. &quot;Even if you decided to negotiate with Putin, just remember he will lie,&quot; she said on Feb. 14. A vocal opponent of Putin, Navalnaya has expressed ambivalence toward arming Ukraine in its defense against Russia&apos;s invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/one-year-following-navalnys-death-the-west-navalnaya-condemn-putins-russia/	2025-02-16T11:12:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2008366667.jpg
Ukraine war latest: US wants 50% of Ukraine's minerals, may deploy troops to guard them; Zelensky says nearly 250,000 Russian soldiers killed in war	Key developments on Feb. 15-16: The U.S. seeks to obtain 50% of Ukraine&apos;s rare minerals and has signaled openness to deploy American troops to guard them if there is a deal with Russia to end the war, NBC reported on Feb. 15, citing unnamed American officials. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered a draft of the agreement to President Volodymyr Zelensky during a visit to Kyiv on Feb. 12. Zelensky refused to sign the agreement after Bessent&apos;s presentation, saying he needed to study it and consult with others, NBC reported, citing eight U.S. officials briefed on the meeting. At the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky said on Feb. 14 that his lawyers would examine the document handed over by Bessent in Kyiv and make some changes to it. He called the U.S. proposal &quot;a memorandum,&quot; not a security agreement. Following up on his earlier proposition of ensuring U.S. support for Ukraine in exchange for rare earth minerals, Trump claimed that Kyiv has &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a deal on a $500 billion resource deal. Ukraine has already signaled it is open to developing a partnership in resource extraction with the U.S. and other partners in exchange for security guarantees, but details on such a deal remain murky. The Russian army has lost almost 250,000 soldiers in the war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 15 during his speech at the Munich Security Conference. Zelensky claimed that Moscow lost nearly 20,000 soldiers in the battles for Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast alone. In addition, a total of over 610,000 Russian troops have been wounded since Feb. 24, 2022, according to the president. Zelensky&apos;s estimate of Russian losses matches that of the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. According to the military, Russia has lost 856,660 troops in Ukraine since 2022. &quot;We completely destroyed the North Korean units that (Vladimir) Putin had to bring in because his own forces weren&#x2019;t enough to hold back our counteroffensive,&quot; Zelensky said, speaking of Ukraine&apos;s Kursk operation. &quot;For over six months now, Ukrainians have been holding a foothold inside Russian territory, even though it was Russia that wanted to create a &apos;buffer zone&apos; inside our land,&quot; he added. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in early August 2024. Zelensky previously said that North Korean troops fighting for Russia against Ukraine have suffered 4,000 casualties, two-thirds of whom have been killed. Russia has to pull back its troops to at least the front line as it was before the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 15 in an interview with Newsmax. Zelensky&apos;s comments come after earlier in the week, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that Ukraine was unlikely to restore its pre-2014 borders in any negotiations with Moscow on ending its war. Experts and officials in Ukraine and Europe have criticized Hegseth&apos;s comments for undermining Ukraine&apos;s leverage before peace talks with Russia have even started. Zelensky told Newsmax that U.S. President Donald Trump could end Russia&apos;s war if Europe supports his plan. &quot;I think that he (Trump) needs, very much, the success, and, otherwise, everybody will say that (this) was the line of Biden and this is the line of Trump. I think he needs success, and we need success and trust him. I hope that he will be on our side,&quot; Zelensky added. The president stressed that a peace deal &quot;can only be about a plan to end the war,&quot; which should be agreed upon between Ukraine and the U.S. president and backed by both sides. Zelensky said he was ready to meet with the Russian president only after a joint plan with Trump and the European Union was developed. A group of European countries is quietly developing a plan to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine due to concerns about changing U.S. priorities on security on the continent, The Associated Press reported on Feb. 14. The news came amid ongoing discussions among Western countries about the possible deployment of peacekeeping forces if a ceasefire agreement is reached between Ukraine and Russia. The U.S. has repeatedly said it wouldn&apos;t send its troops to Ukraine, pushing for Europe to take initiative. France and Britain are leading the initiative of putting &quot;boots on the ground&quot; in Ukraine, according to the Associated Press. Estonia&apos;s Defense Minister Hanno Pevklur told the Associated Press that European allies are &quot;in a very early stage&quot; of developing the plan to deploy peacekeeping troops to Ukraine. Pevklur said that it is &quot;critical&quot; for the allies to understand the contact line in Ukraine before devising a plan. According to Pevklur, if the Russian and Ukrainian armies reduce their forces to a &quot;couple of thousand&quot; on each side, it will not be a problem for Europe &quot;to also be there.&quot; But implementing the plan will be much harder if there is a &quot;boiling conflict.&quot; Earlier reports from The Wall Street Journal indicated that U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s team is weighing a plan to delay Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for continued Western arms supplies and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on Jan. 18 that Germany may consider contributingforces to such a mission, while U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed on Jan. 16 that he had discussed the matter with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Moscow has strongly opposed the idea. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova warned on Jan. 23 that deploying a NATO peacekeeping contingent to Ukraine could lead to &quot;uncontrolled escalation.&quot; Russian drone strikes in the early hours of Feb. 16 shook southern Ukraine, leaving over 100,000 residents in Mykolaiv Oblast without heat, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. &quot;This bears no relationship to military action and the situation on the front. This once again proves that Russians are fighting against our people, against life in Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky wrote of the strikes on his Telegram channel. Mykolaiv Oblast Governor Vitaliy Kim wrote earlier in the day that the attack on the region included nine Shahed drones, with blasts and wreckage from the drones damaging five high-rise buildings and injuring one 64-year-old man. &quot;This was done deliberately to leave people without heat in below-zero temperatures and create a humanitarian catastrophe,&quot; wrote Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, who said that as of shortly before 1 p.m. Kyiv time, 46,000 people were still without heat. Radio Free Europe published video from parts of Mykolaiv affected, showing shopping centers with their walls demolished and stores with windows blown out. Ukraine had recently seen some reprieve from Russia&apos;s continuous attacks on civilian energy infrastructure thanks to an unusually warm winter. Temperatures overnight are forecast to drop to -9&#xB0; Celcius in Mykolaiv. The same night, Russia launched a total of 143 drones, of which Ukraine&apos;s air force said it shot down 95. Forty others and two Russian ballistic missiles also missed their targets, per the official tally. Several elderly civilians in Kherson and Kharkiv Oblasts were also injured in the broader Russian air campaign last night, according to local officials.

Ukraine, Europe must be involved in peace talks, Rubio says	Both Ukraine and Europe must play a role in serious negotiations with the U.S. and Russia to end the war, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS News on Feb. 16. Rubio&apos;s comments come as he prepares to travel to Saudi Arabia to meet with senior Russian officials for talks without representation from Ukraine or the EU. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s recent phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin was a good step, but has to be followed up by action, Rubio told CBS News. &quot;Now, obviously it has to be followed up by action, so the next few weeks and days will determine whether it&apos;s serious or not. Ultimately, one phone call does not make peace,&quot; he said. Rubio declined to say who the U.S. delegation will be meeting with in Saudia Arabia. &quot;Nothing&apos;s been finalized yet,&quot; he said. U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff are set to join Rubio for the talks in Riyadh, according to various media outlets. Ukraine will not be participating, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said. The talks in Saudia Arabia are preliminary, Rubio said, and &quot;real negotiations&quot; will include Ukraine and Europe. &quot;Ultimately, it will reach a point when you are &#x2014; if it&apos;s real negotiations, and we&apos;re not there yet, but if that were to happen, Ukraine will have to be involved, because they&apos;re the one that were invaded, and the Europeans will have to be involved because they have sanctions on Putin and Russia as well, and they&apos;ve contributed to this effort,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re just not there yet. We really aren&apos;t, but hopefully we will be, because we&apos;d all like to see this war end.&quot; Trump has repeatedly pledged to negotiate a swift deal to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, though his proposed timeline of within &quot;24 hours&quot; has been extended to an indefinite period. European leaders have expressed alarm in recent days at their apparent exclusion from discussions between Russia and the U.S. regarding Ukraine. France plans to host an emergency summit on Feb. 17 over these concerns. President Volodymyr Zelensky has emphasized that both the EU and the U.S. must have a strong presence at the negotiating table once Russia and Ukraine begin peace talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-europe-must-be-involved-in-peace-talks-rubio-says/	2025-02-16T09:42:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194469087.jpg
Arrests of top commanders in Ukraine underscore political power games, army commanders and experts say	Last month, four top-level military commanders in Ukraine were arrested for alleged mismanagement of battlefield operations &#x2014; in the first criminal investigations of top military leadership since the start of the full-scale invasion. Three high-ranking officers involved in what&#x2019;s being called &#x201C;the generals&#x2019; case&#x201D; &#x2014; Yurii Halushkin, Artur Horbenko, and Illia Lapin &#x2014; are accused of failing to defend Kharkiv Oblast during Russia&#x2019;s renewed offensive in the area in May 2024. Russian troops managed to get several kilometers beyond the border before Ukrainian troops halted the advance. In a separate case, Colonel Dmytro Riumshyn stands accused of failing to report and prevent desertions in his newly formed 155th Brigade, ultimately leading to 56 soldiers deserting while training in France, and hundreds more &#x2014; in Ukraine. While some Ukrainians welcomed the news, some experts and army commanders see it as a heavy-handed attempt to suppress potential military opposition to peace negotiations and damage the popularity of military leadership before possible elections that could be held if the war comes to an end this year. &#x201C;These investigations mean that the government is afraid of the military as a political force,&#x201D; Ukrainian political scientist Yevhen Mahda told the Kyiv Independent. They also warn of the harm prosecuting high-level commanders can bring to the military during wartime. Ukrainian law on &#x201C;combat immunity&#x201D; passed in 2022 promised commanders freedom to make decisions on the front without legal consequences for their failure. But the arrest of the four top officers shows vestiges of a broken military justice system. On May 10, 2024, Russian forces crossed the Russian border into Kharkiv Oblast, located in Ukraine&#x2019;s northeast, swiftly occupying some border villages. The attack came forty days after Brigadier General Yurii Halushkin was appointed the commander of the Kharkiv Operational Tactical Grouping, responsible for defending the area. On the second day of the offensive, Halushkin was replaced in his position by Major General Mykhailo Drapatyi. With reinforcements sent in, Ukrainian forces stopped Russia&apos;s advance. Some border areas remain occupied to this day, and the fighting continues up to 8 kilometers into Ukrainian territory. The initial success of the Russian offensive sparked outrage against regional and military leaders for poor defense planning that led to both military losses and thousands of civilians displaced from their homes. The newly occupied territories were already liberated once from occupation in Ukraine&#x2019;s 2022 counteroffensive in the area. The State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) launched an investigation into the circumstances around the border&#x2019;s breach in May. The agency detained Halushkin on Jan. 20 along with two other officers commanding troops in Kharkiv Oblast during the offensive. &#x201C;Their negligent attitude to military service allowed the Russian Federation troops to seize part of the territory (of Kharkiv region),&#x201D; the SBI&#x2019;s statement said. &#x201C;Also, the actions of the commanders led to the loss of personnel and weapons, and disrupted the defense of the state border in their area of responsibility.&#x201D; A picture of the commander of the 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Brigade being detained released by the State Bureau of Investigation on Jan. 20Halushkin was accused of assigning inadequate defense positions to the 125th Territorial Defense Brigade led by Lieutenant General Artur Horbenko, and failing to reinforce and support them with artillery and air force. The inadequate command allegedly led to some units of the 125th brigade deserting their positions, which allowed Russians to advance, according to the SBI. Horbenko was also accused of failing to properly prepare positions and equip his troops, as well as organize fire support and communication during the fight. &#x201C;(Horbenko) was unaware of the actual situation on the battlefield,&#x201D; the SBI said. Colonel Illia Lapin, a commander of the 415th Rifle Battalion of the 23rd Brigade tasked to defend the area, was accused of inadequate battle management and preparation of defense positions, as well as allowing twelve servicemen to desert positions. The SBI claimed it received assistance from the Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces Command in arresting the suspects. &#xA0; But Halushkin&#x2019;s lawyer Velychko told the Kyiv Independent that the military police found no violation of the military charter in his client&#x2019;s actions in Kharkiv Oblast during an earlier internal investigation. Halushkin appealed to the General Staff for reinforcements before the renewed Russian offensive, but &#x201C;the answer was &#x2013; you can only rely on what you have,&#x201D; Velychko said. &#x201C;He believes that he had properly used all the forces and means he had (for repelling the attack),&#x201D; Velychko added. Halushkin said in a statement published by his lawyer that he will continue defending his command decisions in detention. &#x201C;If the General Staff of Ukraine does not have enough brigades and weapons to comply with the standards (of the military charter), it is not the fault of the commanders,&#x201D; Halushkin wrote. Although President Volodymyr Zelensky said in July that the talks on who&#x2019;s to blame for Russian success in partially occupying Kharkiv Oblast should be held after the war, he praised the arrests of top commanders on Jan. 20, saying that &#x201C;no status or past achievements can override the rule of law.&#x201D; The court set multi-million-hryvnia bails for the officers. An anonymous donor settled the Hr 5 million (around $118,000) bail for Halushkin on the morning of Jan. 22, while former President Petro Poroshenko publicly offered to do the same on Facebook &#x2014; in a post he has since deleted. Hours later, Halushkin was arrested once again without bail just as he was leaving the detention center, drawing both criticism and praise among some military personnel and politicians. &#x201C;(The investigators) launched a new criminal case against him three hours before his repeated detention,&#x201D; Velychko told the Kyiv Independent, adding that the new case was registered less than an hour after Poroshenko&#x2019;s post. The SBI claimed it had discovered &#x201C;new facts&#x201D; in the investigation and launched a new case under a different article, but Velychko maintains that investigators &#x201C;simply copied seven volumes of materials from the first criminal case.&#x201D; The harsh measures are a &#x201C;short-sighted and dangerous&#x201D; tactic, used by the political leadership before the potential upcoming struggle for power to &#x201C;tame&#x201D; the military, as it remains the most trusted institution in society according to polls, political scientist Mahda said. If society accepts these criminal cases against commanders, the country&#x2019;s political leadership &#x201C;can swing for the fences, for example, (to prosecute former Commander-in-Chief) Zaluzhny,&#x201D; he added, referring to Zaluzhny&#x2019;s continued high popularity among Ukrainians.

(Ian Forsyth/Getty Images)The same polls show a significant decrease in trust in the president and the government. Ukrainian authorities might be using &#x201C;the generals&#x2019; cases&#x201D; to shift the blame. Riumshyn, former commander of the 155th mechanized brigade &#x201C;Anna Kyivska,&#x201D; was also arrested on Jan. 20. The systematic problems in the &#x201C;French-trained brigade&#x201D; were reported by Ukrainian and foreign media, embarrassing the Ukrainian leadership, which lauded the 155th brigade as a flagship project for new NATO-trained and armed Ukrainian brigades. Ukrainian journalist Yurii Butusov, whose extensive report on the failings in the brigade was cited in foreign media, blamed President Zelensky, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi and other members of the high military command for the many problems beyond Riumshyn&#x2019;s responsibilities as brigade commander. &#x201C;There was a lot of publicity in this situation. Someone has to be the fall guy now,&#x201D; Riumshyn told journalists in court, explaining why he was arrested. Despite the publicity of both cases, pre-trial criminal proceedings were closed to the public, and the case materials of Halushkin&#x2019;s case remain undisclosed, considered as military secrets, even to his defense, Velychko said. High military commanders and regular soldiers have since said that the arrests are gravely detrimental to the war effort, as they undermine commanders&#x2019; motivation, trust in the higher command, and willingness to act quickly on the battlefield. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a 100% political case,&#x201D; Anatolii Kozel, former commander of the 53rd brigade, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;This does not benefit (the army).&#x201D; Lieutenant General Serhii Naiev, former commander of the Joint Defense Forces, criticized the arrests in his interview with a major Ukrainian media Ukrainska Pravda on Feb. 10. &#x201C;It is unacceptable that trials of military leaders are launched during the war,&#x201D; he said, adding that even Russia doesn&#x2019;t prosecute generals for their failures. He also put the responsibility on political leadership for Ukraine&#x2019;s stalled preparation for the Russian invasion in 2022, which led to the occupation of the southern part of the country, deaths of civilians, and significant military losses. The next day after the publication, Ukrainian media reported that Naiev was appointed as a front-line commander of a small tactical group in Ukraine&#x2019;s east &#x2014; a move seen as retaliation for his interview. A new comprehensive military justice system wasn&#x2019;t developed in Ukraine after the country gained independence, with the system inherited from the Soviet Union largely dismantled before 2014. And then Russia invaded in the east and annexed Crimea in 2014. The rising need for a new, reformed system was most visible in the case of Major General Viktor Nazarov. In 2017, a civilian court gave him a prison sentence for failing to prevent the downing of a transport aircraft with 49 Ukrainian servicemen by Russian mercenaries in the eastern Luhansk Oblast in 2014. The sentence was welcomed by the families of fallen soldiers and criticized by then-President Petro Poroshenko for placing the blame on Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership for the incident. In 2021, however, Nazarov was acquitted by the Supreme Court, arguing that he would have had no way of preventing the attack. The seven years of controversial proceedings laid bare the lack of a clear framework for tackling these types of cases. The most recent cases last month are also not the first criminal proceedings with political undertones since the start of President Zelensky&#x2019;s presidency. The aftermath of a Russian attack against Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast on May 11, 2024 amid Russia&apos;s renewed offensive in the area. (State Emergency Service/Telegram)&#x201C;My case and the case involving (Galushkin, Horbenko, and Lapin) are not parallels. This is one methodology,&#x201D; Major General Dmytro Marchenko told Ukrainska Pravda in a recent interview on his being a primary subject of the so-called &#x201C;armored vests case&#x201D; in 2019. Serving as a top Defense Ministry official responsible for material supply of the army since 2015, he was arrested in 2019, when the State Bureau of Investigation accused him and several other officials of procuring thousands of low-quality armored vests at inflated prices. Marchenko was held in a civilian detention center for a month &#x2014; a decision called &#x201C;surprising&#x201D; by the Defense Ministry &#x2014; and released on a Hr 20 million ($480,000) bail, paid mostly by former President Poroshenko&#x2019;s family and regular people&#x2019;s donations. Marchenko claimed that his case was politically motivated, aimed at damaging then-President Poroshenko. In 2020, a Kyiv court suspended the prosecutor and investigator on the case due to their &#x201C;biased attitude.&#x201D; The investigation of the &#x201C;armored vests case&#x201D; essentially froze armored vests procurement in Ukraine until weeks before the full-scale Russian invasion. After it began, all the disputed vests were distributed to Ukrainian soldiers, though the case remained open, Ukrainska Pravda reported, citing Marchenko. Marchenko commanded the defense of the southern city of Mykolayiv in 2022, helping to successfully stop the Russian advance. On Nov. 8, 2024, he resigned from the military due to health problems. &#x201C;Such cases demoralize the military entirely, and cause uncertainty among all levels of command &#x2014; from platoon leader to the section commander,&#x201D; Marchenko said in an interview, referring to the ongoing investigation against the Ukrainian officers.	https://kyivindependent.com/arrests-of-top-commanders-in-ukraine-underscore-political-power-games-army-commanders-and-experts-say/	2025-02-16T09:10:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192471550.jpg
Putin will wage war against NATO,' Zelensky tells NBC News	Intelligence reports indicate that there is a &quot;high risk&quot; Russia is preparing troops for a possible invasion of NATO member states, President Volodymyr Zelensky told NBC News in an interview published Feb. 16. Zelensky spoke to NBC on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, where he is leading a Ukrainian delegation in talks with European and U.S. leaders on the current state of the war as it approaches its third-year anniversary. Russia is training 150,000 troops in Belarus for a large-scale operation that could happen as early as this summer, Zelensky said. The preparations could signal a plan to invade a NATO country. &quot;There are risks that this can be Poland and Lithuania, because we believe that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will wage war against NATO,&quot; he said. Ukraine has &quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;documents&quot; regarding Russia&apos;s troop buildup in Belarus, but does not exactly know what Putin is planning to do, according to Zelensky. The president said Ukraine had shared these intelligence reports with allies. Russia is &quot;waiting for a weakening of NATO,&quot; Zelensky warned. He also said he believes Putin only wants a ceasefire in order to prepare greater numbers of troops for more ambitious future military actions. &quot;He is thinking not only about Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said. There is a &quot;high risk&quot; that Russia will set its sights on other countries, particularly those near Ukraine that are now NATO member states, he said. At the outset of the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky said that Russia was training large numbers of soldiers in Belarus for a major military escalation. In his comments to NBC, he said that the move echoed the military exercises Russia staged ahead of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Two days before the conference began, a declassified Danish intelligence report warned that Russia may find the opportunity to launch a large-scale war on Europe within five years, if Moscow &quot;perceives NATO as militarily weakened or politically divided.&quot; NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that such an attack would be &quot;devastating&quot; for Moscow. &quot;If Putin attacks NATO, the reaction will be devastating. He will lose,&quot; Rutte said. The warnings come amid a dramatic shift in U.S. foreign policy towards Europe, NATO, and Russia. U.S. President Donald Trump has been critical of the alliance, sparking outrage last year when he said he would let Russia to do &quot;whatever the hell they want&quot; to NATO members failing to meet defense spending criteria. Trump has also arranged to meet with Putin in Saudi Arabia for bilateral talks without representation from Ukraine or Europe. Ahead of any ceasefire negotiations with Russia, Trump has already signaled that he believes NATO membership for Ukraine is not &quot;practical.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-will-wage-war-against-nato-zelensky-tells-nbc-news/	2025-02-16T08:59:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199789864.jpg
Russian drone strikes hit power plant in Mykolaiv Oblast, leaving over 100,000 Ukrainians without heat	Russian air strikes in the early hours of Feb. 16 shook southern Ukraine, leaving over 100,000 residents in Mykolaiv Oblast without heat, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. &quot;This bears no relationship to military action and the situation on the front. This once again proves that Russians are fighting against our people, against life in Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky wrote of the strikes on his Telegram channel. Mykolaiv Oblast Governor Vitaliy Kim wrote earlier in the day that the attack on the region included nine Shahed drones, with blasts and wreckage from the drones damaging five high-rise buildings and injuring one 64-year-old man. &quot;This was done deliberately to leave people without heat in below-zero temperatures and create a humanitarian catastrophe,&quot; wrote Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, who said that as of shortly before 1 p.m. Kyiv time, 46,000 people were still without heat. Radio Free Europe published video from parts of Mykolaiv affected, showing shopping centers with their walls demolished and stores with windows blown out. Ukraine had recently seen some reprieve from Russia&apos;s continuous attacks on civilian energy infrastructure thanks to an unusually warm winter. Temperatures overnight are forecast to drop to -9&#xB0; Celcius in Mykolaiv. The same night, Russia launched a total of 143 drones, of which Ukraine&apos;s air force said it shot down 95. Forty others and two Russian ballistic missiles also missed their targets, per the official tally. Several elderly civilians in Kherson and Kharkiv Oblasts were also injured in the broader Russian air campaign last night, according to local officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-rock-mykolayiv-and-leave-5-injured-over-past-day/	2025-02-16T06:45:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1415735122.jpg

Europe needs 'special envoy' to take part in Ukraine peace talks, says Finnish President	The European Union needs a special envoy to Ukraine peace talks to avoid being cut out of negotiations, Finnish President Alexander Stubb said on Feb. 16 at the Munich Security Conference. Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, said the day previously that Europe would not be directly involved in peace talks. A new European special envoy, Stubb said, would help focus European efforts and give them a voice in such talks. &quot;If there is a negotiating table, I think we need to do something similar to what was done in Kosovo. Europe needs to have a special envoy,&quot; Stubb said. &quot;And then, a deputy envoy, who is on the level of Kellogg, (Steve) Witkoff, (Andriy) Yermak, or (Yuriy) Ushakov.&quot; Earlier, Politico reported that U.S. officials were heading to Saudi Arabia to meet with Russian representatives for talks meant to lay the ground work for a potential summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kyiv was not invited and was even surprised by the announced meeting in Saudi Arabia, causing alarm that negotiations to end Russia&apos;s nearly three year invasion will happen without Ukraine&apos;s involvement. Croation Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic voiced a similar sentiment as Stubb, saying that Europe needs a strong representative in negotiations, Reuters reported. &quot;What we lacked on Ukraine in recent years was one personality highly respected by everyone, taken into account in Moscow, taken into account in Kyiv, and having support in Washington and European capitals and other leaders, including the global South, that could have the authority to manage the peace talks,&quot; said Plenkovic.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-needs-to-have-a-special-envoy-to-take-part-in-ukraine-peace-talks-says-finnish-president/	2025-02-16T05:19:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1512920640.jpeg
Zelensky's proposed European army 'will not happen,' says Polish foreign minister	There will be no joint European Union army to counter Russian aggression and compensate any withdrawal in U.S. support, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said to local television late on Feb. 15, Reuters reported. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 15 called on Europe to create a unified army at the Munich Security Conference to counter Russian aggression in Ukraine and Europe. &quot;Many leaders have talked about Europe needing its own army. An army of Europe. I really believe that the time has come. The armed forces of Europe must be created,&quot;Zelensky said during his speech. In response to a question about creating a unified European armed forces, Sikorski said that &quot;we should be careful with this term because people understand different things,&quot; Reuters reported. &quot;If you understand by it the unification of national armies, it will not happen,&quot; Sikorski told TVP World. &quot;But I have been an advocate for Europe, for the European Union, to develop its own defense capabilities.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s proposal came in light of waning U.S. military support for Ukraine and Europe writ large. Ukraine hopes to see Europe fill the looming gap in its fight against Russia. Sikorski acknowledged a need to expand European militaries. &quot;If the U.S. wants us to step up in defense, it should have a national component, a NATO component, but I also believe a European EU component, EU subsidies for the defense industry to build up our capacity to produce, but also an EU force worthy of its name,&quot; Sikorski said. Sikorski also said Poland would not put troops on the ground in Ukraine. &quot;Poland&apos;s duty to NATO is to protect the eastern flank, i.e. its own territory.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelenskys-proposed-army-of-europe-will-not-happen-says-polish-minister/	2025-02-16T03:45:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179726505.jpg

Success already 'feels possible' after start of collaboration with US officials, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 15 that success &#x201C;already feels possible&#x201D; as his administration begins collaborations with U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s team. Zelensky noted that he had a good phone call with Trump before the Munich Security Conference, and important meetings with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and State Secretary Marco Rubio. He emphasized that the world looks to the U.S. as a crucial force in stopping conflicts and ensuring lasting peace. Zelensky also said that the two countries are working together on creating a &#x201C;special agreement&#x201D; that will strengthen the U.S. and Ukraine, but did not provide further details. &#x201C;We have started working with President Trump&apos;s team and we already feel that success is possible. It is the U.S. that the world now looks to as a force that can not only stop the war, but also help ensure the reliability of peace after the war,&#x201D; Zelensky wrote on Telegram. However, he cautioned against potential attempts by Russian President Vladimir Putin to manipulate the situation and stressed the importance of joint efforts by Ukraine, the U.S., and Europe to achieve real peace. &#x201C;Of course, there will continue to be many different attempts by Putin to deceive everyone and prolong the war. But real peace is possible. And we have to achieve it: Ukraine, the United States, Europe,&#x201D; Zelensky said. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky told NBC News that it would be &quot;very, very, very difficult&quot; for Ukraine to sustain its fight against Russia and remain secure in the long term without American support. Zelensky stressed that while Ukraine would always fight for its survival, the chances of success would be significantly diminished without help from the United States.	https://kyivindependent.com/success-already-feels-possible-after-start-of-collaboration-with-us-officials-zelensky-says/	2025-02-15T22:15:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2173926361.jpg
G7 leaders: Future sanctions hinged on Russia's 'good faith efforts' during peace talks	The Group of Seven (G7) countries agreed to link any future tightening of sanctions against Russia to the progress of upcoming peace negotiations, after a meeting on Feb. 15. The G7 ministers convened at the Munich Security Conference, which is ongoing from Feb. 14 until Feb. 16. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha participated in some of the talks held by the ministers. The group emphasized in a statement that any new sanctions after February 2025 should depend on whether Russia &#x201C;makes real, good faith efforts to end its war against Ukraine.&#x201D; They also reaffirmed their &#x201C;unwavering support&#x201D; for Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, G7 countries have collectively supported Ukraine with military and financial aid. In October 2024, the G7 reached an agreement to provide Ukraine with approximately $50 billion in loans backed by the revenue from foreign Russian assets.	https://kyivindependent.com/g7-leaders-future-sanctions-hinged-on-russias-good-faith-efforts-during-peace-talks/	2025-02-15T19:53:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1256044350.jpg
France to host emergency summit on Ukraine as Trump administration and Russian officials to begin peace negotiations without Europe	European leaders are set to gather in Paris on Feb. 17 for an emergency summit over concerns that the U.S. is advancing peace talks with Russia without Europe, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski announced on Feb. 15. This comes amid recent talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as a speech on Feb. 14 by U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance at the Munich Security Conference, in which he attacked current European politics and values. Additionally, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, said on Feb. 15 that Europe will not be directly involved in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, but its interests will be considered. Sikorski mentioned the upcoming meeting between European leaders during the Munich Security Conference, and expressed hope that leaders would take the matter seriously. It is unclear which leaders will be present, but British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk have so far confirmed their attendance.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-to-host-emergency-summit-on-ukraine-as-trump-administration-begins-peace-negotiations-with-russia-without-input-from-europe/	2025-02-15T17:58:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1241470695.jpg
US requests European countries to draft proposals outlining post-war security assurances for Ukraine, FT reports	The U.S. has asked European countries to outline their potential security and peacekeeping contributions to Ukraine as part of any future peace negotiations with Russia, the Financial Times reported on Feb. 15, citing undisclosed sources. The countries have been asked to indicate proposed amounts of military aid and peacekeeping forces, as well as other defense measures. According to the sources, the U.S. State Department sent a formal request to European governments this week. The request seeks explicit details on types of military equipment and troop brigade number commitments from the countries. This initiative comes ahead of a European tour by Keith Kellogg, President Trump&apos;s envoy for Ukraine and Russia, who is set to visit Brussels next week. According to Kellogg&#x2019;s comments on Feb. 15, Europe will not be &#x201C;directly involved in negotiations&#x201D; to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, but its interests will be considered.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-requesting-european-countries-to-draft-proposals-outlining-post-war-security-assurances-for-ukraine-ft-reports/	2025-02-15T16:16:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-643099758.jpg
Trump's call to Putin was a mistake, Polish FM says	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s phone call to Russian President Vladimir Putin was a mistake, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15. Trump spoke to Putin in a phone call on Feb. 12, holding a separate phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky the same day. The U.S. President has vowed to end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The phone call between Trump and Putin was only beneficial to the Kremlin. &quot;We have no doubt that the threat to Europe is Vladimir Putin&apos;s Russia, Trump&apos;s phone call to Putin was a mistake,&quot; Sikorski said, according to Polish media outlet RMF24. &quot;There is nothing more dangerous than an empty guarantee,&quot; The Foreign Minister said, adding that &quot;Ukraine already has (security) guarantees that turned out to be empty.&quot; Sikorski called for the West to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia&apos;s aggression as long as it wants to fight back. Russia is waging a &quot;classic colonial war&quot; against Ukraine, the official added. Europe is facing a crisis because it &quot;has used the peace dividend for too long,&quot; The Foreign Minister said. &quot;If Putin succeeds in conquering Ukraine, it will send a signal to China&#x2026; This will have direct consequences for the American strategy and alliance system, and perhaps for the future of Taiwan,&quot; Sikorski said. The Munich Security Conference is ongoing from Feb. 14-16, with numerous Western officials and leaders present, including Zelensky.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-call-to-putin-was-a-mistake-polish-fm-says/	2025-02-15T14:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2172451145.jpg
Official denies Ukraine will participate in Russia-US meeting in Saudi Arabia	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky, denied on Feb. 15 that Ukraine will participate in an upcoming meeting between Russia and the United States in Saudi Arabia. &quot;There is nothing on the negotiating table that would be worth discussing,&quot; Podolyak said on Ukrainian TV, adding that &quot;Russia is not ready for negotiations.&quot; Podolyak comments come amid conflicting reports that Russian and Ukrainian representatives are set to join senior U.S. officials in Riyadh for peace talks. Politico reported on Feb. 15, citing a Republican lawmaker and two U.S. officials familiar with the meeting, that talks between the representatives of all three countries are set to begin in the coming days. The publication later updated the story to note that a Ukrainian official confirmed to Politico that the meeting&apos;s announcement came as a surprise to Kyiv and there are no plans to send a Ukrainian delegation. Bloomberg reported on Feb. 15 that the talks in Saudi Arabia will only include U.S. and Russian officials as a means to pave the way for a potential leaders&#x2019; summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin later this month. Following a phone call he held with Putin, Trump previously said he is ready to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia for peace talks. Podolyak&apos;s comments seemingly echo statements made earlier in the day by Zelensky at the Munich Security Conference. &quot;We didn&apos;t talk about it. The media printed something. I saw that someone said that there would be a meeting in Saudi Arabia. I do not know what it is,&quot; Zelensky said. During his comments on Ukrainian TV, Podolyak said that Russia is set to use their presence at the negotiating table to secure an &quot;operational pause to reconfigure its army&quot; as well as gain leverage over the situation while attempting to ease sanctions on the country. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the details of the upcoming meetings in Riyadh amid the conflicting reports.	https://kyivindependent.com/official-denies-ukraine-will-participate-in-russia-us-meeting-in-saudi-arabia-amid-conflicting-reports/	2025-02-15T14:15:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2068280045.jpg
Senior US diplomat visits Belarus, three political prisoners released, NYT reports	U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Christopher W. Smith visited Belarus alongside two other U.S. officials in an unannounced meeting on Feb. 12, the New York Times reported, potentially ending Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko&apos;s isolation from the West. Belarus has been cut off from the West following Lukashenko&apos;s crackdown on the 2020 mass protests in response to what the West denounced as fraudulent election results. Since then, Belarusian authorities have increasingly suppressed political freedoms and have become complacent in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. The meeting comes as U.S. seeks to negotiate a deal with Belarusian authorities. In exchange for the release of an undefined number of political prisoners, the U.S. is willing to ease sanctions on Belarusian banks and potash, the New York Times (NYT) reported on Feb. 15, citing unnamed officials in contact with Smith on Feb. 13. Belarus is a major producer of potash, a key ingredient in fertilizer. Revealing the meeting, Smith said during a briefing on Feb. 13 that it was the goal of U.S. officials to secure freedom for more political prisoners. Alena Movshuk, a Belarusian activist, and Andrey Kuznechyk, a journalist for Radio Free Europe were released, Franak Viacorka, Senior Advisor to Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tikhanovskaya said. Smith drove to Belarus from Lithuania, following a phone call with Lukashenko. The small U.S. delegation visited a border town where three political prisoners were transferred, including one U.S. citizen, and two Belarusian citizens. The Belarusian leader assured Smith he was ready to decrease repression in Belarus, Smith said, adding that the U.S. wants Belarus to be less reliant on Russia. Lukashenko was handed a seventh consecutive term as President of Belarus on Jan. 26, in an election that has been internationally denounced as a sham. Minsk refused to invite a mission from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to observe the country&apos;s Jan. 26 presidential election.	https://kyivindependent.com/senior-us-diplomat-visits-belarus-political-prisoners-released/	2025-02-15T13:25:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/1238a.jpeg
As little as 1,000 Russian troops left in Transnistria, Zelensky says	Russia has greatly reduced its troop presence in Transnistria, leaving only 1,000-1,500 troops in the region, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15. Russian-controlled Transnistria has hosted Russian forces for decades following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Russian troops have guarded the region, stalling any attempts for reintegration with Moldova. &quot;There were 5,500 or 6,000 (Russian troops), now there are far less,&quot; Zelensky said, according to Kyiv Independent journalists attending the conference. &quot;We believe that there are about 2,500 troops left there today. To be honest, I believe there are (closer to) 1,000-1,500 Russians left.&quot; Russia &quot;withdrew several thousand&quot; troops, relocating from Transnistria to aid in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Zelensky said. The Russian troops left in Transnistria no longer guard the Russian-controlled region like they did before, Zelensky added. &quot;Today they are guarding warehouses with weapons,&quot; he said. &quot;They took some of them (Russian troops) and took them out. They took them out, most likely, by plane via Chisinau,&quot; Zelensky concluded. Amid Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, energy security in Russian-occupied Transnistria have remained in limbo, following the termination of Russian gas transit through Ukraine in January. The EU recently offered financial assistance to Tiraspol, which they rejected. Russian gas deliveries to Transnistria have long been considered crucial to Russia&apos;s control over the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/only-1500-russian-troops-left-in-transnistria-zelensky-says/	2025-02-15T12:49:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198893921.jpg
Trump team heading to Saudi Arabia for Ukraine-Russia peace talks, Politico reports	Senior U.S. officials are heading to Saudi Arabia for peace talks with Russian and Ukrainian representatives, Politico reported on Feb. 15, citing a Republican lawmaker and two U.S. officials familiar with the meeting. U.S. President Donald Trump has previously said he is ready to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia for peace talks. It was not immediately clear as to whether Trump will join his top officials in Riyadh. The two unnamed U.S. officials did not provide to Politico specific details about timelines for the start of negotiation. However, Mike McCaul, a Republican congressman confirmed to Politico that National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will joining State Secretary in Riyadh in the coming days. U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg will not be present. The official is currently at the top European security conference and is expected to visit Ukraine. Request for comment by Politico to Ukraine&apos;s government as well as the U.S. State Department went unanswered. Earlier in the day, President Volodymyr Zelensky and Western leaders attended the Munich Security Conference focused on Ukraine. During a meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14, Zelensky said that Ukraine was &quot;ready to move towards real and guaranteed peace as quickly as possible.&quot; &quot;We sincerely appreciate President Trump&apos;s determination to help stop the war and provide Ukraine with justice and security guarantees,&quot; Zelensky added. European officials will not be present at the upcoming peace talks in Saudi Arabia, U.S. officials said, echoing previous statements by Kellogg. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference earlier in the day, Kellogg said that Europe will not be directly involved in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, but its interests will be considered.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-team-heading-to-saudia-arabia-for-ukraine-peace-talks-politico-reports/	2025-02-15T12:09:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194442240.jpg
State Secretary Rubio holds phone call with Russia's Lavrov	U.S. State Secretary Marco Rubio held a phone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Feb. 15, just days after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin. &quot;Building on the Feb. 12 phone conversation between the presidents of Russia and the United States, the foreign ministers agreed to maintain a communication channel to address accumulated issues in Russian-American relations,&quot; a readout from the Russian Foreign Ministry read. &quot;This is aimed at removing the unilateral barriers inherited from the previous administration that hinder mutually beneficial trade, economic, and investment cooperation.&quot; The conversation between the two top diplomats comes just days after a Feb. 12 phone call in which Trump agreed Putin that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will start &quot;immediately.&quot; The conversation between Putin and Trump was poorly received in Kyiv, amid concern that Ukraine will be left out of peace negotiations. Zelensky took issue with Trump first holding a conversation with Putin before calling the Ukrainian president, expressing that the situation &quot;was not very pleasant.&quot; &quot;Both sides expressed a mutual willingness to engage on key international issues, including the situation in Ukraine,&quot; the readout from the Russian Foreign Ministry continued. &quot;Lavrov and Rubio reaffirmed their readiness to work together to restore a mutually respectful interstate dialogue in line with the tone set by the presidents. They agreed to maintain regular contact, including preparations for a Russian-American summit.&quot; Saudi Arabia will reportedly hold a summit between Trump and Putin in Riyadh, the Saudi Foreign Ministry said on Feb. 14, although the dates have not yet been finalized. No additional details on the phone conversation were provided. A readout from the State Department was not immediately available. During a speech at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15, amid uncertainty over further U.S. support against potential Russian aggression, Zelensky called on Europe to create its own armed forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/state-secretary-rubio-holds-phone-call-with-russias-lavrov/	2025-02-15T11:43:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194528244.jpg
You can't kill your way out of this war' — Kellogg calls for sanctions against Russia's shadow fleet, concessions from Ukraine to end war	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, attended a panel discussion during the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15 where he called for the the U.S. to implement additional sanctions on Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; while also calling for concessions from both countries to secure a peace deal. &quot;What is driving Russia? It&apos;s really a petrol state. 70% of the money they are getting to fund this war is coming from petrol, oil and gas. Most of that is going through the shadow fleet&quot; Kellogg said at the panel discussion attended by Kyiv Independent journalists. &quot;So what does (Russian President Vladimir Putin) have to give up? Well maybe he&apos;ll give up his oil revenue and we&apos;ll force him to do it, because what you do is start employing sanctions that break the economic back,&quot; Kellogg said. &quot;These are the things you can do.&quot; Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; refers to a group of oil tankers employed to help the Kremlin evade sanctions. Earlier in the discussion, Kellogg said that both Ukraine and Russia would have to make concessions to end the war. &quot;When you say concessions, of course they&apos;re concessions that both sides are going to have to give,&quot; Kellogg said, without specifying what concessions the countries would have to make. &quot;If you think you&apos;re going to kill your way out of this, you&apos;re wrong, because you have a lousy view of history,&quot; Kellogg continued, noting that Russia was &quot;willing to sacrifice&quot; large number of Russian soldiers on the battlefield, invoking memories of the 700,000 Russian soldiers lost in the Battle of Stalingrad during World War II. Kellogg&apos;s remarks come as the Trump administration is trying to bring Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table. Trump has repeatedly claimed that he aims to end the war as soon as possible but has not outlined specific steps to do so. During the panel, Kellogg added that a &quot;comprehensive plan&quot; developed alongside allies, was needed to stop the war &#x2014; without specifying the details of what that entails. Speaking at the top European security conference earlier in the day, Kellogg said that Europe will not be directly involved in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, but its interests will be considered. Kellogg mentioned the Minsk II deal of 2015, which aimed to end Russia&apos;s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and involved Germany and France alongside Ukraine and Russia. &quot;There were a lot of people at the table, but it didn&apos;t work out,&quot; Kellogg said. That&apos;s why Europe will not be involved in the negotiations, but its interests will be taken into account, he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/you-cant-kill-your-way-out-of-this-war-kellogg-calls-for-sanctions-against-russias-shadow-fleet-concessions-from-ukraine-to-end-the-war/	2025-02-15T10:51:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/gettyimages-2199838066-612x612.jpg
What's at stake for Poroshenko, ex-president sanctioned by Zelensky?	In an unprecedented move, President Volodymyr Zelensky imposed sanctions on his predecessor and key political rival, lawmaker Petro Poroshenko. Poroshenko, who was elected president in 2014, lost his reelection bid in 2019 to Zelensky in a bitter campaign that often included personal attacks. The rivalry between the two did not subside after the election. &quot;We are defending our state and restoring justice. Everyone who destroyed Ukraine&apos;s national security and helped Russia must be held accountable. The billions that were earned by actually selling Ukraine, Ukrainian interests, Ukrainian security must be blocked and must work to protect Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said in an evening address on Feb. 12, referring to Poroshenko, whose net worth was over $1 billion. The sanctions came as a number of Ukrainian politicians appeared to have begun election preparations following looming peace talks and a push from the U.S. Presidential candidates Volodymyr Zelensky and Petro Poroshenko during the debates at the Olimpyskiy Stadium in Kyiv, Ukraine, on April 19, 2019. (Celestino Arce/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Along with Poroshenko, four more tycoons faced sanctions: oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky, multimillionaire Kostiantyn Zhevago, former PrivatBank co-owner Hennadii Boholyubov, and Viktor Medvedchuk, a former pro-Russian lawmaker accused of high treason. Kolomoisky is now behind bars, while the others have fled Ukraine or ended up in Russia. None of them hold power in Ukraine at this time. All have been charged with a variety of crimes in the past, ranging from money laundering to high treason. The sanctions froze all assets held by the targeted individuals in Ukraine and blocked them from conducting financial transactions, among other restrictions. The decree states that the measures are indefinite. Poroshenko called the sanctions against him &quot;politically motivated&quot; and &quot;unconstitutional.&quot; The Kyiv Independent explains why Poroshenko was targeted now, what he is set to lose and what the ex-president&apos;s future might look like. Poroshenko said that, as of late January, around 130 criminal cases had been opened against him. Most of them were launched after appeals by people who were either convicted or fled to Russia, he said. That&apos;s not exactly true. Prior to the full-scale invasion, in December 2021, the former president was charged with high treason for what the prosecution said was aiding Russian-controlled militants in the occupied parts of Donetsk Oblast. He was accused of organizing the supplies of coal from Russian-occupied areas to Ukrainian companies in 2014-2015. The Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast was a heavily industrialized region and the source of the country&apos;s coal and other critical materials. If found guilty, Poroshenko could face 10 to 15 years in prison. Besides Poroshenko, the coal supplies case involves Medvedchuk, who allegedly negotiated with both Russia and its proxies, and Poroshenko administration on the coal supplies. Poroshenko has denied wrongdoing. After Moscow launched its full-scale invasion, the investigation of criminal cases against the ex-president was halted. Three years later, the suspended criminal case was one of the official reasons for imposing sanctions against Poroshenko. Former President Petro Poroshenko speaks to his supporters before a court hearing at the Pechersk District Court in Kyiv, Ukraine, on July 8, 2020. (STR/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Citing their sources in law enforcement, Ukrainian media outlets have given a variety of other reasons for Poroshenko to be punished by authorities. The reasons range from Poroshenko&apos;s political activities, like his involvement in the creation of the now-banned Party of Regions in 2000, as well as being a minister under Pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in the early 2010s. Another reason given was the fact that Poroshenko was slow in selling his business in Russia and the occupied parts of Ukraine following the start of Russia&apos;s war in 2014. The Roshen factory, a confectionery plant owned by Poroshenko, in Russia&apos;s Lipetsk halted operation in 2017 and was nationalized by Russia in 2024. &quot;These are events that happened in 2000, 2010, 2014. It&apos;s ridiculous to accuse Poroshenko of creating the Party of Regions in 2000,&quot; Professor Oleksiy Haran, research advisor at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;I don&apos;t want to present Poroshenko as an angel. But, unfortunately, it (sanctions) harms Ukraine&apos;s prestige abroad,&quot; he added. Zelensky also accused Poroshenko of circumventing billions from Ukraine and did not rule out that sanctions could be lifted after he &quot;returns the withdrawn funds&quot; to the budget. For years, Poroshenko was listed among the wealthiest people in Ukraine. He first became a billionaire in 2012, according to Forbes. Poroshenko and his son, Oleksiy Poroshenko, ranked third on the list in 2023 with a net worth of $954 million, according to NV media outlet. A year later, only Poroshenko&apos;s son remained in third place on the list of the richest, with a fortune estimated at $1.2 billion. Some of the former president&apos;s assets were frozen in January 2022 following treason charges. However, Poroshenko&apos;s largest businesses remained untouched. After losing the 2019 presidential election, he began transferring his assets to his son, Oleksiy. The key asset of the Poroshenko family is the Roshen confectionery, which saw a profit of Hr 5.64 billion ($135 million) in the first half of 2024 alone, according to NV. Oleksiy Poroshenko also now owns Ukrprominvest-Agro, one of Ukraine&apos;s leading agricultural companies.

(Joseph Sywenkyj/Bloomberg via Getty Images)According to YouControl, Petro Poroshenko remains the beneficiary of several companies, including the Kyiv-based International Investment Bank. It is unclear which of Poroshenko&apos;s assets can be affected by sanctions. Poroshenko also owned Channel 5 and Pryamyi TV channel until 2021. He sold them to his allies to avoid being labeled as an &quot;oligarch.&quot; The channels are still loyal to Poroshenko and harshly critical of Zelensky. Both channels have not been part of the Ukrainian TV marathon &#x2014; a pool of five TV broadcasters formed under the government&apos;s directive to share resources and cover the war. Channel 5 and the Pryamyi TV channel were also deprived of digital broadcasting, which some saw as a violation of freedom of speech. Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said that the sanctions against prominent businessmen are &quot;a reminder of the war against the oligarchs.&quot; In 2021, Zelensky&apos;s anti-oligarch laws created a register of individuals, establishing a legal definition of an oligarch. The process stalled due to the start of the all-out war and remained largely forgotten since. &quot;This is a warning to big business. That in a time of war, even inside the country, there will be tough methods for those who will launch any information or political campaigns against the government,&quot; Fesenko added. The legality of sanctions against Ukrainian citizens has always been questioned by observers. Yet, the majority of Ukrainians have backed the sanctions that were slapped on notorious figures and pro-Russian politicians. When asked, 31% of Ukrainians answered that they see sanctions against Poroshenko as an attempt to divert public attention from the difficult battlefield situation, a poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology showed. Another 24% think that it is an attempt to &quot;neutralize the opposition&quot; before potential elections and only 27% see them as an attempt &quot;to punish actual criminals.&quot; &quot;The main problem is that this (sanctions) will be perceived as a political tool,&quot; Fesenko said. &quot;It was necessary to use traditional legal mechanisms rather than sanctions. Investigation and court,&quot; he added. According to the Law on Sanctions, Ukraine can impose sanctions against foreigners and foreign entities, as well as Ukrainians who engage in terrorist activities. Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office reported on Feb. 14 that investigations into Poroshenko and the other four businessmen are ongoing. Former President Petro Poroshenko and MPs from his party blocked the parliament podium in protest against President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s sanctions against his predecessor in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 14, 2025. (Ruslan Stefanchuk/Facebook)&#xA0;In response to criticism from European partners, Ruslan Stefanchuk, speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, said that sanctions against Poroshenko are &quot;in no way a substitute&quot; for the criminal cases against him. &quot;These are not political issues but legal ones. The final decisions should be made exclusively by the court, as is customary in countries with stable democracies,&quot; Stefanchuk said. According to Fesenko, sanctions could prevent Poroshenko from actively participating in political and information campaigns. At the same time, experts don&apos;t see Poroshenko as a competitor for Zelensky, given the results of multiple polls. Sanctions against him may consolidate Poroshenko&apos;s backers and harm Zelensky&apos;s popularity, but are unlikely to change this tendency, experts say. &quot;The war with Russia is not over yet, and we are starting internal political wars,&quot; Fesenko said. &quot;Unfortunately, Zelensky&apos;s opponents are also waging an open war against him. It is mostly informational, a little bit political. But a war is a war.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/whats-at-stake-for-poroshenko-ex-president-sanctioned-by-zelensky/	2025-02-15T08:56:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1414978534.jpg
Making sense of Trump’s plan – if there is one – to end Russia’s war in Ukraine	After pledging for months to swiftly end Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump has started to take first steps toward peace negotiations this week. After holding a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Feb. 12, Trump declared that Ukraine peace talks were to start &#x201C;immediately.&#x201D; Kyiv was informed soon after. What followed was a stream of often contradictory statements from Trump&#x2019;s team about Ukraine, Russia, and the peace deal procedure, creating an impression that the new U.S. administration rushed to start peace talks without a clear plan &#x2013; if there is one. The Kyiv Independent has compiled key facts and statements to help make sense of Trump&#x2019;s priorities and vision for the negotiations that can decide Ukraine&#x2019;s future. Trump appears confident that Putin is ready for serious talks. The first known Trump-Putin call since Trump returned to office lasted 1.5 hours on Feb. 12, according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Trump applauded the conversation as &#x201C;lengthy and highly productive,&#x201D; saying that both sides agreed to &quot;work together, very closely, including visiting each other&apos;s Nations.&#x201D; &#x201C;I think President Putin wants peace, and President Zelensky wants peace, and I want peace,&#x201D; Trump claimed while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Feb. 13. The comment angered Ukrainians and Ukraine supporters as Trump ignored the fact that this war of aggression was unleashed by Russia. Trump said that he would meet Putin in Saudi Arabia, but has not disclosed a date yet. When asked by reporters whether Putin could be trusted to hold an agreement on Feb. 14, Hegseth said, &quot;You don&apos;t have to trust somebody in order to negotiate with them.&quot; U.S. Vice President JD Vance speaks during the 61st Munich Security Conference on February 14, 2025 in Munich, Germany. (Johannes Simon/Getty Images)Trump&#x2019;s stance on UkraineTrump called Putin first on Feb. 12 before he informed Zelensky over the phone that peace talks were to begin, fueling concerns that Trump has no interest in consulting with Kyiv before making key decisions. Zelensky admitted to journalists that &#x201C;it is not very pleasant&quot; that Trump called Putin first. When asked by reporters about whether Ukraine should be an &#x201C;equal member&#x201D; of the peace talks, Trump didn&#x2019;t answer directly. &quot;It&apos;s an interesting question. I think they have to make peace. Their people are being killed,&#x201D; Trump said. Shortly afterward, Trump reassured that Kyiv would be included in peace talks with Moscow to end the war in Ukraine. &quot;They&apos;re part of it. We would have Ukraine, and we have Russia, and we&apos;ll have other people involved, a lot of people,&#x201D; Trump told reporters in the Oval Room on Feb. 13. Zelensky said it was important that he met Trump first before Putin. So far, Kyiv has not confirmed a planned meeting with the American president yet. Trump doesn&#x2019;t appear interested in pumping much-needed military aid and humanitarian support just to help Ukraine. Trump has stressed that the U.S. should also get something in return. In the same Fox News interview where he suggested that Ukraine &#x201C;may be Russian someday,&#x201D; Trump said he asked Kyiv for &#x201C;the equivalent of like $500 billion worth of rare earth (minerals), and they&#x2019;ve essentially agreed to do that.&#x201D; &#x201C;Otherwise, we&apos;re stupid,&#x201D; Trump suggested. &#x201C;We have to get something. We can&#x2019;t continue to pay this money.&#x201D; Zelensky said that the U.S. deal on minerals doesn&#x2019;t offer any security guarantees to Ukraine, which is why Kyiv hasn&#x2019;t signed it. &#xA0; Trump has agreed with his defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, that Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO accession path is not &#x201C;practical.&#x201D; &#x201C;Pete made a statement today saying that he thinks it&#x2019;s unlikely or impractical. I think probably that&#x2019;s true,&#x201D; Trump said on Feb. 12. &#x201C;I think long before President Putin, they said there&#x2019;s no way they&#x2019;d allow that. This has been going on for many, many years.&#x201D; &#x201C;They&#x2019;ve been saying that for a long time that Ukraine cannot go into NATO, and I&#x2019;m okay with that.&#x201D; Also on Feb. 12, Hegseth said that post-war security guarantees for Ukraine &#x201C;must be backed by capable European and non-European troops&#x201D; outside the scope of NATO. &#x201C;To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine,&#x201D; Hegseth said. Vice President JD Vance, however, said in a Feb. 13 interview with the Wall Street Journal that the possibility of Washington deploying its troops to Ukraine should Russia fail to negotiate properly was still &quot;on the table,&#x201D; hinting at a lack of coordination strategy within the White House. But shortly after the interview was published, Vance walked back from his own comments and called the coverage &#x201C;absurd,&#x201D; claiming that the Journal twisted his words. &#x201C;As we&apos;ve always said, American troops should never be put into harm&apos;s way where it doesn&apos;t advance American interests and security,&#x201D; Vance said on Feb. 14. &#x201C;This war is between Russia and Ukraine.&#x201D; President Volodymyr Zelensky gives a speech on the second day of the Munich Security Conference in Munich, Germany, on Feb. 15, 2025. (Alex Kraus/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Ukraine&#x2019;s pre-2014 bordersTrump and his senior officials have cast doubt on the prospects of Ukraine reclaiming its territorial integrity. Ukraine may get back some of its territories but should not expect to reclaim its pre-2014 borders, Trump told reporters on Feb. 13. Hegseth called it &#x201C;unrealistic&#x201D; for Ukraine to reclaim the pre-2014 borders, which include Crimea and parts of the eastern Donbas region that Russia occupied in 2014. During a speech at the Ramstein summit, Hegseth said that the U.S. would also like to see a &quot;sovereign and prosperous&#x201D; Ukraine, but that &quot;we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine&apos;s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective.&#x201D; Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, said that &quot;formalizing Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial losses&quot; in a potential peace deal &quot;will not equate to recognizing them.&quot; &quot;I think there will be a certain agreement on the potential loss of territory. But, look, you don&apos;t have to admit it,&quot; Kellogg said in an interview on Feb. 13 with Fox News. Though some European officials said Trump&#x2019;s rush to peace talks was partially expected, they warned that a hasty peace deal conducted over their heads would be very dangerous to European security. &#x201C;Any quick fix is a dirty deal,&#x201D; EU&#x2019;s top diplomat Kaja Kallas said, stressing that there is no deal without Europe and Ukraine and accusing the U.S. of &#x201C;appeasement&#x201D; toward Moscow. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said Trump&#x2019;s team publicly conceding to Moscow even before the peace talks began was &#x201C;regrettable.&#x201D; For Central-Eastern European nations and the Baltic states that have been staunch supporters of Ukraine, Trump&#x2019;s sudden push for peace talks with Putin is particularly alarming. &#x201C;Peace talks would need to begin at the battlefield, with Ukraine having a stronger hand, where Ukraine would be able to actually start pushing and increasing pressure on Russians,&#x201D; Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania&apos;s former foreign minister, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;This is how some success at the negotiating table could be achieved. Now, Ukraine is not put in a stronger position, so basically, what happened (on Feb. 12) is a push for capitulation of Ukraine.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/making-sense-of-trumps-plan-if-there-is-one-to-end-russias-war-in-ukraine/	2025-02-15T08:44:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198945928.jpg
Ukraine 'not ready' to sign mineral resource agreement with US, Zelensky says	Ukraine is not yet ready to sign a mineral resource agreement with the United States, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at a news conference at the Munich Security Conference, stating that the agreement &quot;was not ready to protect&quot; Ukraine and its interests. &quot;I did not allow the ministers to sign the agreement because, in my opinion, it&apos;s not ready to protect us, our interests,&quot; Zelensky said at a news conference attended by Kyiv Independent journalists on Feb. 15. The U.S. seeks to obtain 50% of Ukraine&apos;s rare minerals and has signaled openness to deploy American troops to guard them if there is a deal with Russia to end the war, NBC reported on Feb. 15, citing unnamed American officials. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered a draft of the agreement to President Volodymyr Zelensky during a visit to Kyiv on Feb. 12. Zelensky refused to sign the agreement after Bessent&apos;s presentation, saying he needed to study it and consult with others. &quot;It&apos;s important to talk about investments in Ukraine and this needs to be closely examined by legal experts. We can consider how to distribute the profits (from the mineral resource agreement) if it is tied to a security agreement,&quot; Zelensky added. The proposed agreement, which Zelensky referred to earlier as &quot;a memorandum,&quot; was not a security agreement, Zelensky added. &quot;There are no security guarantees,&quot; in the proposed agreement, Zelensky said, adding that signing the agreement &quot;was not in our interest today.&quot; For a mineral resource agreement to be signed, Ukraine would need to know that the agreement would work, be a positive one for both countries, as well as bring profit and security for Ukraine, Zelensky added. &quot;These resources are not mine, they are of our people,&quot; Zelensky concluded. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly pledged to broker a swift peace deal to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Following up on his earlier proposition of ensuring U.S. support for Ukraine in exchange for rare earth minerals, Trump claimed that Kyiv has &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a deal on a $500 billion resource deal. Ukraine has already signaled it is open to developing a partnership in resource extraction with the U.S. and other partners in exchange for security guarantees, but details on such a deal remain murky.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-not-ready-to-sign-mineral-resource-agreement-with-us-zelensky-says/	2025-02-15T08:41:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/DSC06318------.jpg
Europe won't participate in peace negotiations, but its interests to be considered, Kellogg says	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, said on Feb. 15 that Europe will not be directly involved in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, but its interests will be considered. Kellogg&apos;s remarks come as the Trump administration is trying to bring Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table. Trump has repeatedly claimed that he aims to end the war as soon as possible but has not outlined specific steps to do so. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Kellogg mentioned the Minsk II deal of 2015, which aimed to end Russia&apos;s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and involved Germany and France alongside Ukraine and Russia. &quot;There were a lot of people at the table, but it didn&apos;t work out,&quot; Kellogg said. That&apos;s why Europe will not be involved in the negotiations, but its interests will be taken into account, he added. Kellogg also stressed that Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine could end even this year, pledging to &quot;engage all parties&quot; in 180 days to try to achieve this. Kellogg said that Trump &quot;will not give up important interests,&quot; adding that the U.S. will continue to help Ukraine, but &quot;the killing must be stopped.&quot; Moscow and Kyiv engaged in direct negotiations in Belarus and Turkey during the early months of the full-scale invasion, but those talks ultimately failed. No formal direct discussions between the two sides have taken place since then. Trump has tasked his own delegation, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, to lead negotiations. The Kremlin has repeatedly emphasized that it views the U.S. as its &quot;main counterpart&quot; in efforts to end the war. Zelensky said that he wants European allies to be involved in peace negotiations. Kyiv insists that no talks about Ukraine and ending Russia&apos;s war should be held without Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-wont-participate-in-negotiations-but-its-interests-to-be-considered-kellogg-says/	2025-02-15T07:58:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1247741520.jpg
Russia must withdraw to at least pre-2022 front line, Zelensky says	Russia has to pull back its troops to at least the front line as it was before the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 15 in an interview with Newsmax. Zelensky&apos;s comments come after earlier in the week, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that Ukraine was unlikely to restore its pre-2014 borders in any negotiations with Moscow on ending its war. Experts and officials in Ukraine and Europe have criticized Hegseth&apos;s comments for undermining Ukraine&apos;s leverage before peace talks with Russia have even started. Zelensky told Newsmax that U.S. President Donald Trump could end Russia&apos;s war if Europe supports his plan. &quot;I think that he (Trump) needs, very much, the success, and, otherwise, everybody will say that (this) was the line of Biden and this is the line of Trump. I think he needs success, and we need success and trust him. I hope that he will be on our side,&quot; Zelensky added. Trump has repeatedly pledged to swiftly end the war in Ukraine although he never presented a plan for achieving that. On Feb. 12, Trump held separate calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky. Trump called Putin first, saying later that the two leaders agreed that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will start &quot;immediately.&quot; Zelensky stressed that a peace deal &quot;can only be about a plan to end the war,&quot; which should be agreed upon between Ukraine and the U.S. president and backed by both sides. Zelensky said he was ready to meet with the Russian president only after a joint plan with Trump and the European Union was developed. Russia invaded Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donbas region and annexed Crimea in 2014 following the EuroMaidan Revolution that ousted pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. In 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion, further occupying territories in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as partially occupying territories in Kharkiv, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-must-withdraw-to-at-least-pre-2022-front-line-zelensky-says/	2025-02-15T07:14:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198893921.jpg
Europe quietly developing plan to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, AP reports	A group of European countries is quietly developing a plan to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine due to concerns about changing U.S. priorities on security on the continent, The Associated Press reported on Feb. 14. The news came amid ongoing discussions among Western countries about the possible deployment of peacekeeping forces if a ceasefire agreement is reached between Ukraine and Russia. The U.S. has repeatedly said it wouldn&apos;t send its troops to Ukraine, pushing for Europe to take initiative. France and Britain are leading the initiative of putting &quot;boots on the ground&quot; in Ukraine, according to the Associated Press. Estonia&apos;s Defense Minister Hanno Pevklur told the Associated Press that European allies are &quot;in a very early stage&quot; of developing the plan to deploy peacekeeping troops to Ukraine. Pevklur said that it is &quot;critical&quot; for the allies to understand the contact line in Ukraine before devising a plan. According to Pevklur, if the Russian and Ukrainian armies reduce their forces to a &quot;couple of thousand&quot; on each side, it will not be a problem for Europe &quot;to also be there.&quot; But implementing the plan will be much harder if there is a &quot;boiling conflict.&quot; Earlier reports from The Wall Street Journal indicated that U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s team is weighing a plan to delay Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for continued Western arms supplies and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on Jan. 18 that Germany may consider contributing forces to such a mission, while U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed on Jan. 16 that he had discussed the matter with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Moscow has strongly opposed the idea. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova warned on Jan. 23 that deploying a NATO peacekeeping contingent to Ukraine could lead to &quot;uncontrolled escalation.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-quietly-developing-plan-to-send-peacekeeping-troops-to-ukraine-ap-reports/	2025-02-15T06:30:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/1_GettyImages-2149875923.jpeg
Ukraine, Germany agree to open 'Unity Hub' for Ukrainian refugees in Berlin	Ukraine&apos;s National Unity Minister Oleksii Chernyshov and German Federal Minister for Special Tasks Wolfgang Schmidt signed a joint declaration on Feb. 15, agreeing to open Ukraine&apos;s &quot;Unity Hubs&quot; in Berlin. &quot;The signing of the Joint Declaration of Intent to open the Ukrainian &apos;Unity Hub&apos; in Berlin is an important step to support our citizens abroad. This is a professional space that brings together community, business, and cultural initiatives,&quot; Chernyshov said. The declaration was signed at the Munich Security Conference as the German government continues to debate the legal status and benefits for Ukrainian refugees in the country. The hub will provide Ukrainians with access to educational and career opportunities both in Ukraine and in the host country, according to Chernyshov. The initiative also aims to help Ukrainian refugees adapt, learn, and develop their initiatives in the host country. Meanwhile, the hub will also provide assistance to those who want to return to Ukraine. Germany has taken in more than 1 million Ukrainian refugees since the start of the full-scale invasion, spending over 20 billion euros ($21.4 billion) on their accommodation and integration, according to Bloomberg. More than 200,000 Ukrainian refugees have already found jobs in Germany through the government&apos;s Jobturbo program, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said during a conference with citizens and voters of his Social Democratic Party (SPD) in Teltow. According to Eurostat, over 4.2 million Ukrainian refugees are currently registered for temporary protection to legally access housing, find work, and receive social benefits in EU states. The EU activated the Temporary Protection Directive in March 2022 after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-germany-agree-to-open-ukraines-unity-hub-in-berlin/	2025-02-15T05:20:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/tempImagefZ4JkJ.gif
Almost 250,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine war, Zelensky says	The Russian army has lost almost 250,000 soldiers in the war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 15 during his speech at the Munich Security Conference. Zelensky claimed that Moscow lost nearly 20,000 soldiers in the battles for Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast alone. In addition, a total of over 610,000 Russian troops have been wounded since Feb. 24, 2022, according to the president. Zelensky&apos;s estimate of Russian losses matches that of the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. According to the military, Russia has lost 856,660 troops in Ukraine since 2022. &quot;We completely destroyed the North Korean units that (Vladimir) Putin had to bring in because his own forces weren&#x2019;t enough to hold back our counteroffensive,&quot; Zelensky said, speaking of Ukraine&apos;s Kursk operation. &quot;For over six months now, Ukrainians have been holding a foothold inside Russian territory, even though it was Russia that wanted to create a &apos;buffer zone&apos; inside our land,&quot; he added. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in early August 2024. Zelensky previously said that North Korean troops fighting for Russia against Ukraine have suffered 4,000 casualties, two-thirds of whom have been killed. The heavy losses of the North Korean army may be related to its lack of combat experience and the tactic of human waves attacks with a limited amount of equipment, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said in an interview with The War Zone magazine published on Feb. 4. Kyiv launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk in August 2024, initially capturing about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukrainian forces have lost roughly half that area since, they recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in the region in a new offensive.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-has-lost-almost-250-000-soldiers-in-war-against-ukraine-zelensky-says/	2025-02-15T04:16:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2151581445-1.jpg
Putin is weak. We must use that' — Zelensky's Munich speech in 5 key quotes	President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s speech on the second day of the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15 was met with several rounds of applause. The Ukrainian president called for the creation of an &quot;army of Europe&quot; and emphasized the changes in relations between Europe and the U.S. during Donald Trump&apos;s second presidential term. Zelensky also said that it would be possible to stop Russia&apos;s war and Russian President Vladimir Putin if Europe is united. Zelensky&apos;s speech comes after Trump&apos;s call with Putin, in which they discussed a peace deal for Ukraine without first consulting with Kyiv. Trump made it clear that he doesn&apos;t see Ukraine as an equal party in the negotiations, while Europe might not be invited to the table at all. In response to recent statements from Trump&apos;s team saying that Ukraine&apos;s future in NATO is unrealistic, Zelensky said that Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO &quot;is not off the table.&quot; The Kyiv Independent has picked out five key quotes from Zelensky&apos;s speech at the Munich Security Conference. &quot;Let&apos;s be honest &#x2014; now we can&apos;t rule out the possibility that America might say &apos;no&apos; to Europe on issues that threaten it. Many leaders have talked about a Europe that needs its own military &#x2014; an Army of Europe. I believe that the time has come. The Armed Forces of Europe must be created. This is not harder than standing firm against Russian attacks &#x2014; as we have already done. But this isn&apos;t just about increasing defense spending as a GDP ratio. Money is needed, yes &#x2014; but money alone won&#x2019;t stop an enemy assault.&quot; &quot;Does America need Europe? As a market, yes. But as an ally? For the answer to be &apos;yes,&apos; Europe needs a single voice &#x2014; not a dozen different ones. A few days ago, President Trump told me about his conversation with Putin. Not once did he mention that America needs Europe at that table. That says a lot. The old days are over &#x2014; when America supported Europe just because it always had. But President Trump once said: What matters is not the family you were born into, but the one you build. We must build the closest possible relationship with America, and &#x2014; yes, a new relationship &#x2014; but as Europeans, not just as separate nations. That&apos;s why we need a unified foreign policy, a coordinated diplomacy, the foreign policy of a common Europe.&quot; &quot;Europe has everything it takes. Europe just needs to come together and start acting in a way that no one can say &apos;no&apos; to Europe, boss it around, or treat it like a pushover.&quot; &quot;Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement. And the same rule should apply to all of Europe. No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine. No decisions about Europe without Europe.&quot; &quot;Look at what Putin is trying to do. This is his game. Putin wants one-on-one talks with America &#x2014; just like before the war, when they met in Switzerland and looked how to carve up the world. Next, Putin will try to get the U.S. President to stand on Red Square on May 9th &#x2014; this year &#x2014; not as a respected leader, but as a prop in his performance. We don&apos;t need that.&quot; &quot;We are already working to ensure that on Feb. 24, the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, we can gather together in Kyiv and online. All European leaders. All key partners who defend our security. From Spain to Finland. From Britain to Poland. From Washington to Tokyo.This meeting must deliver a clear vision for our next steps on peace, security guarantees, and the future of our collective policy.&quot; &quot;I also will not take NATO membership for Ukraine off the table. But right now, the most influential member of NATO seems to be Putin because his whims have the power to block NATO decisions. And that&apos;s despite the fact that it was Ukraine&apos;s army that stopped Russia &#x2014; not a NATO country, not NATO troops, but only our people and army. I am proud of Ukraine. I am proud of our people. But now, I ask you &#x2014; each of you &#x2014; to honestly answer this question: If Russia came for you, could your army fight the same way? I don&apos;t want anyone to ever have to find out &#x2014; God forbid. That&apos;s why we are talking about security guarantees. And that&apos;s why we believe that the core of any security guarantees for Ukraine must be NATO membership. Or &#x2013; if not that &#x2013; then conditions that allow us to build another NATO right here in Ukraine.&quot; &quot;We must apply pressure together to make real peace. Putin cannot offer real security guarantees. Not just because he is a pathological liar but because Russia, in its current state, needs war to hold power together. And the world must be protected from that. So, first, the Armed Forces of Europe as an upgrade to NATO. Second, a common European foreign policy. Third, the level of European cooperation that Washington has to take seriously. Fourth, international law. And fifth, keeping all pressure on Russia because that pressure is what guarantees peace, not Putin&apos;s words, not just some papers. Putin lies. He is predictable. And he is weak. We must use that &#x2014; now, not later.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelenskys-munich-speech-in-5-key-quotes/	2025-02-15T03:55:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199020267.jpg
US wants to get 50% of Ukrainian minerals, may deploy its troops to guard them, NBS reports	The U.S. seeks to obtain 50% of Ukraine&apos;s rare minerals and has signaled openness to deploy American troops to guard them if there is a deal with Russia to end the war, NBC reported on Feb. 15, citing unnamed American officials.

Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 3, injure 12 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed three and injured 12 civilians over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 15. Russian forces launched 70 drones from the Russian cities of Orel, Millerovo, and Primosk-Akhtarsk, as well as from Cape Chauda in occupied Crimea, at Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 33 drones over Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Donetsk oblasts, the Air Force said. Another 37 drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are usually decoys. Russia sends them alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 35 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, one person was killed, and 10 others were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian forces attacked the town of Preobrazhenka with glide bombs, killing a 50-year-old woman and a 47-year-old man. Their bodies were retrieved from under rubble, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. A 74-year-old woman was also injured in the attack against Huliaipole as Russian forces struck the town with glide bombs. In Donetsk Oblast, one person was injured in the attack against the village of Novodmytrivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-3-injure-12-over-past-day/	2025-02-15T00:36:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-15-09_45_18.jpeg

No point trying to negotiate' with Putin, Yulia Navalnaya says	There is &quot;no point trying to negotiate&quot; with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Yulia Navalnaya, widow of the late Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, said at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14. Navalnaya&apos;s comments come two days before the anniversary of her husband&apos;s death, which coincided with the launch of the 2024 Munich Security Conference. As U.S. and Ukrainian officials gathered in Europe to discuss steps towards negotiating an end to Russia&apos;s war, Navalnaya warned against attempting to make agreements with Putin. &quot;Even if you decided to negotiate with Putin, just remember he will lie,&quot; she said. &quot;He will betray. He will change the rules at the last moment and force you to play his game.&quot; Days before this year&apos;s Munich Security Conference began, U.S. President Donald Trump held separate calls with both Putin and President Volodymyr Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump called Putin first on Feb. 12, saying later that the two leaders agreed that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will start &quot;immediately.&quot; Trump has repeatedly promised to strike a deal with Moscow that brings about a swift end to the war in Ukraine. &quot;There are only two possible outcomes for any deal with Putin,&quot; Navalnaya said. &quot;If he remains in power, he will find a way to break the agreement. If he loses power, the agreement will become meaningless.&quot; Navalnaya, who has emerged as a prominent leader in the Russian opposition movement in the wake of her husband&apos;s death, spoke at a conference panel along exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. Tsikhanouskaya added that supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression would help other countries, including Belarus and Moldova. &quot;By helping Ukraine, you&apos;re helping the whole region,&quot; she said. Alexei Navalny died on Feb. 16 in a penal colony in northern Russia, after being convicted in several fabricated criminal cases as part of the Kremlin&apos;s crackdown on dissent. Navalnaya has accused Putin of murdering her husband and vowed to continue his political work. The Kremlin has denied any role in Navalny&apos;s death. While Navalnaya is an outspoken critic of Putin&apos;s government, she has expressed ambivalence on military support for Ukraine, commenting in October 2024 that &quot;it&apos;s difficult to say&quot; whether Kyiv should receive weapons, because &quot;the bombs are hitting Russians too.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/no-point-trying-to-negotiate-with-putin-yulia-navalnaya-says/	2025-02-14T21:34:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199669519.jpg
Drone strike causes blaze at Russian industrial site in Kaluga Oblast, governor claims	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A drone strike overnight on Feb. 15 caused a fire at an industrial facility in Russia&apos;s Kaluga Oblast, regional Governor Vladislav Shapsha reported. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) crashed into an unspecified industrial site, the governor claimed. &quot;On the territory of an industrial enterprise in the Dzerzhinsky district, as a result of a UAV crash, a fire broke out in one of the buildings,&quot; Shapsha said. Emergency workers were dispatched to the scene, and preliminary reports indicate there are no casualties, Shapsha said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify Shapsha&apos;s claims at the time of publication. While Shapsha did not specify the facility that came under attack, the Dzerzhinsky district is home to Russia&apos;s Pervyy Zavod plant, the largest petrochemical enterprise in Kaluga Oblast. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) reported a successful attack on the facility in May 2024. Last month, the Ukrainian military struck an oil depot in the town of Lyudinovo in Kaluga Oblast, causing a fire on the premises. A number of other regions in Russia reported drone strikes on the night of Feb. 15. A drone attack in the southern Russian city of Volgograd reportedly targeted an oil refinery and hit an apartment building, according to local residents. Russian officials have not commented on a possible attack. Roman Busargin, the governor of Saratov Oblast, also reported a drone threat in the region. The Russian Defense Ministry reported on Feb. 15 that 40 UAVs had been shot down over Kaluga, Volgograd, Saratov, and Rostov oblasts during the night. The Kyiv Independent could not confirm these reports. Ukraine routinely launches deep strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia, primarily relying on domestically developed drones. Kyiv has particlarly taken aim at Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure as part of its strategy to undermine funding for the Kremlin&apos;s war chest.	https://kyivindependent.com/drone-strike-causes-blaze-at-russian-industrial-site-in-kaluga-oblast-governor-claims/	2025-02-14T20:38:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2187953056.jpg
Drones hit apartment building, target oil refinery in Volgograd, Russian media says	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Multiple drones targeted an oil refinery near the city of Volgograd in southern Russia in the early hours of Feb. 15, Russian Telegram channels reported. Local residents reported hearing over 15 explosions during a drone attack, according to the Telegram channel Shot. The reports claimed that the drones were headed towards an oil refinery in the Krasnoarmeysky district of the city. Following reports of explosions, the Telegram channel Astra reported that a drone struck a multistory residential building in Volgograd. Local residents said that security forces had cordoned off the site and that preliminary information indicated no one was injured. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Russian officials have not commented on the alleged attack and no casualties have been reported. The Volgograd refinery, owned by Russian oil giant Lukoil, was recently struck by Ukrainian drones in an attack on Jan. 31, according to the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. The facility has been targeted multiple times throughout the full-scale war. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities as valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-hit-apartment-building-target-oil-refinery-in-volgograd-russian-media-says/	2025-02-14T19:40:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1245921994.jpg
Zelensky, Macron discuss Europe's role in Ukraine's security guarantees	President Volodymyr Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron discussed steps towards ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine in a phone conversation on Feb. 14. The call followed Zelensky&apos;s meeting with U.S. officials, including Vice President JD Vance, at the Munich Security Conference. The two leaders discussed how European partners can coordinate with the U.S. and Ukraine to bring about a just peace, the Presidential Office reported. &quot;Europe must be represented at the negotiating table,&quot; Zelensky reportedly emphasized to Macron. According to the Presidential Office, the call focused particularly on &quot;security guarantees and proposals of France.&quot; While the president did not disclose the details of these proposals, Zelensky and Macron have previously discussed France&apos;s idea of deploying Western peacekeepers to monitor a future ceasefire in Ukraine. While Zelensky has said that Ukraine&apos;s preferred postwar security guarantee is NATO membership, U.S. leadership has severely undercut that aim in the past few days. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said during the Ramstein summit on Feb. 12 that Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership was not a &quot;realistic outcome&quot; of peace negotiations. He also said that a return to the country&apos;s pre-2014 borders was &quot;an unrealistic objective.&quot; Later that day, U.S. President Donald Trump said he spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin directly about negotiations to end the war. Trump called Zelensky some time after his talk with Putin. European officials were reportedly caught off guard by Trump&apos;s direct engagement with Putin, with key allies receiving no prior notice, according to Bloomberg. Zelensky and Macron reportedly discussed the conversation with Trump in their latest call. &quot;If President Trump can truly convince President Putin to stop the aggression against Ukraine, that is great news,&quot; Macron said on X after speaking with Zelensky. &quot;Then, it will be the Ukrainians alone who can drive the discussions for a solid and lasting peace. We will help them in this endeavor.&quot; Zelensky thanked Macron for championing the idea of &quot;nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.&quot; &quot;The security of the whole of Europe in the future depends on unity now,&quot; the Presidential Office said. Many European leaders have reiterated their ongoing support for Ukraine amid Trump&apos;s push for a swift deal to end the war. Still, some allies in Europe fear that they will have to shoulder the economic and security burdens of Ukraine&apos;s postwar recovery as the U.S. and Russia exclude them from talks on ending the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-macron-discuss-europes-role-in-ukraines-security-guarantees/	2025-02-14T18:55:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1241348238.jpg
It doesn't advance American interests' — JD Vance walks back WSJ comments on US troops in Ukraine	U.S. Vice President JD Vance on Feb. 14 reiterated that Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine &quot;is between Russia and Ukraine&quot; and accused the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) of &quot;twisting (his) words&quot; in a recently published interview. Vance told the WSJ on Feb. 13 that the U.S. had &quot;military tools of leverage&quot; it could potentially use to pressure Russia in negotiations to end the war. When asked if the possibility of U.S. troops in Ukraine was &quot;officially off the table,&quot; Vance replied that in negotiations with President Donald Trump, &quot;everything is on the table.&quot; In a post on X the following day, Vance walked those comments back and called the WSJ&apos;s coverage &quot;absurd.&quot; &quot;President Trump is the ultimate deal maker and will bring peace to the region by ending the war in Ukraine,&quot; Vance wrote. &quot;As we&apos;ve always said, American troops should never be put into harm&apos;s way where it doesn&apos;t advance American interests and security. This war is between Russia and Ukraine.&quot; Vance appeared to take issue with the WSJ interview&apos;s headline, which read &quot;Vance wields threat of sanctions, military action to push (Russian President Vladimir) Putin into Ukraine deal.&quot; Even though Vance did not rule out the possibility of military leverage in future negotiations and refused to say deploying U.S. troops was off the table, he accused the outlet of &quot;twisting (his) words.&quot; Vance lashed out at the publication further, claiming without evidence that the WSJ has &quot;spent years pushing for more American sons and daughters in uniform to be unnecessarily deployed overseas.&quot; The Vice President&apos;s remarks came on the same day that he led a U.S. delegation in talks with &#xA0;President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Munich Security Conference. The leaders discussed a potential minerals agreement between Washington and Kyiv, which could involve access to Ukraine&apos;s mineral reserves in exchange for continued U.S. military and financial support. Before the meeting, Vance delivered an excoriating address to the conference attendees in which he suggested progressive European policies were a greater threat to the EU than Russia. His speech downplayed the threat of authoritarian states and touted the value of far-right political parties. A few days before the Munich Security Conference, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that the U.S. would not send troops to Ukraine. Kyiv&apos;s Western allies have discussed the possibility of deploying peacekeeping forces as a potential security guarantee in the event of a ceasefire.	https://kyivindependent.com/it-doesnt-advance-american-interests-jd-vance-walks-back-wsj-comments-on-us-troops-in-ukraine/	2025-02-14T17:53:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198862659.jpg
Ukraine's survival hinges on US military support, Zelensky tells NBC News	President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that his country faces an uphill battle for survival without continued U.S. military assistance. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, he told NBC News that it would be &quot;very, very, very difficult&quot; for Ukraine to sustain its fight against Russia and remain secure in the long term without American support. Zelensky stressed that while Ukraine would always fight for its survival, the chances of success would be significantly diminished without help from the United States. During the interview with NBC&#x2019;s &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; Zelensky also dismissed the idea of negotiating a ceasefire on Russian terms, arguing that Moscow&#x2019;s goal is to gain time to rebuild its military strength. He warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin seeks a temporary truce to ease international sanctions and prepare for renewed aggression. &quot;This is really what he wants,&quot; Zelenskyy said, emphasizing that any pause in fighting could allow Russia to reinforce its forces. His remarks come amid growing tensions between the U.S. and its European allies over support for Ukraine. At the Munich summit, U.S. Vice President JD Vance took a combative tone, criticizing European leaders on multiple fronts, including issues unrelated to the war. In response, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier accused the Trump administration of undermining long-standing partnerships. The widening rift has raised concerns in Europe about the future of Western unity against Russia. Meanwhile, Trump&#x2019;s recent statements on Ukraine have unsettled many European leaders. Trump also downplayed criticism from within his party, telling reporters that he had not heard concerns from Senator Roger Wicker, who recently called U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth&#x2019;s comments on Ukraine a &quot;rookie mistake.&quot; &quot;I&#x2019;ll speak to Roger. I&#x2019;ll speak to Pete. I&#x2019;ll find out,&quot; Trump said. Despite the shifting U.S. stance, Zelensky remains hopeful that Washington will not abandon Kyiv. He said earlier that he does not believe the U.S. has a concrete plan for peace and insisted that Ukraine must be included in any negotiations between Washington and Moscow. Speaking at the Munich conference, he suggested that Trump could exert pressure on Putin if he chose to stand firmly with Ukraine. &quot;And if he will choose our side, and if he will not be in the middle, I think he will pressure and he will push Putin to stop the war. He can do it,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-survival-hinges-on-us-military-support-zelensky-tells-nbc-news/	2025-02-14T16:53:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164821112.jpg
Russia arrests US citizen at Moscow airport over alleged cannabis-laced sweets	A 28-year-old U.S. citizen was detained at Moscow&#x2019;s Vnukovo airport after Russian authorities allegedly found food items containing cannabis derivatives in his luggage. The man had arrived from Istanbul on Feb. 7 when a customs inspection led to his arrest, according to Russian state-run news agencies TASS and Interfax. Russia&#x2019;s Federal Customs Service claimed that a service dog alerted officials to one of the man&#x2019;s suitcases, prompting a search. Inside, authorities reportedly discovered two plastic jars and a zip bag containing sweets. A chemical analysis later confirmed that the items contained narcotic substances from the cannabinoid group, TASS reported. The detained traveler reportedly told officials that the gummies and marmalade had been prescribed to him by a doctor in the United States. He claimed he needed the products while traveling, according to TASS. The possession of cannabis, even for medical use, is illegal in Russia. The U.S. State Department has not yet commented on the case. The detention comes amid ongoing tensions between the U.S. and Russia, including previous high-profile detentions of American citizens. Earlier this week, Russia and the U.S. carried out a prisoner exchange, with Moscow releasing U.S. teacher Marc Fogel in exchange for Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national accused of Bitcoin fraud. Fogel had been sentenced to 14 years in prison for carrying marijuana he claimed was medically prescribed.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-arrests-us-citizen-at-moscow-airport-over-alleged-cannabis-laced-sweets/	2025-02-14T15:44:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1813426206.jpg
Ukraine secures return of 8 children from Russian-occupied territories	Ukraine successfully brought back eight children who had been forcibly taken to Russian-occupied territory, Dmytro Lubinets, Ukrainian Parliament&#x2019;s Commissioner for Human Rights, reported on Feb. 14. &quot;Among the returned children are siblings,&quot; Lubinets wrote. &quot;All the children were separated from their families due to the war and occupation, and some lost their parents. In general, we managed to return children from Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblast.&quot; Since February 2022, at least 20,000 Ukrainian children have been abducted from Russian-occupied territories and sent to other Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine or to Russia itself, according to a Ukrainian national database, &quot;Children of War.&quot; Lubinets estimated that Russia has unlawfully deported up to 150,000 Ukrainian children, while the Children&#x2019;s Ombudswoman, Daria Herasymchuk, puts the figure at 200,000&#x2013;300,000. Ukrainian children return home on Feb. 14 as part of the Ukrainian President&apos;s initiative Bring Kids Back UA. (Dmytro Lubinets / Facebook)Ukraine considers these abductions a war crime and argues that they meet the U.N.&apos;s legal definition of genocide. Russia often claims it is relocating children to protect them from conflict zones. According to the Ministry of Reintegration, the government has managed to return 388 children so far. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Children&apos;s Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, citing their involvement in the unlawful transfer of Ukrainian children. Russia dismissed the ICC&apos;s decision as &quot;outrageous and unacceptable.&quot; A Yale School of Public Health study published on Dec. 3 detailed Russia&apos;s systematic program of deporting and forcibly assimilating Ukrainian children. Under orders from Russian President Vladimir Putin, children were transported via military aircraft in 2022, reclassified in Russian databases as native-born, and subjected to pro-Russian re-education before being adopted into Russian families. Ukrainian children had been transported to at least 21 regions throughout Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-secures-return-of-8-children-from-russian-occupied-territories/	2025-02-14T14:51:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/478155332_3485103575130744_747462514348261219_n.jpg
JD Vance's Munich speech met with shock, bewilderment, and 'almost no applause'	U.S. Vice President JD Vance stunned those watching on Feb. 14 when his speech at the Munich Security Conference turned into a searing attack on Europe&apos;s ideals and a call to embrace far-right political parties. At an event focused almost entirely on how to end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Vance said what he fears most isn&apos;t authoritarian states but Europe&apos;s &quot;threat from within.&quot; &quot;The threat I worry the most about vis-a-vis Europe is not Russia, it&apos;s not China, it&apos;s not any other external actor. It is the threat from within. The retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values.,&quot; he said. Vance went on to admonish Europe for not paying enough attention to &quot;uncontrolled migration&quot; and for what he described as the &quot;retreat&quot; of free speech. He argued that Europe should not &quot;just talk about democratic values&quot; but &quot;live them,&quot; adding the continent could not &quot;force people what to think, what to believe.&quot; Vance said these efforts included restrictions on &quot;misinformation,&quot; which he described as a &quot;Soviet-era&quot; word, and laws against abortion protests that he said unfairly silenced Christians. Speaking a little over a week before the German elections, the vice president called on European nations to drop their opposition to far-right parties such as the Alternative for Germany (AfD), which Berlin suspects of extremism. &quot;If you are afraid of your own people, there is nothing America can do for you,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;You cannot win a democratic mandate by censoring your opponents or putting them in jail.&quot; The speech stunned those in attendance &#x2014; Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksii Honcharenko said in a post on X the speech amounted to &quot; the total humiliation of all European leaders.&quot; &quot;There was almost no applause,&quot; he added in another post. US Vice President Vance just spoke. The only thing that can be said about Vance&apos;s speech was the total humiliation of all European leaders. People in the room are shocked. For most of Vance&apos;s speech, the European leaders and bureaucrats looked at each other, and there was almost no applause. &quot;It&apos;s a strange style,&quot; EU Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius told the Kyiv Independent at the conference, adding: &quot;Of course, he attracted a lot of attention, but (there were) no substantial messages. Not on Ukraine, not on Gaza.&quot; Kubilius added that he was &quot;not surprised&quot; at the speech, adding it was now a question of how Europe reacted to it. &quot;And my reaction is quite simple &#x2014; keep calm and carry on,&quot; he said. Federico Borsari, a resident fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent that Vance&apos;s comments &quot;risk creating a fracture between the U.S. and Europe at a time when unity at all levels is essential to counter Russia (and) ensure a strong transatlantic alliance and continued support for Ukraine.&quot; &quot;Rather than using the prestigious MSC&#x2019;s stage to promote the image of the new U.S. administration in front of European leaders... the U.S. vice president decided to openly downplay a very tangible Russian threat in front of an audience comprising people from countries that suffered decades of brutal Soviet occupation and directly criticize European countries and their governments... for their alleged attack on democracy and freedom of speech,&quot; Borsari noted. The expert also highlighted that Vance&apos;s comments were promptly praised by members of the far-right AfD. Elsewhere, social media was awash with criticism of the speech &#x2014; Gideon Rachman, the chief foreign affairs commentator for the Financial Times (FT), described it as &quot;shocking hypocrisy.&quot; Shocking hypocrisy from Vance - lecturing Europe on democracy when he serves as vice president to a man who attempted a coup in the US Carl Bildt, co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the speech was &quot;significantly worse than expected.&quot; The #MSC2025 speech by &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1F8; VP Vance was significantly worse than expected. At best it was totally irrelevant to European or global security concerns. At worst it was blatant interference in the &#x1F1E9;&#x1F1EA; election campaign in favor of far-right AfD. pic.twitter.com/4IKknWhoR8 Speaking at the conference after Vance&apos;s speech, Germany&apos;s Defense Minister Boris Pistorius tackled the vice president&apos;s comments about the AfD head-on. &quot;Democracy does not mean that a vociferous minority can decide what truth is&#x2026; democracy must be able to defend itself against extremists,&quot; he said. German Defense Minister Pistorius reacts to Vance&apos;s speech: &quot;This is not acceptable.&quot; pic.twitter.com/LdVuLC6PbU Vance later met with President Volodymyr Zelensky. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, also attended the meeting. &quot;Our teams will continue to work on the document (on critical minerals). We have addressed many of the key issues and look forward to welcoming General Kellogg to Ukraine for further discussions and a deeper assessment of the situation on the ground,&quot; Zelensky wrote. &quot;We are ready to move towards real and guaranteed peace as quickly as possible. We sincerely appreciate President Trump&apos;s determination to help stop the war and provide Ukraine with justice and security guarantees,&quot; Zelensky added. I wonder if JD Vance is planning to lecture his boss&#x2019;s buddy Vladimir Putin on democracy and free speech. &#x1F914; Vance&apos;s speech came at the end of a tumultuous week for U.S.-Europe relations and the future of the war in Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump and his top officials on Feb. 12 appeared to undermine Ukraine&#x2019;s leverage in peace talks, renewing fears that his plans for a quick resolution could amount to a victory for Russia. Trump announced he had held phone calls with both Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Zelensky, saying peace negotiations would start &quot;immediately&quot; and a ceasefire is in the &quot;not too distant future.&quot; Earlier in the day, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said &quot;returning to Ukraine&apos;s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,&quot; and that NATO membership for Ukraine is not an option. JD Vance says Putin isn&apos;t Europe&apos;s biggest threat less than 24 hours after Putin hits Chernobyl with a drone. You can&apos;t make this stuff up. European leaders &#x2014; suddenly left out of discussions after nearly three years of close involvement with the U.S. on Ukraine-related issues under President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration &#x2014; &#xA0;scrambled to react to Trump&#x2019;s comments. Kaja Kallas, the EU&apos;s top diplomat, said on the same day: &quot;Why are we giving (Russia) everything they want, even before negotiations have started? &#x2026; If there is an agreement made behind our backs, it simply will not work.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/jd-vances-munich-speech-met-with-shock-bewilderment-and-almost-no-applause/	2025-02-14T14:15:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/DSC06752------.jpg
Senior Republican senator calls Hegseth’s Ukraine remarks 'rookie mistake,' Politico reports	U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth faced criticism from Senate Armed Services Chair Roger Wicker after suggesting that Ukraine&#x2019;s return to its pre-war borders was &quot;unrealistic.&quot; While Hegseth has since walked back some of his comments, Wicker, a staunch supporter of Kyiv, argued in an interview with Politico that the damage was done, saying: &quot;He made a rookie mistake in Brussels and he&#x2019;s walked back some of what he said but not that line.&quot; The controversy stems from Hegseth&#x2019;s initial remarks, in which he also said that NATO membership for Ukraine was off the table and that reclaiming its internationally recognized borders was not feasible. His comments were met with backlash, particularly from Wicker, who speculated on their origins, saying, &quot;I don&#x2019;t know who wrote the speech &#x2014; it is the kind of thing Tucker Carlson could have written, and Carlson is a fool.&quot; Wicker said he was surprised by Hegseth&#x2019;s initial remarks but heartened by his partial reversal. &quot;Everybody knows &#x2026; and people in the administration know you don&apos;t say before your first meeting what you will agree to and what you won&apos;t agree to,&quot; Wicker added, noting that he found Hegseth&#x2019;s statements puzzling and disturbing. The criticism of Hegseth is also tied to broader diplomatic moves by the Trump administration. President Donald Trump held a call this week with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss ending the war, while Vice President JD Vance was set to meet with &#xA0;President Volodymyr Zelensky in Munich. Trump later reinforced Hegseth&#x2019;s message, stating that Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership was not &quot;practical&quot; and that a return to pre-2014 borders was &#x201C;unlikely.&#x201D; The direct talks between Trump and Putin have raised concerns among European allies that Ukraine could be sidelined in any potential peace agreement. In contrast, Wicker maintained a hardline stance, calling Putin a &quot;war criminal who needs to be in prison for the rest of his life.&quot; He also pushed back against Trump&#x2019;s suggestion that NATO enlargement provoked Russia&#x2019;s invasion, stating unequivocally that Russia alone was responsible. &quot;There are good guys and bad guys in this war, and the Russians are the bad guys,&quot; Wicker said. &quot;They invaded, contrary to almost every international law, and they should be defeated. And Ukraine is entitled to the promises that the world made to it.&quot; Trump, however, denied being aware of Wicker&#x2019;s criticism from within his own party. When asked about it on Feb. 14, he said: &quot;Roger is a very good friend of mine, and Pete is obviously, he&#x2019;s been doing a great job. I haven&#x2019;t heard.&quot; He added, &quot;I&#x2019;ll speak to Roger. I&#x2019;ll speak to Pete. I&#x2019;ll find out,&quot; after asking the reporter to clarify Wicker&#x2019;s remarks. Despite the internal Republican divide, Wicker continued to push for sustained U.S. military aid to Ukraine, calling for continued weapons shipments &quot;until there is a ceasefire.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/senior-republican-senator-calls-hegseths-ukraine-remarks-rookie-mistake-politico-reports/	2025-02-14T13:30:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2161853322.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Chornobyl Nuclear Plant sarcophagus hit by Russian drone; Zelensky sets out condition for talks with Putin	Key developments on Feb. 14: A Russian attack drone struck the protective shelter of the destroyed 4th reactor at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant, President Volodymyr Zelensky reported on Feb. 14. The strike damaged the sarcophagus, but the fire was extinguished and radiation levels remained stable, according to the president. Monitoring efforts continue to assess any potential risks. &quot;This is a terrorist threat to the entire world,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that the damage to the shelter is significant. &quot;The only country in the world that attacks such sites, occupies nuclear power plants, and wages war without any regard for the consequences is today&apos;s Russia.&quot; The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has confirmed the explosion. The organization reported that a drone struck the shelter&apos;s roof. Chornobyl, the site of the world&apos;s worst nuclear disaster, remains a highly sensitive location. The explosion of the plant&apos;s reactor on Apr. 26, 1986, contaminated a vast area spanning Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. The sarcophagus was installed over the 4th reactor in the aftermath of the disaster to contain the uranium, plutonium, and radioactive dust at the site. The protective structure would only last 30 years, with the construction of a new sarcophagus completed in 2017. 0:00/1&#xD7;Alleged moment of a Russian drone strike on the protective shelter of the destroyed 4th power unit at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant, Feb. 14, 2025. (President Volodymyr Zelensky / Telegram).&quot;Ukraine is urging the international community to urgently intensify efforts in response to Russia&apos;s unprecedented act of nuclear terrorism. The attack on the shelter of the 4th power unit at Chornobyl poses a threat to the entire continent,&quot; said Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko. Zelensky said the attack underscores Russia&apos;s continued disregard for global security. &quot;Russia continues to expand its army and shows no change in its deranged, anti-human state rhetoric. This means that Putin is definitely not preparing for negotiations &#x2014; he is preparing to continue deceiving the world,&quot; he said. Russia attacked the station&apos;s protective shelter on the day of the Munich Security Conference. Zelensky is leading Ukraine&apos;s delegation at the conference, where U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s team is expected to outline its diplomatic strategy for ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Andriy Yermak, head of Zelensky&apos;s office, said Ukraine would provide the U.S. with detailed information on Russia&apos;s attack on Chornobyl&apos;s protective shelter. Ukraine is not talking about any peace deal now, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14. &quot;Today, we are not talking about any peace agreement. Frankly to say, it is unfortunate,&quot; Zelensky said.&quot;The war has been going on for three years, there have been many deaths, much has been destroyed, especially lives. All this was brought by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and him alone.&quot; The president said that Ukraine needs the firm support of the U.S. and a &quot;strong&quot; President Donald Trump, who will be on Kyiv&apos;s side. According to Zelensky, a peace deal &quot;can only be about a plan to end the war&quot; which should be agreed between Ukraine and the U.S. president, and backed by both sides. He also reiterated the importance of Europe&apos;s role in the potential deal. &quot;A peace deal cannot be signed in Munich because it is Munich. We remember what things were signed here. I do not repeat such things,&quot; Zelensky added, recalling the infamous Munich meeting when Germany, the U.K., France, and Italy came to an agreement that allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland in western Czechoslovakia. Zelensky said he was ready to meet with the Russian president only after there is a joint plan with Trump and the EU. &quot;I am ready to meet only in this case. And we will sit down with Putin and stop the war,&quot; Zelensky said. Russia is possibly preparing for a major military escalation, potentially targeting NATO countries next year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 14. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky said that Russia plans to deploy 15 divisions, totaling 100,000 to 150,000 troops, primarily in Belarus, a Kyiv Independent journalist reported from the event. While the buildup could focus on Ukraine, he cautioned that Russian forces might shift toward Poland or the Baltics, raising concerns about a broader conflict with NATO. &quot;Based on all the information I&apos;ve gathered from intelligence and other sources, I think he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) is preparing for war against NATO countries next year,&quot; Zelensky said, but added he &quot;can&#x2019;t be 100 percent certain.&quot; &quot;Just like in 2022, they could move forward towards Ukraine, or they could go to Poland or the Baltics. And I believe this is his idea,&quot; he said. &quot;God bless, we will stop this crazy guy,&quot; Zelensky added. The president also warned that without NATO membership, Ukraine must build a self-sufficient military capable of defending its sovereignty. &quot;This means the appropriate NATO weaponry and a sufficient number of our Ukrainian soldiers,&quot; he said. According to Zelensky, Ukraine would require an army numbering 1.5 million soldiers. Last month, he said the current total of those serving in Ukraine&apos;s armed forces was 880,000. North Korean troops fighting for Russia against Ukraine have suffered 4,000 casualties, two-thirds of whom have been killed, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 14. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky said the morale of Pyongyang&apos;s troops had been &quot;broken&quot; by the losses, a Kyiv Independent journalist reported from the event. &quot;We understand that their losses are more than four thousand. I think two-thirds have died,&quot; he added. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in early August 2024. Zelensky also said 2,000-3,000 more troops are being transferred from North Korea to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, saying it was important that U.S. President Donald Trump takes note of such developments as he tries to bring Moscow to the negotiating table. Quantum Systems, a German drone manufacturer operating two plants in Ukraine, plans to double its drone production in the country, Ukraine&apos;s Strategic Industries Ministry announced on Feb. 14. The company produces advanced Vector reconnaissance drones. It opened its first facility in Ukraine in April 2024. Unmanned systems have become a key capability for both sides of the Russia-Ukraine war. to meet its battlefield needs, Kyiv has ramped up domestic production and imports of drones since the start of the full-scale invasion.

We're ready to move to real and guaranteed peace as quickly as possible' — Zelensky on meeting with Vance	A Ukrainian delegation led by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with representatives of the U.S. government, including U.S. Vice President JD Vance, at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14. The meeting was initially postponed, allowing the U.S. time to review a draft memorandum of partnership submitted by Kyiv, a source in the Zelensky&apos;s Office told the Kyiv Independent. Following the meeting, Zelensky thanked Vance and his team. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, also attended the meeting. &quot;Our teams will continue to work on the document (on critical minerals). We have addressed many of the key issues and look forward to welcoming General Kellogg to Ukraine for further discussions and a deeper assessment of the situation on the ground,&quot; Zelensky wrote. &quot;We are ready to move towards real and guaranteed peace as quickly as possible. We sincerely appreciate President Trump&apos;s determination to help stop the war and provide Ukraine with justice and security guarantees,&quot; Zelensky added. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered a draft of the agreement to Zelensky during a visit to Kyiv on Feb. 12. Ukraine finalized and handed over the memorandum to the U.S. side, which requested additional time to review the document until 5 p.m. The draft memorandum is part of broader discussions on a potential minerals agreement, which Trump has suggested could involve access to Ukraine&apos;s mineral reserves in exchange for continued military and financial support. Zelensky has expressed openness to such an arrangement, saying that Ukraine is willing to grant U.S. companies access to minerals in exchange for sustained support from Washington.	https://kyivindependent.com/were-ready-to-move-to-real-and-guaranteed-peace-as-quickly-as-possible-zelensky-on-meeting-with-vance/	2025-02-14T11:28:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-14-20_52_43.jpeg
Over 150 Ukrainian war prisoners may be held in Chechnya, Kyiv says	More than 150 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) may be held in Chechnya, Ukraine&apos;s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on Feb. 14. Ukraine has documented over 100 cases of Russia summarily executing Ukrainian POWs since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets clarified that the actual number is likely much higher since it is difficult to document Russian war crimes without supporting evidence, such as videos of the executions. Some 36 Ukrainian POWs are being sought and may be in the city of Grozny, Chechnya, according to the headquarters. The Red Cross International Committee has not confirmed that there are any Ukrainians in captivity in Chechnya. The headquarters are also not aware of any visits by the humanitarian organization to Ukrainian POWs in Chechnya, as reported by RFE/RL. Ukrainian soldiers are captured in different sectors of the frontline, and then they are transferred to Chechnya, the headquarters said. &quot;As in other places of detention on the territory of the aggressor state and the Ukrainian occupied territories, the norms of humanitarian law and the requirements of the Third Geneva Convention related to the treatment of POWs are not observed,&quot; the organization said. &quot;(Chechen dictator Ramzan) Kadyrov&apos;s regime uses prisoners as human shields for military facilities, as well as a lever to lift sanctions against members of the Kadyrov family.&quot; Ukraine has not received any requests from Chechnya for the exchange of POWs, the headquarters added. In 2024, 1,358 Ukrainians were released, and since the beginning of the all-out war, 3,956 Ukrainians have returned from Russian captivity, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his New Year&apos;s address.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-150-ukrainian-war-prisoners-may-be-in-chechnya-ukraine-says/	2025-02-14T11:06:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/2024-05-06-22_22_13.jpg
Over 6,000 cases of Russian use of chemicals recorded over 2 years, Ukraine says	Ukraine has recorded 6,129 cases of the use of munitions containing hazardous chemicals by Russian troops since February 2023, the Foreign Ministry reported on Feb. 14. Russia has been intensifying its use of chemical agents on the battlefield in Ukraine. Since the beginning of the all-out war, Ukraine&apos;s radiation, chemical, and biological intelligence units have been monitoring and recording the use of hazardous chemicals in attacks. For a recent report by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), experts analyzed the materials provided by Ukraine, including four Russian RG-Vo type gas grenades, as well as soil and grass samples. Two OPCW laboratories confirmed that they contained riot control agent known as CS. Among other hazardous chemicals, chloroacetophenone (CN), as well as chloropicrin and mercaptans (malodorants) were found, according to the statement. By using them, Russia violates Article 1 of the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Foreign Ministry said. &quot;The international community must demonstrate its unity in countering the aggressor, and a practical element of this should be the establishment of an international coalition to hold the Russian Federation accountable for the violation of its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention,&quot; the statement read. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, more than 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been hospitalized with chemical poisoning, and three have died, Ukrainian Colonel Artem Vlasiuk said in December 2024. Ukraine struck back at Russia&apos;s use of illegal chemical weapons on Dec. 17, when the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) assassinated Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops. The previous day, Ukrainain prosecutors charged Kirillov in absentia for the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-6-000-cases-of-russias-use-of-chemical-weapons-have-been-recorded-in-2-years-ukraine-says/	2025-02-14T11:03:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2152456898.jpg
German drone manufacturer Quantum Systems plans to double production in Ukraine	Quantum Systems, a German drone manufacturer operating two plants in Ukraine, plans to double its drone production in the country, Ukraine&apos;s Strategic Industries Ministry announced on Feb. 14. The company produces advanced Vector reconnaissance drones. It opened its first facility in Ukraine in April 2024. Unmanned systems have become a key capability for both sides of the Russia-Ukraine war. to meet its battlefield needs, Kyiv has ramped up domestic production and imports of drones since the start of the full-scale invasion. The ministry met with Quantum Systems representatives at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14 to discuss ways to speed up drone production. &quot;We all want the same result &#x2014; more quality weapons for the Ukrainian military,&quot; said Herman Smetanin, Ukraine&apos;s strategic industries minister. The ministry wrote that Quantum Systems operates an R&amp;D center and a drone maintenance and development facility in Ukraine, calling it &#x201C;a good example of localized manufacturing.&quot; Quantum Systems first began providing Ukraine with drones after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. The firm also established a service, support, training, and logistics center in Ukraine in the following year. The company promised to supply Kyiv with 500 reconnaissance drones by the end of 2024. In September 2024, Ukraine created the Unmanned Systems&apos; Forces &#x2014; a separate branch of the military focused on drones, forming special drone-specific units, and improving the production, training, and innovation of unmanned vehicles.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-drone-manufacturer-quantum-systems-plans-to-double-production-in-ukraine/	2025-02-14T10:13:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/Vector-.jpeg
‘Nuclear blackmail:’ Russia strikes Chornobyl as world leaders gather for Munich Security Conference	Russia attacked Ukraine&#x2019;s decommissioned Chornobyl nuclear power plant on Feb. 14 just as world leaders gathered for the Munich Security Conference &#x2014; in Moscow&#x2019;s latest nuclear threat against Kyiv. Videos shared by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky show a drone breaking through Chornobyl&#x2019;s &#x201C;sarcophagus,&#x201D; an international project to cover reactor number four that exploded in 1986 in the most devastating nuclear disaster in history. Zelensky called the drone attack &#x201C;a terrorist threat to the whole world.&#x201D; Without going into details about the attack, a representative for the Chornobyl station called the strike an &#x201C;act of terror by Russia.&#x201D; The strike is likely more signaling on Russia&#x2019;s part. The Munich Security Conference, historically a show of force by NATO, started on Feb. 14. Andriy Yermak, the head of the president&#x2019;s office, wrote, &#x201C;The atmosphere (at Munich) right now is such that everyone in Munich is very angry because of this news.&#x201D; Images of the attack released by Ukraine&#x2019;s security service show that Russia used a long-range Shahed attack drone in the strike, but that damage was limited. The president said that following the attack, higher radiation levels were not detected. &#x201C;It&apos;s a tiny warhead in the drone,&#x201D; says Fabian Hoffman, a missile expert at the Oslo Nuclear Project, of the explosion visible in photos. &#x201C;(Russia) very much knew that this would absolutely not penetrate the meter-thick concrete walls surrounding the reactor, so they knew there would be no radiation leakage,&#x201D; he said. The sarcophagus surrounding the derelict reactor is not the only defense. &#x201C;The blocks also have this concrete shell that gets in the way of some kind of large-scale projection of radioactive waste,&#x201D; said Olena Lapenko, an energy security specialist at the Dixi Group, a Kyiv-based energy think tank. &#x201C;We understand, and they understand, that a single drone is not going to get through to the center of the nuclear block.&#x201D; 0:00/1&#xD7;Alleged moment of a Russian drone strike on the protective shelter of the destroyed 4th power unit at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant, Feb. 14, 2025. (President Volodymyr Zelensky / Telegram).As negotiations to end the war pick up steam, Russia may be flexing its muscles. U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky on the phone this week, saying peace talks would start &quot;immediately&quot; and that a ceasefire was in the &quot;not too distant future.&quot; Trump&#x2019;s Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also came out this week saying that both a return to Ukraine&#x2019;s 2014 borders and NATO accession were unrealistic. The statement caused alarm that the U.S. was making concessions to Russia before negotiations had even begun. Zelensky connected the attack to negotiations, saying, &#x201C;Russia carries out such attacks against Ukrainian infrastructure and our cities every night. Russia continues to increase its army. Russia does not change its crazy anti-human state rhetoric. This means that Putin is definitely not preparing for negotiations.&#x201D; &#x201C;There&#x2019;s this wave of information regarding negotiations. I would not rule out that this (attack) is to put pressure on Ukraine,&#x201D; says Lapenko, who called the attack &#x201C;a new wave of nuclear blackmail.&#x201D; The engine reportedly from a Russian drone that struck the protective shelter of the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant on Feb. 14, 2025. (Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation / Telegram)Moscow has deployed various forms of nuclear saber-rattling since the start of the full-scale invasion. It has repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons to deter Ukraine&#x2019;s allies from assisting it further. In the early days of the invasion, Russian troops occupied the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant &#x2014; Europe&#x2019;s largest nuclear facility &#x2014; effectively using it as a military base. After nearly three years of campaigns against Ukraine&#x2019;s energy system, Russia also began targeting the infrastructure near the country&#x2019;s nuclear power plants last year, putting their connection with the energy grid at risk. While Ukraine has gotten better at protecting its energy facilities since the attacks began, the strikes against nuclear-connected infrastructure represent a &#x201C;change in tactics,&#x201D; says Lapenko. As Russia struggles with ramping up its missile attacks against Ukraine, it may be looking for any avenue it can to ratchet up the pressure on Kyiv, said Hoffman. &#x201C;From a Russian perspective, you really want to bring home this message that Russia still has tools to increase the suffering of the Ukrainian people if they don&apos;t settle this conflict soon.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/nuclear-blackmail-russia-strikes-chornobyl-as-munich-security-conference-kicks-off/	2025-02-14T09:52:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Gjuo632XYAAqUi6-2.jpeg
Saudi Arabia ready to host proposed Trump-Putin summit	Saudi Arabia supported the proposal to hold a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Riyadh, the Saudi Foreign Ministry said on Feb. 14. The statement came days after Trump held separate calls with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He called Putin first on Feb. 12, saying later that the two leaders can meet in Saudi Arabia as part of efforts to negotiate an end to Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. &quot;The Kingdom (of Saudi Arabia) expresses its welcome to hosting the summit in Saudi Arabia, and reaffirms its ongoing efforts to achieve lasting peace between Russia and Ukraine,&quot; the ministry said. Saudi Arabia hosted an international summit on the peace formula in August 2023. The country has also played an important role in negotiating prisoner exchanges with Russia. At the same time, Riyadh has maintained close economic ties with Moscow, which have strengthened following the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Russia&apos;s subsequent economic isolation from the West. The extent of Ukraine&apos;s involvement in the U.S.-Russia talks remained unclear. President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14 that he is planning to visit Saudi Arabia, Turkey and United Arab Emirates to discuss other topics such as children kidnapped by Russia. Zelensky and Trump also agreed to begin working toward ending the war, according to Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office. Ukraine&apos;s president also said that he was ready to meet with Putin only after there is a joint plan with Trump and the EU. Kyiv insists that no talks about Ukraine and ending of Russia&apos;s all-out war should be held without Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/saudi-arabia-says-its-ready-to-host-trump-putin-summit/	2025-02-14T09:43:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2068280045.jpg
Ukraine needs 1.5 million-strong army in absence of NATO membership — Zelensky on alternative security guarantees	If Ukraine does not join NATO as part of a peace deal, it will need Western support to maintain an army of 1.5 million soldiers as deterrence agains a future Russian invasion, President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters on Feb. 14 at the Munich Security Conference. The remarks come amid ongoing uncertainty around possible alternative workable security guarantees for Ukraine given the reluctance of some NATO members to invite Ukraine to join the alliance. Previously floated ideas have included the presence of European troops on the ground in Ukraine, but without an open signal from Washington backing the idea, little progress has been made. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter what country these forces are from. In any case, we need 1.5 million troops if we are not in NATO,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;If we really want not to be afraid of a new occupation or a new Russian invasion, these are real security guarantees. (Vladimir) Putin will know that he has a 1.5 million army, and Ukraine has a 1.5 million army. If he wants to come and die (in Ukraine), he is welcome to do so,&quot; Zelensky added. Ukraine currently has 110 combat brigades, while Russia has 220, according to Zelensky. &quot;So, we need 220,&quot; he added. Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. While NATO members asserted at the 2024 summit in Washington, D.C., that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; they have yet to extend a formal invitation. Ukraine has relied on NATO member states for military aid in its defense against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Ukraine regularly holds visits and summits with NATO leaders.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-need-a-1-5-million-army-if-we-are-not-going-to-be-in-nato-zelensky-on-ukraines-membership-in-alliance/	2025-02-14T09:34:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/DSC06354------.jpg
Editorial: America is folding. Europe, will you step up?	The U.S. administration is ready to hand Russia a win in its brutal war against Ukraine. That&#x2019;s the only conclusion we can make after following the news this week. If anyone held onto hopes that U.S. President Donald Trump would be tough on Russia&#x2019;s Vladimir Putin, sorry to disappoint you. As the week unfolded, the world watched as Trump and his team &#x2014; a group of people who pride themselves on being artful dealmakers &#x2014; threw away any possible leverage they may have had over Russia. They brought Putin back to the table, took NATO off of Ukraine&#x2019;s, and said a return to pre-invasion borders was unrealistic. &#xA0; In other words, they gave Moscow exactly what it wanted before the negotiations even started. Here in Ukraine, that means we only have one hope remaining &#x2014; we need you, in Europe, to step up. The U.S. president seems to have made it his goal to indulge his Russian counterpart at every possible turn. He called Putin before Ukraine&#x2019;s President Volodymyr Zelensky, clearly showing his preference. He praised the Russian dictator and the &#x201C;great nation&#x201D; of Russia. He also promised Putin a meeting. Perhaps most notably, Trump refused to call Ukraine an equal partner in peace negotiations, and blamed Ukraine for &#x201C;going into the war,&#x201D; as if it was Ukraine&#x2019;s choice. He also demanded access to Ukraine&#x2019;s critical minerals, trying to use a battered ally&#x2019;s vulnerability to take something away from it. All of this happened ahead of the Munich Security Conference. There, on its first day, U.S. Vice President JD Vance offered no clarity on Trump&#x2019;s plans regarding the war, instead taking the stage to lecture the already anxious European allies about democracy. Watching it all happen from Ukraine was especially devastating. Being at the epicenter of the storm, having lived through three years of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war and all that comes with it, we now have to watch as Russia is about to not just get away with all of its crimes, but be rewarded for them. There is little use in trying to understand Trump and his team&#x2019;s words and actions now. They went beyond appeasement. Russian politicians, media, and public figures are loudly gloating and praising Trump, understandably so. We know very well that Trump and his team aren&#x2019;t speaking for all Americans. At the Kyiv Independent, we have a front-row seat in seeing how many regular Americans support Ukraine and donate to Ukrainian causes, including backing our publication. They are true supporters of justice and democracy, and there are plenty of them. However, the U.S. president is acting in their name, too. Trump&#x2019;s words and actions signal a change of course that is bleak for Ukraine and the free world. He acts like he isn&#x2019;t just going to let Russia win the war but is ready to help it win. So, is this it? No. Even the leader of the world&#x2019;s most powerful country can&#x2019;t single-handedly decide the outcome of this war. America may be the biggest and richest ally Ukraine has, but it&#x2019;s far from the only one. That means that, of course, all the eyes are on you, Europe. The real decision on whether Russia wins the war doesn&#x2019;t actually sit with Trump now &#x2014; it&#x2019;s with Europe. The EU and the U.K. have shown that they are capable of standing up to Russian aggression and backing Ukraine. Now they need to find the resolve to lead, not be led. The people of Europe need to demand from their leaders to speak up and step up, to counter the conceding direction taken by the U.S. administration. A good example of leadership was set by the U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who on Feb. 13 reiterated that Ukraine was on &#x201C;irreversible path to NATO&#x201D; and said it has to be &#x201C;at the heart&#x201D; of any peace discussions, countering the points of Trump and his team. Other leaders, including Germany&#x2019;s Olaf Scholz and France&#x2019;s Emmanuel Macron, have to join suit. If they truly have their people&#x2019;s interests at heart, and are real leaders of their nations and not political opportunists, they need to recognize the urgency of the situation, and act now. After all, if the U.S. is out, and Ukraine falls, Europe will be left to face Russia one-on-one. Almost exactly three years ago, when the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine was clearly coming, we called upon the world to stand up to Russia. Here&#x2019;s what was at the core of our call back then: &#x201C;This is not just about Ukraine. It&#x2019;s a clash of two worlds, two polar sets of values. If Putin wins, your world loses. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow &#x2013; but soon, and unquestionably.&#x201D; Those worlds are still true today. Russia isn&#x2019;t at war with Ukraine, it&#x2019;s at war with the West. And if a significant part of the West deserts, the rest needs to make sure to show up for battle. Nobody wants this war to end more than Ukrainians do. It&#x2019;s our homes that get attacked with drones every night. It&#x2019;s our friends who get killed in battle. It&#x2019;s our youth that&#x2019;s been stolen by this war. But we understand that any compromise with Russia won&#x2019;t be the end of the war. There can&#x2019;t be a compromise in this war. Russia wins &#x2013; the West loses. The West wins &#x2013; Russia loses. Europe, the time is now.	https://kyivindependent.com/editorial-america-folding-europe-will-you-step-up/	2025-02-14T09:16:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2161909058.jpg
10 Ukrainian drone makers to watch	In the three years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Ukraine has almost certainly become the largest producer of drones in the Western-aligned world. Early workshop tinkering on mainly commercial Chinese drones evolved into steadily more professional and massive production of domestic unmanned aerial systems (UAVs). The industry&#x2019;s rapid growth has given Ukraine a fighting chance against a much bigger enemy, making drones a source of national pride. &#xA0; Details on the drone industry and its producers are hard to come by. Russia constantly targets weapons factories and even drone executives personally. But some drone makers are already clearly big businesses. Based on knowledge both publicly and privately sourced, the Kyiv Independent has assembled a list of makers ranging from mass-produced first-person view (FPV) drones to highly secretive deep-strike UAVs that we believe to be the biggest game in town. Going forward, many of these drone makers hope to sell their wares abroad once export controls are lifted, or the war comes to an end. Those looking to sell abroad are keen to headline non-lethal drone models like intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) or cargo drones, which face fewer restrictions than those more clearly designed to blow things up. Here are 10 of Ukraine&#x2019;s drone makers to look out for, in no particular order: Taking its name from a paradise in pre-Christian Slavic mythology, Vyriy produces what one long-time drone pilot describes as the best FPV he&#x2019;s ever worked with, the Molfar. The small and cheap Molfar has been in use since at least the start of 2023. For massive &#xA0;FPV makers, what&#x2019;s tricky is producing swarms that function reliably. By reputation, Vyriy manages as well as anyone. Molfar drone. (Vyriy Drone / Facebook)The firm is working to onshore production but cites a continued financial dependence on Chinese components that afflicts the drone industry worldwide. Notably, Vyriy&#x2019;s drones operate on low-frequency channels. Prior to 2022, most drones ran on 2.4 or 5.8 gigahertz (GHz) communications. Those channels are easily jammed by Russian electronic warfare systems at the front, so many operators, including Vyriy, have lowered their frequencies to under 1 GHz, which transfers less data but goes further and is harder to both jam and detect. Despite keeping a lower profile among its fellow major Ukrainian drone makers, Skyfall has brought production to a massive scale since launching in June 2022. Skyfall&#x2019;s most beloved model is the Vampire, which first became famous under the name Russian soldiers have for it, the Baba Yaga, named for a fairytale witch. The moniker is due to the drone&#x2019;s ability to run night missions, particularly while bearing payloads of up to 15 kilograms &#x2014; over five times the standard for FPVs. Ukrainian soldiers from the Ukrainian military&apos;s 121st Brigade load a Vampire drone with an anti-tank mine to target Russian positions in Krasnohorivka, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on July 22, 2024. (Pablo Miranzo / Anadolu via Getty Images)One of Skyfall&#x2019;s biggest selling points is nocturnal navigation. It&#x2019;s a feature largely enabled by thermal cameras like those produced by Ukrainian company Oko (which means &#x201C;eye&#x201D; in Ukrainian), and one that has proved especially effective as many Russian units reportedly lack night-vision goggles. In drone footage from a Shrike &#x2014; Skyfall&#x2019;s smaller FPV model &#x2014; shared with the Kyiv Independent by a Ukrainian drone pilot, a Russian truck stands out clearly from the treeline it is hiding inside before the Shrike hurtles into its grill before the signal turns to static. Data from government contracts show the Shrikes selling for a little over Hr 13,000 in 2024, or about $320, making them some of the cheapest quadrocopters being purchased en masse inside of Ukraine. TAF is possibly the largest-scale manufacturer of FPV drones in Ukraine today, producing some 40,000 drones per month. Its output is valued at over $1 billion per year, according to Forbes Ukraine. TAF&#x2019;s drones are fairly standard cheap quadrocopters that flock over the front line in Ukraine. TAF emerged from a charity fund run by now-CEO Oleksandr Yakovenko, which was already producing drone parts to be assembled by soldiers by early 2023. TAF&#x2019;s surge in production over the past year has been quite stunning. Kolibry 7. (TAF)If true, 40,000 a month would account for about a third of the 1.5 million drones that the Defense Ministry said Ukrainian makers shipped to the frontline in 2024. One billion dollars in orders would be a similarly massive fraction of Ukraine&#x2019;s total drone budget &#x2014; approximately $2.5 billion in 2025, not including money that individual brigades raise in donations. By many accounts the archetypical Ukrainian drone maker, UkrSpec dates back to 2014, when it was founded in response to Russia&#x2019;s initial annexation of Crimea and invasion of Donbas. UkrSpec has produced many models over the years, but almost exclusively of the highly engineered repeated-use variety &#x2014; specifically intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The Shark, long-range ISR drone. (Nazar Korovai / Wikimedia)The Shark is a long-range ISR drone that largely set the standard for the genre within Ukraine. The &#x201C;People&#x2019;s Drone,&#x201D; or PD-2, is similar but can carry cargo up to 8 kilograms &#x2014; in theory, anything including a few artillery shells &#x2014; with a range of up to 1,300 kilometers. Avia Atlon is another firm that dates back to 2014. Its bread-and-butter model is the Furia, a long-range recon drone that the firm began exporting abroad prior to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. They were selling the Furia for just over $100,000 in 2022, per the accounting of local charity Come Back Alive. The most recent Furia model is a massive ISR drone that resembles a white manta ray and is specially designed to scout targets from up high for Ukrainian artillery. Ukrainian 24th brigade&apos;s A1-S Furia UAV. (Wikimedia)Far cheaper is Avia Atlon&#x2019;s Hrim, also known as Silent Thunder, which is a smaller kamikaze drone that remains more intricate than the average FPV drone of its class as it depends on a reusable quadrocopter for liftoff. Another of the founding fathers of what would become Ukraine&#x2019;s wartime drone boom, UkrJet shares some overlap in leadership with UkrSpec. Unlike UkrSpec, UkrJet is most famous for its actual explosive models.

Terminal Autonomy is a relatively low-profile, internationally owned, Ukraine-based firm that nonetheless ships upwards of 1,000 of its AQ 100s and an unknown number of its deep-strike AQ 400s each month. At $30,000 and a range of 750 kilometers, the AQ 400s are likely the cheapest long-distance strike drones on the market. To cut costs, their drones are made of plywood.

In addition to wooden frames, their fixed-wing design means they only need a single motor, unlike quadrocopters which, while more maneuverable, require four. The largest traditional aircraft maker in Ukraine, Antonov is often overlooked in considerations of drone manufacturers. Given its standing ties to Ukraine&#x2019;s government-owned weapons makers, it had little reason to advertise. Among drones, Antonov is most notable for its &#x201C;Lyuty&#x201D; drone, a long-range model roughly analogous to the Iranian-made Shaheds that Russia sends into Ukraine nightly. Ukraine&#x2019;s long-range strike drones are typically tightly held secrets within Ukraine&#x2019;s drone programs. But Russian sources frequently identify Lyuty drones as those striking local oil infrastructure. Screenshot from a video allegedly showing the launch of AN-196 Lyuty. (X)Long a government-owned defense manufacturer, Antonov formally transitioned into a private holding in April 2024. Its ties to Ukraine&#x2019;s Soviet-descended, state-owned defense conglomerate, UkrOboronProm, remain well-established. The pricing on a single Lyuty comes in at just under $200,000 a unit. Airlogix is a large-scale drone maker that has seen massive growth since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Pre-2022, Airlogix launched with a hefty cargo drone.

Skyeton&#x2019;s Raybird is a hyper-advanced ISR drone whose latest models boast max flight times of 28 hours. A Raybird system, which includes three separate drones, sells for over $1 million a piece.

Director of popular Ukrainian online casino detained over company ties to Russia	Ukraine&#x2019;s State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) has detained the director of popular online casino Pin-Up over its alleged Russian ownership and business in Russia, the agency announced in a press release on Feb. 14. An ongoing investigation into the company earlier found that its real owners were Russian citizens. The owners allegedly collected personal data and information about the location of Pin-Up&#x2019;s users, including Ukrainian military personnel. In early December, the SBI announced that it suspected the beneficial owners and top managers of Pin-Up of collaborating with Russia. According to Ukrainian law adopted in response to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, companies owned by Russia or Russian citizens can no longer operate in Ukraine and are subject to sanctions or confiscation by the state. The SBI did not name the director in its press release, but said he is being detained on suspicions of &#x201C;aiding the aggressor state.&#x201D; According to Ukrainian monitoring service Opendatabot, Pin-Up Ukraine is owned by a company called Ukr Game Technology, and Oleksii Popenko serves as its director. During the investigation, Pin-Up was found to have ties to both representatives of Russia and entities subject to sanctions in Ukraine, and continued allowing access to its site in Russia, and in Russian-occupied territories. The SBI also said that a &#x201C;person who controls the online casino&#x2019;s work&#x201D; has been financing an organization that helped Russian veterans who fought in Ukraine after the start of the full-scale war. In May, the Pecherskyi Court in Kyiv seized the accounts of Pin-Up&apos;s online casino. It later approved the transfer of over Hr 2.6 billion ($62.5 million) of the company&apos;s seized assets to Ukraine&apos;s Asset Recovery and Management Agency. The pre-trial investigation is ongoing, and other involved parties are being identified, the SBI said in its Feb. 14 press release. Gambling was officially banned in Ukraine in 2009 until its legalization in 2020. The negative impacts of gambling, especially on the Ukrainian soldiers, became a topic of public discussion in the spring of 2024 as a petition demanding restrictions on online gambling reached the president&apos;s table in March. On April 20, President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree restricting online gambling and banning it for military personnel during martial law.	https://kyivindependent.com/director-of-popular-ukrainian-online-casino-detained-over-company-ties-to-russia/	2025-02-14T08:27:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2149356635.jpg
Peace deal can't be signed in Munich' — Zelensky sets out condition for talks with Putin	Ukraine is not talking about any peace deal now, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14. &quot;Today, we are not talking about any peace agreement. Frankly to say, it is unfortunate,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;The war has been going on for three years, there have been many deaths, much has been destroyed, especially lives. All this was brought by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and him alone.&quot; The president said that Ukraine needs the firm support of the U.S. and a &quot;strong&quot; President Donald Trump, who will be on Kyiv&apos;s side. His remarks came days after Trump held separate calls with Putin and Zelensky. Trump called Putin first on Feb. 12, saying later that the two leaders agreed that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will start &quot;immediately.&quot; According to Zelensky, a peace deal &quot;can only be about a plan to end the war&quot; which should be agreed between Ukraine and the U.S. president, and backed by both sides. He also reiterated the importance of Europe&apos;s role in the potential deal. &quot;A peace deal cannot be signed in Munich because it is Munich. We remember what things were signed here. I do not repeat such things,&quot; Zelensky added, recalling the infamous Munich meeting when Germany, the U.K., France, and Italy came to an agreement that allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland in western Czechoslovakia. Zelensky said he was ready to meet with the Russian president only after there is a joint plan with Trump and the EU. &quot;I am ready to meet only in this case. And we will sit down with Putin and stop the war,&quot; Zelensky said. A day earlier, Kremlin claimed that Russia has started forming a group for talks with the U.S., including on the war with Ukraine. Zelensky and Trump also agreed to begin working toward ending Russia&apos;s war, according to Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office.	https://kyivindependent.com/peace-deal-cant-be-signed-in-munich-zelensky-sets-out-condition-for-talks-with-putin/	2025-02-14T08:19:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2194672448.jpg
NATO member turning pro-Russia? Inside Slovakia’s political turmoil	Slovakia, a landlocked country on Ukraine&#x2019;s western border, is undergoing a dramatic political shift under Prime Minister Robert Fico. Once a staunch supporter of NATO and the EU, Slovakia has now moved toward a pro-Russian stance, halting military aid to Ukraine and opposing EU sanctions against the Kremlin. As Fico meets with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and cracks down on opposition voices at home, protests are erupting across the country. Tens of thousands of Slovaks have taken to the streets, fearing that their democracy is at risk.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-member-turning-pro-russia-inside-slovakias-political-turmoil/	2025-02-14T07:40:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Bratislava-Report--3-.jpg
Russia abandons modernization of power plants due to lack of money, equipment, media reports	The Russian government has allowed several companies to abandon the modernization of over a dozen power plants across the country due to a lack of funding and equipment, Russian news agency Interfax reported on Feb. 14, citing an order published on the governmental website the day prior. Though Russian officials have largely dismissed the impact of Western sanctions imposed over the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, warning signs about the state of Russia&apos;s economy continue to mount coming into 2025. Tatneft Thermal Power Plant in Nizhnekamensk was removed from the list of modernization projects, and its renovation was postponed until 2027. Avtozavodskaya and Quadra combined heat and power plants, located in Nizhny Novgorod and Voronezh oblasts, respectively, were also excluded. Reasons for the decision included rising equipment prices, which would threaten the company&apos;s financial stability, and the recognition that the project was not profitable due to the cost of turbines, according to the document. Russia&apos;s Territorial Generation Company No. 2 , which supplies Arkhangelsk, Vologda, Kostroma, Novgorod, and Yaroslavl oblasts, was allowed not to renovate its power plants in Kostroma and Yaroslavl due to financing difficulties. The company originally planned to obtain funds for the projects from Russia&apos;s Alfa Bank but was unable to agree on loans, the news agency reported. The Russian government approved the modernization project&apos;s abandonment of the Nevinnomysskaya Condensing Power Plant in Stavropol Krai, the cost of which had reportedky risen by 454%. Russia&apos;s Siberian Generating Company was also relieved of requirements to modernize four power plants in Siberia. The company will have to pay about 2 billion rubles ($22 million) for the projects to be phased out. The Second Generation Company of the Wholesale Electricity Market, owned by Russian energy giant Gazprom, was also released from its obligations to renovate its power plant in the city of Surgut due to a 16-month delay in equipment deliveries. Billionaire Viktor Vekselberg&apos;s T Plus was also allowed not to modernize the plants he owned in Izhevsk and Samara. The combined effect of sanctions and inflation is beginning to threaten the Russian economy in various sectors, including automotive, aviation, and retail. This development comes amid a growing push by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to launch negotiations in Ukraine as soon as possible, though Moscow has shown little interest in peace talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-government-allows-companies-not-to-modernize-power-plants-due-to-lack-of-money-equipment-media-reports/	2025-02-14T07:28:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197181481.jpg
Putin assembling veteran negotiators for talks on ending Ukraine war, Bloomberg reports	Russian President Vladimir Putin is assembling a team of veteran negotiators to engage with U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s representatives in potential talks to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 14, citing sources familiar with the matter. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed on Feb. 13 that Moscow has begun forming a delegation for negotiations with the United States, following a phone call between Putin and Trump. Putin&apos;s team will reportedly include Yuriy Ushakov, his longtime foreign policy aide and former Russian ambassador to the U.S.; Sergey Naryshkin, director of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR); and Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and a close associate of Putin&apos;s youngest daughter, Katerina Tikhonova. Ushakov has been involved in Russian diplomatic efforts for decades and participated in previous negotiations with Ukraine in 2022. Dmitriev has played a role in diplomatic exchanges, including the recent release of American teacher Marc Fogel from Russian detention, according to Reuters. Naryshkin, a longtime Putin ally who first met the Russian leader in the KGB in the 1980s, has headed the SVR since 2016 and was also part of Russia&apos;s 2022 negotiations with Ukraine. Other members of the Kremlin&apos;s 2022 negotiating team may later join, with Putin&apos;s aide Vladimir Medinsky potentially playing a role in talks involving Ukrainian representatives, according to Bloomberg&apos;s sources. Moscow and Kyiv engaged in direct negotiations in Belarus and Turkey during the early months of the full-scale invasion, but those talks ultimately failed. No formal direct discussions between the two sides have taken place since then. Trump has tasked his own delegation, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, to lead negotiations. The Kremlin has repeatedly emphasized that it views the U.S. as its &quot;main counterpart&quot; in efforts to end the war. Zelensky said that he wants European allies to be involved in peace negotiations. Kyiv insists that no talks about Ukraine and ending Russia&apos;s war should be held without Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/putins-war-negotiation-team-reportedly-includes-foreign-policy-aid-intelligence-chief/	2025-02-14T05:44:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198662707.jpg
Ukraine opens criminal cases against ex-President Poroshenko, sanctioned oligarchs, businessmen	Prosecutor General&apos;s Office announced on Feb. 14 that criminal proceedings have been opened against businessmen and former high-ranking officials recently sanctioned by the National Security and Defense Council (NSDC). The list includes oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky, billionaire Konstantin Zhevago, former PrivatBank co-owner Hennadiy Boholyubov, Ukraine&apos;s 5th President Petro Poroshenko, and former pro-Russian lawmaker Viktor Medvedchuk. &quot;Each of these five individuals is being held criminally liable for committing serious and especially serious crimes,&quot; the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said in a post on Telegram. Poroshenko was charged in 2021 with high treason and aiding terrorist organizations for allegedly conspiring with Russian-backed separatists between November 2014 and January 2015. The scheme reportedly generated over Hr 3 billion ($72 million) in profits from coal supplies. He said the decision to impose sanctions against him was politically motivated and unconstitutional. Medvedchuk faces charges of high treason and violations of war laws, accused of helping Russia seize a Ukrainian oil and gas field in the Black Sea&apos;s Kerch Shelf. He is also accused of passing secret military information, including the locations of Ukrainian military units, and creating a pro-Russian influence network in Ukraine. Kolomoisky is under investigation for embezzling over Hr 5.36 billion ($129 million) from a financial institution and laundering nearly Hr 4.1 billion ($99 million). He is suspected of orchestrating the contract killing of a legal company director who refused to annul a decision regarding a shareholders&apos; meeting. Zhevago is suspected of embezzling $113 million and misappropriating Hr 608 million ($15 million) from a Ukrainian bank through a conspiracy with bank officials. This illegal transfer of funds to offshore accounts caused major financial losses to the institution. He is also under investigation for involvement in a criminal organization and money laundering. Boholyubov is being investigated for illegal possession of another person&apos;s passport and organizing an unlawful border crossing with the help of a border guard. He is wanted by Ukrainian authorities for his role in aiding illegal border crossings. The sanctions freeze all assets held by the targeted individuals in Ukraine and block them from conducting financial transactions, among other restrictions. The decree states that the measures are indefinite.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-opens-criminal-cases-against-ex-president-poroshenko-sanctioned-oligarchs-businessmen/	2025-02-14T05:05:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2182521653.jpg
Ukraine repatriates 757 bodies of fallen soldiers	Ukraine brought back the bodies of 757 soldiers who died fighting against Russia, the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of the Prisoners of War announced on Feb. 14. The bodies were recovered from the Pokrovsk, Bakhmut, Vuhledar, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia sectors of the front. The operation to recover the bodies involved several government and military agencies, including the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the Interior Ministry, the State Emergency Service, and the Armed Forces. The headquarters also thanked the International Committee of the Red Cross for its assistance. In December 2024, Ukraine repatriated the bodies of 503 fallen soldiers, mostly from Donetsk Oblast. Last month, Ukraine repatriated the bodies of 757 soldiers from several oblasts.President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 8 that about 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed during the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-repatriates-757-bodies-of-fallen-soldiers/	2025-02-14T04:28:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/2025-02-14-14_24_28.jpg
Zelensky warns of Russian military buildup, potential NATO threat in 2026	Russia is preparing for a major military escalation, potentially targeting NATO countries next year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a press conference in Munich on Feb. 14. Zelensky said that Russia plans to deploy 15 divisions, totaling 100,000 to 150,000 troops, primarily in Belarus. While the buildup could focus on Ukraine, he cautioned that Russian forces might shift toward Poland or the Baltics, raising concerns about a broader conflict with NATO. &quot;Based on all the information I&apos;ve gathered from intelligence and other sources, I think he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) is preparing for war against NATO countries next year,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;It&apos;s just a large group. And I&apos;m not sure this group will move towards Ukraine.&quot; In a Feb. 12 interview with The Guardian, Zelensky underscored that Europe&apos;s security depends on Ukraine&apos;s continued resistance to Russian aggression. According to Zelensky, Ukraine fields 110 brigades, while Russia has 220 brigades and plans to expand to 250 this year. Europe, including U.S. troops stationed there, has only about 82 combat brigades. Ukraine&apos;s military consists of 880,000 soldiers, tasked with defending the entire country against the 600,000 Russian troops concentrated in specific areas, the president said on Jan. 15	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-warns-of-russian-military-buildup-potential-nato-threat-in-2026/	2025-02-14T03:31:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161013738.jpg
Orban sees Russia's 'reintegration' into world economy, Europe's energy after Ukraine deal	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Feb. 14 that Russia would be reintegrated into the world economy and Europe&apos;s energy system once a peace deal is reached in the Russia-Ukraine war, Reuters reported. &quot;If the U.S. president comes and creates peace, there is a deal, I think Russia will be reintegrated into the world economy... the European security system and even the European economic and energy system, that will give a huge boost to the Hungarian economy,&quot; Orban said. &quot;We will win a lot with a peace deal,&quot; he added. The Hungarian prime minister&apos;s comments follow Trump&apos;s Feb. 12 call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The two leaders reportedly spoke for 90 minutes, and Putin invited Trump to Moscow. Orban, widely regarded as the EU&apos;s most Russia-friendly leader, has consistently opposed sanctions on Moscow and criticized military aid for Ukraine, arguing it prolongs the war. Trump also announced that he and Putin would hold their first in-person meeting in Saudi Arabia. Asked whether Ukraine would be part of the negotiations, Trump later told reporters, &quot;Yes, of course.&quot; Orban has previously called on the EU to lift sanctions on Russia, arguing they harm European economies more than Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-to-rejoin-global-economy-europes-energy-system-after-russia-ukraine-peace-deal-orban-says/	2025-02-14T03:19:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/viki.jpg
4,000 North Korean casualties in Russia's Kursk Oblast, 2/3 killed, Zelensky says	North Korean troops fighting for Russia against Ukraine have suffered 4,000 casualties, two-thirds of whom have been killed, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 14. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky said the morale of Pyongyang&apos;s troops had been &quot;broken&quot; by the losses, a Kyiv Independent journalist reported from the event. &quot;We understand that their losses are more than four thousand. I think two-thirds have died,&quot; he added. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in early August 2024. Zelensky&apos;s claim of the number killed is significantly higher than a Jan. 13 estimate from &#xA0;South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) which said at least 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and another 2,700 wounded. Zelensky also said 2,000-3,000 more troops are being transferred from North Korea to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, saying it was important that U.S. President Donald Trump takes note of such developments as he tries to bring Moscow to the negotiating table. The heavy losses of the North Korean army may be related to its lack of combat experience and the tactic of human waves attacks with a limited amount of equipment, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said in an interview with The War Zone magazine published on Feb. 4. According to Budanov, North Korean soldiers attack &quot;almost without any combat vehicles.&quot; Budanov also suggested that the North Korean military is so willing to advance on foot against Ukrainian drones and artillery because of its loyalty to North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. He added their disregard for personal safety makes Ukraine&apos;s defense more challenging.	https://kyivindependent.com/4-000-north-korean-casualties-in-kursk-oblast-2-3-killed-zelensky-says/	2025-02-14T03:11:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029632286.jpg
Zelensky-Vance meeting postponed as US reviews Ukraine's partnership draft	Editor&apos;s note: This story has been updated with a comment from President Volodymyr Zelensky. The meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the Munich Security Conference has been postponed to allow the U.S. time to review a draft memorandum of partnership submitted by Kyiv, a source in the Zelensky&apos;s Office told the Kyiv Independent on Feb. 14. The postponement comes as the U.S. considers a proposed minerals agreement that could link future aid to Ukraine with access to its rare earth mineral reserves. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered a draft of the agreement to Zelensky during a visit to Kyiv on Feb. 12. Ukraine finalized and handed over the memorandum to the U.S. side, which requested additional time to review the document until 5 p.m. During his press conference, Zelensky confirmed that the meeting with Vance would take place later in the day. The draft memorandum is part of broader discussions on a potential minerals agreement, which U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested could involve access to Ukraine&apos;s mineral reserves in exchange for continued military and financial support. Zelensky has expressed openness to such an arrangement, saying that Ukraine is willing to grant U.S. companies access to minerals in exchange for sustained support from Washington. The proposed minerals agreement could mark a significant shift in U.S.-Ukraine relations, tying economic cooperation to security assistance.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-vance-meeting-postponed-as-us-reviews-ukraines-partnership-draft/	2025-02-14T02:21:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1843522320.jpg
Sudan to allow Russia to build its first naval base in Africa	Sudan will allow Russia to build its first naval base in Africa, the country&apos;s foreign minister, Ali Youssef, said during a visit to Moscow on Feb. 12. &quot;Sudan and Russia have reached an understanding on the agreement regarding the Russian naval base,&quot; Youssef said during a press briefing with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov. &quot;The matter is very simple. We have agreed on everything,&quot; he added. The naval base &#x2014; which has been under discussion since 2017 &#x2014; would give Moscow access to the Red Sea, one of the world&#x2019;s most strategically important waterways through which 12% of global trade passes through due to the presence of the Suez Canal at its northern end. China and the U.S. already have access to the sea as they both hold naval bases in Djibouti to the south of Sudan. The announcement comes after the future of Russia&apos;s naval presence in the Mediterranean was thrown into question after the overthrow of former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in December. Russia began withdrawing assets from Syria, raising doubts about the future of its military presence in the country. Syria&apos;s new government will decide the fate of Russian military bases based on national interests, Syrian Defense Minister Murhaf Abu Qasra told The Washington Post on Feb. 6. Russia&apos;s ability to retain its naval base in Tartus and airbase in Khmeimim will depend on what Moscow offers in return, Abu Qasra indicated. &quot;If we benefit Syria from it, yes,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/sudan-to-allow-russia-to-build-its-first-naval-base-in-africa/	2025-02-14T02:19:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2190592959.jpg
3 lessons from Minsk II for the US in a future Russia-Ukraine peace deal	The following op-ed is based on a broader report by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), published on Feb. 11, 2025. Some peace deals lead to peace; others lead to more war. The Minsk II deal, aimed at ending Russia&#x2019;s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014, instead laid the groundwork for Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022. The United States must learn from the Minsk deal or risk a direct Russia-NATO conflict that puts American lives at risk. Minsk II was a weak deal. It demanded nothing of the invader &#x2014; Russia. It reinforced the Kremlin&#x2019;s aggressive worldview that had driven the conflict to begin with, masking Russia&#x2019;s military weakness. It gave the Kremlin time and space to prepare for a larger invasion. The West could have helped Ukraine reach a stronger deal in 2015. Minsk II gave Russian President Vladimir Putin hope that he could win in Ukraine without war. Russia sought and failed to control Ukraine in 2014 through military means. Minsk II gave Putin a way to demand that Ukraine &#x2014; a sovereign state &#x2014; cede control over its internal policies. When that failed, Putin turned to the full-scale invasion in 2022. Minsk II helped Putin mask his demands for Ukraine&#x2019;s surrender behind false calls for peace. The West has repeatedly failed to confront and counter the real Russian demands since 2014. Minsk II reinforced Western delusions that Putin might settle if he received some land or if the West scaled back support for Ukraine or tried harder to negotiate with him. The deal also provided an excuse for those who understood the Kremlin&#x2019;s goals but still sought to restore ties with Russia. Vladislav Surkov, Putin&#x2019;s close adviser in 2014, said in 2024 that Minsk II &#x201C;legitimized the first partition of Ukraine.&#x201D; Surkov&#x2019;s words confirm Russia&#x2019;s goal to destroy Ukraine as a state and use the Minsk deal to achieve that. He added that &#x201C;peace is nothing more than the continuation of war by other means.&#x201D; Another weak deal today would validate Putin&#x2019;s 2022 invasion and give him hope of gaining more over time. Hope for Putin means more war. More war means a larger conflict: A Russia absolved of any cost for its invasion will want more and rebuild its ability to do so. A larger war would raise costs for the U.S., put American lives at risk, and escalate the conflict to catastrophic levels. The Trump administration has a historic opportunity to break Russia&#x2019;s cycle of overt war and war by &#x201C;peace&#x201D; in Ukraine. To do so, the U.S. must learn the lessons from the Minsk deal. Russia will aim to shift the blame for and cost of its war of choice in Ukraine, as it did with the Minsk II deal. The Kremlin will blame the U.S., NATO, Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Western defense industrial complex, Anglo-Saxons with their &#x201C;aggressive intentions,&#x201D; as the Russian Foreign Ministry puts it, and others. Russia will attempt to offload the cost of the destruction it caused in Ukraine onto someone else&#x2019;s balance sheet &#x2014; be it Ukraine, the U.S., or other Ukrainian partners. The starting U.S. position should be that Russia owns the problem it created. Anything less than a demand for Russia to foot the trillion-dollar bill for the damage it caused and to restore the borders of Ukraine that Russia formally recognized in 1991 and 1994 should be framed as a major concession to Putin. Negotiations that start with preemptive concessions on these demands, without insisting on parallel Russian concessions, would repeat the central mistake of the Minsk deal. The U.S. must make Russia own the problem it created, both for the sake of a just peace and out of pure pragmatism. There is no reason someone else should cover the bill for Russia&#x2019;s war. Russia&#x2019;s war of choice killed and wounded an estimated million people. Russia caused an estimated half a trillion to a trillion dollars in damage to Ukraine and billions to the U.S. and other partner nations. Russia robbed three &#x2014; and in some cases, 11 &#x2014; years from the lives of Ukrainians. Russia cost countless hours and energy from people in the U.S. and globally working to end Russia&#x2019;s war. Russia chose to start this war for no legitimate reason, and it can choose to end it at any point. Ukraine did not pose a threat to Russia. Putin thought Ukraine was so militarily weak that he could conquer it in a matter of days in 2022. Russia was not seriously concerned with a military threat from NATO, as evidenced by Russia&#x2019;s military posture for years before 2022 and even during its war in Ukraine. Putin had effectively blocked Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO accession by 2022. Putin did not invade to protect Russian speakers in Ukraine &#x2014; Russian forces are killing Russian speakers at scale in Ukraine. There were no legitimate &#x201C;casus belli&#x201D; &#x2014; only Putin&#x2019;s desire to control Ukraine. Russia can stop its war at any point. Russian troops can simply withdraw from Ukraine. Russia will still exist as a state without Ukraine. Another deal that absolves Russia will lead to a larger war with higher costs for the U.S. A deal that lets Russia keep its illegal gains in Ukraine at no cost will reinforce the mindset that drove Russia to invade, bringing close to zero the chances of a Russia compatible with U.S. interests, Ukraine&#x2019;s existence, and a peaceful Europe. Minsk 3.0 would create a Russia that will want even more and will be able to do more. The Russia of 2025 is not the Russia of 2022. Russia in 2022 was expansionist enough to attack its neighbor without provocation and kill thousands &#x2014; only to fail to achieve its declared war aims three years later. U.S. President Donald Trump arrives to speak to the media at a press conference on the second day of the 2018 NATO Summit in Brussels, Belgium, on July 12, 2018. (Sean Gallup / Getty Images)Putin has transformed Russian society to support military conquest over three years of war. He has empowered Russian ultranationalists who believe in expansion by force. Putin has promoted these ultranationalists to prominent positions within Russia. Russian ultranationalists are inherently anti-American. They see Russia as being at war with the U.S.-led collective West for the new world order. They are committed to sustaining the war indefinitely and advocate for the permanent mobilization of the Russian people and the means to fight the West. The U.S. would not only face a stronger Putin or Putinist regime (or worse) but a stronger, battle-forged Russian military that is experienced in fighting a NATO-supplied adversary, has a better starting position on the battlefield compared to February 2022, and has stronger ties with China, Iran, and North Korea. Putin is hardly eager to return over half a million violent Russian men deployed to Ukraine back to Russia. He will likely seek to redirect their energy elsewhere if the lines in Ukraine are frozen with no constraints on Russian forces or the Kremlin&#x2019;s choices. If an emboldened and more capable Russia invades Ukraine to complete the conquest, it will cost more Ukrainian lives and very likely bring the Russian military closer to NATO borders, increasing the risk of a direct NATO-Russia conflict. The U.S. risks a larger war with higher costs and higher escalation risks on conditions that favor Russia. The only way to break the vicious cycle of Russian wars is not to absolve Russia of responsibility and force Russia to own the problem it created. The Kremlin will falsely insist that Ukraine is not sovereign. Russia will try to make a deal directly with the U.S. (if Putin considers a deal at all). The Kremlin will falsely insist that Zelensky is not legitimate and demand that Ukraine hold elections that violate its constitution. Putin will embed provisions to destroy Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty into any deal. Putin has already laid out preconditions and poison pills for even sitting down at the table. He is demanding limits on Ukraine&#x2019;s freedom to choose its partners and Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to defend itself (e.g., demanding that Ukraine limit the size of its military). Russia&#x2019;s negotiators will engineer ways to control the physical enforcement mechanism in any deal. The Kremlin needs to preserve options to escalate the war at will. Putin will try to do what he tried (and failed) to do via Minsk II &#x2014; legitimize the Kremlin&#x2019;s invasion without any security guarantees to Ukraine. Putin&#x2019;s individual demands &#x2014; territory, neutrality, elections, and others &#x2014; are irrelevant. Putin&#x2019;s demands are proxies for Russia&#x2019;s actual goals: controlling Ukraine and having the U.S. and NATO cede their principles and interests to accommodate a world order that favors Russia. The U.S. should deprive Putin of the hope that he can achieve either. This war can only end when Russia knows it cannot win militarily or through another &#x201C;peace&#x201D; deal.

(Yan Dobronosov / Global Images Ukraine / Getty Images)The U.S. should focus on conditions compatible with Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty and U.S. interests &#x2014; rather than discussing lines on the map. The U.S. should reject direct U.S.-Russia talks or Putin&#x2019;s demands regarding Ukraine&#x2019;s domestic affairs, including elections, or any other demand that limits Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty. Conceding to Putin&#x2019;s demands before talks would be a self-imposed failure. Any deal that gives Putin hope to control Ukraine will fail, as Minsk did. A deal that does not give Putin hope to control Ukraine is not a deal that Putin will accept &#x2014; unless this deal is imposed on him through a battlefield defeat, a severe degradation of Russian military capability, or a credible deterrent. A deterrent that has a chance to deter Russia requires a capable military force immune to Western political cycles and Russian influence. That is a tall order. Anything short of that, however, will not be viewed as a deterrent by Russia, will be co-opted by Russia, and will lead to another war. A UN-brokered enforcement mechanism is a non-starter, for example, because of Russia&#x2019;s veto power in the UN Security Council. A credible deterrent is impossible without a strong defense industrial base (DIB) in the West and Ukraine. The West&#x2019;s weak DIB gives Putin hope. The Kremlin has exploited the fact that Europe&#x2019;s DIB could not surge in support of Ukraine and that the U.S. could have but lacked the will to fill the void. A state&#x2019;s DIB is a proxy for its will. Depriving Putin of hope to subjugate Ukraine in his lifetime requires a strong Western and Ukrainian DIB able to alter the assumptions of Russian military planning. Putin will try to convince U.S. leaders that making him accept less than his goals in Ukraine is a non-starter. He will try to convince the U.S. that this war is unwinnable or that U.S. support will not matter, will only prolong the war, or is too risky. Russia will draw the next set of red lines. Putin can be made to accept a loss without escalating. He settled for less than his aims in Ukraine in 2014 and in 2022. Ukraine defeated Russia at the Battle of Kyiv and expelled Russian forces from critical terrain in Ukraine in 2022. Russian authorities claimed Russia would be in Kherson &#x201C;forever,&#x201D; but they withdrew in 2022. Putin was forced to accept Ukraine&#x2019;s incursion in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast in 2024 &#x2014; the first invasion of Russia since World War II. Putin reportedly ordered the Russian forces to liberate Kursk by October 2024 &#x2014; a mission failure as of February 2025. Russia&#x2019;s decade of gains in Syria is at risk. Russian military basing and political influence in Syria were key to Russia&#x2019;s power in the Middle East, Mediterranean, and Africa, a pillar of its cooperation with Iran, and a way to contest the U.S. and pressure NATO&#x2019;s southern flank. A decade of Putin&#x2019;s work is at the mercy of HTS &#x2014; militants whom Russia used to call terrorists but can no longer because HTS holds Moscow at its mercy. Each time Putin accepted a setback, the new reality was not &#x201C;negotiated&#x201D; with Putin&#x2014;it was imposed on him by force. The U.S. will eventually recognize that the only way to have Russia accept a deal is to impose one on Russia. The U.S. should not distract itself by providing Putin an &#x201C;offramp.&#x201D; Putin has an offramp &#x2014; the Kremlin&#x2019;s control of Russia&#x2019;s information space. The Kremlin reframed or downplayed Putin&apos;s humiliating setbacks &#x2014; from Russia&#x2019;s retreat from Kherson to Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin&#x2019;s mutiny to the degradation and expulsion of the Black Sea fleet from Crimea, and countless others. This information control allowed Putin to normalize a new and worse reality in Russia each time, including softening the blow for an estimated 800,000 Russian casualties in pursuit of arguably mediocre battlefield results in Ukraine.

(Artem Priakhin / SOPA Images / Getty Images)Putin and Russia have failed before. There is no compelling reason why Putin should not be made to fail again. And if the information offramp eventually fails him, that is not the U.S.&#x2019; problem. Putin is not invulnerable. This war is not lost, despite Russia&#x2019;s increased but still modest gains in eastern Ukraine. While Russia has well-documented advantages, Putin is also accumulating risks and costs. His military faces material and manpower shortages, ongoing issues with force generation, and economic strains &#x2014; including inflation, labor shortages, the erosion of Russia&#x2019;s sovereign wealth fund, and increasingly costly trade-offs between funneling limited manpower to the frontlines or shoring up the economy. Russia also depends on partners to sustain its war effort, and shifting U.S. policies toward China and Iran are putting those enabling relationships at risk. None of this will matter, however, if a Trump administration gifts Russia the time and space to regroup &#x2014; just as the Biden administration&#x2019;s incremental approach has allowed Putin to in the past. As Minsk II helped obscure Russian failures in 2015, a premature deal now risks letting Putin off the hook before he faces hard choices and mounting pressures &#x2014; before Ukraine and the U.S. attain a true position of strength. The Kremlin will face mounting costs if the U.S. and its partners apply maximum pressure &#x2014; something they have yet to do since Putin&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Washington still has many underutilized tools to ratchet up pressure on Russia, from striking harder at its energy sector to targeting the Kremlin across multiple theaters and domains. But the most effective driver of Russia&#x2019;s economic losses remains its sustained battlefield defeats. Maximum pressure on Russia is impossible without U.S. military support for Ukraine. The U.S. and its partners must ensure the Kremlin faces compounding pressure &#x2014; on the battlefield and beyond &#x2014; without easy ways to offset it.

US judge orders temporary lift Trump administration's freeze on foreign aid	A federal judge ordered the Trump administration on Feb. 13 to temporarily lift its funding freeze on U.S. foreign aid programs, including development work worldwide, the Associated Press reported. The ruling marks a significant setback for the administration&apos;s effort to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk have accused of operating outside the administration&apos;s agenda. Musk, who heads the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has called USAID a &quot;criminal organization&quot; and advocated for its dissolution. Judge Amir Ali issued the order in response to a lawsuit filed by the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council, representing health organizations that receive U.S. funding for international projects. The Trump administration ordered a 90-day freeze on nearly all foreign assistance upon taking office, placing USAID under State Department control last week. Crews were seen removing its signage from the agency&apos;s Washington headquarters on Feb. 7. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Feb. 4 that U.S. foreign aid should align with national interests rather than function as charity, emphasizing that assistance programs would not be eliminated. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support to Kyiv. The agency has funded school reconstruction, bomb shelters, critical energy repairs, and civil society programs.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-judge-orders-temporary-lift-trump-administrations-freeze-on-foreign-aid/	2025-02-14T00:55:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185934538.jpg
US aid to Ukraine could become 'carrot or stick' in talks with Russia, Hegseth says	U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth did not rule out that future U.S. aid to Ukraine could become a bargaining tool in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war, CNN reported on Feb. 13. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, Hegseth said that U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration continues to deliver the allocated security assistance to Ukraine but hinted that future funding could be conditional. &quot;I think it would be fair to say that things like future funding, either less or more, could be on the table in negotiations as well,&quot; Hegseth said. He emphasized that Trump will decide what measures to use in potential talks with Russia. &quot;Whatever the president determines is the most robust carrot or stick on either side to induce a durable peace, understanding, obviously, the motivations that Vladimir Putin has had on Ukraine for quite some time,&quot; Hegseth added. Trump has also signaled that U.S. aid to Ukraine could be tied to economic incentives, including access to Ukraine&apos;s rare earth minerals. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Feb. 13 that NATO is assuming a greater role in supporting Ukraine, even as the future of U.S. military aid remains uncertain. Previously, Hegseth said the U.S. does not consider Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession a &quot;realistic outcome&quot; of negotiations. Trump echoed this stance, saying that he does not believe Ukraine joining the alliance is practical. Ukraine officially applied for NATO membership in September 2022, following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. While alliance members reaffirmed in 2024 that Ukraine&apos;s path to NATO is &quot;irreversible,&quot; no formal invitation has been extended. Russia has repeatedly used Ukraine&apos;s potential NATO membership as a justification for its invasion, a claim widely dismissed by Kyiv and its Western allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-aid-to-ukraine-could-become-carrot-or-stick-in-talks-with-russia-hegseth-says/	2025-02-14T00:10:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193880159.jpg
Chornobyl Nuclear Plant shelter damaged in Russian drone strike	A Russian attack drone struck the protective shelter of the destroyed 4th power unit at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant, President Volodymyr Zelensky reported on Feb. 14. The strike damaged the shelter, but the fire was extinguished, and radiation levels remained stable, according to the president. Monitoring efforts continue to assess any potential risks. &quot;This is a terrorist threat to the entire world,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that the damage to the shelter is significant. &quot;The only country in the world that attacks such sites, occupies nuclear power plants, and wages war without any regard for the consequences is today&apos;s Russia.&quot; The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has confirmed the explosion. The organization reported that a drone struck the roof of the shelter. 0:00/1&#xD7;Alleged moment of a Russian drone strike on the protective shelter of the destroyed 4th power unit at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant, Feb. 14, 2025. (President Volodymyr Zelensky / Telegram).Chornobyl, the site of the world&apos;s worst nuclear disaster, remains a highly sensitive location. The explosion of the plant&apos;s reactor on Apr. 26, 1986, contaminated a vast area spanning Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. Zelensky said the attack underscores Russia&apos;s continued disregard for global security. &quot;Russia continues to expand its army and shows no change in its deranged, anti-human state rhetoric. This means that Putin is definitely not preparing for negotiations &#x2014; he is preparing to continue deceiving the world,&quot; he said. The Chornobyl plant, located about 130 kilometers north of Kyiv, was briefly occupied by Russian forces in the early days of the full-scale invasion. They held the station&apos;s staff hostage, creating significant risks to nuclear safety. On Mar. 31, 2022, Russian troops withdrew from the station. During the occupation, increased radiation levels were recorded due to the movement of heavy machinery that stirred up contaminated dust. Russia attacked the station&apos;s protective shelter on the day of the Munich Security Conference. Zelensky is leading Ukraine&apos;s delegation at the conference, where U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s team is expected to outline its diplomatic strategy for ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/chornobyl-nuclear-plant-shelter-damaged-in-russian-drone-strike/	2025-02-13T23:46:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Karina-Piliuhina-5.jpg
Plane malfunction forces State Secretary Rubio to return to Washington while en route to Munich Security Conference	A U.S. Air Force plane carrying U.S. State Secretary Marco Rubio and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch was forced to return to Washington due to a technical malfunction, the Associated Press reported on Feb. 14. &#xA0; Rubio and Risch were en route to Germany for the Munich Security Conference. U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Rubio are scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 14. The aircraft, a C-32 converted Boeing 757, experienced a problem with the cockpit windshield about 90 minutes after takeoff from Joint Base Andrews, prompting an emergency return to the base. &#xA0; U.S. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce confirmed the incident, saying Rubio &quot;intends to continue his travel to Germany and the Middle East on a separate aircraft.&quot; &#xA0; Zelensky will lead Ukraine&apos;s delegation at the conference, where U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s team is expected to outline its diplomatic approach to ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/plane-carrying-secretary-rubio-to-munich-returns-to-washington-due-to-malfunction/	2025-02-13T22:42:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193483462.jpg

German company to manufacture 6,000 AI-powered drones for Ukraine	Ukraine is set to receive 6,000 AI-powered HX-2 attack drones from the Munich-based defense technology firm Helsing. The HX-2, an electrically propelled precision munition with a range of up to 100 km, is equipped with onboard artificial intelligence, ensuring resilience against electronic warfare. Integrated into Helsing&#x2019;s Altra reconnaissance-strike system, the drones can operate in coordinated swarms under the control of a single operator, according to the company&#x2019;s statement. This follows a prior order of 4,000 HF-1 drones that Helsing committed to in Nov. 2024. Helsing signed a memorandum with Ukraine on cooperation in the field of defense technology in February 2024. The company has been active in Ukraine since 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-company-to-manufacture-6-000-ai-powered-drones-for-ukraine/	2025-02-13T21:11:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2158978909.jpg
