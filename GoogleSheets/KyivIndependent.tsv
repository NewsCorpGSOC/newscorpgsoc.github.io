Moldovan President Sandu arrives in Kyiv to meet Zelensky	Moldovan President Maia Sandu arrived in Kyiv on Jan. 25 on an official visit to meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky, according to her X account. Sandu&apos;s visit comes amid an ongoing energy crisis in Moldova&apos;s Russian-occupied Transnistria region. While Moldova has transitioned to European energy supplies, Transnistria remains heavily reliant on Russian gas. Russian gas supplies to Transnistria were halted on Jan. 1 due to Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit, including supplies to Moldova, and Moldova&apos;s debt for gas supplies. The energy crisis has been labeled by Chisinau as Kremlin blackmail and a threat to national security. &quot;I bring a strong message of support for Ukraine and its people. Their courage secures our peace,&quot; Sandu wrote on X. &quot;We&apos;ll discuss security, energy, infrastructure, trade, and mutual support on the EU path. Moldova remains a reliable neighbor.&quot; As Moldova has shifted toward European integration under Sandu&apos;s leadership, Russia has continued to put pressure on the country. Moldova has sought to combat Russian influence and pressure, banning Russian-affiliated political groups like the U.S.-sanctioned Shor party, outlawing broadcasts of Russian state-run television news, and blocking access to Russian media sites.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldovan-president-sandu-arrives-in-kyiv-to-meet-zelensky/	2025-01-25T01:42:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GiIBpMiX0AAwByZ.jpeg
General Staff: Russia has lost 828,470 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 828,470 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 25. This number includes 1,650 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,859 tanks, 20,545 armored fighting vehicles, 35,071 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,309 artillery systems, 1,263 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,050 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 23,213 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-828-470-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-24T23:15:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/LEM_33026-1.JPG
Pete Hegseth confirmed as US Secretary of Defense in tie-breaking vote	The U.S. Senate confirmed Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense on Jan. 24 in a tie-breaking vote. Hegseth, a combat veteran and former Fox News host, was confirmed with the Senate split 50-50. Vice President JD Vance cast the deciding vote, as three Republicans broke with their party to vote against Hegseth. Republican Senators Mitch McConnell, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins joined the Senate Democrats in opposing the nomination. Hegseth&#x2019;s role will be to lead 1.3 million troops and preside over a $850 billion budget, as well as to hold meetings with U.S. allies, acting as the principal defense policymaker and adviser. The confirmation came despite numerous allegations of misconduct, as well as questions about Hegseth&#x2019;s qualifications to lead the Pentagon. President Donald Trump praised Hegseth&#x2019;s appointment, calling him a &#x201C;great secretary of defense&#x201D; and dismissing the dissent as irrelevant to the &quot;important thing&quot; of securing a win. Hegseth&#x2019;s confirmation completes Trump&#x2019;s top national security team. Hegseth previously served as an infantry captain in the Army National Guard, doing multiple tours of Afghanistan and Iraq. He has previously called for reducing the U.S. commitment to the NATO military alliance and decreasing U.S. spending on foreign assistance. At his confirmation hearing on Jan. 14, he was asked about his position on Ukraine after he did not mention Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion during his opening remarks. &quot;We know who the aggressor is,&quot; Hegseth replied, adding: &quot;We know who the good guy is. We&#x2019;d like to see (the resolution of the war be) as advantageous for the Ukrainians as possible.&quot; &quot;But that war needs to come to an end,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/pete-hegseth-confirmed-as-us-secretary-of-defense-in-tie-breaking-vote/	2025-01-24T21:30:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193430534.jpg
SBU foils Russian missile plot on Ukrainian military institute, arrests cadet collaborating with FSB	An 18-year-old military cadet has been charged with treason for allegedly aiding Russian special services, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reported on Jan. 24. The cadet, transferred to Lviv Oblast for training, reportedly communicated with a representative of Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB) and provided sensitive information in exchange for monetary rewards. According to the statement, the suspect transmitted data on the locations of military facilities, troop deployments, and the aftermath of shelling in the region. &quot;Law enforcement officers exposed her activities and prevented potential strikes on Ukrainian military positions,&quot; the statement said. She used a mobile messenger to send geolocations of training facilities and barracks, which were relocated from Kharkiv to Lviv following the full-scale invasion. The FSB allegedly planned to evacuate her from Ukraine to Russia via a third country after the completion of her mission. The cadet was detained by the SBU while attempting to send coordinates to the FSB and flee the military institute. During searches, officers seized a mobile phone and a laptop containing evidence of her collaboration. &#x200B;&#x200B;The SBU revealed that the cadet planned to provide the FSB with the geolocations of official university buildings where other cadets, including her classmates, were staying. She is currently being held without bail, and the court has imposed a preventive measure of detention under Article 208 of Ukraine&apos;s Criminal Procedure Code. The pre-trial investigation, conducted by members of the SBU Department in Lviv Oblast, is ongoing. The charges under Part 2 of Article 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine carry a penalty of up to 15 years or life imprisonment, along with confiscation of property.	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-foils-russian-missile-plot-on-ukrainian-military-institute-arrests-cadet-collaborating-with-fsb/	2025-01-24T20:47:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/sbu.jpeg
Foreign Ministry rejects Slovak PM's unfounded Ukrainian cyberattack claim	The Foreign Ministry denied Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico&apos;s claim that Ukraine is connected to a cyberattack on Slovakia&apos;s national insurance company, according to a statement on the Ministry&#x2019;s website on Jan. 24. &#x201C;We categorically reject the hints of Ukraine&apos;s involvement in the cyberattack against a health insurance company in Slovakia,&#x201D; the statement said. The Ministry also called on Fico to stop portraying Ukraine as an enemy. &#x201C;We once again call on the Prime Minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico, to stop looking for imaginary enemies in Ukraine, which is friendly to Slovakia and the Slovak people.&#x201D; Fico made the allegation during an urgent press conference, offering no evidence to support his claim. Meanwhile, widespread protests against Fico&apos;s government are underway, and the opposition is pushing for a vote of no confidence. Protesters, which erupted in more than 20 cities, chanted slogans like &quot;Enough of Fico&quot; and &quot;We are Europe,&quot; expressing discontent with the prime minister&apos;s policies and pro-Russian rhetoric. The demonstrations drew significant crowds, with organizers claiming 60,000 participants in Bratislava&apos;s Freedom Square.	https://kyivindependent.com/foreign-ministry-rejects-slovak-pms-unfounded-ukrainian-cyberattack-claim/	2025-01-24T19:15:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188638934.jpg
Russia lost over 20,000 units of military equipment since Feb. 24, 2022	The Russian military has lost at least 20,027 units of equipment since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to an analysis by the Oryx project. The majority of these losses&#x2014;15,051 units&#x2014;were destroyed, while 852 were reported as damaged. Russian troops abandoned 1,113 units, and over 3,000 were captured by Ukrainian forces, the report says. Among the destroyed equipment, 3,704 tanks were affected. Of these, 2,635 were destroyed, 534 were captured, and the remainder were either damaged or abandoned. Ukraine has also suffered significant losses, with Oryx estimating 7,609 units of military equipment lost since the invasion began. Oryx compiles its reports based solely on photo and video evidence, meaning the actual losses on both sides are likely much higher. &quot;The amount of equipment destroyed is significantly higher than recorded here,&quot; the report notes. Since the start of Ukraine&#x2019;s incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region which began in August, the Russian military has reportedly lost over 3,000 pieces of equipment and vehicles, according to the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. The cross-border operation is part of Kyiv&apos;s broader strategy to disrupt Russian logistics and defenses near the border. The reported losses include 104 tanks, 575 armored vehicles, 330 artillery systems, 12 air defense systems, and 12 multiple-launch rocket systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-lost-over-20-000-units-of-military-equipment-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-24T16:35:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1247412452.jpg
Zelensky says Putin wants to 'manipulate' Trump amid talk of peace negotiations	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 24 that Russian President Vladimir Putin is attempting to &quot;manipulate&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump. Zelensky&#x2019;s warning came after Putin expressed willingness to engage in talks with Trump and praised the U.S. leader. Kyiv reiterated its opposition to any peace negotiations between Trump and Putin on the nearly three-year war without the involvement of Ukraine and European partners. &quot;He wants to manipulate the desire of the President of the United States of America to achieve peace,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. &quot;I am confident that no Russian manipulations will succeed anymore.&quot; Earlier on the same day, Putin said that Russia is prepared to hold talks with Trump regarding the war in Ukraine. &quot;Regarding negotiations, we have always said &#x2014; and I want to emphasize this again &#x2014; that we are ready for talks on the Ukrainian issue (Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion),&quot; Putin told reporters. Putin also claimed that Trump&#x2019;s defeat in the 2020 U.S. presidential election contributed to the war in Ukraine. &quot;If Trump&apos;s 2020 victory hadn&apos;t been stolen, there might not have been a crisis in Ukraine,&quot; he said. Putin added that Russia has &quot;never refused contact&quot; with the U.S. administration and described his previous interactions with Trump as &quot;pragmatic and trusting.&quot; The Russian leader also referenced a decree signed by Zelensky in 2022, which declared negotiations with Putin &quot;impossible&quot; following Russia&#x2019;s annexation of four Ukrainian regions. Putin went on to question Kyiv&#x2019;s stance: &quot;How can negotiations be resumed if they are officially banned?&quot; Zelensky&#x2019;s decree came in response to Russia&#x2019;s illegal annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, a move widely condemned as illegitimate by the international community. Despite this, Putin continues to signal interest in engaging with Trump, fueling concerns in Kyiv about potential backchannel discussions that exclude Ukraine and its allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-says-putin-wants-to-manipulate-trump-amid-talk-of-peace-negotiations/	2025-01-24T15:32:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156503093.jpg
Rubio halts most foreign aid, including Ukraine assistance, Politico reports	Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on Jan. 24 new guidance that halts spending on most foreign aid grants for 90 days. This directive, which took State Department officials by surprise, appears to include funding for military assistance to Ukraine, Politico reports. According to a document obtained by the news outlet, the guidance requires staff to issue &quot;stop-work orders&quot; on nearly all &quot;existing foreign assistance awards&quot; and is effective immediately. The Kyiv Independent can&apos;t imemdiately verify this information. Rubio&apos;s guidance goes beyond President Donald Trump&#x2019;s recent executive order, which called for a 90-day pause on foreign aid grants while the secretary reviews them. The president&apos;s order left some ambiguity about whether already appropriated funds or Ukraine aid would be affected, but Rubio&apos;s directive makes it clear that no further actions will be taken to disburse funds for already approved programs, according to current and former officials familiar with the matter. The sweeping nature of the mandate shocked many within the department. &quot;State just totally went nuclear on foreign assistance,&quot; one official told Politico. While the document allows some exceptions&#x2014;such as foreign military financing for Egypt and Israel, emergency food assistance, and &quot;legitimate expenses incurred prior to the date of this&quot; guidance&#x2014;its broad scope leaves room for interpretation. It also states that decisions must remain &quot;consistent with the terms of the relevant award.&quot; Officials believe the halt will affect key allies, including Ukraine, Jordan, and Taiwan. One State Department official and two former Biden administration officials, all speaking anonymously, voiced concerns about the potential impact on these partners. The guidance could expose the U.S. government to lawsuits for unfulfilled contracts if the terms are found to be violated. However, the directive states that decisions regarding the continuation, modification, or termination of programs will follow Rubio&#x2019;s review. The omission of Ukraine aid is particularly concerning for American officials who see supporting Ukraine as essential to defeating Russia. While Republicans, including Trump, have long criticized what they view as wasteful foreign aid under Democratic administrations, Trump has recently intensified his stance on Russia. He has threatened Moscow with sanctions if it does not end its nearly three-year invasion of Ukraine and declared that &quot;Putin bears responsibility for ending the war.&quot; The guidance was reviewed and cleared by several senior State Department officials, including counselor Michael Needham and policy planning director Michael Anton. The department is now tasked with preparing a report within 85 days of the guidance&#x2019;s issuance.	https://kyivindependent.com/rubio-halts-most-foreign-aid-including-ukraine-assistance-politico-reports/	2025-01-24T14:29:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194097519.jpg
US arms exports reach record $318 billion in 2024 driven by Ukraine-related demand	U.S. military equipment sales to foreign governments jumped 29% in 2024, reaching a record $318.7 billion, according to the State Department. Countries ramped up purchases to restock supplies sent to Ukraine and prepare for potential large-scale conflicts. The Biden administration&apos;s final-year figures reinforce expectations of strong performance for U.S. defense manufacturers like Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman. Analysts predict their shares will rise in response to increasing global instability, according to Reuters. During his campaign, now President Donald Trump called on U.S. allies to invest more in their defenses. He proposed raising NATO&#x2019;s defense spending target to 5% of GDP, a significant increase from the current 2% goal&#x2014;a level no NATO member, including the U.S., currently meets. The demand for weaponry has surged due to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, putting pressure on defense contractors to keep up. Governments worldwide are submitting orders to bolster their military stocks, while the U.S. works to replenish its own supplies sent to Kyiv. The State Department described arms sales and transfers as &quot;important U.S. foreign policy tools with potential long-term implications for regional and global security.&quot; Notable 2024 deals included $23 billion in F-16 jets and upgrades for Turkey, $18.8 billion in F-15 fighter jets for Israel, and $2.5 billion in M1A2 Abrams tanks for Romania. Many of these orders contribute to the growing backlog for U.S. defense companies. Future quarters are expected to benefit from orders for hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, Patriot missile interceptors, and armored vehicles. Foreign governments procure U.S. arms through two primary channels: direct commercial sales negotiated with defense companies or foreign military sales coordinated via the U.S. government, often through Defense Department officials at embassies. Both methods require government approval. Direct commercial sales reached $200.8 billion in fiscal 2024, up from $157.5 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, government-facilitated foreign military sales rose to $117.9 billion, compared to $80.9 billion the previous year.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-arms-exports-reach-record-318-billion-in-2024-driven-by-ukraine-related-demand/	2025-01-24T13:16:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1246310076-1674684300r20al.jpg
Ukraine war latest: 'More than 50 explosions’ — Massive drone strike targets Russian refinery, plants	Key developments on Jan. 24: The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and Ukraine&#x2019;s Special Operations Forces (SOS) struck the Ryazan Oil Refinery and the Ryazan Thermal Power Plant in an overnight drone strike on Jan. 24, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. The attack was later confirmed by the General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces. The news comes as Russia&#x2019;s Defense Ministry reported intercepting 121 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 37 in Bryansk Oblast, 20 in Ryazan Oblast, and 17 in the Kursk and Saratov oblasts each. The refinery, one of Russia&#x2019;s largest, has the capacity of 17 million metric tons of oil per year. At least three oil depots and a workshop were set ablaze, according to the source. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video that purports to show the aftermath of a Ukrainian drone strike against Ryazan, Russia, on Jan. 24, 2025. (SBU source)The statement confirms earlier reports in Russian Telegram channels that the Ryazan Oil Refinery caught fire after a drone attack. &quot;SBU and SOS drones also targeted an oil pumping station at the Ryazan Thermal Power Plant,&quot; the source said, without revealing details on possible consequences. Local residents reported more than 50 explosions, according to the source. Ryazan lies roughly 500 kilometers (310 miles) north of Ukraine&#x2019;s border. Drones also attacked the Kremniy EL microelectronics plant in Russia&apos;s Bryansk and other facilities in the city, the independent Telegram news channel Astra reported, citing Russian Emergencies Ministry sources. It is not immediately clear whether the plant, which produces components for the Russian military, suffered significant damage in the attack. The drone strike also damaged windows and the facade of a building of the Investigative Committee, and the Institute of Management and Business caught fire, according to Astra. Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&#x2019;s National Security and Defense Council, also reported on the attack against the Kremniy plant. The facility has suspended operations after sustaining hits, Kovalenko claimed, saying that the plant produces microelectronics for Russian air defenses, Iskander missiles, electronic warfare equipment, and drones. This is the third time the plant was hit during the full-scale war, Kovalenko said. The city of Bryansk lies around 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Russia&#x2019;s border with Ukraine. The General Staff also confirmed the attack against the Kremniy plant, without revealing details on possible damage. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. Recent weeks saw Ukraine again intensify long-range strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia&#x2019;s rear in an effort to undermine Moscow&#x2019;s ability to wage war. The Russian army is, for now, failing to outflank Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast in an attempt to cut off the town&apos;s logistics routes, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, Viktor Trehubov, said on Jan. 24 on national television. The area near Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian forces, has been the focus of fierce fighting for months as Russia intensifies its offensive in Donetsk Oblast. Russian forces are trying to bypass Pokrovsk from the north and south, but so far without success, according to the spokesperson. &quot;So far, these attempts have been more or less effectively repelled. They have begun to attack the town more actively with long-range, different types of missiles and FPV (first-person-view) drones,&quot; Trehubov said. &quot;Unfortunately, they are hitting the town, but their plan to surround it is still very far from realization,&quot; he added. The estimated Russian advance in the Pokrovsk sector in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 23, 2025, according to DeepState. Pokrovsk marked by a black symbol. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Trehubov stressed that the Pokrovsk sector of the front line is the primary vector of Russia&apos;s offensive. &quot;This is the main point of concentration of their efforts, and it has been for a long time. There is the largest number of clashes there,&quot; he said. Russian troops are continuing to push on the Lyman, Siversk, Kramatorsk, Toretsk, Pokrovsk and Kurakhove axes, according to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. Pokrovsk and Kurakhove remain the focal points of the Russian eastern offensive, now in its fifth month. Ukraine previously blew up the No. 3 mine&apos;s shaft in the village of Pishchane near Pokrovsk to prevent Russia from deploying its troops closer to the front-line town, according to The New York Times (NYT) Earlier this month, Metinvest announced it had suspended operations at the Pokrovsk coking coal mine due to worsening security conditions and power outages. The BBC and the independent outlet Mediazona have identified the names of 90,019 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the BBC reported on Jan. 24. Since the media outlets&apos; last update in mid-January, the names of 1,964 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties. Some 23% of all those killed were military personnel who signed a contract with the Russian Defense Ministry after February 2022. According to the investigation, 17% of the identified soldiers were professional contractors, 17% were convicts who left for the war from prisons, and 12% were conscripts. The media revealed that nine generals and 500 soldiers with the rank of lieutenant colonel and higher were among the killed. As of Jan. 24, the highest casualty rates were among the residents of Bashkortostan, Russia&#x2019;s republic near the Ural Mountains and the homeland of the Bashkir people. Russia&#x2019;s non-Slavic ethnic groups have been overrepresented in its casualty figures in the war with Ukraine. The authorities and media in this region reported a total of 3,932 deaths during the full-scale war, the investigation read. Russia&apos;s real losses are likely higher, as the media analysis is estimated to cover 45% to 65% of the actual death toll, the BBC reported. According to the journalists&#x2019; estimates, the actual losses could range from 138,500 to 200,000 people killed. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 8 that about 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed during the full-scale invasion. The last time Moscow officially announced the number of soldiers killed was in September 2022, putting the number at 5,937. Ukraine&#x2019;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 19 that Russian forces suffered their heaviest losses last year since the start of the full-scale war, with total military losses reaching 434,000 soldiers killed and injured in 2024. This represents around half of the 800,000 killed and injured Russian soldiers since the start of the full-scale war, according to Ukraine&#x2019;s military. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry dismissed Russia&apos;s demand to cancel NATO&apos;s 2008 promise of eventual membership for Ukraine, calling it &quot;utter bul***it&quot; in a Jan. 24 statement. The response comes after Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko criticized NATO&apos;s 2008 Bucharest Summit declaration, calling it &quot;catastrophic for European security.&quot; &quot;Aw shucks, North Korea&apos;s ally issuing ultimatums to NATO. Utter bul***it,&quot; said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi in response to Grushko&apos;s remarks. &quot;Moscow has no say here.&quot; Instead, the ministry praised NATO&apos;s decision at the time and reiterated Kyiv&apos;s commitment to joining the alliance. &quot;European security architecture is built on protection from Russia,&quot; Tykhyi said. Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. While NATO members pledged at the 2024 Washington Summit that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; they have yet to extend a formal invitation. Russian officials, as well as Western intellectuals with a track record of anti-Ukraine narratives have repeatedly cited Ukraine&apos;s potential NATO membership as a justification for the invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged opposition from several NATO members, including the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia, but expressed hope that U.S. President Donald Trump could sway support for Kyiv&apos;s entry. There is little evidence that the new administration would be more open to Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership than former U.S. President Joe Biden. Trump has previously criticized NATO and blamed Biden for allegedly supporting Ukraine&apos;s aspirations and provoking Russia&apos;s invasion. U.S. President Donald Trump indicated that both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine&#x2019;s President Volodymyr Zelensky share the blame for the Ukraine-Russia war in an interview segment with Fox News released on Jan. 23. The U.S. president, who most recently met Zelensky in Paris in December, criticized his Ukrainian counterpart for resisting Russia at the start of the invasion instead of cutting a deal. &quot;Zelensky... shouldn&#x2019;t have allowed this to happen either. He&#x2019;s no angel,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I could have made that deal so easily, and Zelensky decided that &apos;I want to fight,&apos;&quot; he commented, adding that Ukraine has been fighting against a &quot;much bigger entity.&quot; At the same time, Trump acknowledged Ukraine&#x2019;s bravery in resisting Russia and said that the Ukrainian president has &quot;had enough&quot; and is ready for peace. &quot;We started pouring equipment... and they (Ukraine) had the bravery to use the equipment, but in the end, it&#x2019;s a war that has to be settled,&quot; Trump said. Already during his electoral campaign, Trump implied that his predecessor, former U.S. President Joe Biden, and Zelensky share blame for Russia&#x2019;s ongoing invasion and pledged to broker a swift peace deal. Trump has been often critical of the Biden administration&#x2019;s support for Ukraine and boasted about good relations with Putin, sparking concerns he might broker a deal unfavorable to Kyiv. Recently, the U.S. president has adopted a more critical stance toward Moscow, criticizing Putin for reluctance to cut a deal and threatening with economic repercussions if he fails to do so. &quot;Putin shouldn&#x2019;t have done it (launching the full-scale invasion)... and it has to stop,&quot; Trump said, claiming that Russia had lost around 850,000 soldiers while Ukraine lost 700,000. Zelensky put Ukraine&#x2019;s casualty rates at 43,000 killed and 370,000 wounded as of December, while Moscow does not reveal its losses. In the interview, Trump reiterated his warnings that if Russia does not agree to negotiate, the U.S. is going to impose &quot;massive tariffs and massive taxes, and... big sanctions,&quot; adding he &quot;doesn&#x2019;t want to do it&quot; because he &quot;loves&quot; Russia. The U.S. president echoed his earlier claims that the full-scale invasion would have never started if he were in office at the time, blaming the Biden administration for supposedly provoking Putin and allowing him to profit from high energy prices. Trump also lashed out against the former president for not pressuring European countries to donate more support to Ukraine, falsely claiming that Washington spent &quot;$200 billion more than Europe&quot; in support of Kyiv. The U.S. Congress has allocated over $170 billion to Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, which included the provision of over $60 billion worth of military support. The EU and its member countries have made available $145 billion in financial, military, and humanitarian assistance during the full-scale war. Ukraine recently announced that arrangements for a meeting between Trump and Zelensky are underway, while the U.S. president also said he aims to meet Putin in the coming days to discuss an end to the war. Moscow welcomed Trump&#x2019;s proposal for a meeting but voiced skepticism about a possible peace deal, saying it has to first understand what the U.S.&#x2019;s goals are before entering into any negotiations. Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters on Jan. 24 that Russia is ready for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump on ending the war in Ukraine. &quot;Regarding negotiations, we have always said &#x2014; and I want to emphasize this again &#x2014; that we are ready for talks on the Ukrainian issue (Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion),&quot; Putin said. Putin claimed that if Trump&apos;s 2020 &quot;victory hadn&apos;t been stolen,&quot; there might not have been a &quot;crisis in Ukraine.&quot; He emphasized that Russia has &quot;never refused contact&quot; with the U.S. administration and maintained a &quot;pragmatic and trusting&quot; relationship with Trump. He moved quickly to point out a decree signed by President Zelensky after Russia illegally annexed four Ukrainian regions, which declared negotiations with Putin &quot;impossible&quot; while leaving the door open to discussions with Russia under different leadership. &quot;How can negotiations be resumed if they are officially banned?&quot; Putin asked. Zelensky&apos;s 2022 decree followed Russia&apos;s annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, actions condemned as illegitimate by the international community. The move reflected Ukraine&apos;s refusal to engage with Moscow while Putin remains in power, underscoring Kyiv&apos;s position that peace negotiations must uphold Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak dismissed Putin&apos;s remarks, accusing him of seeking to sideline Europe in any talks. &quot;Putin wants to negotiate the fate of Europe &#x2014; without Europe,&quot; Yermak said. He added, &quot;Putin has long needed to return to reality himself, or he will be brought back.&quot; Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov echoed Putin&apos;s comments, saying that dialog with Trump could recover if the U.S. &quot;takes into account Russia&apos;s interests.&quot; &quot;If the U.S. under Trump takes Russia&apos;s interests into account, the dialog between Moscow and Washington will be gradually restored; if not, everything will remain as it is,&quot; he said. Lavrov expressed dissatisfaction with Trump&apos;s team&apos;s reported peace proposals on Dec. 29, particularly the idea of freezing hostilities along the current line of contact and transferring the responsibility for countering Russia to Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-more-than-50-explosions-massive-drone-strike-targets-russian-refinery-plants/	2025-01-24T12:02:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/2025-01-24-12_03_42-1.jpeg
‘An opportunity, not a burden:’ Ukraine House Davos’s message for world leaders, investors	Over the last week, Ukraine House Davos opened its doors to world leaders and investors for the sixth year in a row during the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. Ukraine House this year was adorned with the slogan &#x201C;Your Country First, Win With Us.&#x201D; The message set the tone for the discussions from Jan. 20-23, which focused on the benefits Ukraine can offer other countries in return for peace and economic recovery, namely lucrative investment opportunities. Throughout the week, the Ukrainian delegation highlighted Ukraine&#x2019;s estimated $26 trillion in natural resources and minerals, a topic that has picked up amid the return of Donald Trump, inaugurated on the first day of the forum. The new U.S. president has vowed to bring a swift end to the war, which could potentially usher in a wave of investment. The Kyiv Independent spoke with Ulyana Khromyak, Ukraine House&#x2019;s executive Director since 2023, as she wrapped up what she called a packed event. Khromyak said part of the delegation&#x2019;s mission was to convince investors to come to Ukraine now, rather than getting stuck waiting in line after the end of Russia&#x2019;s war. Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources provide a lot of investment potential, alongside the country&#x2019;s agricultural and defense sectors, she said.

(Ukraine House Davos)Regarding whether Trump will abandon Ukraine in its fight against Russia, Khromyak is hopeful the president can help achieve a sustainable peace in Ukraine and set the country on a path to recovery. &#xA0; This interview has been edited for clarity. Kyiv Independent: What was Ukraine House&apos;s key message and mission this week in Davos? How has this changed from the last few years? &#xA0; Khromyak: For the past three years, the messages were about what is needed to win this war, the opportunities in Ukraine, how Ukraine can contribute to the world, and why Ukraine is valuable to the world. Our message this year was a just and sustainable peace. We had a lot of discussions about how we can achieve this through strength on the battlefield as well as a strengthened position at the negotiation table. The second message was that Ukraine is not a burden, but a country of opportunity. We showed a lot of opportunities, including how rich Ukraine is in mineral resources. We have about $26 trillion in natural resources in Ukraine, out of which $12 trillion is in minerals. We also discussed the successes of the existing investors who are currently working under these (wartime) conditions and also the successes of small and medium businesses. The country is resilient, the economy is working. We talked about investment in the defense sector, which was also a hot topic, to make Ukraine a defense hub. We have the practical experience on the battlefield, as well as the technologies and the knowledge of how to scale this up. Kyiv Independent: Do you think that there is a positive view that President Trump could be beneficial for Ukrainian businesses and its economy? Khromyak: Yes, I truly believe there is. You can see this from his World Economic Forum speech. He delivered strong messages supporting Ukraine. Let&apos;s believe that his political will can help us strengthen these relations and achieve a just and sustainable peace as well as try to start the recovery of the country. Screening of Donald Trump&apos;s speech in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 20, 2025. (Ukraine House Davos)Kyiv Independent: One of the panels differed from the rest in that it focused on Russia&apos;s destruction of Ukrainian churches. Why is this an important message, particularly for Christian Republicans who have not always been supportive of Ukrainian aid? Khromyak: That&apos;s why we raised this topic. We see it&#x2019;s a hot topic for the Republicans, so we try to reflect this. We are saying that Ukraine is a country where we have a lot of religions and it&apos;s one of the most spiritual countries in the world. Different religions are very important to us. Freedom is our religion as well, but we also need to emphasize that we have a lot of (religious) persecution from the Russians. We showed a lot of videos about the persecution of religion in Ukraine. The audience said that this is an important message to the White House. &#xA0; Kyiv Independent: Ukraine House also lent a lot of attention to Ukraine&apos;s investment climate and resilience. What sense do you get from investors about their interest in Ukraine currently? Khromyak: There are a lot of possibilities to develop in innovation, infrastructure, agro-sector, and then definitely the minerals and energy sector. These sectors are very important for the world and Ukraine has all of these resources. We just need to increase their efficiency and therefore we need the investment for this to run independently. There were a lot of discussions about the frozen Russian assets as well; how we can unfreeze and invest them and efficiently use them to strengthen our economy. &#xA0; Kyiv Independent: Do you get a feeling that investors are taking Ukraine seriously as a place to invest? Khromyak: Yes, I do, considering the discussions that we had in the House. We had first Vice Prime Minister and Economics Minister Yulia Svyrydenko speaking, and her deputy was in the House as well, talking about war risk insurance. The government is supporting it from their side and that&apos;s why investors took it seriously. The investors asked a lot of questions about how they could invest, and what would be the security and guarantees provided to them.

(Stefan Wermuth / Bloomberg via Getty Images)Kyiv Independent: Has that changed since you&apos;ve been in your position since 2023? Khromyak: Yes, the interest increased. In 2023, no one knew what was going to happen. But right now, we have President Trump&#x2019;s messages and support from the leaders of the European Union. Right now we have no other option. We have no choice other than to win this war and to make the country stronger. &#xA0; Kyiv Independent: Do you get a sense that investors are willing to come into Ukraine now, or are they still talking about coming in after the war? &#xA0; Khromyak: We were trying to persuade them to come now and show the opportunities because everyone will be queuing after the war. There will be a lot of competition, so first come first serve. They will get better conditions right now, rather than coming after the war. We showed this deal of the year in the telecom sector, (the $1.5 billion Datagroup-Volia-Lifecell merger) saying that, look, the investors are investing and there are a lot of success stories, so please come and invest now. Kyiv Independent: Is there a clearer path now to securing war risk insurance? Khromyak: Yes. We work with Marsh McLennan, who was on the panel, and we had Aon among the audience. These are two main players in the insurance sector who are working with the government right now and with the investment institutions to provide war risk insurance. We have already had the first successes. The speakers discussed how to involve more people and how to make insurance for those who would like to invest now. The Aon and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) transaction that jointly provided insurance to the companies is a good development.

(Hollie Adams / Bloomberg)Kyiv Independent: One of the final panels discussed utilizing the frozen Russian assets. With some Western businesses lobbying against this idea in Europe, how much support do you think this idea has? Khromyak. We need the whole amount of the frozen Russian assets, not just the proceeds. Therefore we need the political will from different countries. A lot of people from the Ukrainian government, opinion leaders, and NGOs on different levels are lobbying for this issue. We are getting there. It&apos;s a long and hard path and a lot of countries still need to implement a lot of internal regulations to pass and transfer these assets. But we systematically need to work on this. The message is that we should not just accept the proceeds, but we need the whole $350 billion.	https://kyivindependent.com/just-and-sustainable-peace-ukraine-houses-message-to-davos-2025/	2025-01-24T11:59:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GV_09911.jpg
Enough of Fico' — Slovaks flood the streets in nationwide anti-government protests	Protests erupted in more than 20 Slovak cities on Jan. 24 under the slogan &quot;Slovakia is Europe,&quot; targeting the government of Prime Minister Robert Fico, Slovak media Aktuality reported. Protesters chanted slogans like &quot;Enough of Fico&quot; and &quot;We are Europe,&quot; expressing discontent with the prime minister&apos;s policies and pro-Russian rhetoric. Organized by the &quot;Peace to Ukraine&quot; initiative and opposition parties, the demonstrations drew significant crowds, with organizers claiming 60,000 participants in Bratislava&apos;s Freedom Square. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these numbers. Fico, who has been critical of Western support for Ukraine, accused opposition leader Michal Simecka on Jan. 18 of plotting to overthrow the government. In a Facebook address, Fico claimed that Simecka was &quot;kissing Zelensky&#x2019;s ring&quot; and pledging support for Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership. Simecka, leader of the pro-Western Progressive Slovakia party, recently led a delegation of opposition lawmakers to Kyiv on Jan. 17 to reestablish Slovakia&apos;s support for Ukraine. Fico likened the opposition&apos;s actions to Ukraine&apos;s EuroMaidan Revolution, alleging they were preparing to stage a coup in Bratislava. Fico&apos;s government has faced criticism for its perceived alignment with Russian interests, contrasting with the pro-Western orientation of opposition leaders like Simecka.	https://kyivindependent.com/enough-of-fico-slovakia-sees-nationwide-protests-against-pm-government/	2025-01-24T11:58:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2195089562.jpg
Ukraine’s weapons procurement clean-up at risk as defense minister moves to undermine reform	Ukraine&#x2019;s lengthy efforts to clean up its weapons procurement are in danger of being unwound as the Defense Ministry strangleholds the Defense Procurement Agency, say anti-corruption activists and lawmakers.Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Jan. 24 that he would not renew the contract of Maryna Bezrukova, the head of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA), the body in charge of buying weapons for the Ukrainian military. He cited unsatisfactory results as the reason. Umerov&#x2019;s decision comes days after the DPA&#x2019;s supervisory board voted to extend the contract with Bezrukova after a year of reforming in this role. According to Ukrainian law, supervisory boards have the authority to unilaterally hire and fire the heads of state enterprises. This means that legally, after the board&#x2019;s vote, Bezrukova should take the reins of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) for another year. But due to amendments recently made to the agency&#x2019;s charter by the Defense Ministry, which oversees the DPA, this, or any other decision of the supervisory board could be reversed by the ministry. Anti-corruption activists and lawmakers say that the amendments and Umerov&#x2019;s decision are &#x201C;unlawful.&#x201D; &#x201C;It seems like a violation of legislation, violation of the reform process, and violation of the independence of the agency that was promised personally by the defense minister and his deputies to our society, to our partners,&#x201D; Bezrukova told the Kyiv Independent after Umerov&#x2019;s announcement.&#x201C;Umerov is trying to attack the reform,&#x201D; she added. Maryna Bezrukova, the head of the Defense Procurement Agency in Kyiv, Ukraine, on June 19, 2024. (Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)Bezrukova told the Kyiv Independent that she would not leave the agency as she was legally selected by the DPA&#x2019;s supervisory board. &#x201C;I&apos;m not going to surrender. I will stand in my position until the end,&#x201D; she said.&#x201C;I have a vision for the institutional development of the agency. I have over 25 years of experience in procurement,&#x201D; she added. Umerov also removed the board&#x2019;s two state representatives, Taras Chmut and Yuriy Dzhygyr, claiming that they ignored the ministry&#x2019;s recommendation to not extend the contract with Bezrukova. He added that the board will be &#x201C;relaunched&#x201D; in the future, upending nearly a year of work forming the board.Umerov wants to replace Bezrukova with Arsen Zhumadilov, the director of the State Rear Operator (known under its Ukrainian acronym DOT) which buys food and clothes for the military. Previously, Umerov tried to merge the DPA with DOT into one unified body under Zhumadilov&apos;s leadership. Umerov and Zhumadilov are close, sources told the Kyiv Independent. Umerov claimed the reason for the replacement was that DOT delivered better results. Following Umerov&#x2019;s announcement, Ukrainian anti-corruption activists have called for his dismissal, saying that he is disrupting the key reform for wartime Ukraine. &#x201C;These decisions of the minister are a clear sabotage and undermining of the country&apos;s defense capability,&#x201D; Vitaliy Shabunin, the co-founder of the Anti-Corruption Action Center (ANTAC), wrote on Facebook. Additionally, Umerov proposed to fire Deputy Defense Minister Dmytro Klimenkov, who he said &#x201C;failed&#x201D; the task of defense procurement. The ministry set out to reform defense procurement after several high-profile corruption scandals emerged in 2023. Umerov brought Bezrukova on board in January 2024 to lead the transformation of the DPA. Her main goal was to move to direct contracting with weapons producers that cut out middlemen who mark up prices or even fail to deliver on deals. One of the central pieces of the reform was the creation of an independent supervisory board that could protect the agency from political pressure and help ensure fair procurement. However, Bezrukova has locked horns with the ministry multiple times while attempting to change the DPA&#x2019;s practices. In July, the Kyiv Independent reported that she was facing pressure from arms dealers who were unhappy with her reforms. Bezrukova took over the DPA amid reforms in the defense procurement sector which was littered with scandals. Under the agency&#x2019;s previous head, Volodymyr Pikuzo, nearly all defense procurement contracts were through intermediaries, and dodgy contracts cost Ukraine tens of billions of hryvnia, according to Bezrukova, as well as delays of essential battlefield supplies.Bezrukova sees the agency as &#x201C;a platform&#x201D; between the army and defense companies. In the last year, she has secured over 50 direct contracts from 13 countries for ammunition, missiles, radars, drones, and artillery systems under a total annual budget of Hr 306 billion ($7.3 billion). Of the contracts last year, 61% were signed with Ukrainian companies, 27% with foreign companies, including major defense firms like Rheinmetall and KNDS, and 12% with intermediaries. Both the DPA and the DOT, the agency in charge of food and clothes purchases, are performing &#x201C;much better&#x201D; than when the Defense Ministry was in charge of procurement, said Anastasia Radina, lawmaker and head of the parliament&apos;s anti-corruption committee. Bezrukova took the role with the understanding that a supervisory board would be introduced, as is standard practice across state institutions. After facing pressure early on, she hoped the board would protect her, but it took nearly a year into her employment for it to be formed. In the meantime, while the DPA was being overseen by the Defense Ministry, Bezrukova and the ministry repeatedly butted heads. At the start of her job, Bezrukova said Deputy Defense Minister Klimenkov insisted she sign a contract for a large supply of shells despite her concerns about the manufacturer, owned by state defense conglomerate Ukroboronprom. (Editor&#x2019;s Note: The manufacturer&#x2019;s name is not mentioned for security reasons.) Dmytro Klimenkov, deputy defense minister of Ukraine, talks to The Kyiv Independent on Feb. 22, 2024. (Press Service/Defense Ministry of Ukraine) The company&#x2019;s capacities were too limited to produce the proposed 500,000 shells, due to a lack of workers and a gunpowder deficit, Bezrukova said. Additionally, at the time when the contract was being considered in February 2024, the company&#x2019;s director and a manager were under two separate investigations for inflating prices, the National Anti-corruption Bureau (NABU) told the Kyiv Independent.An initial ministry inspection of the manufacturer confirmed Bezrukova&#x2019;s fears, noting that its production capacity was likely around 300-350,000 shells. But a few weeks later, the ministry inspector changed their mind, claiming that the company had enough capacity, according to Bezrukova. Despite concerns, Bezrukova signed the contract.In the summer, the company was behind schedule. Bezrukova told Ukrainska Pravda, a Ukrainian media outlet, that Klimenkov asked her to extend the deadline for deliveries but she refused, insisting they should start looking for alternatives. It was at this point that her relationship with the ministry&#x2019;s top brass went sour, she said. The Kyiv Independent requested a comment from the Defense Ministry but hasn&#x2019;t received a response.By November, the shells were on the front line but many were failing to explode. Around 24,000 duds were withdrawn in December, leaving authorities clambering to find alternatives. On Nov. 26, the Defense Ministry said it was investigating the incident and would deliver imported shells instead.In another more recent clash, the ministry abruptly transferred Hr 23 billion ($546 million) from the DPA&#x2019;s budget to the State Border Guard Service on Nov. 29, without forewarning Bezrukova. The Defense Ministry and Armed Forces General Staff claimed that the DPA had over Hr 100 billion in unused funds that needed to be spent before the end of the year. However, the agency said that this blurred the truth. On Nov. 25, the alleged unused funds consisted of Hr 45 billion available for contracting and Hr 57 billion set aside for pre-agreed contracts. But by Nov. 29, the agency had lined up more contracts for 2025 and the remaining funds dropped to Hr 21.8 billion. That same day, the government adopted the order to redistribute the Hr 23 billion and the DPA had to take Hr 1.2 billion from already concluded contracts to meet it. A furious Bezrukova called for the money to be returned but it hasn&#x2019;t been, according to the DPA.The State Border Guard Service planned to spend the money on a contract with a reportedly dodgy Polish intermediary company PHU Lechmar for mines and shells for the army. The intermediary asked for a 100% prepayment, sounding alarm bells for Bezrukova who says she never pays more than 50% upfront. &#x201C;This is extremely risky,&#x201D; said Bezrukova, adding that if Lechmar fails to deliver on the contract, there is no way to get the money back. Assembling the supervisory board &#x2014; which is now to be &#x201C;relaunched&#x201D; &#x2014; has been a long process, marked by tension between Umerov and Klimenkov on one side, and Bezrukova and anti-corruption activists, supported by Ukraine&#x2019;s Western partners, on the other. The board was supposed to strengthen the agency and defend its head from illicit pressure. While the ministry announced the shortlist of the DPA&#x2019;s supervisory board candidates in June, it took almost six months for the board to come together. Bezrukova sees the delay as a deliberate attempt by the Defense Ministry to undermine the process, or an inability to do its job well. Two board members, Taras Chmut and Kateryna Kuznetsova, told the Kyiv Independent that the process was fraught with bureaucratic hurdles, although they did not find it unusual. Chmut, who leads the Come Back Alive NGO that raises funds and buys weapons for the army, noted that Ukrainian bureaucracy is often a tedious process with endless paperwork. But according to Radina, a lawmaker, the holdup was not justified. While the process was dragging on, Umerov suddenly announced he wanted to merge the DPA with DOT in September 2024. The merger would see one agency dealing with both non-lethal and lethal aid under one supervisory board. Had it been successful, the supervisory board process would have been dragged out again, wasting time and money to rebuild the entire bureaucratic system like the financial budget and workflow. Umerov was trying to &#x201C;destroy&#x201D; the DPA, said Shabunin, the co-founder of the Anti-Corruption Action Center (ANTAC). Instead of Bezrukova, Umerov wanted the director of DOT, Zhumadilov, to head the unified agency as the two men have a closer relationship, several sources told the Kyiv Independent. Vitaly Shabunin, head of the Anti-Corruption Action Center&#x2019;s executive board, speaks at the Ukrainian school of political studies in Kyiv, Ukraine on Sept. 26, 2019. (Ukrainian school of political studies / Facebook)DOT operates with a much smaller budget and staff and doesn&#x2019;t deal with import contracts while the DPA does. Merging the two agencies for them to be led by DOT &#x201C;does not make sense,&#x201D; Shabunin said. &#x201C;It&apos;s a huge difference to buy food, which DOT does, and to buy weapons. The weapons market is much more complicated,&#x201D; he added. Umerov initially said the merger would bring Ukraine in line with NATO standards. However, the plan was swiftly rebuked by the Alliance who backed keeping the two agencies separate. Umerov U-turned on his proposal, saying the two agencies would remain independent during the war. &#x201C;It was not logical,&#x201D; Bezrukova said. &#x201C;In NATO recommendations, it clearly mentions that there are two agencies and that the Defense Ministry should develop and support the capacity of these two agencies, especially of the DPA.&#x201D; Just a day before the supervisory board was finally supposed to be officially formed on Dec. 17, the ministry made amendments to the DPA&#x2019;s charter, undermining its authority. According to Radina, the timing looks suspicious. The ministry also changed DOT&#x2019;s charter but did so months prior. &#x201C;It definitely seems connected to the decision to finally form a supervisory board, to immediately render its powers questionable,&#x201D; she said. Shortly after the ministry&#x2019;s decision, the board members published a statement that the changes &#x201C;restrict the board&apos;s independence and create preconditions for interference in its activities.&#x201D; Bezrukova was keen to stay on at the agency, planning to zero in on the quality and reliability of suppliers. She also hoped to bring the DPA closer in line with NATO agencies and have more autonomy from the Defense Ministry. The supervisory board wanted Bezrukova to stay too. The board voted to extend Bezrukova&#x2019;s contract for another year &#x201C;based on the need to ensure stability and efficiency in procurement management in wartime.&#x201D; Additionally, the board also suggested NATO&#x2019;s auditing board (IBAN) carry out an independent audit. &#x201C;The state must move to transparent rules of the game: purchasing what the army really needs, when it is needed, and at fair prices,&#x201D; Chmut wrote on Facebook after the announcement on Jan. 20. According to the amended DPA charter, the ministry can &#x201C;disagree&#x201D; with the board&#x2019;s decisions and push back.In the long run, Radina is concerned about the broad wording of the amendments, which may allow the ministry to give obligatory orders to the DPA&#x2019;s employees and even intervene in the procurement process, circumventing the agency&#x2019;s leadership and procurement procedures.

Incoming Trump peace envoy suggests oil crackdown to push Russia to negotiate	Stricter measures targeting Russia&apos;s oil industry could pressure the Kremlin to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, incoming peace envoy for U.S. President Donald Trump, told FOX News on Jan. 24. The proposal comes as Trump threatens to impose sanctions and tariffs on Russian exports if no deal to end the war is reached soon. &quot;Russia is earning billions from oil sales,&quot; Kellogg said, emphasizing that battlefield victories alone are unlikely to force Russia to end the war. Kellogg argued that reducing Russia&apos;s oil revenues to $45 per barrel, its breakeven point, could weaken Moscow&apos;s financial resilience and force it to seek a settlement. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed on Jan. 24 that Russia is ready for talks with Trump, whom he described as having a &quot;pragmatic and trusting&quot; relationship with Moscow. Reuters reported on Jan. 23 that Putin is increasingly concerned about the country&apos;s economy, citing five undisclosed sources. Throughout the war, Ukraine&apos;s Western allies have imposed significant sanctions aimed at crippling Russia&apos;s ability to sustain its military aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/incoming-trump-peace-envoy-suggests-oil-crackdown-to-push-russia-to-negotiate/	2025-01-24T10:52:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1242112038.jpg
Ukraine to boost energy resilience with focus on distributed generation, PM says	Ukraine is ramping up efforts to strengthen its energy resilience through the development of distributed generation and increased domestic gas production, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Jan. 24. The government plans to commission nearly 900 megawatts (MW) of distributed generation facilities this year, part of a broader effort to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s energy sector amid ongoing Russian strikes targeting critical infrastructure. Shmyhal said that in 2024, 233 generating units with a total capacity of over 830 MW were connected, including gas turbines, pistons, and cogeneration units. &quot;In order to strengthen and develop our energy sector, we are also investing in increasing Ukrainian gas production,&quot; he added. Repairs and reconstruction of the Ukrainian energy sector are ongoing, the prime minister added. &quot;About 4 gigawatts (GW) of thermal and hydropower capacity was restored in 2024,&quot; he said, &quot;this year, it is planned to restore about 3 GW more.&quot; Under martial law, the government has exempted energy equipment imports from value-added tax to support the restoration and creation of new distributed generation facilities. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure, including a Jan. 15 attack that targeted facilities at one of the largest natural gas storage sites in Lviv Oblast. President Volodymyr Zelensky noted the timing and intent of the strikes, writing, &quot;It&apos;s the middle of winter, and Russia&apos;s goal remains the same: our energy sector.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-boost-energy-resilience-with-focus-on-distributed-generation-pm-says/	2025-01-24T10:01:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1601918605.jpg
What leverage does Trump have over Putin in peace negotiations? Quite a lot, experts say	Only days after U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House, he dialed up the heat on Russia with a threat of sanctions, tariffs, and negotiating &quot;the hard way&quot; if Russian President Vladimir Putin fails to come to the table for a peace deal with Ukraine. Trump has repeatedly promised to push for a swift peace settlement once in office, prompting fears from some that he might pressure Kyiv towards painful concessions or &#x2014; at worst &#x2014; what would amount to a surrender. His recent comments, however, suggest that Trump could be ready to take a hard line with Russia. &quot;In negotiations, it&#x2019;s about who needs a deal the most,&quot; says Timothy Ash, an associate fellow at the Chatham House&apos;s Russia and Eurasia Program. &quot;I think the leverage is with Trump, not Putin.&quot; Trump has leverage in economic, military, and diplomatic terms &#x2014; &#xA0;the main question is his willingness to use it. Russia&#x2019;s economy is showing signs of weakness, making Putin more vulnerable than ever to additional economic pressure like sanctions. Ramped-up support for Ukraine on the battlefield could add to Russia&#x2019;s mounting losses and further incentivize dealmaking, as would uniting support among allies and squeezing Russia on the diplomatic stage. &quot;A long war doesn&#x2019;t hurt Trump very much. There&apos;s no huge cost to the U.S. economy. No U.S. lives are in danger,&quot; said Ash, adding that a large portion of U.S. military aid has been reinvested in its domestic defense industry. &quot;Trump can carry on, whereas for Putin, it just gets more difficult for him the longer it goes.&quot; The Trump administration is already signaling that sanctions are at the forefront of their negotiating plans with Russia. &quot;If a deal is not reached, I will have no other choice but to put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries,&quot; Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social Jan. 22. Earlier in the month, Bloomberg reported that the administration has begun forming its sanctions strategy and will likely take one of two approaches: offering targeted relief to Russian oil producers to incentivize negotiations or significantly expanding sanctions to ramp up pressure. Sanctions are &quot;the best leverage we have,&quot; said Edward Fishman, a senior research scholar at Columbia University&#x2019;s Center on Global Energy Policy and author of the forthcoming book &quot;Chokepoints: American Power in the Age of Economic Warfare.&quot; While the Group of Seven countries and the previous U.S. administration under President Joe Biden imposed heavy economic sanctions on Russia shortly after the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, they included significant carve-outs aimed at not disrupting the global energy markets. After a contraction in 2022, aggressive defense spending contributed to Russia&#x2019;s economic growth for the past two years, suggesting the effect of the sanctions has reduced after Russia&#x2019;s economy adjusted and discovered workarounds. But Russia&#x2019;s economy is now showing cracks, said Fishman, and, &quot;in the last 10 days of the Biden administration, the U.S. imposed pretty significant sanctions on Russia&apos;s oil and gas sector that meaningfully enhanced the pressure on Russia&apos;s economy.&quot; The last-minute sanctions from the outgoing administration are likely intended to provide Trump with a strong negotiating hand in future talks. The new sanctions close many of the energy loopholes and could reduce Russian oil exports by between half a million and a million barrels per day in the short term.

(Contributor / Getty Images)&quot;Russia&#x2019;s economy is not doing very well,&quot; Fishman said, pointing to projections of stalled growth in 2025 and high inflation and interest rates. &quot;Turning up the heat now even more on Russia could really be what we need to get Russia to negotiate.&quot; A powerful sanctions strategy will first require convincing Putin that the U.S. has no plans to reduce current sanctions or enforcement, said Fishman, so Russia can&#x2019;t just wait them out. There are many other sanction targets available to Trump if he wants to up the pressure ahead of negotiations, Fishman also noted. Chief among them would be sanctioning Russia&#x2019;s energy giants Rosneft, Lukoil, and Gazprom, which have so far escaped direct sanctions. Keith Kellogg, Trump&#x2019;s Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia, has said that the administration&#x2019;s goal is to end the war within 100 days. While sanctions are one incentive to negotiate, &quot;their impact is likely not to be truly dangerous for Putin for several more months,&quot; former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John E. Herbst told the Kyiv Independent. In the meantime, Putin has a stronger incentive to seize more territory from Ukraine and try to kick Ukrainian forces out of Kursk before negotiating, Herbst said. &quot;It&#x2019;s a great embarrassment to Putin that Ukraine&apos;s been occupying Kursk for almost six months.&quot; While Russia has gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast over the past year, it has come at the cost of record troop losses. Ukraine&#x2019;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said earlier this month that Russia&#x2019;s military losses this year will surpass losses from the previous two years combined, and the U.K. has estimated that losses could surpass one million in the next six months. &quot;I think the only way to get Putin to move faster in the short term would be for a new Trump-approved aid package to Ukraine full of weapons,&quot; said Herbst. The package wouldn&#x2019;t need to be a gift, noted Herbst, but could be a loan, or funded by frozen Russian assets or European partners. Alternatively, he said, other countries could purchase weapons for Ukraine, or the Trump administration could push for a transfer of the approximately $300 billion in frozen Russian assets, an option that has been previously discussed.

(Genya Savilov / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;That might force Putin&apos;s hand in the right direction. Although, even then, it&apos;s unclear if Putin&apos;s willing to compromise,&quot; Herbst said. Beyond weapons, supporting Ukraine with non-military financial and humanitarian aid would indirectly help Ukraine on the battlefield, by giving the country more leeway to keep fighting. Regardless of how Trump chooses to wield the military and economic leverage available to him, Trump will need to use diplomacy to bring Putin to the negotiating table and secure a peace deal. Any diplomatic maneuvering will need to not just include Ukraine and Russia but to take their allies into consideration. &quot;First, there needs to be a clear demonstration of unity among Ukraine, Europe, and the United States as to what we&apos;re trying to achieve,&quot; said Thomas Graham, a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of &quot;Getting Russia Right.&quot; &quot;The less daylight there is between the Ukrainians, the Europeans, and the Americans, the greater leverage that President Trump will have in dealing with Putin.&quot; One way to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s diplomatic position would be more movement in E.U. accession talks, Graham said. Ukraine would still need additional socioeconomic and political reforms, but it would signal long-term commitment from the West to further integrate Ukraine into a pan-European economic bloc. Demonstrating that the West is prepared to provide security guarantees would send a signal as well, said Graham.

(Sean Gallup / Getty Images)Ukraine is painfully aware of the limits of security guarantees outside of NATO membership or the commitment of NATO troops, following the repeated failure of the Minsk Agreements to contain Russia after its 2014 invasion. Trump has already ruled out offering Ukraine NATO membership, but many countries have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine since 2014. Consolidating these piecemeal agreements and providing resources to back up the agreements would be one way to give them more teeth, according to Graham. Finally, said Graham, pressure on Iran and China could further isolate Russia and complicate its international position. Iran&#x2019;s security situation has deteriorated due to the collapse of Syria&#x2019;s Assad regime in December and recent tensions with Israel. Pressure on Iran, one of Russia&#x2019;s most important allies for its war in Ukraine, could force the country to reallocate resources to addressing its own security concerns, rather than supplying Russia. &quot;And,&quot; said Graham, &quot;there are ties and conversations that we can have with the Chinese that will perhaps encourage China to be less supportive of Russia than they have up to this point.&quot; A previous peace proposal that Trump&#x2019;s team described before his inauguration ruled out Ukrainian membership in NATO for at least 20 years. &quot;And that did not impress the Russians. They still trashed Trump&#x2019;s peace initiative,&quot; pointed out former Ambassador Herbst. In contrast, Herbst said, Trump&#x2019;s team has seen President Volodymyr Zelensky signal willingness to compromise on territory, a softening of Ukraine&#x2019;s long-standing position that any peace deal must return all captured land to Ukraine. &quot;At this point, only the Ukrainians are showing some willingness to actually compromise,&quot; he said. But apart from Trump&#x2019;s comments threatening economic pressure, his administration has given little indication of its strategy for negotiations with Russia, all the experts who spoke with the Kyiv Independent noted. &quot;We have very little insight into what the administration is thinking at this point,&quot; explained Graham.	https://kyivindependent.com/what-leverage-does-trump-have-over-putin-in-peace-negotiations/	2025-01-24T09:19:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194071518.jpg
Ukraine reforming recruitment system to attract 18-25-year-olds, senior official says	Ukraine is finalizing reforms to attract 18- to 25-year-olds, currently exempt from mobilization, into enlisting voluntarily into the armed forces, Deputy Head of the President&apos;s Office Pavlo Palisa said to the Associated Press on Jan. 24. Palisa said Ukraine is exploring new recruitment options because the current drafting system, inherited from Soviet times, is outdated and inefficient. The move comes amid pressure from U.S. lawmakers to lower the draft age, though President Volodymyr Zelensky has opposed lowering it to 18, arguing it would harm Ukraine&apos;s future prospects. &quot;We need to adapt the structure to the logic of modern warfare, which will allow us to be more effective and prevent us from making the same mistakes repeatedly,&quot; Palisa said. One key initiative is an &quot;honest contract,&quot; which offers financial incentives, training guarantees, and improved communication between soldiers and commanders. &quot;To secure the unit commander and the contract soldier, establish open and professional relations between them, and set clear boundaries that are understandable to both,&quot; Palisa said. The updates to Ukraine&apos;s mobilization law, adopted in mid-April 2024, simplified the process for identifying eligible conscripts and introduced penalties for draft dodgers. The new legislation also lowered the minimum age of compulsory military service from 27 to 25. Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 are barred from leaving the country under martial law, but only those over 25 are eligible for the draft. Russian forces significantly outnumber Ukrainian units in some parts of the front and have been able to advance at record rates in eastern Ukraine while absorbing heavy losses.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-finalizes-draft-reform-to-attract-18-to-25-year-olds-media-reports/	2025-01-24T09:03:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-01-at-12.29.54-1.jpg
Trump accuses Russia of stealing plans for U.S. hypersonic missile	President Donald Trump has accused Russia of stealing U.S. plans for a hypersonic missile during the administration of President Barack Obama, telling Fox News&apos;s Sean Hannity on Jan.23 that &quot;some bad person gave them the design.&quot; &quot;Russia stole the design, they got it from us,&quot; Trump said, adding the U.S. is developing &quot;super hypersonic missiles... which is even a step better.&quot; Trump offered no evidence to back up his claim, but he previously raised the accusation in 2023, saying Russia had stolen plans for what he described as &quot;super-duper missiles.&quot; The U.S., China, India, and Russia are the only countries to have developed hypersonic missiles, of which Russia&apos;s Zircon is reported to be the fastest. Moscow has previously said the Zircon hypersonic missile entered the arsenal of the Russian army in early 2023, claiming that it has a range of 600&#x2013;1,500 kilometers, can travel at Mach 9, and has a warhead weighing about 300-400 kilograms. Russia has used Zircon missiles &#x2014; originally designed as an anti-ship missile &#x2014; to attack Ukrainian cities, with the first recorded case being in February 2024. The Kremlin has previously denied accusations it stole hypersonic missile technology, insisting they have developed their own. Elsewhere, Trump said that he wanted to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin as soon as possible to end the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Jan. 23. Trump also said that he wanted to explore reductions in nuclear arms. &quot;I really would like to be able to meet with President Putin soon to get that war ended,&quot; Trump said via video link, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos. &quot;It&#x2019;s a carnage. And we really have to stop that war.&quot; Later, speaking at the White House, Trump reiterated his readiness to meet Putin immediately. &quot;Every day we don&#x2019;t meet, soldiers are being killed on the battlefield,&quot; he said. Trump also claimed that President Volodymyr Zelensky had told him he was open to considering a deal to end the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-accuses-russia-of-stealing-plans-for-u-s-hypersonic-missile/	2025-01-24T07:39:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2195038636.jpg
Putin claims Russia ready for Ukraine peace talks, questions legitimacy under Zelensky's decree	Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters on Jan. 24 that Russia is ready for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump on ending the war in Ukraine. &quot;Regarding negotiations, we have always said &#x2014; and I want to emphasize this again &#x2014; that we are ready for talks on the Ukrainian issue (Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion),&quot; Putin said. However, Putin moved quickly to point out a decree signed by President Zelensky after Russia illegally annexed four Ukrainian regions, which declared negotiations with Putin &quot;impossible&quot; while leaving the door open to discussions with Russia under different leadership. &quot;How can negotiations be resumed if they are officially banned?&quot; Putin asked. He emphasized that Russia has &quot;never refused contact&quot; with the U.S. administration and maintained a &quot;pragmatic and trusting&quot; relationship with Trump. Zelensky&apos;s 2022 decree followed Russia&apos;s annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, actions condemned as illegitimate by the international community. The move reflected Ukraine&apos;s refusal to engage with Moscow while Putin remains in power, underscoring Kyiv&apos;s position that peace negotiations must uphold Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-claims-russia-ready-for-ukraine-talks-questions-legitimacy-under-zelenskys-decree/	2025-01-24T07:29:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1572073087.jpg
Utter bulls***' — Ukraine rejects Russia's demand to abandon NATO membership promise	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry dismissed Russia&apos;s demand to cancel NATO&apos;s 2008 promise of eventual membership for Ukraine, calling it &quot;utter bul***it&quot; in a Jan. 24 statement. The response comes after Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko criticized NATO&apos;s 2008 Bucharest Summit declaration, calling it &quot;catastrophic for European security.&quot; &quot;Aw shucks, North Korea&apos;s ally issuing ultimatums to NATO. Utter bul***it,&quot; said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi in response to Grushko&apos;s remarks. &quot;Moscow has no say here.&quot; Instead, the ministry praised NATO&apos;s decision at the time and reiterated Kyiv&apos;s commitment to joining the alliance. &quot;European security architecture is built on protection from Russia,&quot; Tykhyi said. Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. While NATO members pledged at the 2024 Washington Summit that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; they have yet to extend a formal invitation. Russian officials, as well as Western intellectuals with a track record of anti-Ukraine narratives have repeatedly cited Ukraine&apos;s potential NATO membership as a justification for the invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged opposition from several NATO members, including the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia, but expressed hope that U.S. President Donald Trump could sway support for Kyiv&apos;s entry. There is little evidence that the new administration would be more open to Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership than former U.S. President Joe Biden. Trump has previously criticized NATO and blamed Biden for allegedly supporting Ukraine&apos;s aspirations and provoking Russia&apos;s invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/utter-bul-it-ukraine-rejects-russias-demand-to-abandon-nato-membership-promise/	2025-01-24T07:06:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2166614075.jpg
Media investigation identifies over 90,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine	The BBC and the independent outlet Mediazona have identified the names of 90,019 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the BBC reported on Jan. 24. Since the media outlets&apos; last update in mid-January, the names of 1,964 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties. Some 23% of all those killed were military personnel who signed a contract with the Russian Defense Ministry after February 2022. According to the investigation, 17% of the identified soldiers were professional contractors, 17% were convicts who left for the war from prisons, and 12% were conscripts. The media revealed that nine generals and 500 soldiers with the rank of lieutenant colonel and higher were among the killed. As of Jan. 24, the highest casualty rates were among the residents of Bashkortostan, Russia&#x2019;s republic near the Ural Mountains and the homeland of the Bashkir people. Russia&#x2019;s non-Slavic ethnic groups have been overrepresented in its casualty figures in the war with Ukraine. The authorities and media in this region reported a total of 3,932 deaths during the full-scale war, the investigation read. Russia&apos;s real losses are likely higher, as the media analysis is estimated to cover 45% to 65% of the actual death toll, the BBC reported. According to the journalists&#x2019; estimates, the actual losses could range from 138,500 to 200,000 people killed. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 8 that about 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed during the full-scale invasion. The last time Moscow officially announced the number of soldiers killed was in September 2022, putting the number at 5,937. Ukraine&#x2019;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 19 that Russian forces suffered their heaviest losses last year since the start of the full-scale war, with total military losses reaching 434,000 soldiers killed and injured in 2024. This represents around half of the 800,000 killed and injured Russian soldiers since the start of the full-scale war, according to Ukraine&#x2019;s military.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-identifies-over-90-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine/	2025-01-24T06:12:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1240558742.jpg
Ukraine repatriates 757 bodies of fallen soldiers	Ukraine brought back the bodies of 757 soldiers who died fighting against Russia, the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of the Prisoners of War announced on Jan. 24. The bodies of 451 soldiers were recovered from the Donetsk sector of the front line, 71 from the Bakhmut sector, and 51 from the Vuhledar sector. Thirteen and 137 bodies were brought back from the Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia sectors, respectively. Another 34 bodies were repatriated from morgues in Russia. The Geneva Conventions say that those killed in war are entitled to a dignified burial. &quot;Law enforcement officials and forensic experts will identify the victims as soon as possible,&quot; the headquarters wrote. The operation to recover the bodies involved several government and military agencies, including the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the Interior Ministry, the State Emergency Service, and the Armed Forces. The headquarters also thanked the International Committee of the Red Cross for its assistance. In December 2024, Ukraine repatriated the bodies of 503 fallen soldiers, mostly from Donetsk Oblast. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 8 that about 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed during the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-repatriates-757-bodies/	2025-01-24T05:22:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1251615116.jpg
Investigation: How Russia profits from arms exports to Saudi Arabia despite sanctions	Few agreements are shrouded in more secrecy than inter-government arms deals &#x2014; especially when one of the parties is a global pariah leading a bloody war. But a recent massive leak of emails and documents has given us an unprecedented glimpse into a particularly secretive transaction. The leak reveals that Saudi Arabia agreed to pay Russia over 2 billion euros under a contract signed in 2021 involving companies that were repeatedly sanctioned, both before and after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Saudi Arabia doesn&#x2019;t appear to have canceled the contract after the invasion started, despite the risk of repercussions from the U.S. &#x2014; a major supplier of weapons to Saudi Arabia. Data included in the leak also shows that Russia has continued to sell arms to up to a dozen countries since the start of its invasion of Ukraine, bolstering its defense production and war effort. Apart from Saudi Arabia, the documents reveal contracts with traditional buyers of Russian weapons, such as India, China, or Algeria, none of which have stopped buying arms from Russia. The Kyiv Independent, in partnership with OCCRP, obtained a leak containing thousands of internal emails of Roselectronics, a subsidiary of Russia&apos;s state arms giant Rostec. Arms exports have traditionally been one of Russia&#x2019;s biggest sources of revenue, although far behind oil and gas. These revenues are now being used to support Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. Sanctions imposed after the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine have significantly reduced the country&#x2019;s arms exports. Still, Russia has managed to continue trade with a dozen countries that have not imposed sanctions on Moscow, making it the world&#x2019;s third-largest weapons exporter in 2023. The leak reveals the relentless efforts of Russian arms manufacturers to sustain exports during the war. Exports help support Russia&#x2019;s arms industry and fuel its war machine, despite numerous sanctions imposed over its assault on Ukraine. Analysts say the sales also serve as Russia&#x2019;s &#x201C;tool of influence,&#x201D; strengthening its alliances and helping it secure votes at the United Nations. Russia may have even obtained access to Western weapons technologies through its arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Even in internal documentation and letters, Russia maintains some secrecy when it comes to the foreign governments who buy their weapons. As the leak shows, instead of directly naming the countries that purchase their military products, Russia uses a system that assigns a code to foreign countries, known in Russian as the &#x201C;All-Russian Classifier of Countries of the World.&#x201D; For example, &#x201C;foreign customer 012&#x201D; stands for Algeria. In 2022, Russia was going to supply Algeria with its Acacia-E automatic aerospace defense system, according to the leak. When reporting on deliveries of the Post-3M radio reconnaissance station to Iran in 2021, the letters describe the buyer as &#x201C;foreign customer 364.&#x201D; When mentioning the supply of Polyana-D4M1 command and control system to Egypt, planned for 2025, they code the buyer as &quot;foreign customer 818.&quot; Yet not all the codes are so easy to decipher. The leak contains a contract encoded in a special way &#x2014; Project 82P. There is no such country code as &#x201C;82P,&#x201D; and the client country isn&#x2019;t mentioned in almost any of the letters that concerned the project. It appears that this contract was more sensitive than others. &quot;All the information related to interaction with the foreign customer specified in the contract is subject to restriction,&quot; one of the letters on Project 82P reads. It also says that to keep the details of the contract secret, Russia planned to sign separate confidentiality agreements with the banks involved in the project. Having analyzed hundreds of letters mentioning Project 82P, the Kyiv Independent can confirm that this code stands for an agreement with Saudi Arabia to supply Pantsir air defense systems. The &quot;82&quot; is a part of the country code for Saudi Arabia (682), and the letter &quot;P&quot; could be referring to the product name &#x2014; Pantsir. Within the contract, the Russian side was to supply Saudi Arabia with the Russian Pantsir-S1M system and provide additional services related to it. The Pantsir is a self-propelled air defense missile and gun system. It can shoot down missiles, airplanes, helicopters, aerial bombs, and drones. The system itself is a large truck equipped with missiles and anti-aircraft guns, which can be used alone or in battery together with a command post and radar truck. It recently gained notoriety, as a Russian Pantsir-S battery is alleged to have brought down the Azerbaijan Airlines flight on Dec. 25, killing 38 people.

(Emergency Situations of Kazakhstan/Anadolu via Getty Images)2 billion euros for Russian military productionWhile the deal was secret, some evidence surfaced in 2024 that Saudi Arabia obtained Russia&#x2019;s Pantsir systems. In February 2024, a photo appeared online showing a man, allegedly a Saudi soldier, posing next to a Pantsir with a training certificate in his hand. At the end of the year, the Saudi Air Defense&#x2019;s Bulletin listed the Pantsir among its new air defense systems. No other details were provided. With the leaked Roselectronics emails, the Kyiv Independent can piece together how Saudi Arabia obtained the Russian air defense systems. The emails reveal not only the high value of the contract but also how Saudi money flows directly to Russian military companies united under the Rostec brand. According to the leaked documents, Saudi Arabia agreed to pay 2.17 billion euros for the supply of Pantsir batteries, additional equipment and ammunition, and the training of operators. A battery is a military tactical unit consisting of several pieces of artillery working together. A Pantsir battery usually includes up to six pieces. According to various references to the contract found in the leaked emails, Saudi Arabia ordered anywhere from six to 10 Pantsir batteries. In more detail, the contract description includes 39 combat vehicles, 10 command post units, nine radio command vehicles, 20 loader vehicles, hundreds of missiles, and tens of thousands of cartridges. To maintain the Pantsirs, Saudi Arabia also ordered seven repair vehicles, five evacuation trucks, seven fuel servicing trucks, seven storage and transportation vehicles, and other equipment. They bought various simulators to train the Saudi military and planned three training rounds. The contract was signed on April 8, 2021, and was expected to last 58 months &#x2014; that is, until 2026. The Saudi Defense Ministry made an advance payment of 15% of the contract, or 326 million euros, on Aug. 5, 2021, feeding the Russian military machine with cash just six months before Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Delivery of the first batch of the air defense systems and related equipment was scheduled for the end of 2023. International trade records found in the ImportGenius database show that at the end of November 2023, Rosoboronexport made two shipments of four units of &#x201C;new special purpose motor vehicles&#x201D; to Saudi Arabia. The description is vague but the trademark of the vehicles, the names of Russian shippers and a Saudi consignee, and the cargo delivery point &#x2014; an air defense base in Jeddah &#x2014; indicate that the vehicles were supplied under the Pantsir contract. The leaked Russian documents also show how many subsidiaries of the Russian arms conglomerate Rostec, which is sanctioned by many countries for its role in the war against Ukraine, benefit from the Pantsir exports. Here&#x2019;s how Saudi money moved through the Russian arms holding. The advance payment went from the Saudi Defense Ministry to Rosoboronexport. This state company, a part of the Rostec conglomerate, acts as an intermediary for all of Russia&apos;s military exports and imports, receives payments, takes a commission for contract management, and subsequently transfers the rest of the money to the contractors. Following receipt of the advance payment, Rosoboronexport distributed the bulk of the funds to state-owned Russian arms producers &#x2014; Shipunov Design Bureau, known as the developer of the Pantsir complex, United Instrument Manufacturing Corporation (also known under its Russian acronym, OPK), the managing company of the Roselectronics holding, Sozvezdie Concern, the Scientific Research Institute of Communication and Automated Control Systems (NIISSU), the truck producer KAMAZ&#x2019; subsidiary Remdizel and others. Each entity has a role in the contract. For example, OPK has been appointed as the radio command vehicles supplier, while Sozvezdie Concern and NIISSU are its main co-executors. Russian KAMAZ and its subsidiary Remdizel produce the chassis for the system. All these companies are currently subject to numerous international sanctions either for their role in the deployment of Russian military technologies on the battlefield in Ukraine or for providing a substantial source of revenue to the Russian government during the war. Rosoboronexport has also been repeatedly subject to U.S. sanctions within a nonproliferation program against Iran, Syria, and North Korea. The latest Iran-related sanctions were imposed on Rosoboronexport in 2023. Rostec was subject to U.S. sanctions before 2022, including for its connection with Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and military cooperation with China. Sanctions on Rostec companies involved in the production and supply of the Pantsir system. (Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)The transfer of Russian technology to Saudi ArabiaAccording to the leak, the delivery of Pantsir batteries and additional equipment is only part of the 82P Project. In addition to the 2-billion-euro contract, the documents describing the project mention a second major part of the cooperation. The contract for it, even three contracts, was not yet signed in the first half of 2022, but was already being discussed. This includes localizing Russian Pantsir systems production in Saudi Arabia, establishing maintenance centers in the country, and creating a training center. The future localization of production was Saudi Arabia&apos;s requirement to sign the first contract to supply air defense systems. A leaked letter titled &#x201C;Localization Plan&#x201D; contains a 69-page document entitled Proposal for the Localization of the Pantsir-S1M Complex Production. The proposal includes three localization programs. The first describes the large-scale assembly of 15 Pantsir batteries in Saudi Arabia. The second localization program establishes a network of service centers for Pantsir maintenance (five regional and one central repair workshop). The third program involves building a training center in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia&apos;s second-largest city and &quot;economic capital.&quot; The center would require the construction of a 15,000-square-metre study building. Although none of the three contracts had been signed during the time period covered by the leak, the leaked documents mentioned that Saudi Arabia was ready to sign the assembling production contract in the second half of 2022. If the contracts were indeed signed, Russia could receive even more than 2 billion euros from Saudi Arabia over the next few years. Russia&apos;s war with Ukraine, though, could have affected the fate of any joint Pantsir assembly in Saudi Arabia, as the war has allegedly already affected a couple of other Russian export contracts. &quot;There was a report that Russia had taken away the shells made for Azerbaijan because it needed them in the war against Ukraine,&quot; Ivan Kirichevsky, an analyst at Defense Express, reported. &quot;Another report indicates that Russian T-90S export tanks intended to be sold to India, Algeria, or Vietnam were also spotted on the battlefield in Ukraine. So there are some doubts as to whether Russians can reach the next stage of the Saudi contract &#x2014; the organization of joint production. They are now highly dependent on imports of various equipment and electronic components. This may affect co-production arrangements.&quot; The Pantsir contract carries with it the risk of Russia becoming familiar with Western technologies through its cooperation with Saudi Arabia. The country is a major buyer of U.S. weaponry and buys arms from South Korea and EU countries, including air defense systems. &quot;Saudi Arabia is one of the major operators of Patriot systems. Whether the Russians could have gained access to them is a sensitive issue,&quot; said Ivan Kirichevsky, an analyst at Defense Express, a Kyiv-based military think tank. &quot;The U.S. has demonstrated that it is sensitive to the risk of transferring its technology to third parties.&#x201D; Kirichevsky cites the example of Turkey. In 2020, four months before the Russian-Saudi agreement was signed, the U.S. slapped sanctions on Turkey over a purchase of the Russian S-400 missile system. The risk of Russians accessing U.S. technology is high since the Project 82P also includes &#x201C;integration&#x201D; services, meaning integrating the Pantsir complex into Saudi Arabia&apos;s command, communications, and intelligence system.

(Sergei Savostyanov / Pool / AFP via Getty Images)Those services would be performed by Russian specialists, who could obtain access to the existing Saudi arsenal, which is stuffed with U.S. weapons. Moreover, Russia appeared to have asked for this access. In October 2021, some six months after signing the contract, Saudi Arabia&apos;s representatives met with the Russian side in Moscow to discuss the execution of Project 82P. The Kyiv Independent found the meeting&#x2019;s minutes in Russian companies&#x2019; emails. The emails mention an upcoming trip by Russian representatives to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, scheduled for May 2022. While discussing the meeting, the Russian side requested to visit Saudi air defense facilities &#x2014; and received consent. They started making preparations for the trip like booking the hotel, car rental, and buying tickets. The obtained email leak covers the time up until May 2022, the same month when the trip was supposed to take place. While the Kyiv Independent can&#x2019;t confirm that the trip took place, there was no sign it was canceled either. The Saudi Defense Ministry did not respond to a written inquiry from the Kyiv Independent. Russia&#x2019;s efforts show it&#x2019;s highly interested in selling arms and military technology abroad, despite its massive need for weapons for its war against Ukraine. &#xA0; According to one of the leaked letters, in June 2022, four months after the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, state arms exporter Rosoboronexport held a three-day meeting with arms manufacturers in St. Petersburg. The event was private, with no public mentions of it. The topic was promoting Russia&apos;s anti-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipment &quot;with high export potential.&quot; A Rosoboronexport representative held a presentation on how export sales could be boosted. Two months later, in August 2022, Rosoboronexport hosted a different event, this time a public one. Its seven-day International Military-Technical Forum aimed to secure new arms sales contracts. It reportedly attracted delegations from 50 countries. Local media made no secret of Russia&#x2019;s efforts to interest foreign delegations in a wide range of military products, including tanks, armored vehicles, UAVs and anti-UAVs, air defense systems, rifles, mortars, and fighter aircraft. Similar events were held in 2023 and 2024 and are planned for 2025. Trying so hard to sell weapons abroad while leading a resource-demanding war may seem like an odd thing to do but there are at least two good reasons for Russia to pursue it: high export revenue and strengthening geopolitical ties. Arms under export contracts are traditionally sold at a higher price than those supplied to the domestic army. &quot;The policy of arms export contracts is always the same: You sell your products to someone for export at a premium to supply your army at a lower cost,&quot; said Kirichevsky, an analyst at Defense Express. &quot;The price of the 2 billion euros for six Pantsir batteries seems very high, even when it includes additional equipment and training for the military.&quot; Although Russia&#x2019;s export capacity started crumbling after the start of Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, it remained a significant exporter of military products. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) compared data on Russian arms exports for two periods: 2014-2018 and 2019-2023. The institute found that, between those two periods, the volume of Russian arms exports fell by 53%. The number of countries willing to buy Russian arms has also decreased, but 12 countries were still buying Russian weapons in 2023. Leaked letters show that Rosoboronexport received new export inquiries after Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. In spring 2022, soon after the world learned about the Russian massacre of civilians in Ukraine&#x2019;s Bucha and other places, the Russian defense conglomerate received new inquiries from potential clients. The leaked emails show that Armenia inquired about a possible delivery of the Ranzhir-M1, a command center unit for air defense systems. Meanwhile, Venezuela was interested in Pishchal-Pro and Kupol complexes, the systems that take down unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs. The Kyiv Independent was unable to find confirmation of such deliveries in public sources, or in the customs records available through leaks. Russia also continued to work on executing contracts signed in previous years. There are no mentions of any contracts canceled by either side after the start of the invasion. In 2022, Rostec worked on contracts with China, India, Algeria, Egypt, Belarus, and several other countries, all of which continued to receive military supplies from Russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and new sanctions against the Russian defense companies. Experts say that Russia is motivated to sell its weapons abroad not only by money but by the prospect of establishing or strengthening of geopolitical ties. &#xA0; &quot;Russia sees arms sales as another tool of statecraft. It&apos;s a tactic,&quot; Anna Borshchevskaya, a senior fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, says. &quot;It&apos;s not independent of foreign policy, and so arms sales will strengthen bilateral ties between countries on a political level. It&apos;s a tool of influence from the Russian perspective.&quot; According to Agiya Zagrebelska, a Ukrainian sanctions expert and representative of the NGO Economic Security Council of Ukraine, the result of such ties can be seen in the countries&apos; votes at the UN. Although the allegiance to Russia is not as clear as in the case of Belarus, China, or Iran, Saudi Arabia has abstained from more than half of the UN votes for resolutions on Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. (See the chart) How countries buying Russian weapons vote at the UN. (Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)On the one hand, the country voted for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. However, it abstained from voting on resolutions on the suspension of Russia&#x2019;s rights of membership in the Human Rights Council and on remedy and reparation for aggression against Ukraine. Saudi Arabia has also helped to free foreigners imprisoned by the Russian military and brought together 42 countries in Jeddah to find ways to end the Russian war in Ukraine. It has also allegedly threatened the G7 against seizing Russia&#x2019;s frozen assets, according to Bloomberg&#x2019;s sources. The country has also promised to provide Ukraine with $400 million in humanitarian aid while pledging billions to Russia&#x2019;s military enterprises. Yet even with rich clients like Saudi Arabia, the volume of Russia&#x2019;s arms exports has fallen in recent years. Due to Western sanctions, it has become both difficult and costly for Russia to import Western equipment and electronic components it still needs for defense production. Some reports also suggest that Russia deployed some of the weapons meant for export to the front line in Ukraine. This makes Russia an increasingly problematic supplier. Hey! This is Alisa Yurchenko, the author of this story. Thank you for reading it. I spent the past two months reading leaked internal correspondence of Russian state defense companies. The letters were scattered and out of order, so I had to reconstruct their timeline like a jigsaw puzzle. But it was all worth it. I was glad to reveal how many sanctioned Russian military companies profit from a major arms export deal. Understanding this is crucial as such deals bolster Russian defense industry and the country&#x2019;s geopolitical standing &#x2014; all while Russia is waging a full-scale war. We are not done with this particular leak, however. We are still analyzing it and will soon share insights about Russia&apos;s efforts to source foreign components for its defense industry.

Russia says ban on Ukraine’s NATO accession ’key’ condition for resolving war	Moscow sees a ban on Ukraine&#x2019;s entry to NATO as a key condition in resolving the Russia-Ukraine war, the pro-Kremlin news agency Interfax reported on Jan. 24, citing Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko. &quot;And will not only seek ironclad international guarantees that will prevent Ukraine&#x2019;s membership in NATO in any form, but we will also insist it will become a policy of the alliance itself,&quot; Grushko said on air on the Rossiya-24 television channel. The statement comes amid expectations of peace talks in 2025 as U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table and end the full-scale war that has been ongoing for nearly three years. &quot;For us, this is one of the key elements of a possible deal on the conflict in Ukraine, this relates to the elimination of the root causes of this conflict,&quot; Grushko said about putting an end to Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO prospects. The Russian deputy minister lashed out against the NATO Bucharest Summit&#x2019;s resolution from 2008 that Ukraine and Georgia would eventually become members of the alliance. Grushko called the statement &quot;catastrophic for European security&quot; and said a failure to withdraw it would create an &quot;unacceptable ambiguity&quot; for Russia. Despite the allied pledge, Kyiv and Tbilisi failed to obtain the Membership Action Plan at the summit. Ukraine officially submitted its application to NATO in September 2022 in the wake of the full-scale invasion. Though pledging that Ukraine&#x2019;s path toward membership is &quot;irreversible&quot; at the allied summit in Washington in 2024, NATO members have yet to extend a formal invitation. Russian officials have previously listed Ukraine&#x2019;s possible entry into NATO as one of the justifications for launching the full-scale invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that several NATO countries &#x2013; namely the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia &#x2013; continue to oppose Ukraine&#x2019;s membership but voiced his belief that Trump could sway all the members should he decide to support Kyiv&#x2019;s entry. There is little evidence that the new Trump administration would be more open to accepting Ukraine into NATO than former U.S. President Joe Biden. Trump even attacked Biden over alleged support for Kyiv&apos;s aspirations, claiming it provoked Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/moscow-names-ban-on-ukraines-nato-accession-key-demand-in-potential-talks/	2025-01-24T04:46:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2161623541.jpg
Russian army failing to outflank Pokrovsk, Ukraine's military says	The Russian army is failing to outflank Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast in an attempt to cut off the town&apos;s logistics routes, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, Viktor Trehubov, said on Jan. 24 on national television. The area near Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian forces, has been the focus of fierce fighting for months as Russia intensifies its offensive in Donetsk Oblast. Russian forces are trying to bypass Pokrovsk from the north and south, but so far without success, according to the spokesperson. &quot;So far, these attempts have been more or less effectively repelled. They have begun to attack the town more actively with long-range, different types of missiles and FPV (first-person-view) drones,&quot; Trehubov said. &quot;Unfortunately, they are hitting the town, but their plan to surround it is still very far from realization,&quot; he added. The estimated Russian advance in the Pokrovsk sector in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 23, 2025, according to DeepState. Pokrovsk marked by a black symbol. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Trehubov stressed that the Pokrovsk sector of the front line is the primary vector of Russia&apos;s offensive. &quot;This is the main point of concentration of their efforts, and it has been for a long time. There is the largest number of clashes there,&quot; he said. Russian troops are continuing to push on the Lyman, Siversk, Kramatorsk, Toretsk, Pokrovsk and Kurakhove axes, according to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. Pokrovsk and Kurakhove remain the focal points of the Russian eastern offensive, now in its fifth month. Ukraine previously blew up the No. 3 mine&apos;s shaft in the village of Pishchane near Pokrovsk to prevent Russia from deploying its troops closer to the front-line town, according to The New York Times (NYT) Earlier this month, Metinvest announced it had suspended operations at the Pokrovsk coking coal mine due to worsening security conditions and power outages.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-army-fails-to-outflank-pokrovsk-cut-it-off-from-logistics-ukraines-military-says/	2025-01-24T04:33:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184404872.jpg
Trump plans to reach out to North Korea’s Kim Jong Un	U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview on Jan. 23 he intends to again engage North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, signaling a shift from the previous Biden administration. &quot;I&apos;ll reach out to him again,&quot; Trump said in the interview with Fox News. Kim, who Trump lauded as a &quot;smart guy,&quot; has become Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s key ally in a war against Ukraine, providing ballistic missiles and artillery and sending 12,000 troops to fight in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. &quot;He&#x2019;s not a religious zealot. He happens to be a smart guy,&quot; the U.S. president said, adding that he had good relations with Kim during his first presidential term in 2017-2021. The North Korean dictator has grown increasingly assertive in recent years, cementing an alliance with Russia and carrying out new missile tests. This prompted sharp deterioration of relations with the U.S. under the Biden administration and rising tensions on the Korean peninsula. Initially dismissive of the North Korean leader during his first term in office, Trump later engaged Pyongyang in a rare diplomatic effort to halt the North Korean nuclear program and even claimed to have built a warm personal relationship with Kim. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently admitted that Trump&#x2019;s diplomatic efforts did not achieve any &quot;enduring&quot; progress in stalling Pyongyang&#x2019;s nuclear arms development. Trump&#x2019;s return to the White House is expected to bring geopolitical shifts as the president has often voiced sympathies for the U.S.&#x2019;s rivals and authoritarian leaders, like Putin or Kim, while being critical of Washington&#x2019;s allies. The U.S. president said he plans to reach out to Putin and broker a peace deal in Ukraine, threatening with additional sanctions unless Moscow agrees to negotiate.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-plans-to-reach-out-to-north-koreas-kim-jong-un/	2025-01-24T03:45:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1159161640.jpg
Victory means restoring territorial integrity' — Merz reaffirms support for Ukraine ahead of elections	Friedrich Merz, the leading contender to become Germany&apos;s next chancellor, said that if elected, his strategic priorities would include a just end to Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, Der Spiegel reported on Jan. 23. The statement comes after Merz&#x2019;s meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 22. Merz is the chancellor candidate of the conservative CDU/CSU alliance for the February parliamentary elections. The veteran politician has repeatedly criticized sitting Chancellor Olaf Scholz for supposedly hesitant approach in the support of Ukraine and called for the provision of long-range Taurus missiles. Speaking about ending the war, Merz stressed that Ukraine should &quot;win the war&quot; and be free to choose its political and military alliances. &quot;Victory means restoring territorial integrity with a democratically legitimate government exercising full sovereignty,&quot; Merz added. The German politician nevertheless stressed that Germany should not become a party to the war. Germany has become Ukraine&#x2019;s second largest military donor after the U.S., making it Kyiv&#x2019;s leading supporter on the European continent. Berlin&#x2019;s importance in the pro-Ukraine coalition is likely to grow as U.S. President Donald Trump hinted at reducing his country&#x2019;s involvement in the war. While Berlin has allocated 4 billion euros ($4.2 billion) in defense aid for Ukraine in 2025, some ministers of the outgoing coalition government called for an additional 3 billion ($3.15 billion), a step Scholz refuses to take without additional borrowing. The CDU/CSU alliance, whose backing is crucial for any bill to pass the parliament since the ruling coalition lost majority, voiced support for the additional aid package but rejected abandoning the debt break, leading to a legislative impasse.	https://kyivindependent.com/merz-voices-support-for-ukraine-ahead-of-elections/	2025-01-24T03:31:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187620278--1-.jpg
Putin ready to talk to Trump, Kremlin 'awaits signals' from US	Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to hold talks with U.S. President Donald Trump, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Jan. 24 during a press briefing. Trump has previously said he wants to meet with Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; after his inauguration. The Kremlin welcomed Trump&apos;s comments but added that no preparations were currently underway for the meeting. &quot;Putin is ready, we are waiting for signals, everyone is ready... If there is something, we will inform you,&quot; Peskov said. Moscow is ready for talks with Washington on nuclear disarmament as well, but the arsenals of the U.S.&#x2019;s allies &#x2014; the U.K. and France &#x2014; must also be considered, the spokesperson claimed. &quot;In the interests of the whole world, in the interests of the peoples of our countries, of course, we are interested in starting this negotiation process as soon as possible,&quot; he added. Peskov also reacted to Trump&apos;s recent statement that he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which Russia is a member, to lower the oil price and that this would end the war &quot;immediately.&quot; The spokesperson opposed the statement, saying that the war is not dependent on oil prices and is allegedly taking place because of &quot;the danger to Russia and the Russians.&quot; The Trump team hopes to quickly begin work on a settlement plan that could be implemented within the first few months of his presidency. A meeting with Putin is part of the plan, according to CNN. Trump has often voiced sympathies for the Russian leader while criticizing the level of support the previous Biden administration provided to Kyiv. This prompted concerns that the new U.S. leadership might cut a deal unfavorable to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-ready-to-talk-to-trump-kremlin-awaits-signals-from-us/	2025-01-24T02:41:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1251866099.jpg
Ukraine’s UAVs target Russian refinery, plants in massive strike	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and Ukraine&#x2019;s Special Operations Forces (SOS) struck the Ryazan Oil Refinery and the Ryazan Thermal Power Plant in an overnight drone strike on Jan. 24, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. The news comes as Russia&#x2019;s Defense Ministry reported intercepting 121 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 37 in Bryansk Oblast, 20 in Ryazan Oblast, and 17 in the Kursk and Saratov oblasts each. The refinery, one of Russia&#x2019;s largest, has the capacity of 17 million metric tons of oil per year. At least three oil depots and a workshop were set ablaze, according to the source. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video that purports to show the aftermath of a Ukrainian drone strike against Ryazan, Russia, on Jan. 24, 2025. (SBU source)The statement confirms earlier reports in Russian Telegram channels that the Ryazan Oil Refinery caught fire after a drone attack. &quot;SBU and SOS drones also targeted an oil pumping station at the Ryazan Thermal Power Plant,&quot; the source said, without revealing details on possible consequences. Ryazan lies roughly 500 kilometers (310 miles) north of Ukraine&#x2019;s border. Drones also attacked the Kremniy EL microelectronics plant in Russia&apos;s Bryansk and other facilities in the city, the independent Telegram news channel Astra reported, citing Russian Emergencies Ministry sources. It is not immediately clear whether the plant, which produces components for the Russian military, suffered significant damage in the attack. The drone strike also damaged windows and the facade of a building of the Investigative Committee, and the Institute of Management and Business caught fire, according to Astra. Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&#x2019;s National Security and Defense Council, also reported on the attack against the Kremniy plant. The facility has suspended operations after sustaining hits, Kovalenko claimed, saying that the plant produces microelectronics for Russian air defenses, Iskander missiles, electronic warfare equipment, and drones. This is the third time the plant was hit during the full-scale war, Kovalenko said. The city of Bryansk lies around 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Russia&#x2019;s border with Ukraine. The attack against the Ryazan oil facilities and the Kremniy plant was later confirmed by the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. Recent weeks saw Ukraine again intensify long-range strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia&#x2019;s rear in an effort to undermine Moscow&#x2019;s ability to wage war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-uavs-reportedly-attack-russian-microelectronics-plant-other-facilities-overnight/	2025-01-24T02:09:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/2025-01-24-12_03_42.jpg
Uncontrolled escalation' — Russia opposes NATO peacekeepers in Ukraine	Deploying a NATO peacekeeping contingent to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire in the war with Russia could lead to &quot;uncontrolled escalation,&quot; Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed on Jan. 23 during a press briefing. The statement comes amid discussions about a possible deployment of European soldiers to Ukraine to monitor a future ceasefire deal. Zakharova also mentioned recent statements by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius that their countries could provide troops for a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine. &quot;The intervention of NATO troops in Ukraine is categorically unacceptable for Russia, it will turn into uncontrolled escalation,&quot; she said. Zelensky has been in contact with several European leaders about the prospects of the peacekeeping mission, an initiative that French President Emmanuel Macron has spearheaded. Pistorius said earlier that Germany, as NATO&apos;s largest member in Europe, &quot;will have a role to play&quot; in keeping peace in Ukraine, while Starmer said that the U.K. had discussed the idea of a peacekeeping mission with other allies and that it will play a &quot;full part&quot; in peacekeeping efforts. The idea has also found support from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called upon Europe to take up greater responsibility for Ukraine&#x2019;s security and pledged to bring a swift end to the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/sending-nato-peacekeepers-to-ukraine-could-lead-to-uncontrolled-escalation-russia-claims/	2025-01-24T01:13:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1237721878.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 6, injure 9 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed at least six people and injured at least nine over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 24. Russia launched 58 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force said. Twenty-five drones were shot down over seven oblasts, while 27 were lost in the airspace without causing damage, according to the statement. Drone attacks in Kyiv Oblast killed three civilians and injured a 26-year old man, the regional police department said. Two of the people killed in the attacks were a married couple in Brovary and another man in the Fastiv district, according to the State Emergency Service. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast over the past day killed two people and injured five, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Two civilians were killed and two injured in an attack against the city of Kostiantynivka, two were injured in Kramatorsk, and one in Pokrovsk, according to the statement. In Kharkiv Oblast, a 54-year-old woman was killed in a drone attack against the village of Petropavlivka, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Three civilians were injured in Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast, said the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. Two apartment buildings and nine houses were damaged.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-121/	2025-01-24T00:17:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/2025-01-24-10_10_01.jpg
Seoul suspects North Korea plans to send more troops to Russia-Ukraine war	North Korea is preparing to send more troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine, even after incurring significant losses, the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) warned on Jan. 24, according to the Yonhap news agency. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in early August 2024. Ukrainian forces have continued fighting in the region, hoping to leverage their positions for potential negotiations. &quot;With around four months having passed since the deployment of troops to the war between Russia and Ukraine, (North Korea) is assumed to be accelerating preparations for additional measures and deployment amid multiple casualties and occurrence of prisoners,&quot; the statement read, according to Yonhap. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said previously that Pyongyang is reportedly preparing reinforcements, mainly gun and rocket artillery units, to participate in the war in Ukraine. The New York Times reported that according to an undisclosed U.S. official, fresh North Korean troops could arrive within two months. North Korea is also expected to send Russia 150 short-range KN-23 ballistic missiles in 2025, according to Budanov. Experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent connected North Korea&#x2019;s high casualty rates to a lack of experience with modern warfare, the &quot;human wave&quot; tactics employed against entrenched Ukrainian positions, and the resolve of North Korean troops to avoid capture, even at the cost of their own lives. Only two North Korean soldiers are in Ukrainian captivity since Pyongyang deployed its troops in Kursk Oblast last fall.	https://kyivindependent.com/south-korea-suspects-north-korea-of-sending-more-troops-to-war-in-ukraine/	2025-01-23T23:39:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1734340818.jpg
Zelensky is ’no angel’ — Trump suggests Ukrainian president shares blame for war	U.S. President Donald Trump indicated that both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine&#x2019;s President Volodymyr Zelensky share the blame for the Ukraine-Russia war in an interview segment with Fox News released on Jan. 23. &quot;Zelensky... shouldn&#x2019;t have allowed this to happen either. He&#x2019;s no angel,&quot; Trump said. &quot;First of all, he&#x2019;s fighting a much bigger entity.&quot; Already during his electoral campaign, Trump implied that his predecessor, former U.S. President Joe Biden, and Zelensky share blame for Russia&#x2019;s ongoing invasion and pledged to broker a swift peace deal. The U.S. president, who most recently met Zelensky in Paris in December, criticized his Ukrainian counterpart for initially &quot;wanting to fight&quot; instead of cutting a deal. At the same time, Trump acknowledged Ukraine&#x2019;s bravery in resisting Russia and said that the Ukrainian president has &quot;had enough&quot; and is ready for peace. &quot;We started pouring equipment... and they (Ukraine) had the bravery to use the equipment, but in the end, it&#x2019;s a war that has to be settled,&quot; Trump said. Trump has been often critical of the Biden administration&#x2019;s support for Ukraine and boasted about good relations with Putin, sparking concerns he might broker a deal unfavorable to Kyiv. Recently, the U.S. president has adopted a more critical stance toward Moscow, criticizing Putin for reluctance to cut a deal and threatening with economic repercussions if he fails to do so. &quot;Putin shouldn&#x2019;t have done it (launching the full-scale invasion)... and it has to stop,&quot; Trump said, claiming that Russia had lost around 850,000 soldiers while Ukraine lost 700,000. Zelensky put Ukraine&#x2019;s casualty rates at 43,000 killed and 370,000 wounded as of December, while Moscow does not reveal its losses. In the interview, Trump reiterated his warnings that if Russia does not agree to negotiate, the U.S. is going to impose &quot;massive tariffs and massive taxes, and... big sanctions,&quot; adding he &quot;doesn&#x2019;t want to do it&quot; because he &quot;loves&quot; Russia. The U.S. president echoed his earlier claims that the full-scale invasion would have never started if he were in office at the time, blaming the Biden administration for supposedly provoking Putin and allowing him to profit from high energy prices. Trump also lashed out against the former president for not pressuring European countries to donate more support to Ukraine, falsely claiming that Washington spent &quot;$200 billion more than Europe.&quot; The U.S. Congress has allocated over $170 billion to Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, which included the provision of over $60 billion worth of military support. The EU and its member countries have made available $145 billion in financial, military, and humanitarian assistance during the full-scale war. Ukraine recently announced that arrangements for a meeting between Trump and Zelensky are underway, while the U.S. president also said he aims to meet Putin in the coming days to discuss an end to the war. Moscow welcomed Trump&#x2019;s proposal for a meeting but voiced skepticism about a possible peace deal, saying it has to first understand what the U.S.&#x2019;s goals are before entering into any negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-is-no-angel-trump-claims-ukrainian-president-shares-blame-for-war/	2025-01-23T23:02:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2188254103.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 826,820 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 826,820 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 24. This number includes 1,500 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,852 tanks, 20,508 armored fighting vehicles, 34,992 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,295 artillery systems, 1,263 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,050 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 23,162 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-826-820-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-23T22:17:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/LEM_2194-1.jpg
2 killed, 1 injured in Russian drone attack on Kyiv Oblast	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Two people have been killed and one other injured in a drone attack overnight on Jan. 24 targeting Kyiv Oblast, the regional military administration reported. A 36-year-old man was killed in the city of Brovary, just outside the capital Kyiv, when falling drone debris struck a 10-storey building. One other person, a 26-year-old man was injured in the ensuing fire at the residential building, sustaining superficial burns to his upper respiratory tract, the Kyiv Oblast Military Administration said. Elsewhere in the region, one person was killed when drone debris fell onto a home. No additional details were provided on the identity of the victim. The full extent of the damage to the residential structures was not immediately clear. Both fires caused by the attacks have been extinguished by emergency crews. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force warned throughout the night of the threat of Russian drone attacks on the capital. Air defenses operated throughout the night. Russia has ramped up the use of attack drones over the past year, regularly launching drones at various targets across the country, including Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/2-killed-1-injured-in-russian-drone-attack-on-kyiv-oblast/	2025-01-23T21:10:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/1000000276.jpg
John Ratcliffe confirmed as CIA Director	The U.S. Senate formally confirmed John Ratcliffe as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on Jan. 23. Ratcliffe, who served as President Donald Trump&apos;s director of national intelligence during part of Trump&apos;s first term in office, was confirmed with 74 senators voting in favor and 24 voting against the appointment. Ratcliffe becomes the second Trump nominee to secure an appointment from the Senate, days after State Secretary Marco Rubio was sworn into his new post. Ratcliffe replaces Bill Burns as the head of the spy agency. During his term as the head of the CIA, Burns reportedly regularly communicated with Ukrainian officials for purposes of intelligence sharing. Burns made his final visit to Kyiv on Dec. 21 to meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky, marking a rare public acknowledgment of their discussions during Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Zelensky noted that he and Burns had met multiple times throughout the war, but such encounters were typically kept confidential The United States under former President Joe Biden had been Ukraine&apos;s key ally, providing substantial financial and military aid since the all-out war began nearly three years ago. Washington is also reported to have consistently shared military intelligence to bolster Ukraine&apos;s defense. In his Senate hearing last week, Ratcliffe alluded to foreign adversaries Russia and China, referring the need for the U.S. to improve the use of artificial intelligence. Ratcliffe, a staunch supporter of Trump, also echoed comments from the president that the Russia-Ukraine war threatens to draw the U.S. into a conflict with a &quot;nuclear country.&quot; It is unclear if the Trump administration will continue to provide the same level of intelligence sharing with Ukraine as it received during the Biden administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/john-ratcliffe-confirmed-as-cia-director/	2025-01-23T18:51:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/1000000261.jpg
Fire reported at oil refinery in Russia's Ryazan Oblast amid drone strike	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A fire erupted at the Ryazan Oil Refinery in Russia after a mass drone attack targeting several regions, Russian Telegram channels reported on Jan. 23. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, air defense systems also intercepted 49 drones across Kursk, Bryansk, Belgorod oblasts, as well as occupied Crimea. Social media reports noted drone activity in Ryazan Oblast, located southeast of Moscow, where explosions were heard at the RNPK oil depot. At least 10 drones were reportedly shot down over the facility, and a fire broke out. The Kyiv Independent cannot immediately verify the reports. The head of the Center for Countering Disinformation of the National Security and Defense Council, Andrey Kovalenko, said that the Ryazan Oil Refinery is one of the key facilities in the Russian oil industry, though it is under sanctions. &#x201C;The refinery plays an important role in providing fuel for both the civilian and military-industrial complex of Russia,&#x201D; he said on Telegram. &#x201C;It produces fuel for military equipment, aviation kerosene, diesel fuel and other types of petroleum products used in tanks, aircraft, ships and other equipment of the Russian Armed Forces.&#x201D; The attack comes amid an uptick in Ukraine&#x2019;s drone operations targeting Russian energy infrastructure. Ukraine has targeted Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure as part of its strategy to undermine a key funding source for Russia&apos;s war effort. &#x200C;&#x200C;	https://kyivindependent.com/fire-reported-at-ryazan-oil-refinery-in-russia-amid-alleged-drone-strike/	2025-01-23T17:25:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/Ryazan-oil-refinery.jpg
Trump announces readiness to meet with Putin as soon as possible, Reuters reports	U.S. President Donald Trump said that he wanted to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin as soon as possible to end the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Jan. 23. Trump also said that he wanted to explore reductions in nuclear arms. &#x201C;I really would like to be able to meet with President Putin soon to get that war ended,&#x201D; Trump said via video link, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a carnage. And we really have to stop that war.&#x201D; Later, speaking at the White House, Trump reiterated his readiness to meet Putin immediately. &#x201C;Every day we don&#x2019;t meet, soldiers are being killed on the battlefield,&#x201D; he said. Trump also claimed that President Volodymyr Zelensky had told him he was open to considering a deal to end the war. While Trump stated that U.S. peace efforts were underway, he offered no specific details. On Jan. 21, at the World Economic Forum, Zelensky revealed that discussions were underway to organize a meeting with Trump. &quot;We are your partner. We know all the sore spots; we have lost our people,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to end the war this year. But not just quickly, but fairly and, above all, reliably for us.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-announces-readiness-to-meet-with-putin-as-soon-as-possible-reuters-reports/	2025-01-23T16:39:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179841418.jpg
Putin has no right to veto any country's NATO accession, NATO Secretary General says	NATO Chief Mark Rutte said on Jan. 23 that Russian President Vladimir Putin has no authority to influence NATO&apos;s future membership decisions. &#x201C;We must clearly understand that Vladimir Putin has no veto power and no say over who will join NATO in the future. Unless, of course, he himself wants to join NATO, but I don&apos;t think he wants that,&#x201D; Rutte said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He emphasized that Ukraine&apos;s full NATO membership is the best guarantee for lasting peace. &#x201C;Whatever the outcome, it must be clear that peace is sustainable&#x2026; when they (negotiations) end, we must be confident that the peace we collectively supported will be enduring and will never be questioned again,&#x201D; he said. Rutte also highlighted the need to avoid repeating the failures of the Minsk agreements and stressed the importance of ensuring Ukraine is in the strongest possible position before any future negotiations with Russia. Earlier in the day, Rutte called on the United States to continue supplying weapons to Ukraine, pledging that Europe will shoulder the financial burden. Nearly 3,000 representatives from over 130 countries, including 60 heads of state and government, 900 CEOs of the world&#x2019;s leading companies, and forum partners, are expected to attend the forum in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-has-no-right-to-veto-any-countrys-nato-accession-nato-secretary-general-says/	2025-01-23T14:48:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2184023227.jpg
Trump’s 90-day foreign aid suspension order does not impact weapon deliveries to Ukraine, Pentagon says	U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s executive order suspending foreign aid programs for 90 days does not apply to military assistance for Ukraine, the Pentagon confirmed to the Ukrainian Service of Voice of America on Jan. 23. &#x201C;Security assistance to Ukraine is not subject to the restrictions of the recent foreign assistance order, as it only applies to development programs, not military support,&#x201D; the U.S. Department of Defense stated. Contracts under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) and weapon deliveries from U.S. warehouses under the Presidential Depletion Authority (PDA) will remain unaffected. These programs, among others, were initiated during President Biden&#x2019;s administration. While Ukrainian military assistance is exempt from the 90-day suspension, the status of development and humanitarian programs is uncertain and still under review. The 90-day suspension was published by the White House on Jan. 20, as one of the numerous executive orders Trump has passed since becoming president. In the document, Trump wrote that &quot;the United States foreign aid industry and bureaucracy are not aligned with American interests and in many cases antithetical to American values,&quot; without mentioning specific examples. In addition to development aid, the U.S. has provided Kyiv with $66 billion in military assistance since the outbreak of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-90-day-foreign-add-suspension-order-does-not-impact-weapon-deliveries-to-ukraine-pentagon-says/	2025-01-23T12:52:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/--------------2024-03-19-202210.png
Ukraine war latest: Russian forces suspected of killing 6 Ukrainian POWs in Donetsk Oblast	Key developments on Jan. 23: Ukrainian prosecutors are investigating a case of Russian troops summarily executing six Ukrainian captives in the embattled Donetsk Oblast, the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office said on Jan. 23. The statement came in reaction to a video circulating on social media, recorded by Russian soldiers, that apparently shows the execution of the six prisoners of war (POW). The footage also shows a seventh Ukrainian soldier lying on the ground, whose fate is unknown. &quot;According to preliminary information, during an assault against Ukrainian positions in Donetsk Oblast, Russian soldiers took six Ukrainian soldiers captive and subsequently shot them,&quot; the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office said in a statement. Executing prisoners of war is a serious violation of the Geneva Conventions and a war crime. Ukraine&#x2019;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said he had reached out to the U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross regarding the case. Throughout the full-scale war, Ukraine has documented widespread violations of the Geneva Conventions by Russian forces, including the execution of over 100 POWs in 2024 alone, according to Lubinets. Reports of torture, murder, and abuse of Ukrainian captives &#x2014; particularly in Donetsk Oblast &#x2014; have surged in recent months. Visual evidence of these atrocities continues to emerge, underscoring Russia&apos;s disregard for international law. Ukrainian troops positioned near the village of Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk Oblast are at risk of encirclement by Russian forces, military spokesperson Viktor Trehubov said on Jan. 23. Russian forces are attempting to take control of access routes to the village through heavy fire, according to Trehubov, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces. &quot;Velyka Novosilka is currently in a rather difficult situation. Ukrainian soldiers are doing everything to prevent further advances of the enemy,&quot; Trehubov said. However, the geographical layout of the area, including a river that cuts through the village, complicates defensive maneuvers, according to Trehubov. A screenshot of the map by the DeepState monitoring group as of Jan. 23, 2025, showing the front-line village of Velyka Novosilka, Donetsk Oblast. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)According to Trehubov, Russia&apos;s numerical advantage in manpower in the area poses significant challenges. &quot;They are constantly conducting rotations, adding personnel, and replenishing their deployed forces. They still have this resource,&quot; Trehubov added. He said that preventing encirclement and maintaining access to Velyka Novosilka remains a priority for Ukrainian troops. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi previously described the ongoing Russian offensive in the east as &quot;one of the most powerful&quot; since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Throughout the fall of 2024, Russian forces made operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, including areas near Toretsk and Chasiv Yar, while advancing near Kupiansk and on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast. President Volodymyr Zelensky on Jan. 22 clarified his earlier comments on the number of European peacekeepers needed to maintain peace in Ukraine, saying the required numbers would depend on the size of Ukraine&#x2019;s own military. The statement comes after Zelensky told a journalist at the World Economic Forum in Davos that at least 200,000 European soldiers would be needed for a stable peace deal. &quot;By the way, I didn&#x2019;t say we need 200,000 (peacekeepers)... A journalist asked me, I said, &apos;maybe more, maybe less,&apos;&quot; Zelensky said when asked about the statement in an interview with Bloomberg TV. Zelensky spoke in comparably stronger terms in Davos, saying: &quot;From all the Europeans? 200,000, it&#x2019;s a minimum. It&#x2019;s a minimum, otherwise it&#x2019;s nothing.&quot; The president explained in the interview that the size of the needed contingent will depend on the strength of the Ukrainian military. As Kyiv would struggle to maintain a million-strong army needed to repel future Russian aggression, fielding such a force would depend on U.S. and European support, he explained. If the U.S. and Europe prove unwilling to help maintain such an army and Ukraine reduces it &quot;by 200,000, 300,000 or 500,000, it means that other troops have to replace them in those numbers,&quot; Zelensky added. The president&#x2019;s conclusion was that in the face of such options, Ukraine&#x2019;s accession to NATO is the cheapest way toward stable peace both for Ukraine and the West. At the same time, Zelensky admitted that some members &#x2013; namely the U.S., Germany, Slovakia, and Hungary &#x2013; remain reluctant to allow Ukraine into the alliance. Zelensky has been in contact with a number of European leaders about the prospects of a peacekeeping mission &#x2014; an initiative that French President Emmanuel Macron has spearheaded. During a visit to Kyiv on Jan. 16, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that his country will play its &quot;full part&quot; in supporting efforts to maintain an enduring peace in Ukraine. The idea has also found support from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called upon Europe to take up greater responsibility for Ukraine&#x2019;s security and pledged to bring a swift end to the war. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte called on the United States to continue supplying weapons to Ukraine, pledging that Europe will shoulder the financial burden, Reuters reported on Jan. 23. &quot;If this new Trump administration is willing to keep on supplying Ukraine, the bill will be paid by the Europeans,&quot; Rutte said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Rutte&apos;s remarks come amid the uncertainty of the U.S. support for Ukraine under President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized aid to Kyiv, as well as called on Europe to increase its share. Trump has repeatedly lambasted European NATO members for not investing enough in their defense capabilities and instead relying on the U.S. Rutte agreed with Trump&apos;s criticism of Europe&apos;s low defense spending, saying that &quot;Ukraine is closer to Europe than to the U.S.&quot; Earlier on Jan. 22, President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized the importance of U.S. leadership in ending Russia&apos;s war during an interview with Bloomberg. &quot;The end of the war must be a victory for U.S. President Donald Trump, not for Russian President Vladimir Putin,&quot; Zelensky said. During his presidential campaign, Trump has repeatedly called for a swift resolution to Russia&apos;s war and claimed he would be able to end it quickly. However, he hasn&apos;t elaborated on how he plans to achieve that. On Jan. 22, Trump threatened to impose harsher sanctions on Moscow if a &quot;deal&quot; is not reached soon. President Donald Trump said on Jan. 23 that he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to lower the price of oil, claiming it would end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine &quot;immediately.&quot; &quot;If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately,&quot; he said via videolink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &quot;Right now, the price is high enough that that war will continue, you gotta bring down the oil price and end that war,&quot; he added. OPEC consists of 12 countries including Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, which collectively account for around 30% of the global oil supply. By agreeing to lower or raise the amount of oil they all produce, OPEC can dramatically affect global oil prices. Lower global oil prices would deplete Russia&apos;s main source of revenue that it uses to fund its war in Ukraine, though a recent analysis in Foreign Policy suggested any effects would likely take months to significantly hamper the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. Another Trump policy &#x2014; declaring open season on drilling for U.S. oil and gas &#x2014; could also potentially push down prices and box out Russian oil. Trump was also asked if there would be a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia by the time of next year&apos;s World Economic Forum. &quot;Well, you&apos;ll have to ask Russia. Ukraine is ready to make a deal,&quot; he said. Speaking of China, he said they &quot;have a great deal of power over that situation,&quot; and that he hoped the U.S. could work with Beijing to end the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A day earlier, Trump said that if a &quot;deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine was not reached soon, he would have no choice but to &quot;put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries.&quot; In response, the Kremlin said it sees nothing new in &#xA0;Trump&apos;s threats to impose sanctions if no deal on the war in Ukraine is reached, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Jan. 23. &quot;We don&apos;t see any particularly new elements here. You know that Trump, in the first iteration of his presidency, was the American president who most often resorted to sanctions methods,&quot; Peskov said. Russia is ready for an &quot;equal and respectful&quot; dialogue with the U.S., as it was during Trump&apos;s first term, Peskov added. The Kremlin spokesman also noted that no preparations are currently underway for a meeting between Trump and Putin. President Volodymyr Zelensky led a Ukrainian delegation at the World Economic Forum that sought to highlight the country&apos;s economic potential and investment appeal, framing the country as a &quot;prize, not a burden.&quot; Events held at the Ukraine House, the country&apos;s pavilion at the forum, have focused on Ukraine&apos;s vast natural resources, and defense and agricultural sectors. The delegation&apos;s website says Ukraine holds $26 trillion in mineral wealth, including one-third of Europe&apos;s lithium reserves and significant gas reserves.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russian-forces-suspected-of-killing-6-ukrainian-pows-in-donetsk-oblast/	2025-01-23T12:36:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2153450598.jpg
Russian actor who starred in propaganda films lands Oscar nomination	Russian actor Yura Borisov, who has previously starred in Russian propaganda films and illegally visited Russian-occupied Crimea, has received an Academy Award nomination for his role in the film &quot;Anora.&quot; Borisov is nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category, the U.S. Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on Jan. 23. Borisov is the first Russian actor to land an Oscar nomination in nearly five decades. This recognition of a Russian actor who has never spoken out against Russia&apos;s aggression comes as Moscow continues to wage a brutal war against Ukraine, which has already killed tens of thousands of people, including at least 12,300 civilians. Directed by U.S. filmmaker Sean Baker, &quot;Anora&quot; is a modern-day reimagining of the Cinderella story set in Brighton Beach&apos;s Russian community. It follows a young sex worker from Brooklyn who impulsively marries the son of a Russian oligarch. The film has also been nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress at the 97th Academy Awards. The Oscars ceremony will be held on March 2 this year. The nominees for Actor in a Supporting Role are... #Oscars pic.twitter.com/Um5Ba6mR0e Borisov is an acclaimed Russian actor who has starred in a number of Russian films promoting state propaganda, such as &quot;AK-47,&quot; which was partially filmed in occupied Crimea. Russia invaded and illegally annexed Ukraine&apos;s Crimean Peninsula in 2014. Entering Crimea from Russian territory is illegal. Since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion eight years later, Borisov hasn&apos;t publicly spoken out against his country&apos;s war of aggression. The decision has once again sparked a debate over the glorification of Russian culture and cooperation with Russians while Moscow is committing war crimes in Ukraine. Earlier in September, the Toronto International Film Festival sparked outrage for screening &quot;Russians at War,&quot; a documentary by a Russian-Canadian filmmaker that whitewashes Russian soldiers participating in the invasion of Ukraine. At this year&apos;s Oscars, the Ukrainian documentary &quot;Porcelain War&quot; is nominated for Best Documentary Feature. Directed by Brendan Bellomo and Slava Leontyev, the film tells the story of three Kharkiv artists who joined the Ukrainian army while continuing to create porcelain figurines as an act of cultural resistance during Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-actor-who-starred-in-propaganda-films-lands-oscar-nomination/	2025-01-23T12:18:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2188135413.jpg
Trump’s Ukraine war ultimatum sparks angry reaction from Russian milbloggers	Russian military bloggers, known as milbloggers, have responded in defiant terms to Donald Trump&#x2019;s ultimatum to his Russian counterpart, describing it as &quot;blackmail&quot; from a U.S. president acting more like a &quot;king of the playground.&quot; On Jan. 22, Trump called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to &quot;make a deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine, warning that failure to reach an agreement would lead to increased sanctions, tariffs, and taxes on Russian goods. Trump&#x2019;s statement comes after months of repeated claims he would quickly put an end to Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. Though it is still unknown how Trump plans to reach a deal between Russia and Ukraine, members of his team have made it clear that both sides will have to make concessions. In a typically bombastic post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said he was &quot;not looking to hurt Russia&quot; and maintained he has &quot;always had a very good relationship&quot; with Putin. &quot;We can do it the easy way or the hard way &#x2014; and the easy way is always better,&quot; Trump wrote. &quot;It&apos;s time to make a deal. No more lives should be lost.&quot; The official Russian response was relatively measured, with Russia&apos;s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy saying Russia would have to determine what Trump means by &quot;deal&quot; before entering into negotiations. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Jan. 23 said Moscow didn&#x2019;t see &quot;any particularly new elements&quot; in what Trump said, but added Russia was ready for an &quot;equal and respectful&quot; dialogue with the U.S. But over on Telegram, a messenger app, Russian milbloggers were far more vocal in their opinions of Trump&#x2019;s ultimatum. Pro-Kremlin military bloggers are highly influential in the Russian media ecosystem, sharing insider war coverage and pro-war analysis of events, usually on Telegram. Highly nationalistic, the most prominent have followings in the hundreds of thousands, with some like Rybar having more than a million.

(Natalia Kolesnikova / AFP via Getty Images)German Kulikovsky/Starshe Eddy (Older than the Edda) Trump&apos;s ultimatum &#x2014; in the end, good old Donald is a typical American (salesman), not a politician. Nothing but lies in a fiery speech, all to sell an uninformed average person a completely unnecessary and very poor-quality product. When American astronauts land on Mars, and the Russian army loses a million soldiers killed in the war with &quot;khokhols&quot; (a derogatory word for Ukrainians) then maybe it will be worth considering his proposals. But for now, it&apos;s better to just shut the door or hang up the phone to avoid listening to what the salesman says about his junk. Everyone has already interpreted Trump&#x2019;s ultimatum to Russia however they please, but the meaning is the same &#x2014; either you do as I say, or I&#x2019;ll pressure you even harder with sanctions. As I wrote earlier, there can be no talk of peace. Russia cannot accept what is being offered to it, and Ukraine will not agree to what Russia demands of it. Ukraine should prepare for the complete destruction of its male population, and Russia for a long and grueling war. &apos;To make a deal&apos; &#x2014; an important and well-established American expression Trump took from business. Before the elections, he called Zelensky ineffective. That&#x2019;s the first point. Secondly&#x2026; this is a public ultimatum. How poorly Trump has studied the leadership of our country, to whom he is offering that very deal. Nothing will be agreed to under pressure.And thirdly &#x2014; why should Russia believe the Yankees this time, (believe) that they won&#x2019;t cheat us again? Trump is threatening Russia with new sanctions and the introduction of additional tariffs on Russian goods supplied to the U.S. if Russia doesn&#x2019;t end the special military operation. We&#x2019;ve already been through this under (former U.S. President Joe) Biden. Attempts to change Russia&apos;s position through primitive threats are unlikely to bring Trump the outcome he desires.

(Natalia Kolesnikova / AFP via Getty Images)Kotsnews (Aleksandr Kots) &#xA0;As we assumed, Trump&#x2019;s plan is an ultimatum and blackmail. Like I said, better to prepare for the worst. Biden&#x2019;s term will soon be remembered with nostalgia as a thaw. Remember this post. In a later post&#x2026; Perhaps Donald Trump is unaware, but Vladimir Putin belongs to the pre-TikTok era of global politics, where serious leaders discuss important issues through dialogue, not electronic notes. To express his vision for ending the war in Ukraine, Trump could, at the very least, pick up the phone. This (drama) with demands to make a deal or else sanctions, tariffs, and so on, is hardly appropriate. What exactly do we still trade with the U.S. that&#x2019;s critical to our budget? The last significant revenue stream came from uranium sales &#x2014; the U.S. imported a quarter of its nuclear fuel from Russia. But last May, Biden banned the import of our low-enriched uranium, and in November, Moscow responded by restricting enriched uranium exports to the U.S. Now you can freeze your ears off just to spite Uncle Sam. To be fair, Trump hasn&#x2019;t turned on this thug-like political mode exclusively toward Russia. Canada, Denmark, Panama, and Mexico are also taking hits from &quot;Bold Donnie&quot; and his team. Apparently, the heady success with Hamas (which was open to a ceasefire without threats from the American president) gave him a sense of omnipotence. Trump seems determined to come out looking like a winner no matter the situation. But Russia isn&#x2019;t Gaza. Starting a dialogue with ultimatums isn&#x2019;t the most farsighted move for a leader aiming to position himself as a peacemaker. Moscow will never agree to any deal dictated through blackmail and threats. In short, (it&#x2019;s a) fail, Donald Fredovich.

UK, US sanctions force Russia's oil tankers to reflag, Bloomberg reports	A growing portion of Russia&apos;s oil tanker fleet is being forced to reflag as U.S. and U.K. sanctions intensify pressure on Moscow&apos;s shipping network, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 23. The removal of these flags disrupts Russia&apos;s oil export logistics, forcing tankers to re-register in less reputable jurisdictions and change ownership to avoid detection. The pressure follows sweeping sanctions introduced on Jan. 10, targeting nearly 200 vessels in Russia&apos;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; These ships are used to bypass sanctions on Russian oil exports. The Barbados Ship Registry, which operates under U.K. regulations, will reportedly revoke the flags of 46 vessels under U.K. sanctions by the end of January. Though Barbados does not impose sanctions on Russia, its compliance reflects its strong ties with the U.K. Ships sanctioned by the U.S. but not by the U.K. will retain their Barbadian flags. Panama&apos;s Maritime Authority has similarly begun deregistering 68 vessels, aligning with U.S., EU, U.K., and UN sanctions under rules adopted in late 2024. Compounding the impact of maritime sanctions, Indian banks have reportedly blocked payments for Russian oil imports due to the latest round of U.S. sanctions, according to Energy Intelligence. The tightening measures have already caused a sharp decline in Russian seaborne crude exports, with Bloomberg reporting dozens of tankers dropping anchor and suspending operations since the Jan. 10 sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-and-us-sanctions-force-russias-oil-tankers-to-reflag-bloomberg-reports/	2025-01-23T10:44:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167101990.jpg
57% of Ukrainians believe peace without full territorial integrity will fail, poll shows	A majority of Ukrainians &#x2014; 57% &#x2014; believe any peace agreement that does not fully restore Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity is destined to fail, according to a survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published on Jan. 23. The survey revealed that this stance is shared across age groups, regions, and language practices. The poll, conducted between Nov. 22 and Jan. 7, reflects strong public sentiment as Russia&apos;s full-scale war approaches its third anniversary, with Moscow continuing its offensive in Ukraine&apos;s east. The researchers also noted a link between attitudes toward territorial integrity and perceptions of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s new administration. Over half of respondents regard Trump&apos;s presidency positively, ranging from &quot;rather good&quot; to &quot;very good.&quot; But those who strongly or somewhat agree with the statement about territorial integrity are more likely to view Trump&apos;s presidency negatively. The survey&apos;s results were based on telephone interviews with 1,600 respondents residing in Ukraine-controlled territories. Expectations for possible peace talks in 2025 are rising, as Trump has vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table. Reports from the Wall Street Journal suggest his administration is weighing a plan to delay Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for continued Western arms supplies and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Dec. 26 that Russia aims to &quot;end the conflict&quot; in 2025, emphasizing hopes for front-line success. He expressed openness to dialogue with Trump but reiterated Russia&apos;s demands, including no territorial concessions.	https://kyivindependent.com/57-of-ukrainians-believe-peace-without-full-territorial-integrity-will-fail-survey-shows/	2025-01-23T10:38:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1347758762-1.jpg
Trump says Russia's war in Ukraine 'will end immediately' if OPEC lowers oil prices	President Donald Trump said on Jan. 23 he will ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to lower the price of oil, saying it would end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine &quot;immediately.&quot; &quot;If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately,&quot; he said via videolink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &quot;Right now the price is high enough that that war will continue, you gotta bring down the oil price and end that war,&quot; he added. OPEC consists of 12 countries including Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, which collectively account for around 30% of the global oil supply. By agreeing to lower or raise the amount of oil they all produce, OPEC can dramatically affect the global oil price. Lower global oil prices would deplete Russia&apos;s main source of revenue that it uses to fund its war in Ukraine, though a recent analysis in Foreign Policy suggested any effects would likely take months to significantly hamper the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. Another Trump policy &#x2014; declaring &#xA0;open season on drilling for U.S. oil and gas &#x2014; could also potentially push down prices and box out Russian oil. Trump was also asked if there would be a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia by the time of next year&apos;s World Economic Forum. &quot;Well you&apos;ll have to ask Russia. Ukraine is ready to make a deal,&quot; he said. Speaking of China, he said they &quot;have a great deal of power over that situation,&quot; and that he hoped the U.S. could work with Beijing to end the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A day earlier, Trump said that if a &quot;deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine was not reached soon, he would have no choice but to &quot;put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries.&quot; In response, the Kremlin said it sees nothing new in &#xA0;Trump&apos;s threats to impose sanctions if no deal on the war in Ukraine is reached, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Jan. 23. &quot;We don&apos;t see any particularly new elements here. You know that Trump, in the first iteration of his presidency, was the American president who most often resorted to sanctions methods,&quot; Peskov said. Russia is ready for an &quot;equal and respectful&quot; dialogue with the U.S., as it was during Trump&apos;s first term, Peskov added. The Kremlin spokesman also noted that no preparations are currently underway for a meeting between Trump and Putin. President Volodymyr Zelensky led a Ukrainian delegation at the World Economic Forum that sought to highlight the country&apos;s economic potential and investment appeal, framing the country as a &quot;prize, not a burden. Events held at the Ukraine House, the country&apos;s pavilion at the forum, have focused on Ukraine&apos;s vast natural resources, and defense and agricultural sectors. The delegation&apos;s website says Ukraine holds $26 trillion in mineral wealth, including one-third of Europe&apos;s lithium reserves and significant gas reserves.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-says-russias-war-in-ukraine-will-end-immediately-if-opec-lowers-oil-prices/	2025-01-23T09:35:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194855272.jpg
NATO chief urges US to keep arming Ukraine, pledges European funding	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte called on the United States to continue supplying weapons to Ukraine, pledging that Europe will shoulder the financial burden, Reuters reported on Jan. 23. &quot;If this new Trump administration is willing to keep on supplying Ukraine, the bill will be paid by the Europeans,&quot; Rutte said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Rutte&apos;s remarks come amid the uncertainty of the U.S. support for Ukraine under President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized aid to Kyiv, as well as called on Europe to increase its share. Trump has repeatedly lambasted European NATO members for not investing enough in their defense capabilities and instead relying on the U.S. Rutte agreed with Trump&apos;s criticism of Europe&apos;s low defense spending, saying that &quot;Ukraine is closer to Europe than to the U.S.&quot; Earlier on Jan. 22, President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized the importance of U.S. leadership in ending Russia&apos;s war during an interview with Bloomberg. &quot;The end of the war must be a victory for U.S. President Donald Trump, not for Russian President Vladimir Putin,&quot; Zelensky said. During his presidential campaign, Trump has repeatedly called for a swift resolution to Russia&apos;s war and claimed he would be able to end it quickly. However, he hasn&apos;t elaborated on how he plans to achieve that. On Jan. 22, Trump threatened to impose harsher sanctions on Moscow if a &quot;deal&quot; is not reached soon.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-chief-urges-us-to-keep-arming-ukraine-pledges-european-funding-media-reports/	2025-01-23T08:11:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2188184447.jpg
Kyiv Independent identifies high-ranking Russian officer, officials involved in looting of museums in southern Ukraine	The Kyiv Independent identified a Russian military officer and three Russian-appointed officials from occupied Crimea who were responsible for the illegal removal of artworks and artifacts from two Kherson museums in the fall of 2022. Fleeing a Ukrainian counteroffensive, Russian forces collectively stole more than 33,000 historical artifacts and works of art. This museum theft is the largest in Europe since World War II. Those who oversaw the theft are Dmitry Lipov, head of the communications center of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, who served as the city&apos;s commandant during the occupation of Kherson, Sergey Patrushev, appointed by the Russian authorities to head the museum department of the so-called Crimean Ministry of Culture, Elena Morozova and Mikhail Smorodkin, appointed by the Russian authorities as directors of the Crimean museums, Tauric Chersonese and the Museum of Defense of Sevastopol. The findings are the basis for the Kyiv Independent&apos;s War Crimes Investigation Unit&apos;s documentary &quot;Curated Theft.&quot; To identify those who took part in the government-sanctioned theft, the Kyiv Independent journalist posed as a Russian TV producer and as a Russian investigator to communicate with local collaborators who helped Russian troops loot. The Kyiv Independent found that Russian officer Lipov was responsible for securing the collections during their removal and personally sealed the trucks that carried the stolen items. Patrushev was responsible for moving paintings from the Kherson Art Museum to occupied Crimea. The directors of the Crimean museums chose items from the Kherson Local History museum&apos;s collection during the looting. The Kyiv Independent also found that the illegal removal of collections from Kherson to occupied Crimea was supervised by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB).	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-independent-identifies-high-ranking-russian-officer-officials-involved-in-looting-of-museums-in-southern-ukraine/	2025-01-23T08:06:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1245781943.jpg
Russia’s looting of history is a theft of who we are	I first visited the looted museums of Kherson, a city in southern Ukraine, in May 2024. At the time, my team at the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s War Crimes Investigations Unit and I were beginning an investigation into the illegal export of artifacts from Kherson to occupied Crimea by Russian forces amid the full-scale war. Over 33,000 works of art and historical artifacts had been stolen from local museums in the fall of 2022, just before the city was liberated from Russian occupation by the Ukrainian military. I went to Kherson thinking that I had already seen so much horror, human tragedy, and pain during two years of the full-scale invasion that I could hardly be affected by the sight of looted museum halls. But when I entered the local history museum, for a few minutes, everything inside me went numb. The large exhibition halls were completely empty, and the display cases that once housed artifacts from the Scythians, Goths, Romans, and Greeks were shattered. The museum director led me to a hall that had been especially significant to the staff and guests. This separate room had displayed gold jewelry from the Scythians and Sarmatians, peoples who inhabited Ukrainian lands thousands of years ago. All that remained of these treasures were the text descriptions on the display cases. I&#x2019;ve known about the Scythians since childhood. I was born and raised in Ukraine&#x2019;s Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, home to the most famous Scythian burial mounds. These ancient graves of a nomadic people have yielded unique gold jewelry and household items through centuries of excavation. In the 20th century, one of these mounds revealed the legendary Golden Pectoral, an ornate decoration belonging to a Scythian aristocrat, which became one of Ukraine&#x2019;s most renowned treasures. I learned about their culture and history in local history lessons at school. After Kherson&#x2019;s liberation, a guard at the local history museum told reporters that Russian forces hadn&#x2019;t just taken valuables &#x2014; they had stolen the Ukrainian soul. The moment I first saw the looted halls, I understood exactly what he meant. I felt as though they had taken part of my Ukrainian identity too. Systematic attacks on Ukrainian culture have been part of Russian state policy since czarist times. In the early 20th century, this practice was adopted by the Bolsheviks, and in the 21st century, it continues with modern Russia. For instance, journalists from Ukrainian outlet Texty analyzed electronic catalogs of two major Russian museums &#x2014; the Hermitage and the State Historical Museum &#x2014; and found over 110,000 items in their collections that originated from modern Ukraine. Many artifacts lack detailed information about their origins, such as the archaeological site or place of discovery. To confirm these items&#x2019; ties to Ukraine, journalists conducted additional research. These artifacts were appropriated during both the Russian Empire and Soviet times. Russia hasn&#x2019;t just looted Ukrainian cultural artifacts; it has also physically eliminated Ukrainian intelligentsia. In the 1920s and 1930s, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin&#x2019;s regime destroyed an entire generation of Ukrainian artists &#x2014; painters, writers, and directors &#x2014; later called the &#x201C;Executed Renaissance.&#x201D; I have no doubt these actions aim to erase Ukrainian identity. And I know from personal experience how this works. I am a Ukrainian who grew up in a Russified region. Both my grandmothers were born in Ukrainian-speaking families, but my first words were in Russian. As a child, I received New Year&#x2019;s gifts from Father Frost, a character invented by Soviet propaganda, instead of Saint Nicholas, as my ancestors had. I went to school in independent Ukraine, but in music lessons, we sang Soviet songs, like those about Mykola Shchors, a Bolshevik military commander. At the same time, I knew nothing about Mykola Leontovych, the Ukrainian composer who wrote the world-famous &#x201C;Carol of the Bells.&#x201D; I became interested in Ukrainian literature during my student years. That interest expanded to Ukrainian art, especially cinema. I began attending exhibitions of Ukrainian artists and performances by Ukrainian theater directors. Eventually, I abandoned the Russian language entirely. Now, my family and I are reviving Ukrainian traditions. This year, for the first time, I replaced the traditional Christmas tree with a &#x201C;didukh,&#x201D; a Ukrainian Christmas decoration made of wheat. Still, I am on a journey to rediscover my culture and history &#x2014; like millions of other Ukrainians. The more we return to our roots, the harder Russia hits. It loots museums, destroys architectural monuments, and Russifies Ukrainian children in Russian-occupied territories. Its goal is clear: to erase everything Ukrainian and turn the Ukrainian state into a colony once again.

Ukrainian soldiers near Velyka Novosilka at risk of encirclement, spokesperson says	Ukrainian troops positioned near the village of Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk Oblast are at risk of encirclement by Russian forces, military spokesperson Viktor Trehubov said on Jan. 23. Russian forces are attempting to take control of access routes to the village through heavy fire, according to Trehubov, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces. &quot;Velyka Novosilka is currently in a rather difficult situation. Ukrainian soldiers are doing everything to prevent further advances of the enemy,&quot; Trehubov said. However, the geographical layout of the area, including a river that cuts through the village, complicates defensive maneuvers, according to Trehubov. A screenshot of the map by the DeepState monitoring group as of Jan. 23, 2025, showing the front-line village of Velyka Novosilka, Donetsk Oblast. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)According to Trehubov, Russia&apos;s numerical advantage in manpower in the area poses significant challenges. &quot;They are constantly conducting rotations, adding personnel, and replenishing their deployed forces. They still have this resource,&quot; Trehubov added. He said that preventing encirclement and maintaining access to Velyka Novosilka remains a priority for Ukrainian troops. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi previously described the ongoing Russian offensive in the east as &quot;one of the most powerful&quot; since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Throughout the fall of 2024, Russian forces made operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, including areas near Toretsk and Chasiv Yar, while advancing near Kupiansk and on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-soldiers-near-velyka-novosilka-at-risk-of-encirclement-spokesperson-says/	2025-01-23T07:26:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1618591092.jpg
Ukraine's central bank raises key policy rate to 14.5% due to inflation	Ukraine&apos;s National Bank (NBU) announced on Jan. 23 that it will raise the key policy rate from 13.5% to 14.5% per annum starting from Jan. 24. The Ukrainian economy was heavily hit by Russia&apos;s full-scale war. At the start of the invasion, inflation skyrocketed to 26.6% in 2022 from 10.0% in 2021. It subsided the following year but in 2024, the inflation again accelerated to 12%, exceeding NBU&apos;s forecast. &quot;In order to maintain the stability of the foreign exchange market, keep expectations under control, and gradually bring inflation to the 5% target on the policy horizon, the NBU Board decided to raise the key policy rate by 1% to 14.5%,&quot; chairman Andrii Pyshnyi said in a press briefing. The NBU raised its key policy rate to 10% in January 2022. It had remained unchanged since the beginning of the all-out war, but on June 3, 2022, the rate grew from 10% to 25%. For over a year, it remained at the same level, dropping to 22% in July 2023 and following a gradual decline. In December 2024, the NBU raised the key policy rate from 13% to 13.5% in response to inflationary developments. According to Pyshnyi, the NBU will likely continue &quot;tightening interest rate policy if signs of sustained inflationary pressure and the threat of imbalance in inflation expectations persist.&quot; Inflation is likely to continue rising in the first months of 2025, peaking in the second quarter and then starting to decline in the middle of the year. According to the NBU&apos;s forecast, inflation will slow to 8.4% by the end of 2025 and to 5% in 2026. &quot;This will be supported by the NBU&apos;s interest rate and exchange rate policies, as well as by higher harvests, an improvement in the energy sector, a reduction in the fiscal deficit, and moderate external price pressure,&quot; NBU&apos;s statement read.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-national-bank-raises-key-policy-rate-by-1-due-to-inflation/	2025-01-23T06:08:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1401596737.jpg
Trump needs to come out on top' — Zelensky on US president's role in ending war	The end of the war must be a victory for U.S. President Donald Trump, not for Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview for Bloomberg TV on Jan. 22. Zelensky&apos;s statement comes amid Trump&apos;s calls for an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and recent threats to impose sanctions on Moscow if a &quot;deal&quot; is not reached soon. &quot;I think the issue of ending the war in Ukraine must be a victory for Trump, not for Putin. Putin is nobody for him. America is much stronger, Europe is much stronger, China is stronger than Russia. They are all players,&quot; Zelensky told Bloomberg TV. Zelensky added that the war showed Russia&apos;s inability to fully occupy Ukraine. &quot;They (Russia) are big, they have a lot of weapons, and they don&apos;t spare people,&quot; he said. &quot;We are specifically defending Europe, NATO countries. And Putin will go there.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s why Trump needs to come out on top. And he is capable of doing so.&quot; According to Zelensky, Trump must conclude such an agreement that will prevent Putin from resuming the aggression further down the line. The Ukrainian president also noted that &quot;everyone should have a plan&quot; before they start communicating directly with Putin. Trump has signaled his intent to meet Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; after taking office. While the Kremlin welcomed the remarks, it noted that no preparations for the meeting are currently underway. Trump&apos;s team is reportedly working on arranging a call with Putin shortly after the inauguration, with the goal of initiating a settlement plan for the war in Ukraine within the first months of his presidency. The U.S. president&#x2019;s team Trump aims to preserve Ukraine&apos;s independence, though U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that both Kyiv and Moscow would have to make concessions to achieve a peace deal.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-needs-to-come-out-on-top-zelensky-on-us-presidents-role-in-ending-war-in-ukraine/	2025-01-23T05:42:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169777527.jpg
To ban Tchaikovsky or not, that is the question	In 2022, Lithuania&#x2019;s then-Culture Minister Simonas Kairys decided that performing Russian composer Pyotr Illyich Tchaikovsky&#x2019;s classic ballet &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; was no longer an appropriate way to celebrate the Christmas season. Lithuania is a staunch supporter of Ukraine, and Kairys, believing that Russian culture could not be separated from Russian imperialism, called for a &#x201C;mental quarantine&#x201D; &#x2014; otherwise known as &#x201C;cultural decolonization.&#x201D; At the end of last year, &#x160;ar&#x16B;nas Birutis, the newly installed culture minister, announced that he liked Tchaikovsky&#x2019;s music and saw no reason to prohibit it. Some Lithuanians agree, including another former minister of culture, who said: &#x201C;We fought Soviet power to get the freedom not to ban things.&#x201D; The Nutcracker debate in Lithuania echoes similar, though usually more fraught, arguments in Ukraine. In 2023, the Kyiv City Council decided that Russian music, plays, books, and art should no longer be showcased in public. Statues of Alexander Pushkin, one of Russia&#x2019;s greatest poets, were removed from public places. The patriotic urge to ban works of art associated with an enemy country is not new, of course. During World War I, some British people wanted to prohibit the performance of German music in concert halls, and there was even a proposal to replace German-made pianos with British-made models. When World War II came around, music played a very different role in Britain. The celebrated British pianist Myra Hess performed her famous lunchtime concerts in London during the Blitz. Hess, who was Jewish, saw no problem with playing music by the great German composers. To her, and to the Londoners who flocked to hear her, Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach belonged to the world, not to Germany alone. In Nazi Germany, the same music was performed on official occasions, such as Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s birthday, to demonstrate the superiority of German culture. Wilhelm Furtw&#xE4;ngler, the most famous German conductor at the time, would not have disagreed about the exalted status of German music, but he was not a Nazi. In his view, great music lifted people above politics and wartime propaganda, hence his refusal to leave his home country, or to stop performing there. German conductor and composer Wilhelm Furtwaengler acknowledges the applause of the audience after a concert by the Berlin Philharmonic in Berlin, Germany, on Jan.1, 1933. In the front row are (L-R) Herman Goering, Adolf Hitler, and Josef Goebbels. (Getty Images)The Nazis never banned all &#x201C;enemy culture&#x201D; either. Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays were performed in Germany throughout World War II, although &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; posed some problems: Shylock, the Jewish moneylender, might evoke a little too much sympathy. One of the aims of wartime propaganda is to demonize the enemy and portray them as less than human. Hollywood movies had been very popular in Japan (and in Germany) until December 1941. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese propaganda portrayed Americans as &#x201C;devils and beasts,&#x201D; and their devilish and beastly cultural products were swiftly taken out of circulation. So, is banning the art of another country ever a good idea? In principle, no. Tchaikovsky cannot be held responsible for Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s war of aggression. Withholding great works of art from the public will have a narrowing, provincializing effect. Artists like Ludwig van Beethoven, William Shakespeare, and Leo Tolstoy transcend borders. And yet, perhaps the Ukrainians should be given some slack. Britain was not in danger of being dominated by German culture during WWII, let alone forcibly assimilated into it. Putin&#x2019;s vision of building a broader &quot;Russkiy mir&quot; (Russian world) in which peripheral countries are subservient to the Kremlin, and their cultures are reduced to folkloric dances on official occasions, poses a fundamental threat to Ukraine&#x2019;s survival as an independent nation-state. To speak of cultural decolonization suggests a parallel between Ukraine and the former European colonies in Asia and Africa, where some local elites were indeed Anglicized or Francicized. But a better comparison would be to Korea under the Japanese Empire between 1910 and 1945. During this period, Koreans were not so much colonial subjects as widely despised second-class citizens. In the later stages of Japan&#x2019;s imperial rule, Koreans were forced to adopt Japanese names and be educated in Japanese. After Japan&#x2019;s defeat in World War II, Koreans, nearly robbed of their identity, also narrowed their cultural horizon by rejecting all things Japanese. It was only in the 1990s that Japanese movies, comic books, pop music, and literature began to re-enter South Korea, and they were not always well received. To those of us who espouse the principle of universal humanism, this kind of cultural chauvinism might seem provincial, if not bigoted. But Koreans were once fighting for their survival as a people. Culture was an existential matter. The same is true for Ukrainians today. Shunning Russian music, art, and literature, despite having deep historic links with such works, will not do much for universal humanism in Ukraine. But Ukrainians have more pressing concerns: they must fight to maintain their own distinct language and culture, as well as their own government. Once they secure their sovereignty, neither they, nor indeed the Lithuanians, will have any reason to fear Pushkin&#x2019;s poetry or Tchaikovsky&#x2019;s music.

Syrskyi sees 'gradual' improvement in scandal-hit French-trained brigade's capabilities	Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 23 that the French-trained 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Brigade is &quot;gradually acquiring certain combat capabilities&quot; after reports of poor command and training. The unit became a center of controversy after the Censor.net outlet uncovered rampant cases of mismanagement that led to high rates of losses and desertions. The brigade was deployed at the Pokrovsk sector, the most critical section of the front in Donetsk Oblast, in November 2024. &quot;All negative aspects and difficulties that arose during... (the brigade&#x2019;s) deployment in Ukraine have been analyzed, and the conclusions will be taken into account during the further training of service members,&quot; Syrskyi said after discussion with officers during his visit to the Pokrovsk sector. Censor.net&apos;s chief editor, Yurii Butusov, laid the blame for the brigade&apos;s poor performance on the Ukrainian military and political leadership, saying that France provided all the necessary support . Similarly, Syrskyi thanked France for being &quot;the first country to respond to the request to create a mechanized brigade and fulfilled all its obligations regarding the training and equipment.&quot; The scandal cast doubt on Ukraine&apos;s initiative to build fresh new brigades that would be trained and supplied with the support of Western partners. The 155th Brigade was to be the flagship unit of this project. Ukrainian authorities have launched an investigation into the brigade&apos;s mismanagement, with its former commander being reportedly detained earlier this week.	https://kyivindependent.com/syrskyi-sees-gradual-improvement-in-scandal-ridden-155th-brigades-capabilities/	2025-01-23T05:27:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1550396164.jpg
Zelensky clarifies comment on 200,000 peacekeepers, says figure depends on Ukrainian army size	President Volodymyr Zelensky on Jan. 23 clarified his earlier comments on the number of European peacekeepers needed to maintain peace in Ukraine, saying the required numbers would depend on the size of Ukraine&#x2019;s own military. The statement comes after Zelensky told a journalist at the World Economic Forum in Davos that at least 200,000 European soldiers would be needed for a stable peace deal. &quot;By the way, I didn&#x2019;t say we need 200,000 (peacekeepers)... A journalist asked me, I said, &apos;maybe more, maybe less,&apos;&quot; Zelensky said when asked about the statement in an interview with Bloomberg TV. Zelensky spoke in comparably stronger terms in Davos, saying: &quot;From all the Europeans? 200,000, it&#x2019;s a minimum. It&#x2019;s a minimum, otherwise it&#x2019;s nothing.&quot; The president explained in the interview that the size of the needed contingent will depend on the strength of the Ukrainian military. As Kyiv would struggle to maintain a million-strong army needed to repel a future Russian aggression, fielding such a force would depend on U.S. and European support, he explained. If the U.S. and Europe prove unwilling to help maintain such an army and Ukraine reduces it &quot;by 200,000, 300,000 or 500,000, it means that other troops have to replace them in those numbers,&quot; Zelensky added. The president&#x2019;s conclusion was that in the face of such options, Ukraine&#x2019;s accession to NATO is the cheapest way toward stable peace both for Ukraine and the West. At the same time, Zelensky admitted that some members &#x2013; namely the U.S., Germany, Slovakia, and Hungary &#x2013; remain reluctant to allow Ukraine into the alliance. Zelensky has been in contact with a number of European leaders about the prospects of a peacekeeping mission &#x2014; an initiative that French President Emmanuel Macron has spearheaded. During a visit to Kyiv on Jan. 16, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that his country will play its &quot;full part&quot; in supporting efforts to maintain an enduring peace in Ukraine. The idea has also found support from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called upon Europe to take up greater responsibility for Ukraine&#x2019;s security and pledged to bring a swift end to the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-clarifies-comment-on-200-000-peacekeepers/	2025-01-23T04:58:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194672328.jpg
Kremlin sees 'no new elements' in Trump's statement on sanctions against Russia	The Kremlin sees nothing new in U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s threats to impose sanctions if no deal on the war in Ukraine is reached, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Jan. 23 during his press briefing. A day earlier, Trump said that if a &quot;deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine was not reached soon, he would have no choice but to &quot;put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries.&quot; &quot;We don&apos;t see any particularly new elements here. You know that Trump, in the first iteration of his presidency, was the American president who most often resorted to sanctions methods,&quot; Peskov said. Russia is ready for an &quot;equal and respectful&quot; dialogue with the U.S., as it was during Trump&apos;s first term, Peskov added. The Kremlin spokesman also noted that no preparations are currently underway for a meeting between Trump and Putin. During the election campaign, Trump promised to end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours, though his choice for special Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, has since revised this to 100 days. The Trump team hopes to quickly begin work on a settlement plan that could be implemented within the first few months of his presidency. A meeting with Putin is part of the plan, according to CNN. Trump has often voiced sympathies for the Russian leader while criticizing the level of support the outgoing Biden administration gave to Kyiv. This prompted concerns that the new U.S. leadership might cut a deal unfavorable to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-sees-no-new-elements-in-trumps-statement-on-sanctions-against-russia/	2025-01-23T04:10:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245735181.jpeg
Russian cargo ship Sparta II docks in Syria after weeks drifting at sea, tracking data shows	A Russian cargo ship supposed to evacuate Russian military equipment from Russia&apos;s Tartus naval base in Syria has finally docked after spending weeks drifting in the Mediterranean, MarineTraffic data showed on Jan. 22. The Sparta II, a Russian cargo ship under U.S. sanctions, had been drifting near Tartus since Jan. 5 after leaving Baltiysk in Kaliningrad Oblast on Dec. 11. Following the December overthrow of Russian-backed dictator Bashar al-Assad by rebel forces, the new Syrian authorities refused to grant entry to the ship. Reports indicate that Russian forces have dismantled air defense radars and moved over 100 trucks of equipment to the port, but without access for Russian ships, personnel and equipment had been left stranded. The Insider reported on Jan. 21 that Syrian authorities had finally granted permission for the ship to dock, and MarineTraffic data shows it moored at Tartus as of Jan. 23. A circle marks the postion of the Sparta II on Jan. 23 as shown on MarineTraffic.com (MarineTraffic)But while Russia may now be able to evacuate some of its personnel and equipment, the Kremlin&apos;s long term presence at the Mediterranean port was thrown into doubt earlier this week when Syria canceled Russia&apos;s 49-year operating lease for Tartus. The contract, signed in 2019, had committed Moscow to invest at least $500 million in modernizing the port. With the agreement now void, all revenues from the port&apos;s operations will go directly to the Syrian state, and its management will revert to local authorities. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha addressed Russia&#x2019;s military presence in Syria during a Dec. 30 diplomatic visit to Damascus. According to Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi, Ukraine and the new Syrian leadership share similar views on the matter, though specific details were not disclosed.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-cargo-ship-sparta-ii-docks-in-syria-after-weeks-drifting-in-mediterranean/	2025-01-23T04:10:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screen-Shot-2025-01-23-at-13_21_06.png
Putin increasingly concerned about state of Russia’s economy, Reuters reports	Russian President Vladimir Putin appears increasingly concerned about the country&apos;s economy as U.S. President Donald Trump calls for an end to the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Jan. 23, citing five undisclosed sources. Throughout the nearly three years of full-scale invasion, Ukraine&apos;s Western partners imposed heavy sanctions on Moscow to undermine its ability to wage war. Initially, Russia has largely weather the sanctions, circumventing economic restrictions through third-party countries and various loopholes. The situation appears to be shifting as Russia has faced mounting economic challenges over the past months, compounded by labor shortages and military spending-induced inflation that led to record interest rates. Putin insisted that Russia would continue to fight as long as necessary and would not compromise its interests. At the same time, the Russian president acknowledged the pressure on the economy caused by the war, Reuters reported, citing its undisclosed source. Putin was also dissatisfied with the decline in private investment due to the high cost of credit. During a meeting with Russian business leaders in December, the president chided the economic bloc&apos;s top officials, according to two sources. In 2025, Russia has increased defense spending to a post-Soviet record level of 6.3% of GDP, which is one-third of budget expenditures, causing inflation. The economic situation in Russia has pushed some of the Russian elite to seek a negotiated settlement to the war, according to two sources familiar with the Kremlin&apos;s views. Trump has yet to present a detailed plan for peace in Ukraine, despite campaigning on promises to put a swift end to the conflict. While he frequently references his good relationship with Putin, his recent comments on Moscow have taken a somewhat harder line. The U.S. president recently urged Putin to &quot;make a deal&quot; on Ukraine, threatening with &quot;high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries&quot; if he fails to do so. Russia has thus far dismissed any reported peace proposals from the Trump administration and maintained its ambitions to fully occupy four Ukrainian regions &#x2014;Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. Trump has said that arrangements for a face-to-face meeting with Putin are currently underway.	https://kyivindependent.com/putins-concerns-about-russias-economy-growing-amid-trumps-calls-for-wars-end-reuters-reports/	2025-01-23T03:49:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1246326347.jpg
Russian forces suspected of killing 6 Ukrainian POWs in Donetsk Oblast	Ukrainian prosecutors are investigating a case of Russian troops summarily executing six Ukrainian captives in the embattled Donetsk Oblast, the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office said on Jan. 23. The statement came in reaction to a video circulating on social media, recorded by Russian soldiers, that apparently shows the execution of the six prisoners of war (POW). Footage also shows a seventh Ukrainian soldier lying on the ground, whose fate is unknown. &quot;According to preliminary information, during an assault against Ukrainian positions in Donetsk Oblast, Russian soldiers took six Ukrainian soldiers captives and subsequently shot them,&quot; the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office said in a statement. Executing prisoners of war is a serious violation of the Geneva Conventions and a war crime. Ukraine&#x2019;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said he had reached out to the U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross regarding the case. Throughout the full-scale war, Ukraine has documented widespread violations of the Geneva Conventions by Russian forces, including the execution of over 100 POWs in 2024 alone, according to Lubinets. Reports of torture, murder, and abuse of Ukrainian captives &#x2014; particularly in Donetsk Oblast &#x2014; have surged in recent months. Visual evidence of these atrocities continues to emerge, underscoring Russia&apos;s disregard for international law.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-apparently-kill-6-ukrainian-pows-in-donetsk-oblast/	2025-01-23T03:25:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2153450598.jpg
North Korea to send artillery units, 150 more ballistic missiles to aid Russia’s war, Budanov says	North Korea is expected to send reinforcements to Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, mainly gun and rocket artillery units, Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said in an interview with The War Zone magazine published on Jan. 23. Pyongyang is also expected to send 150 short-range KN-23 ballistic missiles to Russia in 2025, in addition to the 148 already supplied in 2024, according to the spy chief. Moscow is further set to receive additional 170 mm M1989 Koksan self-propelled artillery guns and M-1991 240 mm multiple launch rocket systems, Budanov noted, adding that North Korea provided 120 pieces of each of these systems in the past three months. The North Korean soldiers are expected to train their Russian counterparts on the supplied systems, he said. North Korea has shaped up to be Russia&#x2019;s key supporter in its war against Ukraine, providing extensive artillery ammunition, missiles, and a contingent of 12,000 troops who had joined Russia in assaults against the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast. Kyiv has said that North Korean troops have already suffered 4,000 casualties, though the number cannot be independently verified. Budanov did not provide further details on the number of North Korean reinforcements or the timeframe of their arrival. The New York Times reported that according to an undisclosed U.S. official, fresh Pyongyang troops could arrive within two months. Experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent connected North Korea&#x2019;s high casualty rates to a lack of experience with modern warfare, the &quot;human wave&quot; tactics employed against entrenched Ukrainian positions, and the resolve of North Korean troops to avoid capture, even at the cost of their own lives. Only two North Korean soldiers are in Ukrainian captivity since Pyongyang deployed its troops in Kursk Oblast last fall. Russia has ramped up its efforts to push Ukrainian forces out of their positions in Kursk Oblast, held since early August 2024. The region is expected to play a key role in any negotiations amid U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s push for peace talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-to-send-artillery-units-150-ballistic-missiles-to-aid-russias-war-budanov-says/	2025-01-23T02:40:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2037956412.jpg
US podcaster Fridman plans to visit Russia, interview Putin after criticizing Zelensky	U.S. podcaster Lex Friedman plans to visit Russia to interview Russian President Vladimir Putin, Fridman said on Jan. 22 at Joe Rogan&apos;s podcast. The podcaster previously interviewed President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv. Following the interview, Fridman criticized the Ukrainian president on X, saying that Zelensky had spoken &quot;crude words&quot; towards Putin and that this would not facilitate negotiations. &quot;There&apos;s probably a lot to say about this war. I should say that I interviewed Volodymyr Zelensky, and I will be traveling to Russia to interview Vladimir Putin, and I&apos;m aware of the risks; I accept the risks, and the goal of the mission is just to push for peace,&quot; Fridman said on the podcast The Joe Rogan Experience. Fridman did not specify when he would visit Russia or whether he had already agreed to an interview with the Russian authorities. The Kremlin has not commented on Fridman&apos;s statement. The podcaster also added that he believes that U.S. President Donald Trump is capable of bringing peace closer. &quot;I think that both Zelensky and Putin fear Donald Trump. And that&apos;s a great person to then make peace. All of them believe, both Putin and Zelensky, that Trump would do some crazy shit,&quot; he said. With nearly five million subscribers on his YouTube channel, Fridman, born in Tajikistan and raised in Moscow, organized an interview with Zelensky that was published on Jan. 5 as part of what he described as his &quot;small part in pushing for peace.&quot; Fridman&apos;s show has previously hosted controversial figures, including Trump, entrepreneur Elon Musk, political commentator Vivek Ramaswamy, and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, some of whom have advanced narratives portraying Ukraine as a corrupt nation bent on escalating war with Russia. In a three-hour interview, Fridman tried to persuade Zelensky that Putin is &quot;a serious person who loves his country.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/fridman-plans-to-interview-putin/	2025-01-23T02:22:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1239295205-1.jpg
Ukraine is failing the mobilization test	Ukrainian society largely does not want to mobilize. Nearly 6 million Ukrainian men have not updated their information in military enlistment centers, and most of them likely don&apos;t have grounds for a deferment or exemption. Forced mobilization of these men is categorically opposed by society. Rosy-cheeked aunts gather and shout &quot;shame&quot; at military enlistment officers tasked with searching for draft dodgers. Society is also resistant to the mobilization of 25-year-old &quot;children.&quot; However, this sentiment does not extend to the sons of elites and deputies, who are readily and unhesitatingly deemed fit for the front lines. &quot;Let (former Ukrainian President Petro) Poroshenko&apos;s and (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky&apos;s sons fight,&quot; they say. There is also a reluctance to pay more taxes &#x2014; and I&#x2019;m not even addressing the other duties or requirements imposed during martial law. Furthermore, society is adamantly against sending soldiers from other branches of the military into infantry. Being in the infantry is not seen as an honor for Ukrainian soldiers but as something dirty and undignified &#x2014; a form of punishment. At the same time, society strongly opposes sending poorly trained recruits into infantry. Ten years of war and three years of full-scale invasion weren&apos;t enough to prepare Ukrainian men. Now, they must undergo at least six months of preparation, preferably abroad, where it&apos;s easier to avoid service. One can talk endlessly about drone warfare and a shortage of equipment and artillery, but it&apos;s the infantry that holds the front line. The front line stretches 3,000 kilometers, with active combat continuing on a third of it. Society is unwilling to answer the question of where the military command should find the personnel to maintain the line against a vastly superior enemy &#x2014; let the government solve this, but without mobilizing anyone and, God forbid, calling up 25-year-olds. Let the MPs, prosecutors, and police officers go to war. Never mind that there aren&apos;t enough MPs and prosecutors to form even one regiment, and police officers have already been fighting with full brigades from the start. Society has failed the test of maturity. The political opposition battles the government as though elections are just around the corner, despite the fact that elections cannot be held during martial law. Instead of seeking compromises with the opposition, the government prefers to keep political traitors and collaborators on a leash, cooperating with them while losing more and more credibility.

(Kostiantyn Liberov / Libkos / Getty Images)A Ukrainian soldier stands in a trench near Bakhmut, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on Oct. 25, 2023. (Kostya Liberov / Libkos / Getty Images)One can rightfully criticize the government for its failures. It&#x2019;s fair, they exist. But the government is a reflection of the views and politics of society. There is no demand for mobilization, and thus there is no adequate mobilization policy. There is no demand to transition the country&#x2019;s economy to a wartime footing, and so there are no corresponding unpopular decisions. However, the issue of the enemy&#x2019;s total advantage in infantry remains unresolved. Yes, our partners are right. If we want the world to protect democracy in Ukraine, Ukrainians themselves must be the first to defend our democracy. There will be no negotiations on terms that suit us while the enemy continues to seize more and more territory. It&#x2019;s time to remove the rose-colored glasses. The West favors strong partners, but as we retreat daily, we are not seen as strong, no matter how much weapons and money we receive. They are telling us this directly. Are there issues with military management? Of course. But if you believe this is some secret plan by spies working for the enemy within our General Staff, I pity you. That&#x2019;s conspiracy theory-level thinking, like believing the Earth is flat. What reforms can we talk about when the only goal of the military command is to hold the front line from collapsing and prevent the enemy from breaking through into our rear? All available reserves are being used. That&#x2019;s why we see mismatches of various units on small sections of the front line, leading to management problems. In my opinion, there is no point in discussing management reforms without creating reserves that would ensure the implementation of those reforms. Forming these reserves is purely a political issue that must be addressed with political decisions. This question should be directed to political leaders, not military command. Zelensky and Ukraine&apos;s parliament bear full responsibility for what is happening on the front line. These two political entities failed mobilization. To fix this, unpopular political decisions must be made, regardless of ratings and the opportunistic opposition, which will inevitably exploit this. Otherwise, we won&#x2019;t make it.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-is-failing-the-mobilization-test/	2025-01-23T01:28:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1749112458.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 46 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least two people and injured at least 46 over the past day, including an infant, regional authorities reported on Jan. 23. Moscow&#x2019;s forces launched 92 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, as well as four Iskander-M or North Korean KN-23 ballistic missiles fired against Zaporizhzhia, according to the Air Force. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 57 drones, while 27 were lost in the airspace without inflicting damage, the Air Force said. Russia launched drones and missiles against the city of Zaporizhzhia overnight, killing a 47-year-old man and injuring at least 31 people, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. Twenty-two of the injured are hospitalized and are in a condition of medium severity. Among them is a two-month old baby, Fedorov said. The injured victims also included members of the State Emergency Service. One apartment building was destroyed and 30 were damaged in the city, in addition to damaged houses and non-residential buildings. A Russian airstrike against the city of Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast killed one civilian and injured eight, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Fourteen houses, eight apartment buildings, and dozens of other buildings, infrastructure facilities, and cars were damaged. In Kherson Oblast, seven people were injured in Russian attacks, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. Twelve houses were damaged in the strikes.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-120/	2025-01-23T01:19:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/2025-01-23-11_15_22.jpg
Trump's national security adviser Waltz starts purging NSC, including aides working with Ukraine	U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz has launched a full vetting of the National Security Council (NSC) staff, including those working with Ukraine, in line with Donald Trump&apos;s America First agenda, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Jan. 23. Since returning to the White House, Trump has implemented significant changes in the new administration&apos;s staff. Trump&#x2019;s picks included candidates who have made controversial statements about Ukraine&apos;s support and ending the war. The &quot;full review&quot; aims to ensure that the NSC staff &quot;are committed to implementing President Trump&apos;s America First agenda to protect our national security and wisely use the tax dollars of America&apos;s working men and women,&quot; National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said in a statement. During a telephone call on Jan. 22, conducted by Waltz&apos;s chief of staff, Brian McCormack, NSC employees were told that they were to leave the office immediately. They were instructed that they could return only at the request of their supervisors, senior directors appointed by the Trump administration, the WP reported. According to the outlet, about 150 employees remained from the Biden administration, and the departure of such a large number of employees could complicate the administration&apos;s work during the transition period. Dozens of officials sent home on Jan. 22 had been assigned to the NSC from other government agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, the State Department, and the Pentagon. Those interested in staying with the NSC under Trump were asked to contact the human resources department and told that the new team would review those requests, according to three officials familiar with the matter. Trump has yet to present a detailed plan for peace in Ukraine, despite campaigning on promises to put a swift end to the conflict. While he frequently references his good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, his comments on Moscow in recent days have taken a somewhat harder line. When asked on Jan. 21 if he would impose additional sanctions if Putin refuses to negotiate, Trump replied: &quot;Sounds likely.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Jan. 21 Ukraine is actively working to arrange a meeting between him and Trump. &quot;We are your partner. We know all the sore spots; we have lost our people,&quot; Zelensky said, noting Trump&apos;s pledge to end the war in 2025. &quot;We want to end the war this year. But not just quickly, but fairly and, above all, reliably for us.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-national-security-adviser-waltz-starts-purging-nsc-including-those-working-with-ukraine/	2025-01-23T00:47:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2173993733.jpg
Kyiv announces release of 3 Ukrainian sailors from Houthi captivity	Editor&#x2019;s note: The story is being updated. Ukraine&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry and military intelligence agency secured the release of three Ukrainian crew members of the Galaxy Leader commercial vessel from the Houthi captivity in a &quot;joint operation,&quot; the ministry said in the statement on Jan. 23. The news comes as the Yemeni rebel group released the crew of the ship captured in November 2023 as part of attacks on vessels sailing through the Red Sea corridor. The decision is seen as part of de-escalation efforts in the wake of the Gaza ceasefire. In the statement, the Foreign Ministry did not provide further details on the release of the three Ukrainian citizens but said they are &quot;in the care of Ukrainian diplomats, are in good condition, and have all the necessary documents.&quot; The multinational crew of 25 also included sailors from Romania, Mexico, Bulgaria, and the Philippines. Ukraine has led talks on the release of its citizens since the vessel was captured, the ministry said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-secures-release-of-3-ukrainian-sailors-from-houthi-captivity/	2025-01-23T00:19:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2152897501.jpg

Depends what 'deal' means — Kremlin responds to Trump's sanctions threats	Russia will have to determine what U.S. President Donald Trump means by &quot;deal&quot; before entering into negotiations to end the full-scale war in Ukraine, Russia&apos;s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said on Jan. 22. Polyanskiy&apos;s remarks come shortly after Trump threatened to impose economic penalties on Russia if the country does not &quot;make a deal&quot; to end the war. &quot;If a deal is not reached, I will have no other choice but to put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries,&quot; he posted on his social media platform Truth Social earlier on Jan. 22. &quot;We can do it the easy way or the hard way.&quot; In response, Polyanskiy said Moscow would have to determine what Trump&apos;s aims are before it enters any agreements. &quot;It&apos;s not merely the question of ending the war,&quot; Polyanskiy told Reuters. &quot;It&apos;s first and foremost the question of addressing root causes of Ukrainian crisis. So we have to see what does the &apos;deal&apos; mean in President Trump&apos;s understanding.&quot; Trump has the opportunity to end Washington&apos;s current &quot;malicious policy&quot; against Russia, he added. Trump has yet to present a detailed plan for peace in Ukraine, despite campaigning on promises to put a swift end to the conflict. While he frequently references his good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, his comments on Moscow in recent days have taken a somewhat harder line. When asked on Jan. 21 if he would impose additional sanctions if Putin refuses to negotiate, Trump replied, &quot;Sounds likely.&quot; His team is reportedly devising a sanctions strategy to pressure Russia to the negotiating table. Russia has thus far dismissed any reported peace proposals from the Trump administration and maintained its ambitions to fully occupy four Ukrainian regions &#x2014;Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson.

Prigozhin’s Wagner Group accused of plotting attacks on Chevron, cooperating with Al Qaeda, leaked emails show	The late Russian warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin&apos;s Wagner mercenary force has been accused of plotting attacks against Western infrastructure in Africa, including U.S. oil company Chevron&apos;s pipelines, according to the leaked correspondence of Prigozhin&apos;s Concord Group obtained by Ukraine&apos;s 24 Channel. Another accusation is that Wagner mercenaries have allegedly cooperated with terrorists, including Al Qaeda, in Africa. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the information. The hacked correspondence contains numerous emails written by relatives of Wagner mercenaries killed in Ukraine, as well as mothers and fathers asking Prigozhin to hire their sons. The obtained emails shed light on a scandal involving food poisoning allegedly caused by the Concord Group. The group did not respond to a request for comment. Prigozhin, once a trusted confidant of Russian President Vladimir Putin, rose to infamy as the mastermind behind Wagner, Russia&apos;s most notorious mercenary force. Wagner fighters have left their mark across Africa, Syria, and Ukraine &#x2014; most notably in the grinding battles in the country&apos;s Donetsk Oblast, where they spearheaded Russia&apos;s offensive from 2022 to 2023. However, in June 2023, Prigozhin fell out with the Kremlin and led an armed rebellion, only to abruptly call it off after negotiations with Putin. Two months later, in August 2023, Prigozhin was killed in a plane crash, an incident that many independent observers have pinned on Putin as the likely orchestrator. In March 2021, Igor Smirnov wrote an email to Prigozhin&apos;s Concord Group that retired Russian officers were expected to take part in attacks on foreign infrastructure facilities in West Africa. Smirnov, allegedly a former Russian intelligence officer who allegedly worked for oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was attempting to frame or warn the group. He claimed that &quot;a group of Russians is contacting many armed groups in West Africa, including Ansaru, an Al Qaeda affiliate in Nigeria.&quot; &quot;In exchange for attacks on Western oil companies, jihadists are helping to arm militants in the Niger Delta under a direct agreement with the Russians,&quot; Smirnov said. &quot;After the first attacks on Western companies, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb will take responsibility for that.&quot; Supporters of Niger&apos;s National Council of Safeguard of the Homeland (CNSP) wave the Niger national flag (R) and flag bearing the logo of private military company Wagner, as they protest outside the Niger and French airbase to demand the departure of the French army from Niger, in Niamey on Sept. 16, 2023. (AFP via Getty Images)He also claimed that he had video and audio recordings implicating a Wagner mercenary in the negotiations about the attacks. &quot;All of this will soon come crashing down on your company, which destabilizes the situation in West Africa, cooperates with terrorists, and is waging an indirect war against the West,&quot; Smirnov added. In another email, Smirnov also accused Wagner Group of extorting money from U.S. oil company Chevron in exchange for the security of the company&apos;s pipelines in Nigeria. He claimed that the extortion had been &quot;documented by Khodorkovsky.&quot; He also attached a video that allegedly shows an associate of Wagner Group&apos;s chief of staff, Andrei Troshev, meeting with Nigerian warlord Asari Dokubo. This is not the first time Wagner mercenaries stand accused of illegal activities in Africa. Journalist Orkhan Dzhemal, film director Alexander Rastorguyev, and cameraman Kirill Radchenko were killed in the Central African Republic in 2018 while investigating the activity of Wagner mercenaries there. In 2019, Khodorkovsky&apos;s Dossier Center published an investigation according to which Wagner Group could have been behind the murder. Chevron and Khodorkovsky&apos;s press office did not respond to requests for comment. The emails obtained by the 24 Channel also reveal the consequences of Wagner Group&apos;s participation in Russia&apos;s offensives in Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk Oblast, including the Battle of Bakhmut, in 2022 and 2023. Wagner Group recruited thousands of convicts who were pardoned by Putin in exchange for military service. The convicts routinely took part in human wave attacks in Bakhmut and other areas, suffering disproportionately high casualties in the grinding offensives. Starting from January 2023, many people sent emails to Wagner asking the company about their killed relatives and compensation for their deaths. In January 2023, Ekaterina Merzlyak wrote that a 25-year-old Wagner fighter had been killed in December 2022 and later buried in the village of Krasnoselkup in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District. &quot;Fellow villagers are outraged that not a single representative of the local authorities showed due respect to the parents of our hero,&quot; she said. &quot;They did not assist with the organization of the funeral or with transportation. There was complete silence as if nothing had happened.&quot; Screenshot of Wagner mercenary group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin claiming to be on the African continent in a video published to the &quot;Razgruzka Vagnera&quot; Telegram channel linked to the mercenary group on Aug. 21, 2023. (Telegram)Merzlyak also wrote that his &quot;father had to transport the coffin himself with a trailer over a bumpy winter road for five hours, despite the fact that our administration finds it easy to bring in some singer by helicopter for City Day celebrations.&quot; The correspondence also contains emails written by prison inmates&apos; mothers asking Wagner to recruit their sons. &quot;Dear Yevgeny Viktorovich (Prigozhin), I am asking for your help! Please help my son redeem himself,&quot; one of them wrote to Prigozhin in November 2022. &quot;My son went to Moscow to earn a living. Unfortunately, he got into trouble there and ended up in pretrial detention.&quot; She wrote Prigozizhin &quot;to help my son get to the front,&quot; saying that &quot;he is very eager for your help!&quot; A man named Andrei Lapshin wrote in April 2023 that his 15-year old son, a cadet at a military school, is &quot;deeply engaged in the patriotic agenda, sees his future in the ranks of Russian law enforcement agencies and is an avid fan of Wagner Group.&quot; &quot;Therefore, I would like to ask for your help in possibly arranging a job for him during the summer break &#x2014; so that he doesn&apos;t waste his time working at some chain caf&#xE9; or as a courier, but rather gets involved in a real, serious, necessary, and useful task for our Motherland,&quot; Lapshin added. Some other emails were more critical of Wagner Group&apos;s activities. A woman named Dinara Satanova wrote in July 2023 that the hands of Wagner Group&apos;s leadership were &quot;stained with the blood of our children, husbands, and brothers.&quot; &quot;We are aware of the facts of killings, abuse, denial of medical assistance, and starvation, despite all efforts to conceal them,&quot; she said. Satanova said that Wagner&apos;s drive to recruit convicts was &quot;like slave trade from which the company made millions.&quot; &quot;You have destroyed and ruined our families, our children,&quot; she said. &quot;On what grounds were children under the age of 22 recruited? Mothers were not informed, and no consent was given.&quot; Apart from military activities, the correspondence covers Concord Group&apos;s food procurement schemes. In 2019, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny&apos;s team exposed Concord Group&apos;s low-quality food deliveries to schools and kindergartens in Moscow and St. Petersburg, which resulted in the poisoning of hundreds of children. Amid the scandal, many parents sent emails to Concord Group and demanded compensation. In response to the accusations, in August 2019, Prigozhin accused Navalny and his associate Lyubov Sobol of orchestrating the poisoning, according to the leaked correspondence. He claimed that Navalny and Sobol &quot;extorted 300 million rubles ($3 million) to avoid stirring up a scandal regarding the children.&quot; A portrait of late head of Wagner paramilitary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, displayed at a makeshift memorial in Moscow, Russia, on Aug. 27, 2023. (Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP via Getty Images)&quot;We have made significant progress in this investigation and do not rule out the possibility that the poisoning incident was the result of a blatant act of sabotage, as numerous facts suggest,&quot; Prigozhin said. &quot;As you know, Sobol is a person willing to commit any crime to become a politician... We have witnesses who confirm that Sobol was directly involved in the children&apos;s illness.&quot; He claimed that Sobol and Navalny &quot;could have been the masterminds and organizers of this terrible crime.&quot; Despite Prigozhin&apos;s claims, even a Russian court recognized in 2019 that Concord Group was to blame for the food poisoning and ordered it to pay compensation. Navalny himself survived a poisoning attempt in 2020. A joint investigation by The Insider, Bellingcat, CNN, and Der Spiegel revealed that Navalny had been poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent by agents of Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service. In February 2024, Navalny died in a Russian prison. Independent experts say that he was either killed intentionally or died due to harsh conditions and lack of medical treatment. Navalny&apos;s team did not respond to a request for comment.	https://kyivindependent.com/prigozhins-wagner-group-accused-of-plotting-attacks-on-chevron-cooperating-with-al-qaeda-leaked-emails-show/	2025-01-22T21:00:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1259010459.jpg
Russian attack in Zaporizhzhia injures at least 16	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia attacked the city of Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Jan. 23, damaging a residential building and injuring at least 16 people, Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. The attack left at least 16 people wounded, Fedorov said. Four of the injured victims are employees of Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service. They are reportedly being treated at the hospital. Rescue operations are ongoing at the site as emergency workers search for victims who may be trapped beneath the rubble. According to Fedorov, at least four explosions occurred in Zaporizhzhia shortly after 4 a.m. local time. An aerial alert was issued over the region due to the threat of Russian ballistic missiles. The attack damaged residential buildings in the city, damaging a roof and smashing multiple windows, Fedorov said. Zaporizhzhia, home to approximately 710,000 residents before Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, is frequently targeted by Russian forces. An attack against an industrial facility in the city on Jan. 8 killed 13 people and injured 122, including a child.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-in-zaporizhzhia-injures-at-least-16/	2025-01-22T19:24:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/zapo.jpg
Zelensky meets with Serbian, Argentine presidents at Davos forum	President Volodymyr Zelensky held separate meetings with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Argentine President Javier Milei on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 22. Zelensky is leading a Ukrainian delegation at the forum, which takes place Jan. 20-24. His agenda includes bilateral talks with world leaders and meetings with top business officials. The meeting with Vucic centered on security guarantees and the two countries&apos; path to membership in the European Union, the Presidential Office said. Vucic has previously called Ukraine a &quot;friendly country&quot; and affirmed that Crimea and Donbas are sovereign Ukrainian territories, despite Serbia&apos;s historically warm relationship with Russia. During the meeting, Zelensky stressed to Vucic that &quot;sustainable peace must be supported by strong security guarantees.&quot; The leaders&apos; meeting comes a week after Vucic offered to host a potential meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Belgrade. Zelensky&apos;s meeting with Milei touched on matters of economic cooperation, recent global events, and cooperation with the U.S. following Trump&apos;s inauguration. Zelensky also issued a warm invitation for Milei to visit Ukraine. &quot;You are a much-awaited guest in Ukraine,&quot; the president said. &quot;I invite you to get to know the Ukrainian people, they love you very much. I want you to see with your own eyes how Ukrainians are fighting and what they are going through during this war. And I really want Ukrainians to feel how much you respect them.&quot; The leaders agreed to maintain high-level contacts between Ukraine and Argentina and discussed possibilities for developing trade and expanding economic cooperation. Milei has repeatedly expressed firm support for Ukrainian sovereignty in the face of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Zelensky visited Argentina in December 2023 to attend Milei&apos;s inauguration, and the two leaders held talks in Buenos Aires. Argentina in 2024 joined the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which meets regularly at the Ramstein Airbase in Germany to coordinate military aid for Ukraine, and international coalition for the return of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia. One of Zelensky&apos;s stated aims heading into the Davos forum was to meet with leaders from Latin America. Earlier in the day, Zelensky met with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz and Israeli President Isaac Herzog.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-with-serbian-argentine-presidents-at-davos-forum/	2025-01-22T19:06:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/davos.jpeg
SBU conducts 150 special operations in 3 days in large-scale security crackdown	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) conducted 157 special operations from Jan. 18-20, the agency said on Jan. 22. The SBU issued the announcement after reporting a wave of investigations, arrests, and charges in recent days. Suspects were accused of various crimes, including aiding Russia&apos;s war effort. The agency carried out 157 special operations from Jan. 18-20 in order to &quot;counter crimes that pose a threat to state security, territorial integrity and defense capabilities of our country,&quot; the SBU said. The actions resulted in 222 charges and 85 detentions, the agency said. The SBU also carried out 287 searches during the operations. According to the SBU, the three-day crackdown targeted 19 agents suspected to have carried out intelligence and sabotage activities on behalf of Russian special services. It also netted 24 individuals who allegedly harmed &quot;the economic interests&quot; of Ukraine. The SBU charged 63 people with participating in draft evasion schemes and 39 individuals with crimes related to the military, including embezzling from the state defense budget. Another seven were charged with illegal weapons trafficking, and seven others allegedly spread propaganda or otherwise posed threats to Ukraine&apos;s cybersecurity, the agency reported. President Volodymyr Zelensky on Jan. 18, the first day of the recent crackdown, praised Ukrainian law enforcement agencies for their investigations. &quot;Traitors and various schemes that weakened our state and our Ukrainian society are being countered,&quot; the president said. &quot;And anyone who stands against Ukraine or defies the laws of Ukraine must remember, that they will face a response.&quot; The SBU has announced high-profile arrests in recent days, including the detention of a well-known Dnipro lawyer who allegedly helped Russia carry out missile strikes and that of Ukraine&apos;s chief military psychaitrist, who is suspected of illicit enrichment activities. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-conducts-150-special-operations-in-3-days-in-large-scale-security-crackdown/	2025-01-22T18:00:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/SBU-badge.jpg
Russia could challenge EU's defense readiness within 5 years, Kallas says	European Union leaders are warning that Russia could test the bloc&apos;s readiness to defend itself within the next three to five years, calling for an increase in defense budgets and deepen military cooperation among member states. Speaking at a European Defense Agency meeting on Jan. 22, EU&apos;s chief diplomat Kaja Kallas stressed that the bloc must act decisively to counter Russia&apos;s growing militarization, with President Vladimir Putin allocating over one-third of his national budget to military spending &#x2014; three times what it was before the invasion of Ukraine. &quot;This is a heavily militarized country that presents an existential threat to us all,&quot; Kallas warned, citing intelligence reports suggesting that Russia is preparing for further provocations. &quot;We are running out of time. The Ukrainians are fighting for their freedom and ours. They are buying us time.&quot; German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius echoes Kallas&apos; concerns. Speaking with journalists in Lithuania, he has cautioned that Russia could be capable of attacking NATO territory within the next five to six years due to its rapid military industrialization. &quot;By 2029 or 2030, Putin could strengthen his army to the point where Russia would be capable of striking NATO,&quot; Pistorius said, according to Delfi. The minister also highlighted that Russia now produces more weapons and ammunition in months than the entire EU manufactures in a year. The EU has already committed over 130 billion euros in support to Ukraine, including nearly 50 billion euros in military aid. Member states have also trained 75,000 Ukrainian soldiers and imposed extensive sanctions on Russia. However, Kallas is adamant that more needs to be done. &quot;Russia is spending 9% of its GDP on defense, while EU member states collectively average only 1.9%. This sends a dangerous signal to the aggressor. Weakness invites them in,&quot; EU&apos;s top diplomat noted. To address these challenges, the EU is drafting a Preparedness Strategy that emphasizes stronger defense integration without forming a single European army. Instead, the plan focuses on enabling 27 capable national armies to work cohesively. &quot;We need investment from member states, the private sector, and the common EU budget. We must relay a message that we are serious about our commitment to European defense,&quot; Kallas said, highlighting the urgency of increasing production capabilities for weapons and military equipment. &quot;Ukraine is Europe&#x2019;s front line for defense,&quot; Kallas said, adding that Russia&#x2019;s military aggression has already been accompanied by hybrid warfare tactics, including cyberattacks, election interference, and sabotage across Europe. &quot;We need more, faster, and stronger support for Ukraine because the only language the Kremlin understands is the language of strength.&quot; While Russia&#x2019;s limited territorial gains in Ukraine have come at a high cost to its military and economy, EU leaders must remain cautious. &quot;Russia is not invincible, but neither is time on our side. We must prepare for the worst while striving for peace through strength.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-could-test-eus-readiness-to-defend-itself-in-3-to-5-years-time-kallas-says/	2025-01-22T15:50:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1401349176.jpg
US leadership essential in Ukraine peace efforts, Zelensky tells Bloomberg	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 22 that any effective peacekeeping force in Ukraine must include U.S. troops, emphasizing the critical role of the United States in deterring Russian aggression. Speaking with Bloomberg&apos;s Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Zelensky dismissed the idea that European allies could provide sufficient military support independently. &quot;It can&#x2019;t be without the United States,&quot; he said. &quot;Even if some European friends think it can be, no it can&#x2019;t be. Nobody will risk without the United States.&quot; As Donald Trump assumes office with plans to engage directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Zelensky seeks to secure long-term U.S. support while urging China to leverage its influence on Russia. Frustrated by limited communication with Chinese President Xi Jinping, he said: &quot;He can push Putin for peace, I&#x2019;m sure. President Trump is the strongest &#x2014; and Xi Jinping. I think there&#x2019;s no other ally who can really do it. His economy, Putin, depends very much on China.&quot; Zelensky stressed the importance of Ukraine&#x2019;s involvement in any negotiations about its future, warning against deals made without Kyiv&#x2019;s input, as he believes happened during the Minsk talks in 2015. &quot;We do not want this to happen behind the backs of Ukraine,&quot; he said. &quot;I very much believe that the U.S. won&#x2019;t do that, although I&#x2019;m not sure that earlier this did not happen. Here I&#x2019;m speaking not just about America, but some European partners.&quot; With Trump pledging a swift end to the war and planning talks with Putin, Zelensky is working to frame the negotiations as an opportunity for the U.S. to demonstrate strength. &quot;Ending the war should be a victory for Trump, not for Putin,&quot; he told Bloomberg, adding that without strong and irreversible security guarantees from the U.S. and Europe, a ceasefire could allow Russia to rearm and renew its offensive. &quot;The only question is what security guarantees and honestly I want to have understanding before the talks,&quot; he said. Zelensky has also faced challenges regarding domestic mobilization efforts, resisting pressure to expand conscription in Ukraine. Western allies, including the U.S., have urged lowering the age of conscription to bolster manpower. However, Zelensky argued that the focus should be on supplying weapons rather than drafting more soldiers. &quot;Why mobilize even younger people,&quot; he said. &quot;So that there are even more people without weapons?&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-tells-bloomberg-us-leadership-essential-in-ukraine-peace-efforts/	2025-01-22T14:46:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194672448.jpg
EU to allocate $36 billion of financial support to Ukraine	The European Union will provide 35 billion euros ($36 billion) in financial assistance to Ukraine in 2025 through the G7 ERA credit initiative and the Ukraine Facility program, European Commission&apos;s vice-president and trade commissioner announced on Jan. 22.

The money has been provided through the Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) initiative, in which G7 countries pledged to provide Ukraine with almost $50 billion loan, with the EU contributing around $20 billion. In December 2024, the U.S. Treasury Department announced a $20 billion loan to Ukraine as part of the ERA initiative, backed by the proceeds from approximately $300 billion in frozen Russian assets, primarily held in European countries, with smaller amounts in the United States and Japan.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-to-allocate-36-billion-of-financial-support-to-ukraine/	2025-01-22T13:25:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2151615401.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine's Special Forces say they killed 21 North Korean soldiers, show combat footage	Key developments on Jan. 22: Warning: Footage includes violent and graphic content. Soldiers of the 8th Regiment of Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces resisted a North Korean assault in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast for eight hours before retreating, killing 21 and wounding 40 soldiers, the unit said on Jan. 22. The statement comes as Russia ramps up efforts to push out Ukrainian troops entrenched in the western Russian region, deploying its North Korean allies in ground assaults. In a video shared by the Special Operations Forces, a large assault group of purportedly North Korean soldiers is seen crossing an open field and forest, followed by close combat footage with only dozens of meters between the two sides. In the end, graphic footage shows killed soldiers claimed to be North Koreans. &quot;At the ninth hour of the battle, the Special Operations Forces had only a third of their ammunition left. They spent the rest on destroying (North Korean forces),&quot; the Telegram post read. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage shared by Ukraine&apos;s Special Operation Forces that purports to show an engagement with North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Video released on Jan. 22, 2025. Contains graphic and violent content. (Special Operations Forces).The Ukrainian fighters held off the assault with small arms, grenade launchers, and snipers. Eventually, the Ukrainian troops retreated in two Humvees, the post read. North Korea deployed around 12,000 soldiers in Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August 2024 to bring the war to Russian territory. North Koren troops have suffered 4,000 casualties, both wounded and killed, President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed earlier in January 2025. In exchange for the troop transfer, Russia is paying over $2,000 for each North Korean soldier, though officials said it is unclear how much is allocated to individual soldiers and the Pyongyang government. A Kyiv court arrested General Yurii Halushkin, General Artur Horbenko, and Colonel Illia Lapin, three officers accused of leading an unsuccessful defense in Kharkiv Oblast during a Russian offensive last spring, Suspilne reported on Jan. 21. Russia launched a cross-border offensive into northeastern Kharkiv Oblast in May 2024, swiftly moving forward by several kilometers despite Ukraine&apos;s efforts to fortify border regions. Though the Russian offensive eventually stalled some 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Kharkiv, its initial success sparked outrage against regional and military leaders for poor defense planning. The three officers responsible for organizing the defenses were detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on Jan. 20. They were accused of violating military regulations and not using all resources at their disposal to repel the Russian offensive. &quot;This led to the seizure of part of the territory in the eastern Ukrainian region, where fierce fighting is currently ongoing,&quot; the SBU said. Halushkin commanded the Kharkiv Operational-Tactical Group, Horbenko led the 125th Territorial Defense Brigade that was deployed in the area, and Lapin commanded the brigade&apos;s 415th Battalion. The three suspects were charged with negligence in military service and &#x2014; in Horbenko&apos;s and Lapin&apos;s cases &#x2014; carrying out unauthorized withdrawal from the battlefield. They face up to 10 years in prison. &quot;The charged officials did not ensure the fortification and engineering arrangements of defensive positions (in Kharkiv Oblast). They did not ensure proper organization of units during the battle,&quot; the State Bureau of Investigation said. The suspects&apos; lawyers protested the charges. The trial comes against the backdrop of several scandals connected to poor command and organization in different brigades. Military mismanagement has often been cited as one of the key challenges plaguing Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces as it faces the Russian advance in the east. Russia lacks sufficient forces for a big breakthrough in Ukraine, NATO&apos;s Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, General Christopher Cavoli, said during a discussion on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 21. &quot;I&apos;m not worried that Ukraine could suddenly lose. I don&apos;t see the potential for a massive (Russian) breakthrough,&quot; Cavoli said. &quot;And this is not a political but a military vision. It&apos;s got to do with both sides, the effective defenses that the Ukrainians have been putting in, but also the difficulty that the Russian side has in generating significant offensive forces to be able to exploit a potential breakthrough.&quot; Russia quickly advanced in Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk Oblast in late 2024, making operationally significant gains near Toretsk, Chasiv Yar, and Kupiansk, as well as on its own soil in Kursk Oblast. Ukraine has struggled to contain the Russian offensive as Ukrainian forces are overstretched and dealing with manpower shortages. Despite Russian advances, Cavoli said Russia&apos;s slow and incremental push is &quot;exhausting&quot; for Moscow&apos;s forces. &quot;After all, there is a reason why Russia brought thousands and thousands of soldiers from North Korea,&quot; he added, referring to the 12,000-strong North Korean contingent dispatched to Kursk Oblast. &quot;I think we&apos;re going to continue to see this tension between the desire to attack and the lack of manpower on the part of the Russians. I think that will largely define the conflict and force the Russians to use more weapons of deterrence, as we&apos;ve seen them do in recent years.&quot; The general also said that though it remains unclear whether the U.S. will continue providing military aid packages under the Trump administration, he pointed to the &quot;very significant uplift in European aid&quot; provided to Ukraine. Recently inaugurated U.S. President Donald Trump criticized military aid for Ukraine during his campaign and, after his reelection, hinted at reducing it. Multiple media reports have nevertheless indicated that Trump does not intend to cut aid completely but wants to see Europe take up greater responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security. Russia wanted to install pro-Kremlin oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk as Ukraine&apos;s president after forcing President Volodymyr Zelensky to step down, the Ukrainian head of state said on Jan. 22, citing a Kremlin ultimatum he received in the early days of the full-scale war. &quot;Some people came to me on the first days of the war, some people from Ukraine&#x2026;They gave me the ultimatum from (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,&quot; Zelensky said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &quot;They said that I have to go, and they will change me (for) Medvedchuk (as president).&quot; According to Zelensky, the ultimatum also demanded Ukraine recognize Russian occupation authorities in Donbas, change its constitution to commit to &quot;neutrality,&quot; shrink its army to 50,000 troops, give up much of its weapon arsenal, and recognize Russian as an official language of Ukraine. &quot;This was not a negotiation; it&#x2019;s an ultimatum,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that Russia&#x2019;s points were similar to those later presented during unsuccessful peace talks in 2022 that took place in Turkey. Formerly a Ukrainian lawmaker and businessman, Medvedchuk was among the leading pro-Russian figures in Ukraine before the full-scale invasion. He maintained close personal relations with Putin, who is the godfather of the oligarch&apos;s daughter. Medvedchuk was detained by Ukrainian authorities in 2022 and exchanged with Russia later the same year. Possible peace talks are again coming into focus as U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table. Zelensky said earlier during the forum that his country will seek to achieve a quick but just peace this year. The U.S. and European countries remained in contact with Russia throughout the full-scale war, namely on the level of intelligence agencies, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 22. &quot;The U.S. and Russia maintained contacts on various levels during the three years of the war&#x2026; and Europeans too,&quot; Zelensky said in a meeting with international journalists. Zelensky noted that &quot;diplomacy has to have an isolationist quality, just like sanctions. If the leaders don&apos;t talk, but the intelligence agencies are constantly in touch, then, in principle, this may suit Russia.&quot; The Western countries have largely cut official contacts with Russia following the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022. The international isolation imposed on the Kremlin appears to be weakening as U.S. President Donald Trump announced his intention to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a potential peace deal. Commenting on the news that Trump plans to arrange a phone call with Putin, Zelensky said he is not surprised by Washington&apos;s efforts to establish contact with the Kremlin but believes Ukraine &quot;should be the priority because we are the allies of the U.S.&quot; Trump&apos;s new secretary of state, Marco Rubio, recently confirmed in an interview that the Trump administration will aim for a sustainable peace deal so that the war with Russia does not begin anew in two to four years. Trump said earlier if Putin does not come to the negotiating table, Moscow may face fresh economic sanctions. The Trump administration is working to attain a sustainable peace in Ukraine so that the war with Russia does not begin anew in two to four years, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Jan. 21. &quot;We are going to engage in making it (the war) end in a way that is sustainable, meaning we don&apos;t just want the conflict to end and then restart in two, three, or four years down the road,&quot; the recently confirmed top U.S. diplomat said on the CBS Mornings program. &quot;We want to bring stability.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump, who took office on Jan. 20, vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table and end the full-scale war nearing its third-year anniversary. He has revealed few details on how he plans to achieve that goal, though Rubio repeatedly said that both Ukraine and Russia will have to make concessions. &quot;It is a stalemate. It&apos;s a war that was started by Russia, but it is now a stalemate, a protracted bloody conflict,&quot; Rubio said on CBS Mornings, adding that the war has been &quot;incredibly destructive&quot; for both Ukraine and Russia. The secretary of state nevertheless said that Ukraine &quot;is paying the biggest price of all to its energy infrastructure, to the people, the lives that are lost, to the millions of Ukrainians that have had to leave their countries and are living overseas.&quot; Ukraine has struggled to contain the Russian advance as the battlefield began tilting in Moscow&apos;s favor in late 2024. Facing increasingly difficult manpower shortages, the Ukrainian military was forced to steadily cede ground to Russian forces in eastern Donetsk Oblast. In turn, Russia is believed to have lost between 700,000-800,000 soldiers killed and wounded, though it demonstrated the capability to replace the losses with new contract soldiers. The country&apos;s economy also faces economic headwinds amid soaring inflation and tightening sanctions against its energy sector. In a rare criticism, Trump said on Jan. 20 that Russian President Vladimir Putin is &quot;destroying Russia&quot; by not seeking a deal to end the war. The new U.S. president said he plans to soon meet his Russian counterpart, though he admitted uncertainty about whether the Kremlin&apos;s chief seeks a negotiated settlement. Since his electoral campaign in 2024, Trump has repeatedly claimed that the full-scale invasion would not have started if he had been in office at the time and pledged to broker an end within 24 hours. He and his team have since shifted rhetoric and acknowledged complexities in resolving the war. When asked about the expired 24-hour deadline, Rubio evaded commenting on any possible timeframe and merely said that ending the war would be the &quot;priority&quot; and &quot;policy of the United States.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump called on Russia to &quot;make a deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine on Jan. 22, warning that failure to reach an agreement would lead to increased sanctions, tariffs, and taxes on Russian goods. &quot;If a deal is not reached, I will have no other choice but to put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries,&quot; he posted on his social media platform Truth Social. &quot;We can do it the easy way or the hard way,&quot; said in reference to negotiating an end to the war, adding, &quot;the easy way is always better.&quot; While stressing that he is &quot;not looking to hurt Russia&quot; and maintaining that he has &quot;always had a very good relationship&quot; with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump added, &quot;It&apos;s time to &apos;Make a deal. No more lives should be lost.&quot; The statement comes as the Trump administration reportedly works on a sanctions strategy to advance a diplomatic solution to the conflict, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 16. Two primary approaches are under consideration. The first involves offering targeted relief to sanctioned Russian oil producers as an incentive if peace negotiations advance. The second calls for significantly expanding sanctions to increase pressure on Moscow, according to Bloomberg. His comments align with his previous vows to swiftly negotiate the war&apos;s end, though he has yet to present a detailed plan. When asked on Jan. 21 if he would impose additional sanctions if Putin fails to negotiate, Trump replied, &quot;Sounds likely.&quot; The Biden administration and the U.K. recently imposed their most extensive sanctions, targeting nearly 200 vessels in Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; key oil companies, and related entities, further tightening the economic noose around Moscow. Trump&apos;s efforts reportedly include plans to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and consultations with Putin.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-53/	2025-01-22T12:06:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/North-Korean-troops.png
Scandal-hit 155th Ukrainian Brigade commander in custody with $2.1 million bail, media reports	The former commander of the scandal-hit Ukrainian 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Brigade has been remanded in custody with a bail of Hr 90 million ($2.1 million), Hromadske reported on Jan. 22. The court&apos;s decision comes amid an investigation into allegations of poor leadership and widespread issues within the unit, which was deployed near Pokrovsk. The brigade, initially intended as a flagship project for Ukrainian military modernization, was trained and equipped with assistance from France and other foreign partners. French President Emmanuel Macron announced in June that France would provide training and military supplies, including AMX-10 armored vehicles, Caesar howitzers, and German Leopard 2A4 tanks. An investigation by Yurii Butusov, editor-in-chief of Censor.net, uncovered significant issues within the brigade. Butusov reported high numbers of soldiers going absent without official leave (AWOL) due to disorganization and poor leadership. The State Bureau of Investigation said on Jan. 20 that the brigade commander &quot;did not respond to violations in his unit, including the unauthorized abandonment of the military unit by his fighters.&quot; If convicted, the commander faces up to 10 years in prison. The brigade, which has approximately 5,800 troops, faced challenges from its inception. According to Butusov, 2,500 service members were reassigned to other units before training began, depleting its experienced personnel. Between March and November 2024, over 1,700 soldiers reportedly abandoned their posts, with an additional 50 deserting while training in France. Of the 1,924 soldiers sent to France for training, only 51 had more than a year of military service, while 1,414 had served fewer than two months. Replenishment efforts brought in new recruits, but Butusov claimed proper selection processes were often neglected, exacerbating the unit&apos;s operational challenges.	https://kyivindependent.com/commander-of-scandal-hit-155th-ukrainian-brigade-detained-with-2-1-million-bail-media-reports/	2025-01-22T11:51:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-20-at-15_59_41.png
Ukraine's OnlyFans content creators declare more than $7 million in income	Ukraine&apos;s tax service is looking to collect taxes on Ukrainians&apos; income made on the the subscription-based site OnlyFans, widely known for being an adult content platform, despite pornography being illegal in the country. After the country&apos;s tax service sent out requests to Ukrainian citizens who earn money on the platform, 451 people sent in declarations totaling Hr 326.1 million ($7.76 million) for the period of 2020-2022, Ekonomichna Pravda reported on Jan. 22, citing information requested from the country&apos;s tax service. Ukraine&apos;s tax authorities said it had requested data from the U.K.&apos;s tax service on Ukrainian earnings on OnlyFans for the period from 2020-2022, Ekonomichna Pravda reported. OnlyFans is owned by the British company Fenix &#x200B;&#x200B;International Limited. Ukraine&apos;s tax service refused to disclose how many Ukrainian citizens were earning money on OnlyFans, but said it had sent out 4,429 requests to Ukrainians to declare their income from the site. Only 451 people, or 10% of those contacted, filed declarations. These filings revealed a total tax liability of Hr 63.2 million ($1.5 million) in personal income and military taxes. It is unclear what type of content those who responded to the request for declaration are creating on OnlyFans. Although OnlyFans is known for adult content, it hosts a variety of materials, including fitness tutorials, cooking lessons, and behind-the-scenes content from artists. Ukraine&apos;s tax service also told Ekonomichna Pravda that it had received a court order to pass along information on Ukrainians earning money on the site to a law enforcement agency, without specifying which one. The media outlet reported a day earlier that Ukraine&apos;s Bureau of Economic Security was provided the names of Ukrainians earning income on the platform, and had begun carrying out searches of models and bringing charges against them under Article 301 of the criminal code that deals with the production of pornography. Kyiv has looked to increasing tax revenues as a means to bolster its wartime budget amid Russia&apos;s ongoing war. But as pornography and adult content, which makes up a lot of the activity on OnlyFans, remains illegal in Ukraine, its users have largely avoided declaring income from the site out of fear of legal repercussions. Ukraine&apos;s strict anti-pornography laws have created complications for creators. The legal framework prohibits the production and distribution of pornography, with broad interpretations leading to prosecutions even for consensual sharing of intimate images. &quot;OnlyFans already pays taxes in Ukraine. But for &apos;Ukrainian actors,&apos; even if they want to pay taxes, it is impossible. It would be an admission of guilt,&quot; Opposition lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said late last year. OnlyFans as a company pays taxes in Ukraine through the country&apos;s taxes on electronic services. Efforts to change the laws surrounding pornography are underway. A bill to decriminalize pornography was registered in late 2024 for the second time in recent years and gained support from the Verkhovna Rada&apos;s specialized law enforcement committee in December. Zhelezniak, who has supported amending the laws around pornography in Ukraine, said late last year that there are more than 5,000 people in the country currently making money through OnlyFans.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-on-onlyfans-declared-7-76-million-amid-legal-ambiguities-media-reports/	2025-01-22T11:39:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/Website---Porn-5.png
Ukraine's energy giant DTEK to invest $468 million in expanding Black Sea wind power plant	Ukraine&apos;s largest private energy company, DTEK, announced plans on Jan. 22 to invest 450 million euros ($468 million) in expanding the Tyligulska Wind Power Plant near the Black Sea coast. DTEK, which is owned by Ukraine&apos;s richest man Rinat Akhmetov, lost nearly 90% of its generation capacity in 2024 due to Russia&apos;s aerial attacks targeting Ukraine&apos;s power grid. The company said it reached a financing deal with lenders to purchase 64 wind turbines from Danish manufacturer Vestas, a world leader in turbine production. By expanding the facility from 19 to 83 turbines, the project aims to increase the wind farm&apos;s capacity fourfold, from 114 megawatts (MW) to 500 MW, DTEK said. The project is expected to be completed by late 2026 and generate 1.7 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity annually, enough to power 900,000 Ukrainian homes. Of the 450-million-euro investment, 370 million euros ($385 million) will be financed through bank loans guaranteed by Denmark&apos;s state-owned Export and Investment Fund (EIFO), with the remainder funded by DTEK. &quot;The commitment is the largest private sector investment in Ukraine since russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022 and the biggest ever private investment in Ukraine&#x2019;s energy sector,&quot; the company said in a press release. The Tyligulska plant, which became operational in May 2023, is located in Mykolaiv Oblast, approximately 400 kilometers south of Kyiv, and consists of 19 Danish company Vestas-supplied wind turbines. DTEK signed a memorandum of understanding with Vestas in December 2023, aiming to construct the largest wind farm in Eastern Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-energy-giant-to-invest-468-million-in-expanding-black-sea-wind-power-plant/	2025-01-22T10:51:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/_19R5572.jpeg
How Ukraine lost faith in the Red Cross and UN	Seeing the face of Ukrainian soldier Maksym Kolesnykov light up with joy over an apple upon his release from Russian captivity last February was enough to bring anyone to tears. During nearly a year in captivity, Kolesnykov lost over 30 kilograms and could not walk freely due to a severe injury in his left leg. Yet the only international organization he should have been able to rely on was never there for him. &quot;Not once did I see a representative of the Red Cross,&quot; Kolesnykov, now 47, told the Kyiv Independent. Like Kolesnykov, most Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) have never been visited by the representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) while in Russian captivity, says Ukraine&apos;s Human Rights Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets. Upon their release, numerous Ukrainian POWs revealed the horrific conditions they had endured in Russian prisons, facing near starvation, torture, and humiliation.

(Kostiantyn Liberov / Libkos / Getty Images)Ukraine&#x2019;s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of POWs said in October that &#xA0;177 Ukrainian soldiers have &quot;died from torture and inhumane treatment&quot; while in captivity. But international organizations &quot;turn a blind eye,&quot; says Lubinets. Kolesnykov recalls conditions in the Russian prison improving only slightly during an internal inspection by the Russian Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office. He believes that if the ICRC had been present, it might have prompted the prison staff to treat POWs better. &quot;I think their (the ICRC) appearance could have changed something for us. Maybe some conventions would have been followed, or the (prisoners&apos;) physical state would have been documented,&quot; says Kolesnykov. &quot;Any oversight in such a criminal situation would be good.&quot; With the start of the Russian full-scale war, Ukraine seems to have lost faith in major international bodies like the ICRC and the United Nations (U.N.) Once seen as pillars of global humanitarian aid, both organizations have been widely criticized by Kyiv for not doing enough, effectively undermining their authority and the very concept of international institutions as a cornerstone of the West. The relationship between Ukrainian officials and civic society, and international organizations has deteriorated since the start of the full-scale war. Myroslava Kharchenko, a lawyer with the NGO Save Ukraine, recalls asking the Ukrainian branch of the ICRC for a vehicle to evacuate children from Russian-occupied Kyiv Oblast early in the war, hoping its emblem would deter Russian attacks. According to Kharchenko, the ICRC refused, citing mandate limitations and also declined to provide body armor for volunteers. &quot;We didn&apos;t ask them to go there personally, to risk their lives; we were going to do it ourselves, but they refused,&quot; Kharchenko says. President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the ICRC for similar cases at the time, saying that it &quot;says a lot&quot; about the organization. As the war went on, the criticism escalated: Ukraine denounced both the U.N. and the ICRC for insufficient or delayed humanitarian responses, including when Russian troops blew up the Kakhovka Dam in June 2023, resulting in a major flood in the south of Ukraine. &quot;They are not there,&quot; Zelensky told the Bild media outlet at the time. Just a few hours after Russian forces destroyed the dam in Kherson Oblast, causing a humanitarian and ecological disaster, the U.N. posted on X to mark its annual Russian Language Day. &#xA0; &quot;Russian commanders will have given the order to blow up the Kakhovka Dam in Russian (language). What a day at the U.N. to celebrate the Russian Language!&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry said in response. Russian commanders will have given the order to blow up the Kakhovka Dam in Russian. What a day at the UN to celebrate Russian language! @UnitedNationsRU tweets about cultural diversity, ignoring the biggest catastrophe in Europe in decades caused solely by Russia. Why be silent? https://t.co/8z5PIyfs8P That has once again prompted a discussion in Ukrainian society about whether Russia&apos;s place in various U.N. bodies and the U.N.&apos;s lenient attitude toward Russia should be reconsidered. Zelensky has called for the U.N. Security Council to strip Russia of its veto power multiple times: &quot;All the U.N. actions &#x2014; either by the Security Council or the General Assembly &#x2014; that could have stopped this aggression are shattered by the privilege granted by this seat to the aggressor.&quot; &quot;Veto power in the hands of the aggressor is what has pushed the U.N. into a dead end,&quot; Zelensky said at the U.N. Security Council on Sept. 20, 2023. Last fall, the heads of both the ICRC and the U.N. faced backlash in Ukraine again. In September, ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric met with the Russian Presidential Commissioner for Children&apos;s Rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, who, alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin, is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for their involvement in the forced deportation of thousands of Ukrainian children. In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin meets with Russia&apos;s presidential commissioner for children&apos;s rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, in Moscow, Russia on May 31, 2024. (Alexander Kazakov / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)In her social media post, Lvova-Belova even thanked the ICRC for its support in &quot;reuniting the families&quot; since the start of the full-scale war. According to the Ukrainian national database, Russia has deported over 19,500 Ukrainian children from occupied territories since Feb. 24, 2022. Although it&apos;s not part of the ICRC&apos;s mandate to &quot;counter&quot; the deportation of children, supporting it is &quot;the height of cynicism,&quot; Kharchenko says. On Oct. 24 &#x2014; United Nations Day which marks the anniversary of the day in 1945 when the U.N. Charter entered into force &#x2014; the U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres took part in the BRICS summit in the Russian city of Kazan, despite facing sharp criticism.

(Contributor / Getty Images)He also met Putin there, with a photograph of their handshake blasted by Ukrainians, as well as several Western officials on social media. Before that, Guterres had declined Ukraine&apos;s invitation to the first global peace summit in Switzerland, held last summer. In response, Zelensky also reportedly rejected Guterres&apos; visit to Ukraine. &quot;Although even some of its functionaries prefer the temptations in Kazan to the content of the U.N. Charter, our world is built in such a way that the rights of nations and the norms of international law matter and will matter,&quot; Zelensky said on Oct. 24, alluding to Guterres&apos; actions. The treatment of Ukrainian POWs in Russian captivity remains one of the most pressing issues for Ukrainian society. Multiple reports have revealed torture, inhumane conditions, and executions of POWs in captivity, while Ukraine also indicates minimal access to its POWs by the ICRC. Petro Yatsenko, a representative of the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of POWs, says there are &quot;many things that the ICRC is currently unable to monitor within Russia.&quot; While the ICRC claims to have paid over 3,000 visits to POWs on both sides, it never specifies how many of them were to see Ukrainian POWs in Russia, Yatsenko says, adding the number is &quot;extremely low.&quot; &quot;This is a form of manipulation directed at both Ukrainian and international society,&quot; he says. &quot;We demand the ICRC recognize that they can not effectively carry out their mandate within Russia or in the detention facilities set up in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine,&quot; Yatsenko says. According to the Ombudsman&apos;s office, Russia &quot;fundamentally ignores&quot; the mandates set by international humanitarian law for the ICRC and U.N. bodies, especially regarding the treatment of Ukrainian POWs and civilians in captivity. &quot;Despite having the authority, the ICRC and U.N. structures continue to demonstrate &apos;concern and a neutral approach,&apos; which in practice equates to inertia, despite numerous calls from the Ukrainian side to intensify their activities,&quot; the Ombudsman&apos;s office said in a comment for the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It encourages Russia to disregard basic international norms,&quot; it added. On Nov. 20, Ukraine presented the &#x201C;Moscow Convention&#x201D; campaign aimed at exposing Russia&apos;s systemic violations of the Geneva Conventions as well as drawing attention to the ICRC and the U.N.&#x2019;s &#x201C;neutral stance.&#x201D; A Ukrainian soldier who was previously held captive poses for a portrait while undergoing rehabilitation in an unspecified location in Ukraine, on June 6, 2024.

(Kostiantyn Liberov / Libkos / Getty Images)Based on testimonies from former POWs and their families, the printed &quot;Moscow Conventions&quot; replicate the structure of the original Geneva Conventions but highlight the vastly different &quot;standards&quot; practiced by Russia, such as electric shock torture, physical and psychological abuse, sexual violence, and murder. &quot;Russians treat the Geneva Conventions as mere scraps of paper, something they can blatantly ignore and dismiss,&quot; Lubinets said during the presentation. &quot;Meanwhile, the ICRC has spent this entire time burying its head in the sand&#x2026; not befitting for a professional organization that should be upholding its mandate with dignity,&#x201D; he added. Patrick Griffiths, the spokesperson for the ICRC delegation in Ukraine, says their neutrality is a tool that &quot;works best&quot; for them when it comes to reaching POWs on both sides. &quot;Every decision that we make about what we say or don&apos;t say, what we do or what we don&apos;t do in this armed conflict, the first thought we have is, will it help the people that our mandate is to help?&quot; Griffiths says. &quot;And it&apos;s not in their interests for us to say something that risks losing the humanitarian access that we have limited though it already is, we acknowledge that,&quot; he says. Although the ICRC wants to be able to visit every POW, it is the &quot;obligation of the state&quot; which holds them to grant access, which they can not enforce, Griffiths says. Yatsenko, however, dismissed Griffiths&#x2019; arguments, calling them &quot;excuses&quot; that offer &quot;no constructive solution.&quot; &quot;If we had seen a significant number of changes during these two and a half years of Russian aggression, and if these excuses influenced changes in access for the ICRC to places of detention, then it would be justified. But we do not see such changes,&quot; he says. &quot;Something needs to be changed here.&quot; Even if Ukraine says a million times that it&apos;s not happy with the ICRC&apos;s work &quot;it will not change anything,&quot; says Mikhail Savva, a legal expert from the Center for Civil Liberties, a Ukrainian human rights organization. According to Savva, the biggest issue is that the 1949 Geneva Conventions do not provide any sanction tools; hence, they do not give the ICRC any &quot;enforcement mechanisms.&quot; &quot;It is necessary to raise the issue that the Red Cross (ICRC), and not only it but Ukraine as a state, should have tools to compel any aggressor country to comply with the norms of international humanitarian law,&quot; Savva says. Developing and signing an &quot;additional protocol&quot; to the Geneva Conventions is necessary for that, Savva says, adding that it should have the &quot;same authority as the conventions and should take into account the three years of wartime experience.&quot; A protester holds a placard expressing her opinion during a demonstration in Lviv, Ukraine, on July 31, 2022. (Pavlo Palamarchuk / SOPA Images / LightRocket via Getty Images)Yet he says it would be impossible without the will of state parties to the Geneva Conventions, the same as removing Russia from the U.N. Security Council. Oleksandr Pavlichenko, the Executive Director of the Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights Union, believes that currently &quot;there is neither a legal means nor political will&quot; to strip Russia of its status in the Security Council. &quot;It would set a precedent for stripping a permanent member of the Security Council of that status. I believe other members, like the U.S., would not want to set such a precedent, as it could later lead to questions about potentially losing their own status, for example.&quot; Savva agrees, saying that &quot;under current legal conditions, this is practically impossible.&quot; &quot;It would mean dismantling the U.N. and creating other organizations. But would that impact the global situation?&quot; he says, adding: &quot;Russia would still have nuclear weapons and remain free from any restrictions altogether.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/how-ukraine-lost-faith-in-red-cross-and-un/	2025-01-22T10:13:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/photo_2024-01-03_18-39-34.jpg

In photos: Grinding war in Donetsk Oblast through the lens of photojournalist-turned-soldier	When Oleg Petrasiuk began taking photos in 2009, photography was only meant to be a side gig to earn some money while in college. Eventually, it became his life&#x2019;s work. After Russia launched its all-out war against Ukraine, Petrasiuk was drafted to serve in Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces. He didn&#x2019;t let go of the camera. Petrasiuk now serves in the press service of the 24th Separate Mechanized Brigade, holding ground in the embattled Chasiv Yar, Donetsk Oblast. The 33-year-old photographer, who previously covered the war for the European Pressphoto Agency, now regularly catches the reality of Russia&#x2019;s all-out invasion as part of the military press service. &#x201C;(Front line) is exactly where I should be, next to them,&#x201D; Petrasiuk said, referring to the battle-hardened soldiers from the 24th who have been fighting on the eastern front for over two years. &#x201C;Time passes, and what remains are memories and photos,&#x201D; he said. The Kyiv Independent publishes photos taken by Oleg Petrasiuk while serving in the 24th Separate Mechanized Brigade in Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk Oblast.

Zelensky touts Ukraine's potential in meeting with global investors at Davos forum	President Volodymyr Zelensky met leading American and European executives and business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 22, emphasizing Ukraine&apos;s investment potential and the importance of international support in achieving a just peace. Participants discussed avenues to support Ukraine&apos;s war effort and economic recovery, with Zelensky spotlighting the advancements of Ukraine&apos;s defense sector, according to a statement published to the president&apos;s website. &quot;Ukraine has produced millions of kamikaze and reconnaissance drones, and it even uses them in logistics to deliver water, food, and medicine. These innovations will benefit not just wartime efforts but also peacetime applications,&quot; Zelensky said at the meeting. The meeting was part of the forum&apos;s &quot;Big Business Leaders to Ukraine&quot; panel, which included Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo and French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot. Zelensky&apos;s statement did not disclose the names of the investors who attended the meeting. &quot;Investments in Ukraine, our defense industry, support for our economy, development of the agricultural sector, energy, and education, along with maintaining sanctions pressure on Russia, were the key topics of our important conversation,&quot; Zelensky wrote on Telegram after the meeting. The discussions also extended to cooperation in agriculture, education, and energy, with attendees pledging continued investments to create jobs and facilitate Ukraine&apos;s post-war recovery, Zelensky&apos;s official website says. Ukraine&apos;s delegation at Davos this year has sought to highlight the country&apos;s economic potential and investment appeal, framing the country as a &quot;prize, not a burden.&quot; Events held at the Ukraine House, the country&apos;s pavilion at the forum, have focused on Ukraine&apos;s vast natural resources, and defense and agricultural sectors. The delegation&apos;s website says Ukraine holds $26 trillion in mineral wealth, including one-third of Europe&apos;s lithium reserves and significant gas reserves. 0:00/1&#xD7;President Volodymyr Zelensky met with top executives and business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 22 (Volodymyr Zelensky / Telegram)The Davos forum, themed &quot;Collaboration for the Intelligent Age,&quot; has gathered 3,000 participants from over 130 countries, including 60 world leaders. Ukraine&apos;s Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, speaking to Bloomberg on Jan. 22 &#xA0;on the sidelines of the forum, noted that foreign companies are ready to invest in Ukraine but require robust security guarantees to mitigate military risks. &quot;They need a guarantee &#x2014; like NATO membership, a military presence, or anti-missile systems to protect industrial zones and cities,&quot; she said. Ukraine&apos;s defense industry has expanded sixfold in the past year, and the country is ready to promote projects in reconstruction, defense, and resource extraction, including uranium deposits critical for reducing European reliance on China and Russia, Svyrydenko said. Zelensky&apos;s administration is reportedly exploring partnerships with the newly inaugurated U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration, particularly in processing and extracting rare earth minerals. With Trump&apos;s business experience and Ukraine&apos;s wealth of resources, Kyiv is hoping to secure deals that bolster economic recovery and strengthen global support for its post-war future.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-highlights-ukraines-investment-potential-seeks-global-investors-at-davos-forum/	2025-01-22T08:17:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194513510.jpg
Russian economy after 3 years of sanctions	The Kyiv Independent sat down with Timothy Ash, an associate fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program at Chatham House, to discuss Russia&apos;s current economic situation and why the Kremlin is running out of options as inflation rises, interest rates soar, and the ruble weakens.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-economy-after-3-years-of-sanctions/	2025-01-22T07:48:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/IMG_20250122_173520_640.JPG
What Trump’s 90-day pause on US foreign development assistance means for Ukraine	Hours after taking office, U.S. President Donald Trump put a stop on U.S. foreign development assistance for 90 days to review and ensure it aligns with the new administration&apos;s policy. Ukraine tops the recipient list of U.S. development assistance, receiving over $17 billion in economic aid in 2023 as it faced Russian all-out war, official data shows. According to the White House statement, it is now up to the U.S. State Secretary Marco Rubio or his designee to determine whether to request to continue, modify, or cease each foreign aid program based upon the review recommendations. &quot;Under President Trump, the top priority of the United States Department of State will be the United States. The direction he has given for the conduct of our foreign policy is clear,&quot; Rubio said before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week. &quot;Every dollar we spend, every program we fund, every policy we pursue must be justified by the answer to one of three questions: Does it make America safer? Does it make America stronger? Or does it make America more prosperous? &quot; Then-nominee for Secretary of State, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), testifies during his Senate Foreign Relations confirmation hearing at Dirksen Senate Office Building in Washington, DC, U.S. on Jan. 15, 2025. (Kevin Dietsch / Getty Images)What does this mean for Ukraine?Experts told the Kyiv Independent that Trump&apos;s move does not apply to funding programs through which the U.S. provides Ukraine with military aid. Artur Koldomasov, a Ukrainian expert on U.S. politics, says that the order is aimed at taking certain actions, but it cannot override existing legislative mechanisms or procedures. Trump can freeze funding for initiatives conducted by international organizations on human rights, refugee support, etc., according to the expert. &quot;In the context of this particular decision, it is quite difficult to imagine the implementation of this idea since the funds allocated for these initiatives have already been distributed, and the next budget will be adopted in September,&quot; Koldomasov said. But the order may apply to financial and humanitarian aid programs for Ukraine under the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), he said. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale, USAID has provided Ukraine with $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support. The agency has also allocated funds to restore Ukraine&apos;s energy grid, which Russia is trying to destroy by launching barrages of missiles and drones. Oleksandr Kraiev, an expert on North American policy at the foreign policy think tank Ukrainian Prism, said that Trump&apos;s decision does not threaten Ukraine&apos;s support now. &quot;One way or another, our assistance still depends primarily on the decision of the Congress,&quot; he added. 155 mm artillery shells that are ready to be shipped are stored at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, U.S. on April 12, 2023.

(Wolfgang Schwan / Anadolu via Getty Images)What is Trump&apos;s position on Ukraine aid?The future of U.S. aid to Kyiv under Trump&apos;s administration remains uncertain. During the inaugural speech, he did not mention Ukraine, claiming that the U.S. &quot;will stop all wars.&quot; Yet, his full plan on how to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war remains unclear, too. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly criticized the level of support provided to Ukraine and signaled Kyiv should brace for reduced assistance once he takes office. When asked in early December whether Ukraine should prepare for such a scenario, Trump responded: &quot;Possibly, sure.&quot; In 2024, the pro-Trump wing of the Republican Party blocked the U.S. aid bill in Congress for months. This led to the fall of the key eastern city of Avdiivka in Donetsk Oblast, followed by the loss of several other towns in the region. The $61 billion aid bill was passed by the U.S. Congress in April, giving the former President Joe Biden around $10 billion in Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA), which allows the U.S. to supply Kyiv with military equipment from existing military stockpiles. Around $3.8 billion remained unspent. Now, these funds are at Trump&apos;s disposal. Yet, the majority of U.S. funding remains in the hands of the U.S. Congress. &quot;So far, despite the large number of Trump&apos;s orders, despite his executive activity, not even half of them can be implemented,&quot; Kraiev said. &quot;You can plan and write all kinds of plans, but if you don&apos;t have the money to implement them, then these plans risk simply remaining plans.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-orders-90-day-pause-in-us-foreign-development-assistance-is-ukraines-aid-at-risk/	2025-01-22T07:17:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194362860-2.jpg
One-fifth of Ukrainians would move abroad if travel restrictions were lifted, survey shows	Some 21% of Ukrainians would want to move abroad if all travel restrictions were lifted, according to a survey by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation and the Razumkov Center published on Jan. 21. Men aged 18-60 are not allowed to leave the country except for specific cases since Ukraine imposed martial law at the outbreak of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Should the borders open again for all citizens, 70% of the respondents said they would not want to move to another country for permanent residence, while 21% said they are ready to do so, according to the survey. According to the survey, men and younger people were more keen to move abroad &#x2014; 25% and 33%, respectively. Only 9% of respondents over 60 expressed willingness to move abroad. Around 4.2 million Ukrainian refugees reside in the European Union under temporary protection status, with the largest numbers living in Germany and Poland. The main motivations for moving abroad included &#xA0;&quot;lack of opportunities for development (30.5%), threat to life due to hostilities (29%), insufficient social support from the state (29%), desire to reunite with relatives (26%), desire to take relatives who depend on the respondent away from the country (23%), and inability to find a job,&quot; the survey read. The poll, carried out between Nov. 29 and Dec. 14, 2024, involved face-to-face interviews with 1,518 respondents from Ukrainian-controlled territories. An exodus of the working-age population would be certain to increase labor shortages and threaten to plunge Ukraine deeper into the demographic crisis it has been facing since the start of the full-scale invasion. The U.N. predicted that in the worst-case scenario, Ukraine&apos;s population could shrink from 37.441 million in 2024 to just 15.3 million people by 2100.	https://kyivindependent.com/one-fifth-of-ukrainians-would-move-abroad-if-borders-open-survey-shows/	2025-01-22T06:09:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1760543042.jpg
Russia lacks manpower for major breakthrough in Ukraine, top NATO general says	Russia lacks sufficient forces for a big breakthrough in Ukraine, NATO&apos;s Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, General Christopher Cavoli, said during a discussion on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 21. &quot;I&apos;m not worried that Ukraine could suddenly lose. I don&apos;t see the potential for a massive (Russian) breakthrough,&quot; Cavoli said. &quot;And this is not a political but a military vision. It&apos;s got to do with both sides, the effective defenses that the Ukrainians have been putting in, but also the difficulty that the Russian side has in generating significant offensive forces to be able to exploit a potential breakthrough.&quot; Russia quickly advanced in Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk Oblast in late 2024, making operationally significant gains near Toretsk, Chasiv Yar, and Kupiansk, as well as on its own soil in Kursk Oblast. Ukraine has struggled to contain the Russian offensive as Ukrainian forces are overstretched and dealing with manpower shortages. Despite Russian advances, Cavoli said Russia&apos;s slow and incremental push is &quot;exhausting&quot; for Moscow&apos;s forces. &quot;After all, there is a reason why Russia brought thousands and thousands of soldiers from North Korea,&quot; he added, referring to the 12,000-strong North Korean contingent dispatched to Kursk Oblast. &quot;I think we&apos;re going to continue to see this tension between the desire to attack and the lack of manpower on the part of the Russians. I think that will largely define the conflict and force the Russians to use more weapons of deterrence, as we&apos;ve seen them do in recent years.&quot; The general also said that though it remains unclear whether the U.S. will continue providing military aid packages under the Trump administration, he pointed to the &quot;very significant uplift in European aid&quot; provided to Ukraine. Recently inaugurated U.S. President Donald Trump criticized military aid for Ukraine during his campaign and, after his reelection, hinted at reducing it. Multiple media reports have nevertheless indicated that Trump does not intend to cut aid completely but wants to see Europe take up greater responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-lacks-manpower-for-major-breakthrough-in-ukraine-top-nato-general-says/	2025-01-22T05:12:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2148294550.jpg
Russia issued ultimatum to Ukraine in 2022 to replace Zelensky with Medvedchuk, president says	Russia wanted to install pro-Kremlin oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk as Ukraine&apos;s president after forcing President Volodymyr Zelensky to step down, the Ukrainian head of state said on Jan. 22, citing a Kremlin ultimatum he received in the early days of the full-scale war. &quot;Some people came to me on the first days of the war, some people from Ukraine&#x2026;They gave me the ultimatum from (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,&quot; Zelensky said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &quot;They said that I have to go, and they will change me (for) Medvedchuk (as president).&quot; According to Zelensky, the ultimatum also demanded Ukraine recognize Russian occupation authorities in Donbas, change its constitution to commit to &quot;neutrality,&quot; shrink its army to 50,000 troops, give up much of its weapon arsenal, and recognize Russian as an official language of Ukraine. &quot;This was not a negotiation; it&#x2019;s an ultimatum,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that Russia&#x2019;s points were similar to those later presented during unsuccessful peace talks in 2022 that took place in Turkey. Formerly a Ukrainian lawmaker and businessman, Medvedchuk was among the leading pro-Russian figures in Ukraine before the full-scale invasion. He maintained close personal relations with Putin, the godfather of the oligarch&apos;s daughter. Medvedchuk was detained by Ukrainian authorities in 2022 and exchanged with Russia later the same year. Possible peace talks are again coming into focus as U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table. Zelensky said earlier during the forum that his country will seek to achieve a quick but just peace this year.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-issued-ultimatum-in-2022-to-force-out-zelensky-install-medvedchuk-president-says/	2025-01-22T04:41:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1193640358.jpg
Well-known' Dnipro lawyer detained for allegedly aiding Russian missile strikes	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) detained a lawyer from Dnipro suspected of aiding Russian missile strikes against the city and then attempting to flee the country, the SBU said on Jan. 22. The agency did not reveal the suspect&apos;s identity but described him as a &quot;well-known local lawyer&quot; and one of the most &quot;deeply undercover FSB (Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service) agents in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.&quot; The man, detained while allegedly attempting to flee across the Polish border at the Krakivets checkpoint, was accused of providing Russia with coordinates for a strike that killed six people and seriously injured 30 in Dnipro on Dec. 29, 2023. The attack damaged a shopping center, a maternity hospital, a house, administrative buildings, and at least two dozen high-rise buildings. The suspect is said to have provided Russia with coordinates for a local enterprise, workshops, and drone warehouses to help &quot;inflict maximum damage.&quot; He then passed information on the consequences of the attack and provided coordinates for another strategic facility in Dnipro, according to the SBU. The lawyer maintained contact with a senior member of the Russian occupation administration in Crimea and with FSB officers, Ukrainian prosecutors said. The suspect was charged with treason and justifying Russian aggression and faces life in prison. Dnipro is the regional center of the central-eastern Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and Ukraine&apos;s fourth-largest city, serving as an important logistics and medical hub for the front since the outbreak of the full-scale invasion. Multiple deadly drone and missile strikes have targeted the city since 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/well-known-dnipro-lawyer-detained-for-allegedly-aiding-russian-missile-strikes/	2025-01-22T04:12:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-22_10-00-02.jpg
Ukraine's Special Forces say they killed 21 North Korean soldiers, show combat footage	Warning: Footage includes violent and graphic content. Soldiers of the 8th Regiment of Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces resisted a North Korean assault in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast for eight hours before retreating, killing 21 and wounding 40 soldiers, the unit said on Jan. 22. The statement comes as Russia ramps up efforts to push out Ukrainian troops entrenched in the western Russian region, deploying its North Korean allies in ground assaults. In a video shared by the Special Operations Forces, a large assault group of purportedly North Korean soldiers is seen crossing an open field and forest, followed by close combat footage with only dozens of meters between the two sides. In the end, graphic footage shows killed soldiers claimed to be North Koreans. &quot;At the ninth hour of the battle, the Special Operations Forces had only a third of their ammunition left.

Eventually, the Ukrainian troops retreated in two Humvees, the post read. North Korea deployed around 12,000 soldiers in Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August 2024 to bring the war to Russian territory. They have suffered 4,000 casualties, both wounded and killed, President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed earlier in January 2025. In exchange for the troop transfer, Russia is paying over $2,000 for each North Korean soldier, though officials said it is unclear how much is allocated to individual soldiers and the Pyongyang government.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-special-forces-say-they-killed-21-north-korean-soldiers-show-combat-footage/	2025-01-22T03:22:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/North-Korean-troops.png
Zelensky meets German opposition leader, Israeli president at Davos forum	President Volodymyr Zelensky separately met with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz and Israeli President Isaac Herzog on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 22. Talks between Zelensky and Merz focused on &quot;necessary efforts and coordinated actions with allies to achieve a just and lasting peace,&quot; the Presidential Office said. Merz is the chancellor candidate of the conservative CDU/CSU alliance for the parliamentary elections in February. The German politician, who met Zelensky in Kyiv last December, has urged Berlin to provide more decisive support to Ukraine and supported the provision of long-range Taurus missiles. Speaking to Merz in Davos, Zelensky &quot;underscored the critical importance of Germany approving an additional 3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) defense support package for Ukraine.&quot; German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has blocked the approval of additional funds for Ukraine unless they are paid through additional borrowing, drawing criticism from his coalition partners. Merz&apos;s party, whose support is crucial for passing the funding since Scholz&apos;s coalition lost the majority in the parliament, backed the additional funding for Ukraine but insisted the federal budget can cover it without abandoning the debt break.

The outreach has been largely unsuccessful, with Israel staying out of the Russia-Ukraine war while fighting its own conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. The Ukrainian president also said that Ukraine understands &quot;the pain of having loved ones held in captivity and share the joy when people return home from captivity.&quot; The Palestinian militant group Hamas recently released three Israeli hostages in the first phase of a ceasefire deal between the group and Tel Aviv.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-german-opposition-leader-israeli-president-in-davos/	2025-01-22T02:38:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/209e6dbdb982be1d2cbaace19be00376_1737496161_extra_large.jpeg
Ukraine's NATO prospects depend on Trump, Zelensky says	Ukraine&#x2019;s ascension to NATO ultimately rests on U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s will, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 21. &quot;Everything depends on the United States. If Trump is ready to see Ukraine in NATO, we will be in NATO, everyone will be in favor. If President Trump is not ready to see us in NATO, we will not be in NATO,&quot; Zelensky told journalists. Zelensky also named four countries &#x2014; Germany, Hungary, Slovakia, and the United States&#x2014; that currently do not want Ukraine to join the military alliance. Politico reported last year that other countries, such as Belgium, Slovenia, or Spain, are also in opposition, even though they are less vocal about their stance. There is little evidence that the new Trump administration would be more open to accepting Ukraine into NATO than former U.S. President Joe Biden. Trump even attacked Biden over alleged support for Kyiv&apos;s aspirations, claiming it provoked Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Ukraine did not obtain any definitive commitments from Western partners on its NATO membership ahead of the full-scale invasion and, as of 2025, has yet to receive a membership invitation. A report by The Wall Street Journal has previously suggested that Trump&#x2019;s team was exploring a plan to delay Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for Western arms supplies and European peacekeepers to monitor a potential ceasefire with Russia. Moscow has already rejected the proposal, with Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly seeking a permanent ban on Ukraine&apos;s entry into the alliance in expected talks with Trump. Kyiv submitted its application to join in September 2022, and in July 2024, the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-nato-prospects-depend-on-trump-zelensky-says/	2025-01-22T02:08:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194511049.jpg
Kyiv court arrests 3 senior officers accused of failed defense of Kharkiv Oblast	A Kyiv court arrested General Yurii Halushkin, General Artur Horbenko, and Colonel Illia Lapin, three officers accused of leading an unsuccessful defense in Kharkiv Oblast during a Russian offensive last spring, Suspilne reported on Jan. 21. Russia launched a cross-border offensive into northeastern Kharkiv Oblast in May 2024, swiftly moving forward by several kilometers despite Ukraine&apos;s efforts to fortify border regions. Though the Russian offensive eventually stalled some 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Kharkiv, its initial success sparked outrage against regional and military leaders for poor defense planning. The three officers responsible for organizing the defenses were detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on Jan. 20. They were accused of violating military regulations and not using all resources at their disposal to repel the Russian offensive. &quot;This led to the seizure of part of the territory in the eastern Ukrainian region, where fierce fighting is currently ongoing,&quot; the SBU said. Halushkin commanded the Kharkiv Operational-Tactical Group, Horbenko led the 125th Territorial Defense Brigade that was deployed in the area, and Lapin commanded the brigade&apos;s 415th Battalion. The three suspects were charged with negligence in military service and &#x2013; in Horbenko&apos;s and Lapin&apos;s cases &#x2013; carrying out unauthorized withdrawal from the battlefield. They face up to 10 years in prison. &quot;The charged officials did not ensure the fortification and engineering arrangements of defensive positions (in Kharkiv Oblast). They did not ensure proper organization of units during the battle,&quot; the State Bureau of Investigation said. The suspects&apos; lawyers protested the charges. The trial comes against the backdrop of several scandals connected to poor command and organization in different brigades. Military mismanagement has often been cited as one of the key challenges plaguing Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces as it faces the Russian advance in the east.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-court-arrests-generals-over-unsuccessful-defense-in-kharkiv-oblast/	2025-01-22T01:45:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-20_14-00-12.jpg
Western intelligence agencies kept contact with Russia during full-scale war, Zelensky says	The U.S. and European countries remained in contact with Russia throughout the full-scale war, namely on the level of intelligence agencies, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 21. &quot;The U.S. and Russia maintained contacts on various levels during the three years of the war&#x2026; and Europeans too,&quot; Zelensky said in a meeting with international journalists. Zelensky noted that &quot;diplomacy has to have an isolationist quality, just like sanctions. If the leaders don&apos;t talk, but the intelligence agencies are constantly in touch, then, in principle, this may suit Russia.&quot; The Western countries have largely cut official contacts with Russia following the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022. The international isolation imposed on the Kremlin appears to be weakening as U.S. President Donald Trump announced his intention to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a potential peace deal. Commenting on the news that Trump plans to arrange a phone call with Putin, Zelensky said he is not surprised by Washington&apos;s efforts to establish contact with the Kremlin but believes Ukraine &quot;should be the priority because we are the allies of the U.S.&quot; Trump&apos;s new secretary of state, Marco Rubio, recently confirmed in an interview that the Trump administration will aim for a sustainable peace deal so that the war with Russia does not begin anew in two to four years. Trump said earlier if Putin does not come to the negotiating table, Moscow may face fresh economic sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/western-intelligence-agencies-kept-contact-with-russia-throughout-full-scale-war-zelensky-says/	2025-01-22T00:48:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194513510.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 29 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least two people and injured at least 29 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 22. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, three people were injured in Russian attacks against the Synelnykove district on Jan. 21, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Close to 70 houses in the area were damaged. Russian strikes killed one civilian and injured another in Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. Two more people were reportedly injured in the town of Bilytske. In Kharkiv Oblast, 10 people were injured over the past day, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Three police officers and two civilians were wounded during a drone attack in the town of Kupiansk on the morning of Jan. 21. Later the same day, Russian attacks injured an 87-year-old woman in the Bilyi Kolodiaz village, three women in Kupiansk, and a 62-year-old woman in the Borshchivka village. Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast killed one civilian and injured 11, said Oleksandr Prokudin, the regional governor. Two high-rise buildings and seven houses were damaged. A Russian drone strike against the city of Mykolaiv in Mykolaiv Oblast injured a 74-year-old woman and a 59-year-old man and damaged a six-story residential building, Governor Vitalii Kim reported. The woman is in serious condition.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-119/	2025-01-22T00:17:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-22_09-41-11.jpg
Top Putin aide's son investing in the West despite sanctions, media reports	Vladimir Kiriyenko, son of Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s Deputy Chief of Staff Sergei Kiriyenko, has continued making investments in the West through offshore companies despite sanctions, The Moscow Times reported on Jan. 21. Kiriyenko, the CEO of the Russian social media site Vkontakte, holds shares in at least one venture capital fund and maintains ownership in various offshore companies registered in the British Virgin Islands and Barbados, according to documents seen by The Moscow Times. The son of one of Russia&apos;s most influential men, Kiriyenko was appointed to head the Gazprombank-owned social site Vkontakte at the age of 38. His father, Sergey Kiriyenko, served as Russia&apos;s prime minister in 1998 and is currently Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s deputy chief of staff. He was a leading figure in organizing Russia&#x2019;s sham elections in the occupied Ukrainian territories in 2023 and has been described as one of the chief architects of Russian disinformation and propaganda operations. According to The Moscow Times, Vladimir Kiriyenko went to court in the British Virgin Islands to claim shares of his Titanium VC fund to be transferred from offshore company Yalecrest to him. In a document he signed, the worth of shares to be transferred amounted to $500,000. Titanium VC Limited, partially owned by Kiriyenko, is an investment fund that was launched with $50 million in 2013. It has focused on Israeli startups that were later acquired by tech companies from the United States. Since 2022, Kiriyneko has been sanctioned by the U.S., the U.K., and the EU, among other countries. His social media network, VKontakte, is one of the most popular sites in Russia. It was banned in Ukraine in 2017 due to the Russian government&apos;s influence over its administration and its storing of data in Russian servers.	https://kyivindependent.com/top-putin-aides-son-investing-in-the-west-despite-sanctions-media-reports/	2025-01-21T23:46:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1198921235.jpg
US seeks 'sustainable' peace in Ukraine to avoid new war in '2-4 years,' Rubio says	The Trump administration is working to attain a sustainable peace in Ukraine so that the war with Russia does not begin anew in two to four years, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Jan. 21. &quot;We are going to engage in making it (the war) end in a way that is sustainable, meaning we don&apos;t just want the conflict to end and then restart in two, three, or four years down the road,&quot; the recently confirmed top U.S. diplomat said on the CBS Mornings program. &quot;We want to bring stability.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump, who took office on Jan. 20, vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table and end the full-scale war nearing its third-year anniversary. He has revealed few details on how he plans to achieve that goal, though Rubio repeatedly said that both Ukraine and Russia will have to make concessions. &quot;It is a stalemate. It&apos;s a war that was started by Russia, but it is now a stalemate, a protracted bloody conflict,&quot; Rubio said on CBS Mornings, adding that the war has been &quot;incredibly destructive&quot; for both Ukraine and Russia. The secretary of state nevertheless said that Ukraine &quot;is paying the biggest price of all to its energy infrastructure, to the people, the lives that are lost, to the millions of Ukrainians that have had to leave their countries and are living overseas.&quot; Ukraine has struggled to contain the Russian advance as the battlefield began tilting in Moscow&apos;s favor in late 2024. Facing increasingly difficult manpower shortages, the Ukrainian military was forced to steadily cede ground to Russian forces in eastern Donetsk Oblast. In turn, Russia is believed to have lost between 700,000-800,000 soldiers killed and wounded, though it demonstrated the capability to replace the losses with new contract soldiers. The country&apos;s economy also faces economic headwinds amid soaring inflation and tightening sanctions against its energy sector. In a rare criticism, Trump said on Jan. 20 that Russian President Vladimir Putin is &quot;destroying Russia&quot; by not seeking a deal to end the war. The new U.S. president said he plans to soon meet his Russian counterpart, though he admitted uncertainty about whether the Kremlin&apos;s chief seeks a negotiated settlement. Since his electoral campaign in 2024, Trump has repeatedly claimed that the full-scale invasion would not have started if he had been in office at the time and pledged to broker an end within 24 hours. He and his team have since shifted rhetoric and acknowledged complexities in resolving the war. When asked about the expired 24-hour deadline, Rubio evaded commenting on any possible timeframe and merely said that ending the war would be the &quot;priority&quot; and &quot;policy of the United States.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-seeks-stable-peace-in-ukraine-rubio-says/	2025-01-21T23:08:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193483462.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 823,980 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 823,980 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 22. This number includes 1,950 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,844 tanks, 20,485 armored fighting vehicles, 34,837 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,194 artillery systems, 1,262 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,050 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 23,039 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-823-980-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-21T22:22:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1870879319.jpg
Nominee for US ambassador to UN says Trump needs 'maximum flexibility' to end Ukraine war	Elise Stefanik, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s nominee for United Nations ambassador, said on Jan. 21 that Trump should be given &quot;maximum flexibility&quot; to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war in Ukraine. Trump nominated Stefanik, a Republican congressmember and Trump loyalist with a mixed record on Ukraine support, for the ambassador role shortly after his election win. When asked how she would use her position at the U.N. to hold Russia accountable for its war crimes in Ukraine, Stefanik said her concern was supporting Trump&apos;s attempts to negotiate a peace agreement. &quot;I support President Trump&apos;s commitment to bringing this war to a resolution to stop the killing,&quot; Stefanik said at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Stefanik defended her record in the U.S. House of Representatives, saying she has &quot;a very strong record when it comes to deterring Russia.&quot; She also referenced her vote in favor of supplying lethal military aid to Ukraine during Trump&apos;s first term. &quot;I believe that peace through strength is our strongest deterrence,&quot; she said, echoing a phrase from Trump&apos;s inaugural address. &quot;(M)y effort will be supporting President Trump&apos;s mission to bring that to a resolution and to deter Russia in the long term.&quot; Stefanik did not detail any possible sanctions or other accountability measures against Moscow or Russian President Vladimir Putin. When asked again about efforts to penalize Russia for human rights abuses, Stefanik reiterated the importance of supporting Trump&apos;s agenda. &quot;Certainly it&apos;s going to be important to support President Trump&apos;s approach with his special envoy to address and bring that to a resolution, and I will work with the National Security Council and my colleagues in the cabinet who sit in the national security spaces to use this position at the United Nations to support his strategy and give him maximum flexibility to bring this to a resolution.&quot; Trump has repeatedly promised to negotiate a swift end to the war in Ukraine. His special Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, said the administration aims to negotiate a ceasefire within 100 days of taking office. The goal represents a change from Trump&apos;s previous pledge to end the war within 24 hours. Both Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky are reportedly arranging upcoming meetings with Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/nominee-for-us-ambassador-to-un-says-trump-needs-maximum-flexibility-to-end-ukraine-war/	2025-01-21T21:35:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194552422.jpg
Indian banks block Russian oil payments after new US sanctions	Indian banks has begun blocking payments for Russian oil imports following the latest round of U.S. sanctions against Russia&apos;s oil industry, according to a report from Energy Intelligence, an energy information company. The U.S. on Jan. 10 announced large-scale sanctions against major Russian oil companies and nearly 200 vessels of Moscow&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; Following the new restrictions, financial institutions in India began blocking payments for Russian crude, Energy Intelligence reported on Jan. 20. India&apos;s state-owned banks, State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank, have exercised the most caution in avoiding U.S. sanctions. Private banks have adopted a less rigid approach, the report said. India became the world&apos;s leading importer of Russian oil following the full-scale invasion of February 2022 and subsequent barrage of Western sanctions. India accounted for almost half of all Russian seaborne crude exports in 2024. Approximately 20% of those exports originated from Surgutneftegas and Gazprom Neft, Russian oil companies targeted in Washington&apos;s recent sanctions, according to S&amp;P Global. Sanctioned shadow fleet tankers reportedly transported 450,000 barrels of crude to India per day. Sanctioned Russian tankers that were booked before the sanctions went into effect on Jan. 10 will be allowed to unload at ports in India until March 12, the end of a U.S. grace period, an official told Bloomberg. Refineries in India have already entered agreements to buy crude from Oman and the United Arab Emirates, Reuters reported on Jan. 21, citing industry sources. The tightening sanctions prompted a sharp drop in Russian seaborne crude exports over the past week, according to Bloombirg. Since the Jan. 10 measures, dozens of tankers around the world have dropped anchor and suspended operations. According to S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, sanctioned Surgutneftegaz and Gazprom Neft accounted for about 20% of Russian oil exports to India, while tankers included in the sanctions &quot;blacklists&quot; transported 450 thousand barrels per day to the country, or a quarter of all deliveries. The Indian authorities have decided that sanctioned tankers will not be able to enter the country&apos;s ports after March 12, the date when the period set by the US Treasury Department for completing all transactions with blacklisted individuals ends. Until that date, India is ready to accept tankers loaded before the sanctions were imposed, a high-ranking official in New Delhi told Bloomberg.	https://kyivindependent.com/indian-banks-block-russian-oil-payments-after-new-us-sanctions/	2025-01-21T20:07:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1249927966.jpg
Trump claims he urged China's Xi to help end Russia's war in Ukraine	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Jan. 21 that he pressed Chinese President Xi Jinping to help put an end to Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump claimed he brought the matter up with Xi during a call. &quot;He&apos;s not done very much on that,&quot; Trump said. &quot;He&apos;s got a lot of ... power, like we have a lot of power. I said, &apos;You ought to get it settled.&apos; We did discuss it.&quot; Xi and Trump spoke by phone on Jan. 17, though Trump did not mention Ukraine in his comments directly afterwards. Trump&apos;s latest remarks come a day after his presidential inauguration. On the same day, Xi held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin in which he praised the deepening ties between Moscow and Beijing. &#xA0; While Trump in the past has spoken admiringly of both Xi and Putin, he told reporters that the U.S. would &quot;likely&quot; impose new sanctions on Russia if Putin refuses to make deal. The previous day, he said Putin was &quot;destroying Russia&quot; by not making a deal to end the war. Trump campaigned on the promise that he could end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine within 24 hours of his election. Since his November victory, the timeline for a peace agreement has changed significantly, with Trump acknowledging in December that the situation is &quot;a tough one.&quot; Both the U.S. and Ukraine have previously urged China to exert pressure on Russia to de-escalate the war, including by withdrawing North Korean troops and military aid. Although China has positioned itself as a possible mediator between Russia and Ukraine in future negotiations, Beijing remains Moscow&apos;s key economic ally and leading source of dual-use goods that feed the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. China nonetheless denies accusations of supporting Russia&apos;s invasion. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-claims-he-urged-chinas-xi-to-help-end-russias-war-in-ukraine/	2025-01-21T19:00:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1163306252.jpg
Ukraine's energy grid may suffer from Trump aid freeze, Politico reports	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s foreign aid pause may hinder Ukraine&apos;s ability to rebuild energy facilities damaged by Russian attacks, Politico reported on Jan. 21, citing Ukrainian officials. Trump issued an executive order imposing a 90-day freeze on all U.S. foreign development assistance on Jan. 20, his first day in office. The order appears to target programs under the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which provides humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. The aid freeze could affect Ukraine&apos;s ability to rebuild damaged energy infrastructure, conduct demining operations, and fund civil society programs, according to Maksym Samoiliuk, an economist at the Kyiv-based Center for Economic Strategy. &quot;The question is how exactly this decree will be implemented and whether the previous Biden administration was preparing for such a development and did not transfer funds in advance, for example,&quot; Samoliuk told Politico. U.S. Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat, also slammed Trump for issuing the order in winter amid Ukraine&apos;s ongoing energy crisis. &quot;Does that mean that we will abandon Ukraine in the middle of winter? Because USAID has been providing critical funding for the rebuilding of their electric grid every time Russia attacks it,&quot; Coons said. Russia continues to target Ukrainian energy infrastructure, ramping up attacks in the winter months. In December 2024, Russia carried out one of its largest assaults on Ukraine&apos;s electric grid, launching 90 missiles and 200 drones against the country&apos;s thermal power plants. While a pause on USAID funding could put some projects in Ukraine at risk, other types of aid have already been secured under former U.S. President Joe Biden, officials said. Trump&apos;s freeze does not apply to weapons or the $20 million in loans backed by frozen Russian asset revenues that the U.S. allocated for Ukraine last fall. &quot;In terms of budget funding, we&apos;re secured,&quot; Roksolana Pidlasa, chair of the Verkhovna Rada&apos;s budget committee, told Politico. &quot;Biden&apos;s administration transferred all the funds under the ERA initiative to the World Bank.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-energy-grid-may-suffer-from-trump-aid-freeze-politico-reports/	2025-01-21T17:41:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194978801.jpg
US 'likely' to sanction Russia if Moscow refuses peace negotiations, Trump says	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Jan. 21 that he would likely impose additional sanctions against Russia if Russian President Vladimir Putin fails to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine. &quot;Sounds likely,&quot; Trump said responding to a question from a reporter on whether he would impose additional sanctions on Russia if Putin fails to come to the negotiating table. Trump comments on the issue come as Trump administration officials are reportedly developing a comprehensive sanctions strategy aimed at facilitating a diplomatic resolution to the Russia-Ukraine war, according to Bloomberg. The Trump team is reportedly weighing two primary approaches. The first set of policy recommendations suggests that, if a resolution to the war appears possible, the administration should focus on good-faith measures to benefit sanctioned Russian oil producers that could help seal a peace deal. The second option would involve expanding sanctions to exert maximum pressure, increasing leverage over Moscow. Trump has repeatedly vowed to quickly negotiate the end of the war. Although a detailed plan has not yet been proposed, the deal that would likely require the presence of European peacekeepers. Trump, who has previously stressed he needs to consult with Russian President Vladimir Putin first, is working to actively arrange a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Biden administration and the U.K. recently imposed their most extensive sanctions yet on Russia&apos;s oil sector, targeting nearly 200 vessels in the &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; key oil companies, and related entities. These measures, announced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on Jan. 10, have already impacted the global oil market, pushing Brent crude prices up by nearly $5 per barrel. The G7 nations are also considering tightening the existing $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 19.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-likely-to-sanction-russia-if-moscow-refuses-peace-negotiations/	2025-01-21T16:05:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2177668198.jpg
Supervisory board extend arms procurement head's contract, initiates audit following proposed merger	The supervisory board of Ukraine&#x2019;s Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) extended a 1-year contract to Maryna Bezrukova, the current director of the DPA, the agency announced on Jan. 21. The contract extensions comes after Defense Minister Rustem Umerov walked back on plans to merge the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) and the State Logistics Operator (DOT) into one agency, following a NATO statement said that the two agencies should be kept separate and two separate supervisory boards established &quot;to perform their tasks and supporting their independence and anti-corruption policies.&quot; In addition to the contract extension, the board said in a statement that it had initiated a &quot;comprehensive audit of the Agency&apos;s activities,&quot; which will involved NATO&apos;s International Board of Auditors (IBAN). Bezrukova, whose contract was extended by a unanimous vote, is a former employee of Ukraine&#x2019;s energy company Ukrenergo, before being appointed to head the DPA. Separate boards were set up for Ukraine&#x2019;s lethal and non-lethal procurement agencies, complying with NATO standards, in the fall of 2024. The defense procurement sector was reshaped in December 2023, aiming to meet NATO standards. The DPA, first established in August 2022, was to focus solely on lethal aid. Meanwhile, the DOT was formed to purchase non-lethal aid such as food and clothing.	https://kyivindependent.com/supervisory-board-extend-arms-procurement-heads-contract-initiates-audit-following-proposed-merger/	2025-01-21T14:59:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/DSC01371.jpg
Albania signs 10-year security cooperation agreement with Ukraine	Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama and President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a 10-year security cooperation agreement on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 21. The wide-ranging agreement includes cooperation between the two countries in areas including defense, intelligence sharing, cyber security, nuclear safety, as well as mutual support for each others accession into the European Union, among other topics. &quot;Albania reaffirms its unwavering support for Ukraine&apos;s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders as of 1991,&quot; the agreement reads, adding that the document does not &quot;substitute for Ukraine&#x2019;s future membership in NATO.&quot; &quot;Albania has been providing military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale invasion and it will continue its support throughout the ten-year term of the agreement,&quot; Zelensky wrote on X. &quot;I am grateful to Albania for supporting our European integration path, strengthening our positions on the battlefield, and bringing us closer to a just and lasting peace for Ukraine.&quot; As Albania&apos;s military support for Ukraine continues, the agreement notes that Albania will &quot;continue to support Ukraine in the same way as in 2022-2024.&quot; The agreement also committed Albania into its participation in the fighter jet coalition, an allied initiative helping Ukraine acquire U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets and the necessary training. &quot;Albania will make its contribution to the fighter jet coalition by providing English language training for Ukrainian pilots and technicians,&quot; the agreement reads. Albania, a member of NATO, previously signed a joint cooperation agreement with Ukraine in February 2024. A few days prior on Jan. 19, Tirana opened its first embassy in Ukraine, establishing the country&apos;s first permanent diplomatic mission in Kyiv since the two countries entered into diplomatic relations in 1993.	https://kyivindependent.com/albania-signs-10-year-security-cooperation-agreement-with-ukraine/	2025-01-21T13:46:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/174cb142ba68ea04f71ed9529473c5e2_1709114474_extra_large.jpeg
Syria reportedly cancels deal with Russian construction firm following Assad's downfall	Syria&apos;s port of Tartus has terminated a 49-year investment agreement with Russian construction company Stroytransgaz, the independent Russian outlet Important Stories reported on Jan. 21, citing Riad Joudeh, head of customs in the city of Tartus. The decision follows the collapse of Russian-backed dictator Bashar al-Assad&apos;s regime on Dec. 8, after a swift offensive by opposition forces that captured Damascus, significantly undermining Russia&#x2019;s influence in Syria. The contract, signed in 2019, had committed Moscow to invest at least $500 million in modernizing the port. With the agreement now void, all revenues from the port&apos;s operations will go directly to the Syrian state, and its management will revert to local authorities. The new Syrian government has also blocked a Russian vessel from evacuating military equipment from the Tartus naval base, The Moscow Times reported on Jan. 9. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha discussed Russia&#x2019;s military presence in Syria during a Dec. 30 diplomatic visit to Damascus. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said the same day that Kyiv and the new Syrian leadership share similar views on the issue, though specific details were not revealed.	https://kyivindependent.com/syria-reportedly-cancels-russian-investment-agreement-for-tartus-port-modernization/	2025-01-21T13:30:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2189980735.jpg
Ukraine-Russia peace deal would require at least 200,000 peacekeepers, Zelensky says	At least 200,000 European soldiers would be required to serve as peacekeepers on Ukraine&apos;s eastern front for a peace deal to be enforced, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 21. &quot;From all the Europeans? 200,000, it&#x2019;s a minimum. It&#x2019;s a minimum, otherwise it&#x2019;s nothing,&quot; Zelensky said during the panel. Zelensky&apos;s comments comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to quickly negotiate the end of the war. Although a detailed plan has not yet been proposed, the deal that would likely require the presence of European peacekeepers. Trump, who has previously stressed he needs to consult with Russian President Vladimir Putin first, is working to actively arrange a meeting with Ukraine, Zelensky said. During his remarks in Davos, Zelensky highlighted the imbalance in military capabilities, noting that Russia can deploy 1.5 million troops compared to Ukraine&apos;s 800,000 and France&apos;s 200,000. Zelensky ruled out Moscow&apos;s demand of reducing the size of the country&apos;s military in order to achieve a peace deal. The new U.S. president has revealed few details of his plans to end the war. His team signaled that the new administration would seek to preserve Ukraine&apos;s independence, though U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that both Kyiv and Moscow would have to make concessions to achieve a peace deal. Earlier in his remarks, Zelensky called on European nations to unite against Russian aggression, warning that battles involving North Korean soldiers are now geographically closer to Davos than to Pyongyang. &quot;Europe must establish itself as a strong global player,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that, while the United States remains an indispensable ally, Washington doubts Europe&apos;s ability to contribute meaningfully to global security. Zelensky has been in contact with a number of European leaders about the prospects of a peacekeeping mission &#x2014; an initiative that French President Emmanuel Macron has spearheaded. During a visit to Kyiv on Jan. 16, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that Britain will play its &quot;full part&quot; in supporting efforts to maintain an enduring peace in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-russia-peace-deal-would-require-at-least-200-000-peacekeepers-zelensky-says/	2025-01-21T13:06:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/f798ed2187a644a475ac0e3db9836c62_1692023126_extra_large.jpeg
Following Trump's inauguration, Russian pundits and politicians show some enthusiasm, some reserve	Russian President Vladimir Putin was quick to congratulate his U.S. counterpart, Donald Trump, issuing a short statement before the start of the inauguration ceremony in Washington. &quot;We were always ready to support relations of equal cooperation with any American administration,&quot; Putin told members of the country&apos;s National Security Council in a call on Jan. 20, claiming that Russia was &quot;open to dialogue on the &apos;Ukrainian conflict,&apos;&quot; a name used by the Kremlin for the war it wages against Ukraine. Later reporting suggested that Trump&apos;s team was already preparing a call with Putin, which could take place &quot;very quickly.&quot; On the following day, however, Putin&apos;s press secretary Dmitry Peskov denied any preparations. Russian parliamentarians, whose role is diminished to approving Putin&apos;s agenda and attacking his enemies, on Jan. 20 showed signs of reserve. Trump simply &quot;doesn&apos;t have a final stance&quot; on the war, according to Konstantin Kosachev, the deputy speaker of the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian parliament, which has little to no real power in the country. This would explain why Trump didn&apos;t mention Russia&apos;s war a single time in his inauguration speech, Kosachev argued. This also means that improving Russian-American relations &quot;will be difficult,&quot; said Leonid Slutsky, the head of the Russian Parliamentary Committee of Foreign Affairs. Slutsky, the leader of one of the country&apos;s pro-Putin political parties, blamed former U.S. President Joe Biden for the tarnished relations between the two countries. The U.S. will remain &quot;hostile to Russia,&quot; said Russian Senator Andrey Klishas. Kremlin pundits, meanwhile, didn&apos;t turn their tune, blaming Ukraine for, well, everything. Olga Skabeeva, the host of a popular evening talk show, connected with Ekaterina Moore, a Washington correspondent for Russian state-controlled media, who demonstrated her invitation to Trump&apos;s inauguration on air. &quot;They invited you, but neither (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky nor (French President Emmanuel) Macron,&quot; Skabeeva commented, passing next to the fact that Putin was not invited either. Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council Meeting in Igora ski resort, north of Saint Petersburg, Russia, on Dec. 26, 2024. (Contributor / Getty Images)Zelensky, in addition, would have been desperate to receive an invitation, according to Skabeeva, who quoted Donald Trump Jr, the son of the current U.S. president, who has been actively attacking Kyiv online. Fellow pundit Vladimir Solovyev, on his end, reposted a publication on Telegram according to which &quot;Trump mentioned democracy 637 times and Ukraine not a single time&quot; in his inauguration speech. In another post, Solovyev attacked Biden, claiming that the ex-president needed to pardon former U.S. Chief Medical Advisor Anthony Fauci because U.S. Covid vaccines had &quot;side effects, which were ordered to stay silent on.&quot; Biden&apos;s last-minute presidential pardons were also a topic for Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova, who claimed that these decrees were &quot;self-incriminating.&quot; Zakharova also welcomed Trump&apos;s executive order on the recognition of only two genders, insinuating that under Biden, the U.S. government had been actively promoting non-binary identities in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, &quot;many people&apos;s lives were broken,&quot; Zakharova claimed. Back on Skabeeva&apos;s evening show, Russian parliamentarian and political scientist Andrey Isayev saw this year&apos;s Inauguration Day as a &quot;competition between Trumpists and globalists.&quot; Russian propaganda&apos;s talking points have long been similar to the ones expressed by right and far-right pundits in the U.S. The first group, according to Isayev, is &quot;obviously prevailing.&quot; However, this does not change much for Russia as &quot;both parties fight for Western domination.&quot; With regards to Ukraine, Trump&apos;s presidency would not change much, as the new president &quot;will not leave Europe,&quot; the Russian parliamentarian argued. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to the crowd as Vice President J.D. Vance looks at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC, U.S. on Jan. 20, 2025. (Bill Clark / Pool / Getty Images)Similar arguments came up on the popular pro-war Telegram channel Rybar, which called upon its readers to &quot;judge (U.S. foreign policy) based on concrete decrees and actions in the next three months,&quot; not based on Trump&apos;s inauguration speech. Meanwhile, Kremlin-aligned economists showed hope that sanctions against Russia could be lifted, even if Trump&apos;s policies on Russia could be &quot;tough,&quot; according to industry expert Leonid Khazanov, who was quoted by pro-Kremlin outlet Lenta. For 15 years, Lenta was one of the leading Russian independent news outlets. In 2014, months after Russia launched its war against Ukraine, the news outlet was taken over by the Russian government. Fired journalists left for Riga, Latvia, and founded the Meduza news outlet. Despite Russia&apos;s cautious optimism and lack of outright criticism of the incoming administration, Trump didn&apos;t return the favor. On Jan. 20, Trump said that Putin was &quot;destroying Russia&quot; by failing to reach a peace deal with Ukraine. &quot;He should make a deal. I think he&apos;s destroying Russia by not making a deal,&quot; Trump said following his inauguration.	https://kyivindependent.com/donald-trump-was-long-seen-as-russian-candidate-of-choice-in-moscow-however-reactions-following-inauguration-are-mixed/	2025-01-21T12:44:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194304549.jpg
Israel proposes sending seized Russian weapons in Lebanon to Ukraine, deputy FM says	Israel&apos;s Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel proposed transferring Russian weapons seized by Israel in Lebanon to Ukraine during a Jan. 21 meeting with Ukrainian Ambassador Yevhen Korniychuk, Ukraine&apos;s embassy reported. The initiative follows Israel&apos;s September 2024 ground invasion of southern Lebanon as part of its campaign against the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah. The discussion also addressed military collaboration between Iran and Russia, which poses security risks to both nations. Moscow and Tehran recently formalized their partnership, signing a strategic agreement on Jan. 17. The Ukrainian ambassador thanked Haskel for the proposal, emphasizing the significance of recognizing shared threats faced by Ukraine and Israel. Ukraine&apos;s embassy expressed hope for a positive resolution to the initiative, which it called an important step in strengthening cooperation. Iran has supplied Russia with thousands of Shahed drones and short-range ballistic missiles, weapons frequently used in Russia&apos;s attacks on Ukrainian cities. Ukraine has supported Israel, expressing solidarity after the deadly attack by Hamas terrorists in October 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/israel-proposes-sending-seized-russian-weapons-in-lebanon-to-ukraine-deputy-fm-says/	2025-01-21T12:20:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/meeing-.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukrainian soldier reports harsh conditions, fatal accidents in regiment; unit launches investigation	Key developments on Jan. 21: The 78th Air Assault Regiment on Jan. 21 announced an internal investigation after a soldier of the unit pointed to excessive demands on his comrades that supposedly lead to exhaustion and fatal accidents when handling explosives. The soldier, Vitalii Holovnia, said on Facebook that an unmanned platoon commander of an attack drone unit forces soldiers to accomplish too many tasks, which leads to service members being exhausted, overstretched, and prone to mistakes. The news comes amid major scandals plaguing other units as Ukraine continues to struggle with mobilization and personnel shortages in the face of the Russian onslaught. &quot;Cases of accidents with explosives occurred because people had been in combat positions for a long time, and they were tired. It also happened that people performed some tasks during the day and some at night, so they worked around the clock. As a result, mistakes were made in the safety rules for handling explosives,&quot; Holovnia told the Kyiv Independent. According to Holovnia, casualties caused by the accidents were listed as battlefield losses. These included both deaths and injuries, he clarified for the Kyiv Independent. Approaching the third anniversary of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine still has no legal mechanism that would allow demobilization after a certain period of service. Holovnia noted that the aforementioned commander has favorites who receive the highest additional financial reward, Hr 100,000 ($2,370), without going to combat positions, while others have to put their lives to do so. According to the soldier, the commander failed to ensure the units had communications and high-quality electronic warfare equipment to perform combat missions. As a result, the unit did not have a stable connection for emergencies for almost a month and a half in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Holovnia also claimed that the commander&apos;s decisions on staffing groups for combat missions led to internal conflicts. &quot;The leadership must be proper, appropriate. We must fight with our minds and equipment, not with (people as) meat.&quot; Following the complaint, the command of the 78th Regiment launched an internal investigation &quot;in compliance with all established procedures and aimed at objectively clarifying the circumstances.&quot; &quot;We urge the public not to make hasty conclusions based on unverified information,&quot; the statement read. &quot;The 78th Separate Air Assault Regiment remains a powerful military unit that performs combat missions to protect the territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine with honor and dignity.&quot; Ukrainian forces struck the Liskinskaya oil depot in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast, the Smolensk Aviation Plant, and a Russian command post in Donetsk Oblast overnight on Jan. 21, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said. The announcement comes as Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry reported intercepting 55 Ukrainian drones in a large-scale overnight strike, including 10 over Smolensk Oblast and six over Voronezh Oblast. The Liskinskaya oil depot was targeted again after being hit by a Ukrainian drone attack on Jan. 16. In the most recent strike, Ukrainian drones hit fuel and lubricant tanks, starting a fire at the Rosneft-run facility, the General Staff reported. An attack against the depot was confirmed by Voronezh Oblast Governor Alexander Gusev. The village of Liski, where the depot is located, lies around 140 kilometers (90 miles) north of Russia&apos;s border with Ukraine&apos;s Kharkiv Oblast. Another attack, carried out jointly by the Unmanned Systems Forces and the Special Operations Forces, hit the infrastructure of the Smolensk Aviation Plant, with explosions reported on the facility&apos;s territory, according to the General Staff. Smolensk lies less than 60 kilometers (around 35 miles) east of the Russia-Belarus border and some 270 kilometers (170 miles) north of Ukraine. The city&apos;s aviation plant is involved in the production and modernization of the Su-25 military aircraft, said Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. The Ukrainian military also reported a successful hit against a command post of Russia&apos;s 29th Combined Arms Army in the occupied Volnovakha in Donetsk Oblast. &quot;The consequences of the strike are being clarified,&quot; the General Staff said without specifying the weaponry used. Ukrainian long-range drones regularly target Russian military and industrial facilities to undermine Moscow&apos;s ability to wage its full-scale war in Ukraine. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has detained the chief psychiatrist of the Armed Forces over suspected illicit enrichment in the amount of over $1 million, the agency reported on Jan. 21. According to charges, the official has acquired substantial undeclared assets since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, including a house in Kyiv Oblast, apartments in Kyiv and Odesa, luxury cars, and plots of land. The detainee also serves as the deputy head of the central medical commission, which determines the suitability of potential recruits for military service. Though the SBU did not name the suspect, Oleh Druz serves as the chief military psychiatrist. Military medical commissions have come under increasing scrutiny after suspected instances of corruption and other violations. Enlistment facilities across the country attracted authorities&apos; attention after journalists discovered in June 2023 that the family of the ex-head of the Odesa Oblast military enlistment office had acquired property worth $4.5 million since the start of the full-scale invasion. Ukraine&apos;s defense and health ministries pledged to reform the institution by November 2025 in order to tackle corruption and bureaucratic deficiencies. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Jan. 21 reiterated his commitment to ending Russia&apos;s war in 2025 &quot;not just quickly but fairly and reliably.&quot; Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Zelensky stressed the importance of ensuring Ukrainians can safely return home and rebuild their lives. &quot;We want to end the war this year - not just quickly but fairly and reliably for all of us, for Ukrainians,&quot; he said. &quot;So that they can return home, live in safety, and work.&quot; Zelensky underscored the need for strong European engagement, calling for allies to provide accurate information to U.S. President Donald Trump. &quot;We have very good relations with President Trump,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;voices conveying disinformation or pro-Russian positions could present risks.&quot; Zelensky also expressed concerns over possible Russian demands in peace negotiations, including calls for Ukraine to reduce its military and abandon NATO membership. Newly inaugurated on Jan. 20, U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to bring a swift resolution to the war but acknowledged that consultations with Russian President Vladimir Putin will be necessary. Trump criticized Putin&apos;s handling of the conflict on Jan. 20, claiming he is &quot;destroying Russia by not making a deal.&quot; The Davos forum, themed &quot;Collaboration for the Intelligent Age,&quot; brings together nearly 3,000 participants from over 130 countries, including 60 heads of state and government. Discussions include European defense strategy, NATO&apos;s future, and Ukraine&apos;s &quot;Peace through Strength&quot; approach, which advocates leveraging military and political power to secure a just peace. Key speakers include Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Poland&apos;s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, and European Parliament President Roberta Metsola. Zelensky&apos;s appearance follows his attendance at the January 2024 forum, which coincided with the fourth meeting on Ukraine&apos;s peace formula, paving the way for the global peace summit later that year. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will begin working on a ceasefire in Ukraine &quot;almost immediately,&quot; new U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told journalists on Jan. 20. Asked about a timeframe for ending the war, Rubio did not provide any specific deadline but said that negotiating a ceasefire would be a &quot;top priority to the president, so it&#x2019;ll (begin) almost immediately.&quot; &quot;In fact, some of that&#x2019;s already begun. You would hope that some of the groundwork has already been laid, but it&#x2019;ll be complex. I mean, it&#x2019;s a complex conflict and a bloody one, and it needs to end,&quot; he was quoted as saying by CNN. Rubio became the first high-level cabinet member of the new Trump administration to be confirmed by the Senate, making him the new U.S. secretary of state. &quot;I don&#x2019;t &#x2014; couldn&#x2019;t put a time frame on it, other than to say that anytime you bring an end to a conflict between two sides, neither of whom can achieve their maximum goals, each side is going to have to give up something,&quot; Rubio said, without specifying what these concessions might be. The chief U.S. diplomat acknowledged that Russia &quot;is the aggressor&quot; but stressed that the war &quot;needs to end.&quot; Previously, Rubio publicly praised the bravery of Ukrainian defenders but was among the 15 Republican lawmakers in the Senate who voted against the $61 billion aid package for Ukraine in early 2024. Its delay severely hampered Ukraine&apos;s fight against Russian forces. Although Trump vowed during his campaign in 2024 to put an end to the conflict in 24 hours if elected, aides revised the timeframe to the first 100 days after he took office. The Trump administration has not publicly disclosed details on any specific plans to broker a peace deal in Ukraine. An initial proposal leaked from Trump&apos;s team &#x2013; freezing the war along its current front lines, delaying Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2013; has already been rejected by Russia. U.S. President Donald Trump believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin is &quot;destroying Russia&quot; by failing to reach a peace deal on Ukraine, Trump told reporters at the White House on Jan. 20. &quot;He should make a deal. I think he&apos;s destroying Russia by not making a deal,&quot; Trump said following his inauguration. The new U.S. president was sworn in at the United States Capitol earlier on Jan. 20. Though his inauguration speech did not mention Ukraine, Trump has often claimed in the past that he would seek to bring a swift end to Russia&apos;s war. Talking to reporters, Trump again said he aims to conclude the conflict as soon as possible but noted he would have to talk to Putin first. The new U.S. president also said that his Russian counterpart &quot;can&apos;t be thrilled (with the war) since &quot;he&apos;s not doing so well.&quot; &quot;Most people thought that war would have been over in one week,&quot; Trump said, adding that Putin would be &quot;very well off to end the war.&quot; The U.S. president again boasted of warm relations with the Russian leader and voiced hopes for reaching a quick peace deal without presenting a specific timeline. Trump nevertheless noted that while Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky told him he seeks an agreement to end the war, the U.S. president is unsure whether Putin wants the same. Russia is estimated to have lost around 700,000-800,000 soldiers killed or wounded in almost three years of the full-scale war and faces economic headwinds in the year ahead. At the same time, Russian forces continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east while Kyiv struggles with manpower shortages. The U.S. president has revealed few details of his plans to end the war. His team signaled that the new administration would seek to preserve Ukraine&apos;s independence, though U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that both Kyiv and Moscow would have to make concessions to achieve a peace deal.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukrainian-soldier-reports-harsh-conditions-fatal-accidents-in-regiment-unit-launches-investigation/	2025-01-21T12:18:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/461284393_27329909956652636_6640114376022564971_n-1.jpg
Early voting begins in Belarusian presidential election	Early voting began on Jan. 21 in the Belarusian presidential election scheduled for Jan. 26, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported. The previous election, held in August 2020, was accompanied by large-scale voting fraud and the largest protests in Belarusian history. Most Western governments refused to recognize the 2020 election results and do not consider Alexander Lukashenko the country&apos;s legitimate leader. Lukashenko, who has been in power in Belarus since 1994, announced last year that he intended to run again in the Jan. 26 presidential election. Meanwhile, human rights activists call the early election procedure one of the mechanisms of vote rigging, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported. Up to 40% of voters usually take part in early voting, and the executive branch determines the number of people who are supposed to participate. Early voting plans are distributed among regions and enterprises, effectively forcing citizens to vote during this period, according to the media outlet. Elections in Belarus &quot;no longer fulfill their functions but are used by the authoritarian government to show a positive picture of general support and thus legalize the authoritarian government,&quot; Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported, citing human rights activists. Lukashenko claimed victory in the 2020 presidential election, which was widely denounced as rigged in his favor. It was followed by mass protests across the country, which were brutally suppressed by the authorities. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who leads Belarusian democratic forces in exile, said she had won 60% of the vote. The Belarusian dictator is also a close ally of Russia and has backed Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, providing Belarusian territory as a staging area for Russian invasion troops in 2022. Russia has also been using Belarus to launch missiles against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/early-voting-in-presidential-election-begins-in-belarus/	2025-01-21T12:14:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/4888dde3-a15f-e3f0-3ad7-8b6b4f2b02d9.jpeg
Germany's KNDS launches joint venture with Ukraine for military equipment repair, minister says	Germany&apos;s KNDS Deutschland, a manufacturer of Leopard 2 tanks, has officially opened a joint venture with a Ukrainian defense company, Ukraine&apos;s Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin reported on Jan. 21. &quot;This will significantly speed up repairs and strengthen our defense capabilities,&quot; he said. The collaboration aims to expedite equipment repairs for Ukrainian armed forces and boost the local economy with investments and job creation. Smetanin noted that Ukrainian specialists have already been trained in Germany, and initial systems have been installed at local facilities. The joint venture aligns with Kyiv&apos;s strategy to localize weapons production. In July 2024, German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall also confirmed plans to construct an ammunition factory in Ukraine. The ammunition factory project is expected to take several years to complete, marking a critical step in fortifying Ukraine&apos;s defense infrastructure and deepening its partnerships with Western defense companies amid the ongoing war with Russia. Over the past year, Ukraine has significantly increased its domestic weapon productions, accounting for about 33 - 34% of its annual weapons needs &#x2014; up from less than 10% before the full-scale invasion, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 15. Ukraine aims to spend a record $35 billion on weapons production in 2025, according to Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. The Ukrainian government intends to provide $17 billion, while the rest may be financed by allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/germanys-knds-launches-joint-venture-with-ukraine-for-military-equipment-repair/	2025-01-21T12:09:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1669833933.jpg

‘A team of attention-seekers’ — Ukrainian soldiers and politicians react to Trump's Inauguration speech	Donald Trump was sworn in as U.S. president on Jan. 20, giving a speech containing a bombastic series of announcements and executive orders, not to mention the declaration of two national emergencies. Setting out the goals of his second term, with billionaires Elon Musk, Amazon&apos;s Jeff Bezos, and Meta&apos;s Mark Zuckerberg at his side, Trump took aim at everything from transgender rights and electric cars to drug cartels and a mountain in Alaska. Yet he kept his comments on U.S. foreign policy relatively vague and general, and never once mentioned what is likely to be one of his administration&apos;s biggest challenges &#x2014; ending Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home, while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad,&quot; Trump said without elaborating which events he was referring to. Trump declared open season on drilling for U.S. oil and gas, saying it was time to &quot;drill baby, drill!&quot; Although he didn&#x2019;t speak about it in the speech, flooding global markets with U.S. oil and gas could potentially push down prices and box out Russian oil, the country&apos;s main source of revenue that it uses to fund its war in Ukraine. A slightly stronger allusion to the war in Ukraine came when he criticized the administration of President Joe Biden for giving &quot;unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders&quot; at what he said was the expense of &quot;American borders, or, more importantly, its own people.&quot; Trump also said he would &quot;build the strongest military the world has ever seen,&quot; adding that success would be measured &quot;not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end and, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.&quot; &quot;My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That&#x2019;s what I want to be, a peacemaker and a unifier,&quot; he added. Trump went on to highlight the ceasefire in Gaza which came into force the day before he was sworn in, but made no mention of any ceasefire or peace negotiations in relation to the war in Ukraine. The new president campaigned on a message of ending the war in Ukraine within 24 hours. After his election, he has since admitted that bringing an end to the fighting in Ukraine will take much longer. In terms of apparent concrete foreign policy actions his administration will undertake, Trump only made reference to the Panama Canal which he&apos;d previously pledged to reassert U.S. control over. &quot;We&#x2019;re taking it back,&quot; Trump said, accusing Panama of mismanaging the critical trade route and allowing China to take de facto control of it. We asked six Ukrainians what they made of Trump&apos;s omission of Ukraine and Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion from his inauguration speech. lawmaker from the European Solidarity faction Trump is the president of the United States, not of Ukraine. It&#x2019;s understandable why his speech was focused on the U.S. I don&#x2019;t see a huge problem in the fact that he didn&#x2019;t mention Ukraine. Aryev said that it&apos;s more important for him that Trump is planning to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to reach a peace deal and to increase oil production, which would reduce prices. It&apos;s a bigger blow for Russia than any statements.

(Julia Demaree Nikhinson / Pool / Getty Images)Yaroslav Yurchyshynlawmaker and head of the Ukrainian parliament&apos;s committee on freedom of speech We understand that Trump will prioritize internal affairs over external matters. Like any political consultant will tell you, talking about something traumatizing in an inauguration speech is not as effective as something motivating. We remember that Trump promised to finish the war in 24 hours, but even before the inauguration speech, he and his team understood, that for that goal, they needed much more time and that not hours, not days, not even months would be enough. And just after the inauguration speech, talking with the mass media, Trump said that he was ready to speak with Putin, but only after the beginning of the negotiation process. Yes, for Ukraine it would have been better to have been mentioned in the inauguration speech because it (would) show that Ukraine, the end of the Russia-Ukraine war, is among the priorities for Trump&apos;s new term. But we know that it&apos;s not. author and soldier in the Ukrainian army (Ending the war in) 24 hours is over, isn&#x2019;t it? Elon Musk kind of overwhelmed even Trump with the show (Musk made a controversial salute in a separate speech later in the day). I don&#x2019;t believe it matters what they say publicly, it&#x2019;s just a team of attention-seekers. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk appears to give a fascist salute while speaking during the inaugural parade at Capitol One Arena in Washington, DC, U.S. on Jan. 20, 2025. (Angela Weiss / AFP via Getty Images)Mykyta Poturayevlawmaker in President Volodymyr &#xA0;Zelensky&apos;s Servant of the People party President Trump expressed his &#x2014; so to speak &#x2014; philosophy about wars in general. I&apos;m referring to his view on the U.S.&apos;s mission and role in ongoing or potential wars and conflicts. This is enough for me personally (to understand his perspective). Now, seeing how (Trump will approach ongoing wars), it is necessary to work with him on a practical level. medic in the 166th brigade, Kupiansk I can&#x2019;t say if things will be better for us (now Trump has been inaugurated) because Trump is definitely not a sympathizer of Ukraine. He loves himself and will make decisions and measures to keep face. He promised to stop the war in 24 hours. Well, in 24 hours, of course, he will not stop it. But in any case, he will lead such a policy to keep face, his status, his machismo, so to speak. And in this spectrum of his vision, Ukraine is unlikely to be a priority. lawmaker and chair of the Ukrainian parliament&apos;s foreign affairs committee I&#x2019;m not disappointed because it was expected. In fact, he implied Ukraine when he was talking about the need to finish the wars in the world, and to prevent them from breaking out. Besides, Trump comes to power as, first and foremost most, the president who will focus on internal problems. The crux of the matter is whether he can come up with a realistic plan to stop Russian aggression. As of now, I don&#x2019;t see such a plan.

Zelensky says Ukraine working on arranging his meeting with Trump	Ukraine is actively working to arrange a meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump, Zelensky announced on Jan. 21 during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &quot;The teams have been working on a meeting; they are currently in the process,&quot; Zelensky said, emphasizing Ukraine&apos;s commitment to ending the war with Russia. Zelensky noted Trump&apos;s public pledge to end the war in 2025. &quot;We are your partner. We know all the sore spots; we have lost our people,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to end the war this year. But not just quickly, but fairly and, above all, reliably for us.&quot; Trump, sworn in on Jan. 20, has previously claimed he could swiftly broker peace, though he stressed the need to consult with Russian President Vladimir Putin first. On Jan. 20, Trump expressed doubts about Moscow&apos;s willingness to negotiate. Zelensky also used his Davos address to urge Europe to strengthen its security framework and warn against reliance on the U.S. &quot;Europe must establish itself as a strong global player,&quot; he said, highlighting Russia&apos;s growing military capacity and alliances with Iran and North Korea. He underscored the imbalance in military production, with Russia outpacing Europe in ammunition and equipment output despite its smaller economy. The Davos forum, themed &quot;Collaboration for the Intelligent Age,&quot; convenes nearly 3,000 participants from 130 countries, including 60 heads of state and government. Discussions on Jan. 21 addressed European defense strategy, NATO&apos;s future, and Ukraine&apos;s &quot;Peace through Strength&quot; approach, which advocates using military and political leverage to pressure Russia into a just peace. Key speakers included Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Poland&apos;s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola, and Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics. Topics also ranged from geo-economic challenges to the evolving role of artificial intelligence in global cooperation.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-working-to-secure-zelensky-trump-meeting-president-announces/	2025-01-21T09:39:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173922474.jpg
Trump team may meet Ukrainian delegation in early February, MP says	Members of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s team may meet a Ukrainian delegation during Ukraine Week in Washington in early February, David Arakhamia, head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s faction in parliament, said on Jan. 21. &quot;We are now working to ensure that the relevant meetings are held at the inter-parliamentary level and other levels,&quot; he said, as cited by Interfax Ukraine. Following his inauguration on Jan. 20, Trump reiterated his intent to pursue a peace deal in Ukraine but offered few specifics. Trump has instructed his aides to arrange a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin shortly after his inauguration, CNN reported on Jan. 19. The U.S. president told reporters on Jan. 20 that Putin is &quot;destroying Russia by not making a deal&quot; while acknowledging doubts about Moscow&apos;s willingness to negotiate. The Trump administration&apos;s Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, was expected to visit Ukraine before Trump&apos;s inauguration. However, he postponed his visit due to the U.S. Logan Act, which restricts unauthorized negotiations with foreign governments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi explained on Jan. 10. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Jan. 15 that Kyiv and Moscow must make concessions to achieve peace, signaling potential challenges in crafting a mutually acceptable agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-admin-expected-to-meet-ukrainian-delegation-during-february-ukraine-week-arakhamia-says/	2025-01-21T08:44:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1263380211.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 10	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 10 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Jan. 13&#x2013;19, 2025. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Rada approves IMF-backed budget code reform for public investment The Ukrainian Parliament has passed draft law #12245, amending the budget code to streamline public investment management. The measure fulfills one of the International Monetary Fund benchmark. It establishes a centralized public investment fund to be overseen by the government&#x2019;s Strategic Investment Council, which currently mirrors the composition of the Cabinet of Ministers itself. This &#x201C;fund of funds&#x201D; will consolidate various expenditures, including the road fund, radioactive waste management, water resource development, decarbonization, and internal waterway projects. Ukrainian Parliament fails to advance reform to meet one of structural benchmarks The Committee on Law Enforcement reviewed four draft laws addressing the repeal of the &#x201C;Lozovyi amendments.&#x201D; However, it refrained from endorsing a specific proposal, recommending instead that parliament decide which draft to support. Despite the critical importance of these reforms, last week&#x2019;s parliamentary session failed to secure sufficient votes even to include the issue on the agenda.At the same time, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&#x2019;s Office (SAPO) supported the alternative draft law introduced by David Arakhamia, head of the Servant of the People faction. The bill proposes: Energoatom oversight board faces shortfall of international experts According to Forbes Ukraine, Energoatom&apos;s supervisory board is operating without a majority of its international experts, with contracts signed for only four members &#x2014; two from the Cabinet of Ministers and two international representatives. Journalists&#x2019; sources claim that Timothy Stone, a prominent figure in the U.K.&#x2019;s nuclear industry, declined to sign his contract, leaving a vacancy that the Cabinet must now fill through an open competition. According to Ukraine&apos;s Economy Ministry, on Jan. 17, the board convened for its first substantive meeting, electing former Lithuanian Energy Minister Jaroslav Neverovich as chairman. Neverovich is expected to use his decisive vote in the event of a tie. The supervisory board&apos;s first major decision is anticipated to be the announcement of a competitive selection process for the position of Energoatom CEO. Ukrainian Parliament extends martial law and mobilization The Verkhovna Rada has voted to extend martial law and military mobilization, marking the 14th time such measures have been approved. The extension will remain in effect from Feb. 8 to May 9, 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-10/	2025-01-21T07:42:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2155584026.jpg
Europe must become stronger in face of Russian hostility, Zelensky says	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 21, urging Europe to take charge of its own security amid escalating Russian threats. &quot;Europe must establish itself as a strong global player,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that, while the United States remains an indispensable ally, Washington doubts Europe&apos;s ability to contribute meaningfully to global security. Zelensky highlighted the imbalance in military capabilities, noting that Russia can deploy 1.5 million troops compared to Ukraine&apos;s 800,000 and France&apos;s 200,000. He called on European nations to unite against Russian aggression, warning that battles involving North Korean soldiers are now geographically closer to Davos than to Pyongyang. Despite having a smaller economy than Europe, Russia outpaces European nations in ammunition and military equipment production, a disparity Zelensky urged Europe to address collectively. Zelensky also emphasized the growing strategic ties between Russia, Iran, and North Korea, describing them as threats to Europe, the U.S., and global stability. &quot;These are their strategic priorities, and our priorities must meet this challenge &#x2014; in politics, defense, and economics. We can only counter such threats together,&quot; he said. Zelensky also said that Russia is evolving into a &quot;North Korea-like state,&quot; where human life holds no value, but nuclear weapons and hostility toward neighbors dominate its agenda. The Davos forum, themed &quot;Collaboration for the Intelligent Age,&quot; brings together nearly 3,000 representatives from over 130 countries, including 60 heads of state and government. Discussions on Jan. 21 include European defense strategy, NATO&apos;s future, and Ukraine&apos;s &quot;Peace through Strength&quot; approach, which advocates using military and political leverage to push Russia toward a just peace. High-profile speakers include Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Poland&apos;s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola, and Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics. Topics range from geo-economic uncertainty to the role of artificial intelligence in shaping global collaboration. Zelensky&apos;s appearance at the forum follows his attendance in January 2024, which coincided with the fourth meeting on Ukraine&apos;s peace formula, a precursor to the global peace summit in Switzerland.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-must-step-up-as-global-player-in-face-of-russian-hostility-zelensky-says/	2025-01-21T07:21:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161013738.jpg
Ukrainian soldier reports harsh conditions, fatal accidents in regiment; unit launches investigation	The 78th Air Assault Regiment on Jan. 21 announced an internal investigation after a soldier of the unit pointed to excessive demands on his comrades that supposedly lead to exhaustion and fatal accidents when handling explosives. The soldier, Vitalii Holovnia, said on his Facebook channel that an unmanned platoon commander of an attack drone unit forces soldiers to accomplish too many tasks, which leads to service members being exhausted, overstretched, and prone to mistakes. The news comes amid major scandals plaguing other units as Ukraine continues to struggle with mobilization and personnel shortages in the face of the Russian onslaught. &quot;Cases of accidents with explosives occurred because people had been in combat positions for a long time, and they were tired. It also happened that people performed some tasks during the day and some at night, so they worked around the clock. As a result, mistakes were made in the safety rules for handling explosives,&quot; Holovnia told the Kyiv Independent. According to Holovnia, casualties caused by the accidents were listed as battlefield losses. These included both deaths and injuries, he clarified for the Kyiv Independent. Approaching the third anniversary of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine still has no legal mechanism that would allow demobilization after a certain period of service. Holovnia noted that the aforementioned commander has favorites who receive the highest additional financial reward, Hr 100,000 ($2,370), without going to combat positions, while others have to put their lives to do so. According to the soldier, the commander failed to ensure the units had communications and high-quality electronic warfare equipment to perform combat missions. As a result, the unit did not have a stable connection for emergencies for almost a month and a half in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Holovnia also claimed that the commander&apos;s decisions on staffing groups for combat missions led to internal conflicts. &quot;The leadership must be proper, appropriate. We must fight with our minds and equipment, not with (people as) meat.&quot; Following the complaint, the command of the 78th Regiment launched an internal investigation &quot;in compliance with all established procedures and aimed at objectively clarifying the circumstances.&quot; &quot;We urge the public not to make hasty conclusions based on unverified information,&quot; the statement read. &quot;The 78th Separate Air Assault Regiment remains a powerful military unit that performs combat missions to protect the territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine with honor and dignity.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/78-air-assault-regiment-deadly-accidents/	2025-01-21T07:05:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/461284393_27329909956652636_6640114376022564971_n-1.jpg
EU has reduced Russian gas imports by 75%, von der Leyen says	The EU has reduced Russian gas imports by 75%, while only 3% of its oil is imported from Russia, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 21. The share of Russian coal in Europe&#x2019;s imports also went from 50% before Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion to zero by 2025, she said. &#x201C;Our gas imports from Russia went down by roughly 75% and now we import from Russia only 3% of our oil and no coal at all anymore,&quot; von der Leyen said. Europe began to wean itself off Russian energy commodities after Moscow&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine while Gazprom steadily reduced flows to the EU to pressure Ukraine&#x2019;s allies. &quot;This (Russian) energy appeared cheap, but it exposed us to blackmail. So when (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&apos;s tanks rolled into Ukraine, Putin cut us off his gas supplies, and in return, we substantially reduced our dependency on Russian fossil fuels in record time,&quot; she added. Kyiv&apos;s decision not to prolong a gas transit deal with Gazprom past December 2024 ended the supply of Russian pipeline gas to the EU. European countries continue buying Russian liquified natural gas, purchasing record amounts in 2024. Moscow and Kyiv signed an agreement in 2019 to transit 40 billion cubic meters of Russian gas annually through Ukraine to buyers in the EU. Gazprom raked in an estimated $5&#x2013;$6.5 billion annually from the deal. Thousands of participants, including political leaders and CEOs, have gathered for the annual World Economic Forum in Davos this week. President Volodymyr Zelensky is also attending the forum and is expected to meet top political and business officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-has-reduced-russian-gas-imports-by-75-von-der-leyen-says/	2025-01-21T06:22:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194490301--1-.jpg
Kyiv court arrests former host of pro-Russian channels Max Nazarov	Max Nazarov, a former host of shuttered pro-Russian news channels, was taken into custody on suspicions of spreading pro-Kremlin propaganda, Suspilne reported on Jan. 21, citing a court ruling. Nazarov has been sent to custody for 60 days pending trial, with an alternative of bail of Hr 12 million ($285,000). Nazarov, whose real name is Nazar Diorditsa, previously worked as a news presenter at the Nash and NewsOne television channels, both of which were considered among the leading pro-Russian news outlets in Ukraine. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced charges against Nazarov after searches of his home on Jan. 18, saying that &quot;large-scale evidence&quot; and &quot;conclusions from independent experts&quot; point to the news host&apos;s &quot;anti-Ukrainian activities.&quot; After the outbreak of the full-scale invasion, Nazarov regularly invited pro-Russian guests to his own YouTube channel show and used the discussions to justify Russian aggression and war crimes, the SBU said. Nazarov claimed on his Telegram channel that he bears no responsibility for the words of the guests he interviewed. Nash was owned by Yevheniy Muraiev, a wanted pro-Russian politician who fled the country after the full-scale invasion began and recently resurfaced in China. Ukraine sanctioned Nash in February 2022, leading to its closure. Shortly before the start of the full-scale Russian invasion, the U.K. Foreign Office warned that the Kremlin intends to install Muraiev as the head of the Russian puppet regime in Kyiv. NewsOne was also formerly owned by Muraviev but later became part of the unofficial media empire of pro-Russian politician and former lawmaker Viktor Medvedchuk, who lives in exile in Russia after being released from Ukrainian custody in a prisoner exchange in 2022. The news channel was banned in 2021 amid a broader crackdown on Medvedchuk&apos;s media operations, which were accused of promoting pro-Russian and anti-Ukrainian narratives.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-court-arrests-former-host-of-pro-russian-channels-max-nazarov/	2025-01-21T05:31:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/e4df9e96f6019058f5aed403f88d5cea.jpg
‘It needs to end’ — State Secretary Rubio’s position on Russia’s war against Ukraine	Republican Senator Marco Rubio was confirmed as the new U.S. secretary of state on Jan. 20, becoming the first member of President Donald Trump&apos;s new cabinet. In a rare display of bipartisan consensus, Rubio was confirmed just hours after Trump was sworn in for a second term in the White House. As secretary of state, Rubio will oversee the implementation of Trump&#x2019;s foreign policy, including that relating to Ukraine and Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion &#x2014; neither of which were directly referred to by the new president during his inauguration speech. Since Rubio was nominated for the position in early November, the signals coming from Trump and those around him about how the war in Ukraine might end have shifted dramatically, going from a swift end in &quot;in 24 hours,&quot; to a much more drawn out process that could take &quot;100 days.&quot; &quot;&#x200B;&#x200B;It&#x2019;s a complex conflict and a bloody one, and it needs to end,&quot; Rubio said after being confirmed. Regardless of the approach the Trump administration takes, Rubio will be at the forefront of any peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. Rubio, 53, is a former Republican senator from Florida. The son of Cuban immigrants, he would be the first Latino U.S. secretary of state. Rubio ran for the Republican nomination for U.S. president in 2016 but lost out to Trump after a heated, and at times bitter contest. Despite the rivalry at the time, Rubio went on to endorse Trump in 2016, albeit in not the most convincing of terms. &#x201C;I disagree with him on many things, but I disagree with his opponent on virtually everything. I wish we had better choices for president,&#x201D; he said. He endorsed Trump once again in 2024. Amid Rubio&#x2019;s confirmation, Trump revoked the former U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s last-minute decision to remove Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism in what became the first foreign policy decree by the new administration. &#x201C;Cuba belongs on the list,&#x201D; Rubio said a few days prior. The secretary of state job is Washington&#x2019;s top diplomatic position, and the person in this role is responsible for &quot;carrying out the president&apos;s foreign policy decisions and advising the president on issues of international concern,&quot; according to the National Museum of American Diplomacy. Rubio replaces Antony Blinken, who played a leading role in the U.S.-Ukraine relations throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion launched in early 2022. It was Blinken, along with his British counterpart David Lammy, who in September first received President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s detailed account of why Ukraine needs permission to strike targets deep inside Russia using Western missiles. Blinken has made numerous important announcements regarding Ukraine, including humanitarian assistance from the U.S., the provision of air defenses, and F-16 fighter jets. He has also made numerous trips to Kyiv during Russia&#x2019;s full-blown war against Ukraine. While on the job, Blinken was largely supportive of Ukraine and of providing Kyiv with what is needed to fight back against Russia&apos;s invasion. Rubio has publicly praised the bravery of Ukrainian defenders but was among the 15 Republican lawmakers in the Senate who voted against the $61 billion aid package for Ukraine in early 2024. Its delay severely hampered Ukraine&apos;s fight against Russian forces. In terms of a resolution to the war, Rubio&apos;s statements and actions have been very much geared towards negotiation and an end to the fighting rather than giving Ukraine what it needs to push Russian forces from its territory. &quot;I think the Ukrainians have been incredibly brave and strong in standing up to Russia,&quot; Rubio said on Nov. 6. &quot;But at the end of the day, what we are funding here is a stalemate war, and it needs to be brought to a conclusion, or that country is going to be set back 100 years.&quot; In September, he insisted he was &quot;not on Russia&#x2019;s side&quot; but that the &quot;reality of it is that the way the war in Ukraine is going to end is with a negotiated settlement.&quot; &quot;I would be comfortable with a deal that ends these hostilities and that I think is favorable to Ukraine, meaning that they have their own sovereignty, that they don&#x2019;t become a satellite state or a puppet state that is constantly held hostage by the Russians. I&#x2019;m not going to prejudge any agreement.&quot; Rubio has refrained from setting out any kind of timeline, and based on public statements, it&apos;s been left up to other members of the Trump administration to manage expectations. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly said he could end Russia&apos;s war within 24 hours if elected president, without ever elaborating on how he planned to achieve it. After winning the presidential election in November, these expectations were significantly dampened by Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s choice for special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, who said adjusted the timeline to within 100 days. Asked on Jan. 20 about a timeframe for ending the war, Rubio did not provide any specific deadline but said that negotiating a ceasefire would be a &quot;top priority to the president, so it&#x2019;ll (begin) almost immediately.&quot; &quot;In fact, some of that&#x2019;s already begun. You would hope that some of the groundwork has already been laid, but it&#x2019;ll be complex. I mean, it&#x2019;s a complex conflict and a bloody one, and it needs to end,&quot; he was quoted as saying by CNN. It&apos;s too early to say what sort of peace deal Trump&apos;s new administration will pursue and be able to forge. &quot;I don&#x2019;t &#x2014; couldn&#x2019;t put a time frame on it, other than to say that anytime you bring an end to a conflict between two sides, neither of whom can achieve their maximum goals, each side is going to have to give up something,&quot; Rubio said on Jan. 20, without specifying what these concessions might be. &quot;Russia is the aggressor in this conflict, but this war needs to end. And ultimately, that&#x2019;s the complexity of foreign policy.&quot; Some reports in recent months have provided clues as to the shape of any peace process. The latest report came last month when the Financial Times, citing its sources close to Trump&apos;s team, reported that he planned to freeze the war. According to the paper, the new Vice President J.D. Vance, in September outlined the idea of freezing the war by establishing autonomous regions on both sides of the demilitarized zone and leaving Ukraine outside the NATO military alliance. According to one of Trump&apos;s longtime advisors, the new plan would rethink the failed Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015, which were never implemented. The agreements contained a plan that would create temporarily autonomous zones in Russian-occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts which would later be fully reintegrated with the rest of Ukraine. Occupied Crimea was not mentioned in the Minsk agreements. In July, Politico reported that Trump was reportedly considering the possibility of making a deal with Russia to block the future NATO accession of certain countries, namely Ukraine and Georgia. One of the sources told Politico that Trump &quot;would be open to something foreclosing NATO expansion and not going back to the 1991 borders for Ukraine. Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have pushed back against the notion of any sort of ceasefire that would cement Russia&apos;s battlefield gains. &#x201C;When (Putin) gains strength, he might issue an ultimatum &#x2014; to recognize all occupied territories, to stay out of NATO, to forget about European integration,&#x201D; Zelensky said in June.&#x201C;And there will be many such conditions, depending on how strong (Putin) is at that moment. Therefore, a ceasefire is a trap,&#x201D; Zelensky added.	https://kyivindependent.com/it-needs-to-end-state-secretary-marco-rubios-position-on-russias-war-against-ukraine/	2025-01-21T04:57:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194442240.jpg
Chinese imports of Russian coal reportedly dropping over sanctions, price	China has been decreasing coal imports from Russia despite a steady growth in domestic demand, turning instead to Australian and Mongolian suppliers, The Moscow Times reported on Jan. 21, citing Chinese customs data. This development signals another blow to the Russian coal industry, which is already facing multibillion-dollar losses and mass bankruptcies. Russia&#x2019;s share in Chinese coal imports shrank despite the latter&#x2019;s demand growing by 14% in 2024 compared to the previous year, The Moscow Times reported. Russia&#x2019;s coal exports to China were said to have dropped by almost 7%, with Mongolian and Australian coal export volumes growing 18% and 60%, respectively, in 2024 compared to 2023. Warnings that Russia&#x2019;s coal industry was beginning to nosedive appeared in the second half of 2024, when AC TEK, a Russian state analytical center under the Energy Ministry, published a dire assessment. Western sanctions, insufficient transport infrastructure to the east, and Chinese tariffs levied on Russian coal are contributing to the industry&apos;s setback. Despite growing economic ties between Moscow and Beijing, the Western sanctions have presented an increasingly serious obstacle to Russian-Chinese trade relations.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-coal-imports-to-china/	2025-01-21T04:30:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1234072071.jpg
Russia’s Baltic Sea sabotage is no accident, it’s strategy	Intelligence officials in the U.S. and Europe have suggested that recent incidents damaging critical cables in the Baltic Sea were accidental, according to a Washington Post report. Western geostrategic self-deception has overly emphasized fears of escalation and cornering Russia. It would be na&#xEF;ve to assume that the repeated cutting of cables in the Baltic Sea, along with the recent leak, is purely accidental. Persistent incidents of &#x201C;poor seamanship&#x201D; in one of the world&#x2019;s most strategically significant maritime environments cannot be easily dismissed. Some within the Western foreign policy establishment may believe that this assessment signals de-escalation and patience toward Russia &#x2014; particularly with Donald Trump poised to take office. For them, the recently announced NATO operation in the Baltic is framed as mere maritime traffic control and accident prevention, requiring a more militarized presence for the sake of efficiency. The leak aligns with an unfortunate pattern of de-escalatory signaling to Russia. Yet others see the pattern of shadow fleet accidents as deliberate provocations with deeper geostrategic motivations, reflecting a tendency to escalate. A reasonable alternative to the &#x201C;accidents happen&#x201D; explanation is that the current and past incidents, which remain under investigation due to the inherent deniability, are the result of deliberate malice. Instead of downplaying these actions, a strong message of strategic resolve must be sent to Moscow. The cable-cutting occurred due to the self-evident, deliberate, and negligent actions of Russia&#x2019;s shadow fleet. While tactical leaks to the media may ease tensions, they only do so for the intended audience. For Russia, however, these leaks signal Western discord, encouraging both recklessness and further sabotage. There are clear geopolitical reasons for giving Russia the benefit of the doubt when it comes to these sabotage incidents. The investigation is challenging and may not produce conclusive evidence. Authorities may want the issue to disappear to avoid unwanted attention and scrutiny. Moreover, the situation drains already limited military resources, and some countries are less motivated to escalate tensions in the Baltic Sea, particularly with elections on the horizon. However, putting too much emphasis on these concerns risks provoking further Russian aggression and weakening deterrence. As the Finns say, &#x201C;The Russians will keep pushing with their bayonet until it hits something hard.&#x201D; (L-R) Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and Finnish President Alexander Stubb attend the Summit of Baltic Sea Allies at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki, Finland, on Jan. 14, 2025. (Roni Rekomaa / Bloomberg via Getty Images)Another Finnish saying, from their geopolitically pressured times, is that &#x201C;Moscow is not a district court.&#x201D; Russia respects the law only when it benefits them or when forced to do so, while Finland has always been committed to international law. Investigations are being conducted as thoroughly as possible, but conclusive attribution is difficult, as seen in numerous other suspected instances of Russian sabotage across Europe and North America. While the intent remains hard to establish, that shouldn&#x2019;t lead to granting Russia an implicit plea deal or allowing them to escape accountability. It&#x2019;s essential to see the forest for the trees. The repeated reckless actions by Russia should already be alarming enough to warrant countermeasures. The precautionary principle demands the establishment of deterrence. NATO has contributed to this by launching the Baltic Sentry operation. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte initiated the summit in Helsinki last week. Although not all NATO countries were invited, it was not just a Nordic-Baltic effort. More than half of Russia&#x2019;s energy exports pass through a critical corridor from St. Petersburg, through the narrow Gulf, and into the Danish Straits. If Russia&#x2019;s recklessness continues, this vital corridor, which allows for innocent passage, must be tightened. Legal measures to restrict this main artery include environmental, seaworthiness, and insurance inspections. The United Nations&apos; maritime convention, UNCLOS, also provides valuable alternatives. If Russia continues to abuse the line between war and peace, other legal frameworks, beyond UNCLOS, could become actionable. Russia views the Black, Baltic, and Arctic Seas as part of a unified geopolitical theater. The West should not engage in petty tactics like selective intelligence leaks. These are highly strategic waters, which Russia considers its imperial playground. Unfortunately, Chinese-registered ships have also been involved, as the Baltic Sea may serve as a rehearsal for the maritime blockade of Taiwan. Western reactions are carefully monitored. Ultimately, the Baltic Sea incidents are about testing Russia&#x2019;s defense thresholds. Leaks should not stem from minor disagreements or short-term considerations; when intelligence is leaked, it must convey a message of containment and deterrence.

Xi declares readiness to bring China-Russia ties to 'new height' in call with Putin	Chinese President Xi Jinping declared readiness to lead China-Russian relations to &quot;a new height&quot; together with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin&apos;s press service reported on Jan. 21 after a video call between the two leaders. China has deepened its ties with Russia since the start of the Kremlin&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine and has become Moscow&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry. Beijing has nevertheless denied accusations of supporting Russia&apos;s military efforts. In the call with Putin, Xi added that China is ready to stand with Russia to &quot;face external uncertainties based on maintaining the stability and stress resistance of China-Russia relations for the prosperity of the two countries, international justice, and equality.&quot; The Chinese president stressed that bilateral cooperation between Beijing and Moscow is gradually expanding and that joint trade is trending upward. Putin, in turn, noted a 7% increase in trade between the two countries, which amounts to more than $220 billion. The Russian president also called China Russia&apos;s leading trading partner. &quot;China is the largest consumer of Russian energy resources. We hold the first place in terms of oil exports to China. Five years ago, together with you, we launched the Power of Siberia gas pipeline, and today Russia has taken the first place in natural gas supplies to China,&quot; Putin said. Since February 2022, Putin has visited China twice &#x2014; first just days before launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and again in May 2024. Xi visited Russia in March 2023, where he was welcomed by his &quot;dear friend&quot; Putin. Beijing has also positioned itself as a mediator between Russia and Ukraine, sending envoy Li Hui on multiple rounds of shuttle diplomacy in Europe. China has criticized the U.S. and its allies for &quot;exacerbating&quot; the war by supplying arms to Ukraine, while NATO has named Beijing a &quot;decisive enabler&quot; of Russia&apos;s war.	https://kyivindependent.com/xi-declares-readiness-to-bring-china-russia-relations-to-new-height-together-with-putin/	2025-01-21T03:32:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1730511481--1-.jpg

Ukraine's SBU detains chief military psychiatrist over suspected illicit enrichment	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) detained the chief psychiatrist of the Armed Forces over suspected illicit enrichment in the amount of over $1 million, the agency reported on Jan. 21. According to charges, the official has acquired substantial undeclared assets since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, including a house in Kyiv Oblast, apartments in Kyiv and Odesa, luxury cars, and plots of land. The detainee also serves as the deputy head of the central medical commission that determines the suitability of potential recruits for military service. Though the SBU did not name the suspect, Oleh Druz serves as the chief military psychiatrist. Military medical commissions have come under increasing scrutiny after suspected instances of corruption and other violations. Enlistment facilities across the country attracted authorities&apos; attention after journalists discovered in June 2023 that the family of the ex-head of the Odesa Oblast military enlistment office had acquired property worth $4.5 million since the start of the full-scale invasion. Ukraine&apos;s defense and health ministries pledged to reform the institution by November 2025 in order to tackle corruption and bureaucratic deficiencies.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-sbu-detains-chief-military-psychiatrist-over-suspected-illicit-enrichment/	2025-01-21T03:08:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-21_10-00-03.jpg
Ukraine ceasefire is 'top priority' for Trump, US Secretary of State Rubio says	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will begin working on a ceasefire in Ukraine &quot;almost immediately,&quot; new U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told journalists on Jan. 20.

Ukraine attacks Russian oil depot, aviation plant, command post overnight, military says	Ukrainian forces struck the Liskinskaya oil depot in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast, the Smolensk Aviation Plant, and a Russian command post in Donetsk Oblast overnight on Jan. 21, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said. The announcement comes as Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry reported intercepting 55 Ukrainian drones in a large-scale overnight strike, including 10 over Smolensk Oblast and six over Voronezh Oblast. The Liskinskaya oil depot was targeted again after being hit by a Ukrainian drone attack on Jan. 16. In the most recent strike, Ukrainian drones hit fuel and lubricant tanks, starting a fire at the Rosneft-run facility, the General Staff reported. An attack against the depot was confirmed by Voronezh Oblast Governor Alexander Gusev. The village of Liski, where the depot is located, lies around 140 kilometers (90 miles) north of Russia&apos;s border with Ukraine&apos;s Kharkiv Oblast. Another attack, carried out jointly by the Unmanned Systems Forces and the Special Operations Forces, hit the infrastructure of the Smolensk Aviation Plant, with explosions reported on the facility&apos;s territory, according to the General Staff. Smolensk lies less than 60 kilometers (around 35 miles) east of the Russia-Belarus border and some 270 kilometers (170 miles) north of Ukraine. The city&apos;s aviation plant is involved in the production and modernization of the Su-25 military aircraft, said Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. The Ukrainian military also reported a successful hit against a command post of Russia&apos;s 29th Combined Arms Army in the occupied Volnovakha in Donetsk Oblast. &quot;The consequences of the strike are being clarified,&quot; the General Staff said without specifying the weaponry used. Ukrainian long-range drones regularly target Russian military and industrial facilities to undermine Moscow&apos;s ability to wage its full-scale war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-russian-oil-depot-aviation-plant-military-confirms/	2025-01-21T01:35:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-21_06-56-23.jpg
Trump pauses US foreign development aid for 90 days, orders review	U.S. President Donald Trump paused U.S. foreign development assistance for 90 days and ordered reviews of aid programs to ensure they align with Washington&apos;s foreign policy, according to an executive order published by the White House on Jan. 20. Trump signed numerous decrees after being sworn in as the 47th president of the United States in a ceremony held in the United States Capitol on Jan. 20. Ukraine tops the list of U.S. development assistance recipients, receiving over $17 billion in economic aid in 2023 as it faces Russian aggression, official data shows. It remains unclear what programs will be affected or what the immediate impact of the order will be for Ukraine. As the federal budget is set by the U.S. Congress, it also remains unclear what funding could be cut by the order. In the document, Trump wrote that &quot;the United States foreign aid industry and bureaucracy are not aligned with American interests and in many cases antithetical to American values,&quot; without mentioning specific examples. &quot;All department and agency heads with responsibility for United States foreign development assistance programs shall immediately pause new obligations and disbursements of development assistance funds to foreign countries and implementing non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and contractors pending reviews of such programs for programmatic efficiency and consistency with United States foreign policy,&quot; the executive order reads. In addition to development aid, the U.S. has provided Kyiv with $66 billion in military assistance since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022. Trump has previously hinted at a possible reduction of military support for Ukraine and vowed to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the conflict.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-pauses-all-us-foreign-aid-for-90-days-pending-review/	2025-01-21T01:04:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158937171.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine injure 15 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine injured at least 15 civilians over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 21. Russia attacked Ukraine with four Iskander-M ballistic missiles overnight, the Air Force said. Moscow also launched 131 Shahed-type drones and decoy drones, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported on their Telegram channel. Ukrainian air defenses reportedly shot down 72 drones, while 59 other drones were lost in the airspace without causing further damage. Three people were injured in Russian attacks against Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Governor Serhii Lysak reported on his Telegram channel. These included two railway workers, Ukrainian Railways said. Three people were also injured in Russian strikes in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on his Telegram channel. The casualties were reported in Kostiantynivka, Lyman, and Druzhkivske. Two police officers were injured during a Russian attack on Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. In Kherson Oblast, six people were injured in strikes against Kherson and 38 other settlements, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. A 49-year-old man was wounded in a Russian attack on the Vasylivka district of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported on his Telegram channel.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-injure-15/	2025-01-21T00:30:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-21_06-36-32.jpg
Ukrainian drones reportedly attack Russian aviation plant in Smolensk	A Ukrainian drone attack targeted the Smolensk Aviation Plant in western Russia overnight on Jan. 21, starting a fire at the facility, the independent news channel Astra reported. Russian authorities confirmed a drone attack against Smolensk Oblast but made no mention of the plant. According to Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry, Russian air defenses intercepted 55 drones overnight, including 10 in Smolensk Oblast. &quot;Fallen drone debris caused fires on the ground and on the roofs. Windows of residential buildings were also damaged,&quot; Governor Vasily Anokhin said on his Telegram channel. The governor also warned against alleged &quot;fake information and videos&quot; appearing on social media regarding the drone attack. At least two high-rise residential buildings were damaged as a result of the attack, the Russian Telegram channel Shot claimed. No casualties were reported. The Ukrainian military did not comment on the claims, which could not be independently verified. Smolensk lies less than 60 kilometers (around 35 miles) east of the Russia-Belarus border and some 270 kilometers (170 miles) north of Ukraine. The city&apos;s aviation plant is involved in the production and modernization of the Su-25 military aircraft, said Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. The same night, an oil depot in the village of Lisky in Voronezh Oblast caught fire due to fallen drone debris, Governor Alexander Gusev said. Ukrainian drones previously attacked the facility on Jan. 16. Ukrainian long-range drones regularly target Russian military and industrial facilities to undermine Moscow&apos;s ability to wage its full-scale war in Ukraine. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-reportedly-attack-russian-aviation-plant-in-smolensk/	2025-01-20T23:52:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-21_06-56-23.jpg
US Senate confirms Marco Rubio as new secretary of state	The U.S. Senate confirmed Marco Rubio as the next secretary of state by a rare bipartisan consensus on Jan. 20, making him the first confirmed high-level member of the new Trump administration. Rubio will oversee the implementation of U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s foreign policy, which is expected to entail a quick push to end Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. Trump has sent mixed signals about his approach to ending the conflict. Rubio recently said that both Russia and Ukraine would have to make concessions to achieve a peace deal, possibly indicating an agreement that would allow Moscow to hold on to at least some of the occupied territories. Previously, Rubio publicly praised the bravery of Ukrainian defenders but was among the 15 Republican lawmakers in the Senate who voted against the $61 billion aid package for Ukraine in early 2024. Its delay severely hampered Ukraine&apos;s fight against Russian forces. Rubio replaced Antony Blinken, who, in the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden, has played a leading role in U.S.-Ukraine relations throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion launched in early 2022. Officials close to Trump maintain that U.S. military aid to Ukraine will persist, focusing on empowering Kyiv to negotiate from a position of strength.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-senate-confirms-marco-rubio-as-next-us-secretary-of-state/	2025-01-20T23:24:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193483462.jpg
Putin is 'destroying Russia by not making a deal' to end war, Trump says	U.S. President Donald Trump believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin is &quot;destroying Russia&quot; by failing to reach a peace deal on Ukraine, Trump told reporters at the White House on Jan. 20. &quot;He should make a deal. I think he&apos;s destroying Russia by not making a deal,&quot; Trump said following his inauguration, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported. The new U.S. president was sworn in at the United States Capitol earlier on Jan. 20. Though his inauguration speech did not mention Ukraine, Trump has often claimed in the past that he would seek to bring a swift end to Russia&apos;s war. Talking to reporters, Trump again said he aims to conclude the conflict as soon as possible but noted he would have to talk to Putin first. The new U.S. president also said that his Russian counterpart &quot;can&apos;t be thrilled (with the war) since &quot;he&apos;s not doing so well.&quot; &quot;Most people thought that war would have been over in one week,&quot; Trump said, adding that Putin would be &quot;very well off to end the war.&quot; The U.S. president again boasted of warm relations with the Russian leader and voiced hopes for reaching a quick peace deal without presenting a specific timeline. Trump nevertheless noted that while Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky told him he seeks an agreement to end the war, the U.S. president is unsure whether Putin wants the same. Russia is estimated to have lost around 700,000-800,000 soldiers killed or wounded in almost three years of the full-scale war and faces economic headwinds in the year ahead. At the same time, Russian forces continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east while Kyiv struggles with manpower shortages. The U.S. president has revealed few details of his plans to end the war. His team signaled that the new administration would seek to preserve Ukraine&apos;s independence, though U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that both Kyiv and Moscow would have to make concessions to achieve a peace deal.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-is-destroying-russia-by-not-making-a-deal-trump-says/	2025-01-20T22:52:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194451398.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 822,030 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 822,030 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 21. This number includes 1,600 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,833 tanks, 20,477 armored fighting vehicles, 34,682 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,134 artillery systems, 1,262 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,050 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 22,898 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-822-030-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-20T22:20:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2003913401.jpg
German FM urges Scholz to act and support aid to Ukraine amid election campaign	German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has urged Chancellor Olaf Scholz to avoid politicizing aid to Ukraine during Germany&apos;s election campaign, n-tv reported on Jan. 20. Baerbock made the comments in Berlin, speaking alongside Lithuania&#x2019;s foreign minister. &#x201C;Times are too difficult now, Germany has too much responsibility for us all to indulge in pre-election rhetoric in the coming weeks,&#x201D; she said. Baerbock emphasized that Germany has pledged to support Ukraine and its Eastern European partners for as long as necessary. &quot;This is a crucial issue for trust in Europe, whether we are able to act in the interests of the security of all of us, our European security,&#x201D; she noted. Her remarks come amid reports of a growing rift in the intermin Social Democrat-Greens cabinet as Scholz is reluctant to greenlight an additional 3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) in security assistance for Kyiv. Despite Baerbock&apos;s and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius&apos; (SPD) support for the new assistance tranche, the chancellor said he would sign off on it only if it is paid with additional borrowing, an unpopular step among other parties. Berlin stands as Ukraine&apos;s second largest military donor, a role of growing importance as Ukraine faces a heavy Russian onslaught in the east of the country, and the future of U.S. support appears uncertain under the incoming Trump administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-fm-urges-scholz-to-act-and-support-aid-to-ukraine-amid-election-campaign/	2025-01-20T22:04:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/baerbock.jpeg
Erdogan intends to discuss ending Russia’s war in Ukraine with Trump	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that there was an urgent need for a &#x201C;just and lasting peace&#x201D; in Ukraine, at a press conference on Jan. 20. He made this statement after meeting with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico. &#x201C;A just and lasting peace must be achieved in Ukraine as soon as possible&#x2026;before the consequences of the war in our neighboring geography deepen even further,&#x201D; Erdogan said. He reaffirmed Turkey&apos;s ongoing commitment to this goal and noted his plans to discuss the matter with newly inaugurated U.S. President Donald Trump. Slovak Prime Minister Fico acknowledged his country&#x2019;s limited influence in the outcome of the war, and noted that if the new U.S. administration can quickly end the war, it should be fully supported. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s take off our rose-colored glasses,&#x201D; Fico said, saying that there was a low likelihood of Russia withdrawing from occupied territories in Ukraine. The two leaders also signed agreements elevating Turkish-Slovak relations to a strategic partnership and expanding cooperation in military, cultural, and defense industries. While Turkey is a NATO member, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has aimed to maintain positive relations with both Russia and Ukraine. Turkey has also facilitated the flow of Russian oil to the European Union since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, enabling the Kremlin to circumvent the bloc&#x2019;s sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/erdogan-intends-to-discuss-ending-russias-war-in-ukraine-with-trump/	2025-01-20T19:48:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1410425074.jpg
Macron warns of prolonged Ukraine war, urges stronger European defense strategy	French President Emmanuel Macron cautioned on Jan. 20 that Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine is far from over, as Donald Trump, who vowed to quickly end the conflict, assumed office again. &quot;Let us not delude ourselves,&quot; Macron said earlier during his New Year&#x2019;s address to the French armed forces, according to AFP. &quot;This conflict will not end tomorrow or the day after,&quot; he added, with the third anniversary of Russia&#x2019;s invasion approaching next month. Trump has previously pledged to end the war &quot;in 24 hours&quot; without detailing his plan and later extended the timeline to several months. Speaking in Cesson-S&#xE9;vign&#xE9; in northwestern France, Macron emphasized the importance of strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s position. &quot;It is essential to provide Ukraine with the means to endure and to negotiate from a position of strength in the future,&quot; he said. He also stressed the need to ensure Ukraine&#x2019;s security and prevent a resurgence of war on its territory. Macron renewed his call for Europe to take greater responsibility for its defense, a point he has often raised. &quot;There can be no peace and security in Europe without Europeans,&quot; he said, referencing the war in Ukraine and Europe&#x2019;s role in future negotiations. Trump&#x2019;s questioning of NATO commitments and his remarks about reducing support for Ukraine have sparked fresh urgency among European nations to reassess their defense capabilities. In 2023, France approved a record 413-billion-euro ($450 billion) military budget for 2024-2030, marking its most significant defense spending boost in decades. Macron also directed the government and armed forces to submit plans by May to mobilize more young volunteers to support the military. This appears to acknowledge the end of his long-championed universal national service project. &quot;In order to build up this reserve, the Defense and Citizenship Day will be revamped,&quot; he added, without elaborating. Currently, France requires all citizens to participate in a one-day &quot;Defense and Citizenship&quot; program at age 18, which introduces the country&#x2019;s military forces and includes a French language test. Macron called for better efforts to identify willing volunteers. During his 2017 presidential campaign, Macron proposed a month-long mandatory national service, aiming to expose young people to military life. The army&#x2019;s lukewarm response led to the government pivoting toward a civic service initiative instead.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-warns-of-prolonged-ukraine-war-urges-stronger-european-defense-strategy/	2025-01-20T15:50:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1522719294.jpg
EU plans to eliminate Russian fossil fuels, aims to end gas imports	The European Commission is developing a strategy to eliminate Russian fossil fuels from the European Union&apos;s energy market. However, gas deliveries from Russia to Europe persist despite the EU&apos;s efforts, and Brussels is determined to halt this, Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, the EU&#x2019;s spokesperson for energy and housing, said. Speaking at a press briefing in Brussels on Jan. 20, Itkonen noted that work on a comprehensive roadmap to fully phase out Russian fossil fuels is ongoing. &quot;This initiative was announced as a priority for the Energy Commission to deliver within its first 100 days, so we still have a little time before the deadline,&quot; she said, according to Interfax news agency. Itkonen highlighted that the EU has already made substantial progress in reducing its dependence on Russian energy. &quot;We have significantly reduced imports of Russian gas, eliminated all coal imports from Russia, and cut most oil imports,&quot; she explained. Despite these achievements, Russian gas continues to be present on the EU market, which remains a concern. &quot;This is an issue we aim to address in the roadmap that will be unveiled in the coming weeks,&quot; Itkonen added.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-plans-to-eliminate-russian-fossil-fuels-aims-to-end-gas-imports/	2025-01-20T13:39:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1013825882.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ammunition used by Russians halved following Ukrainian strikes, Syrskyi says	Key developments on Jan. 20: Russia&apos;s ammunition use has been cut nearly in half amid the long-term impacts of Ukrainian strikes on Russian military targets, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in an interview with the Ukrainian news outlet TSN on Jan. 19. Ukraine has intensified strikes deep into Russian territory in an attempt to weaken Russia&apos;s ability to wage war in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;For several months now, the artillery ammunition expenditure rates in the Russian army have practically halved. If previously the figure reached up to 40,000 rounds per day, it is now significantly lower,&quot; Syrskyi said when asked what the impact of Ukrainian strikes has been on Russia&apos;s military supply-chain. Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory target &quot;industrial enterprises that produce ammunition, missile parts, or dual-use products are targeted for destruction,&quot; Syrskyi said, adding that oil refineries serve as regularly military targets. Ukraine has regularly targeted Russian ammunition depots in an attempt to stall Russia&apos;s operations on the front line. Despite being regularly outgunned by Russian forces since the start of the full-scale war, Ukraine has managed to progress in arms production, with the country producing about 33-34% of its annual weapons needs &#x2014; up from less than 10% before the full-scale invasion, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 15. Europe and the U.S. supply more than 60% of Ukraine&#x2019;s weaponry, with each accounting for about 30%. Earlier in his interview, Syrskyi said that Ukraine is working on developing its own air defense systems, including ones that can repel the the Oreshnik missile. &quot;This encourages us to create our own air defense system, which would be not just an air defense system, but also an anti-missile system,&quot; Syrskyi said. &quot;The work is underway, it is being actively pursued in this direction. I hope that we will soon get the desired result for us,&quot; he added. Ukraine aims to spend a record $35 billion on weapons production in 2025, according to Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. The Ukrainian government intends to provide $17 billion, while the rest may be financed by allies. The commander of a scandal-hit Ukrainian brigade has been detained, accused of failing to report violations in his unit, the State Bureau of Investigation said on Jan. 20. The 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Brigade was intended to be a flagship project for Ukrainian brigades trained and armed with the assistance of foreign partners. French President Emmanuel Macron announced in June that France would provide training and military supplies as part of this initiative. Despite Paris fulfilling its commitments for training and arms provision, an investigation led by Yurii Butusov, editor-in-chief of Ukrainian media outlet Censor.net, claimed soldiers of the unit, currently deployed near Pokrovsk, have suffered losses and gone AWOL (absent without leave) in large numbers due to poor command and organization within Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership. The State Bureau of Investigation launched an investigation into the unit on Jan. 3. In a statement on Jan 20, the bureau said the commander &quot;did not respond to violations in his unit, including the unauthorized abandonment of the military unit by his fighters.&quot; &quot;The commander also deliberately failed to perform other actions assigned to him by his official duties. In particular, during 2024, he did not send a single report to pre-trial investigation bodies regarding subordinate servicemen who committed criminal offenses,&quot; it added. If found guilty, the commander faces up to 10 years in prison. The 155th Brigade has about 5,800 troops, fewer than 2,000 of whom have undergone training in France. It is armed with French AMX10 armored vehicles, Caesar howitzers, and German Leopard 2A4 tanks, among other weapons. According to Butusov&apos;s investigation, the unit&apos;s founding was &quot;organizational chaos&quot; from the very beginning. Even before the training in France began, 2,500 service members were reportedly sent to other units, thus removing many of the most qualified personnel from the brigade. Of the 1,924 soldiers eventually sent to France, only 51 had more than a year of military service, while 1,414 had served for less than two months, Butusov wrote. The unit was also plagued by large numbers of soldiers going AWOL &#x2014; about 50 deserted in France, in addition to hundreds who left their posts even before the unit was deployed at the front, according to the journalist. Between March and November, over 1,700 soldiers had gone AWOL, Butusov reported. Though the unit was replenished with new recruits, these often did not undergo a &quot;proper selection process,&quot; the journalist added. Highly-trained Air Force specialists are protected from being transferred to front-line infantry units, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 19. Reports last week indicated that since 2024, thousands of Air Force soldiers have been transferred to the Ground Forces. Videos filmed by Air Force specialists themselves then surfaced, claiming their transfer to front-line units was &quot;a real challenge&quot; that could &quot;destroy the very foundation of our aviation.&quot; The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces on Jan. 14 said the transfer of some personnel is &quot;a necessary step&quot; to strengthen defense by reinforcing combat brigades with soldiers from other branches of the Armed Forces. But it stressed that Syrskyi prohibited the transfer of high-tech specialists and those trained abroad on foreign models of weapons and equipment. &quot;I have an order prohibiting the transfer of highly qualified personnel who have undergone training and specialize in aircraft maintenance,&quot; Syrskyi reiterated in an interview with journalist Andriy Tsaplienko. &quot;Clearly, these are specialists on whom money has been spent, who have gained experience, and who are practically irreplaceable,&quot; he added. But in a separate interview with Ukrainian news outlet TSN on Jan. 19, Syrskyi &#xA0;acknowledged that current mobilization efforts are not sufficient on their own to meet the needs of the Armed Forces. Fighting has intensified in eastern Ukraine as Kyiv and Moscow try to gain an upper hand in potential upcoming peace negotiations following the inauguration of Donald Trump on Jan. 20. &quot;We have needs at the front. We must increase the number of personnel in our mechanized brigades, &quot; unfortunately, mobilization does not cover demand from the front line, Syrskyi said. President Volodymyr Zelensky released on Jan. 20 new footage of the interrogation of a North Korean soldier captured by the Ukrainian military. Ukrainian forces captured two North Korean soldiers in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast earlier in January. They are currently in the custody of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) in Kyiv. Both were wounded and are reportedly receiving medical attention. The prisoner of war (POW) in the newly released footage said he arrived in Russia on a cargo ferry with over 100 soldiers. He was not trained with Russian military equipment but claimed that several other North Korean soldiers were taught to do so. Communication between captured North Korean soldiers and SSU investigators continues. Intelligence data on the movement of such troops to Russian territory, their training and complete information isolation have been confirmed by the prisoners. All the facts about North&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/E2wiFlPBiw North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces against a Ukrainian incursion launched on Aug. 6. Ukrainian troops continue to operate in the region, leveraging their position for potential future negotiations. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) estimates that North Korean casualties have reached 300 killed and 2,700 wounded, attributing the losses to inadequate training and ineffective counter-drone tactics. The NIS also reported that some North Korean soldiers have been forced to commit suicide to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby echoed these claims on Dec. 27, adding that captured North Korean troops fear severe retaliation against their families if they surrender. Neither Russia nor North Korea have officially acknowledged the deployment, which is the latest move in Moscow&apos;s ever-increasing &#x2014; and humiliating &#x2014; reliance on Pyongyang to bolster its military, following long-running shipments of artillery shells and ballistic missiles. Russian forces suffered their heaviest losses last year since the start of the full-scale war, with total military losses reaching 434,000 soldiers, including approximately 150,000 killed in combat during 2024, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in a Jan. 19 interview with the Ukrainian news outlet TSN. &quot;In this year of fighting, (Russian President Vladimir Putin) lost more than in the previous two years of the war (combined),&quot; Syrskyi said. As of Jan. 19, Russia has lost a total of 818,740 troops since the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported. The estimate, which is broadly in-line with estimates made by Western intelligence agencies, likely includes those killed, captured, wounded, and missing. Russia has gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast over the past year but at the cost of heavy casualties. Russian losses reached record highs in November and December, with a daily high of 2,030 troops lost in November, marking the highest daily loss since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures, though a Defense Ministry official recently let slip that the department received 48,000 requests to identify missing soldiers. According to a joint investigation by BBC Russia and Mediazona, journalists have identified the names of 88,726 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. According to the outlets&apos; conclusions for the year, 2024 will likely mark the &quot;war&apos;s deadliest year,&quot; with a current count of over 20,000 confirmed deaths over the past 12 months &#x2014; although final conclusions cannot yet be made as data on casualties continues to emerge. In December, President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed in a rare statement that Ukraine had lost 43,000 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. When asked during the wide-ranging interview about the Ukrainian losses, Syrskyi broadly replied that there were &quot;many times&quot; less Ukrainian losses than those sustained by the Russians. At the current rate of Russian military casualties, Russian losses are expected to surpass 1 million troops within six months. Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on his upcoming inauguration and expressed readiness for dialogue during a Russian Security Council meeting on Jan. 20. Putin emphasized his openness to engaging with the incoming Trump administration, including discussions related to Russia&apos;s war war against Ukraine. &quot;We are open to dialogue with the new U.S. administration on the Ukrainian conflict (Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine). The most important thing here is to eliminate the root causes of the crisis,&quot; Putin said. This comes as reported peace proposals, including freezing the front lines, have been publicly rejected by Russia. Putin previously stated that his country would begin peace negotiations if Kyiv agreed to withdraw from the four Ukrainian regions &#x2014; Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson &#x2014; that it partly controls. Trump has signaled his intent to meet Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; after taking office, according to CNN. While the Kremlin welcomed the remarks, it noted that no preparations for the meeting are currently underway. Trump&apos;s team is reportedly working on arranging a call with Putin shortly after the inauguration, with the goal of initiating a settlement plan for the war in Ukraine within the first months of his presidency. During his campaign, Trump pledged to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours, though his choice for Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, has since adjusted this timeline to 100 days.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ammunition-used-by-russians-halved-following-ukrainian-strikes-commander-of-scandal-hit-ukrainian-brigade-detained/	2025-01-20T12:23:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/2023-04-10-09.52.06.jpg
China’s support for Russia falls short in replacing Western materials, media reports	China has emerged as Russia&apos;s largest supplier of goods, but Chinese imports have failed to fully replace Western equipment and raw materials lost due to sanctions, The Moscow Times reported on Jan. 20, citing data from the Gaidar Institute. The trade between the two countries is hindered by payment difficulties as the West intensifies sanctions against Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Chinese imports have partially compensated for Russian losses in key sectors. Medical and optical equipment imports rose by $1.3 billion annually compared to 2021, covering only 60% of pre-sanction European shipments. Plastics and polymers imports increased by $1.6 billion, replacing just 40% of EU supply. In mechanical equipment, Chinese imports covered 60% of losses, while electrical equipment saw less than 25% replacement. Chinese exports fell short in several categories. Aircraft shipments from Europe dropped by $3.1 billion annually, while Chinese exports amounted to only $201 million, just 7% of the shortfall. For pharmaceutical production, China supplied $108 million annually, far below the EU&apos;s pre-war level of $9.3 billion. Despite an initial surge in trade, growth has stagnated. After increasing by 30% in 2022 and 26% in 2023, mutual trade turnover grew by just 1.9% in 2024, reaching $244.8 billion. Chinese exports to Russia in yuan grew by only 5%, compared to 53% the previous year, while imports from Russia rose by 1%. Russian crude oil exports to China hit a record high in 2024, growing by 1% compared to 2023, according to Reuters. Broader trade figures highlight the limitations of Russia&apos;s pivot to China in offsetting the impact of Western sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinas-support-for-russia-falls-short-in-replacing-western-materials-media-reports/	2025-01-20T11:57:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2153185709.jpg
Arms procurement head should keep post, supervisory board says	The supervisory board of Ukraine&#x2019;s Defense Procurement Agency advised the Defense Minister to extend its director&#x2019;s work in a statement posted on Facebook on Jan. 20. &#x201C;The Supervisory Board submitted to Defense Minister Rustem Umerov a recommendation to extend the contract of the current director of the Defense Procurement Agency, Maryna Bezrukova, for one year,&#x201D; the statement read. Separate boards were set up for Ukraine&#x2019;s lethal and non-lethal procurement agencies, complying with NATO standards, in the fall of 2024. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov planned to merge the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) and the State Logistics Operator (DOT) into one agency but changed his mind after a NATO statement said that the two agencies should be kept separate and two separate supervisory boards should be established. Bezrukova, a former employee of Ukraine&#x2019;s energy company Ukrenergo, was appointed to head the DPA. &#x201C;This decision is based on an assessment of her performance and the need to ensure stability and efficiency in procurement management in wartime,&#x201D; the supervisory board statement read. In a separate move, the supervisory board also announced initiating an independent audit by the International Board of Auditors of NATO (IBAN), the results of which will form a &#x201C;center of excellence for Ukraine&apos;s military procurement,&#x201D; the statement read.	https://kyivindependent.com/arms-procurement-head-should-keep-post-supervisory-board-says/	2025-01-20T11:25:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/DSC01273.jpg
False story' — Denmark denies Russian claims of F-16 instructor killed in Kryvyi Rih strike	The Danish Defense Ministry on Jan. 19 denied Russian claims of the death of a Danish F-16 instructor in a missile strike on Kryvyi Rih, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, on Jan. 17. &quot;This is a false story being spread by the Russian media &#x2014; probably with the aim of discrediting Denmark,&quot; Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said. The Russian strike killed four people and injured 14 others, with damage reported to high-rise buildings, houses, vehicles, and an educational institution. Russian state news agency TASS alleged on Jan. 18 that a Danish F-16 instructor was killed during the attack, citing unnamed sources in Russia&apos;s security services. Denmark&apos;s Defense Ministry dismissed the report as false, emphasizing that no Danish military personnel have died in Ukraine. Poulsen condemned the disinformation, citing it as part of broader influence campaigns amid a serious security situation. Denmark, along with the Netherlands, has provided Ukraine with U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets, which have been used in air defense operations to counter Russian missile strikes on cities and infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/false-story-denmark-denies-russian-claims-of-f-16-instructor-killed-in-kryvyi-rih-strike/	2025-01-20T10:03:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2171996068.jpg
Massive Russian hack on government database shows cracks in Ukraine's digitalization drive	At the start of December, Ukrainians suddenly found themselves unable to sell cars, file legal claims, or register marriages through Ukraine&#x2019;s recently digitized government registries. Cybersecurity specialist and frequent coordinator of Ukrainian hackers, Karla Wagner, noticed when she went to register an NGO through the Ukrainian Justice Ministry. &#x201C;I was getting inconsistent results from the Justice Ministry website; I was able to submit the document, but I was not able to digitally sign it. And at first, I was annoyed because I&apos;m thinking, yeah, this is a crappy system,&#x201D; says Wagner. &#x201C;I was getting different results every time, from timeouts to errors to &#x2018;something didn&apos;t seem to work right, please try again later.&#x2019;&#x201D; The Justice Ministry on Dec. 19 formally announced that a Russian hack had taken a laundry list of critical government databases that had been put under the Justice Ministry offline. The databases contain sensitive information from property ownership to biometric data to tax records. Relevant Ukrainian offices quickly called it an act of war from Russia. &#x201C;The information space is one of the key directions of the enemy&#x2019;s attacks,&#x201D; wrote the State Communications Service, the national cybersecurity agency, in a statement provided to the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Russian hackers, who have become full-fledged participants in this war, are constantly getting better, improving their toolkits, tactics and strategy of operations.&#x201D; The statement contained no information on the technical details as to how the systems were compromised. XakNet, a hacking group previously tied to Russian intelligence, took credit for the attack, posting on Telegram data they claim to have hacked from the Ukrainian civil registry. The hackers claimed to have deleted at least some of the registry data. The Justice Ministry has since announced that all its state registries were ready to operate but that access to some registers was still limited, as their data still needs to be updated. Access to government services through the Diia app would be available in the near future, the ministry said on Jan. 20. The hack posed a major informational threat, highlighting how vulnerable government and Ukrainians&#x2019; personal data is to cyber attacks. In pushing to digitize its services quickly, the government also may have taken shortcuts that opened the door to digital onslaughts. Attacks of these kinds also erode public trust in the government, experts say. The core problem, as Wagner diagnoses, was the pace at which Ukraine rewired systems ranging from passports to tax payments into a single digital portal, all under the auspices of the Justice Ministry, in order to show positive results to foreign observers. &#x201C;It was very, very, very, very, very fast progress,&#x201D; says Wagner. &#x201C;And any IT project that has the heat on to make fast progress will cut corners where needed and save resources where needed with the best of intentions, which is meeting the deadlines and satisfying the requirements. (That) created not only a long string of vulnerabilities but also over-centralization in tech admin infrastructure.&#x201D; A woman uses her laptop as she takes shelter in a metro station during an air strike alarm in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Nov. 20, 2024, amid the Russian invasion. (Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)Mykyta Knysh, who formerly worked in cybersecurity for Ukraine&#x2019;s security services, the SBU, and currently runs the hacking collective &#x201C;HackYourMama,&#x201D; says the agencies involved should have known better. &#x201C;I understand that the Justice Ministry doesn&#x2019;t necessarily have to have this kind of expertise, but the State Office of Security and Communications, the Digital Transformation Ministry, the SBU &#x2014; they should have that expertise,&#x201D; says Knysh. Hardly the most eye-catching of Russia&#x2019;s military operations against Ukraine since the full-scale invasion, the attack nonetheless presents a serious threat to Ukraine&#x2019;s security. &#x201C;If the Russians occupy more territory they can use that information, maybe to threaten or blackmail or defraud people who fall under them,&#x201D; says Knysh. Knysh hails from Kupiansk, a town in eastern Kharkiv Oblast that currently lies within five miles of Russian positions. The registries attacked included information like individuals&#x2019; addresses and assets, as well as familial relationships. It is not yet known whether the hackers involved have actually re-written the information for certain civilians. Knysh fears the hackers may have forged digital identities to grant Russian agents access to the front. The hack &#x201C;provides opportunities for Russian intelligence to obtain additional information about Ukrainian military and civilian government employees, and identify vulnerable or otherwise suitable people in Ukraine who can be recruited or coerced into conducting espionage activities and sabotage,&#x201D; analysts at cybersecurity firm Flashpoint wrote in a comments to the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;However, more likely uses of such information include conducting future cyberattacks on other organizations in Ukraine using the information from public registries for reconnaissance, identity theft, social engineering, doxxing, harassment, and crafting convincing phishing emails,&#x201D; Flashpoint wrote.

(Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu via Getty Images)Oleh Burba, who works as a component leader for EU4DigitalUA and coordinates registry integration says that while anything is theoretically possible if Russians have the access, there is currently no confirmed information they have changed anything in the registries. Though any such impacts have yet to materialize, the attack has already proved a major inconvenience to civil society, which Wagner sees as the biggest issue. &#x201C;You attack the Justice Ministry and the day-to-day business of government cannot go on,&#x201D; says Wagner. &#x201C;Okay, nobody&apos;s going to die if I can&apos;t register my NGO. But it erodes confidence in the Ukrainian government.&#x201D; For Russia, Wagner considers it an extension of a propaganda war, similar to bombardments of Ukrainian national monuments. &#x201C;You don&apos;t need to hit strategic targets in a country. All you have to do is make it appear to be ungovernable.&#x201D; XakNet hackers also claimed to have destroyed backup data in servers in Poland. In its message the hacker group mocks Ukraine&#x2019;s government, saying: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s very telling to store government data on foreign storage &#x2014; that&#x2019;s what independence Ukrainian-style looks like, apparently.&#x201D; The systems affected were under the umbrella of massive digitalization of government services that has taken place under the administration of President Volodymyr Zelensky, particularly his Digital Transformation Minister Mikhailo Fedorov. This digitalization has been enormously popular, largely seen as reducing opportunities for low-level corruption among a patchwork of regional agencies ruled by unscrupulous bureaucrats. But cybersecurity experts question the wisdom of the technical centralization of these systems within one office, with Knysh jokingly dubbing Fedorov&#x2019;s agency the &#x201C;Digital Degradation Ministry.&#x201D; &#x201C;At the beginning of the full-scale invasion we realized that Ukraine&apos;s digital infrastructure was overly centralized, according to the old Soviet model,&#x201D; says Wagner. &#x201C;Centralization and single points of failure are a well-known anti-pattern. And it&apos;s highly vulnerable.&#x201D; &#x201C;My personal opinion was that (the hack) was through this system, &#x2018;Trembita,&#x2019;&#x201C; says Knysh. Trembita is a core data management system that provides the backend for government systems, specifically Diia, an app that has digitized government services like passports and tax paying. Knysh helped organize a hack on Russia&#x2019;s government services portal last year that among other impacts, immobilized digital voting. Independent hackers have been warning government agencies about the centralization of everyone&#x2019;s information under Diia since 2021. Trembita manages the digital communication between different registries. &#x201C;Trembita is a trip by rail,&#x201D; wrote Burba in an op-ed for Economic Pravda defending the system in May, describing the registries as cities, their digital links as railroads, and individual identifying codes as tickets. A mobile phone displays an error message for a marriage online on the &apos;Diia&apos; mobile app in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Sept. 10, 2024. (Viktor Fridshon / Global Images Ukraine / Getty Images)&#x201C;Trembita specifically in this situation was not damaged or broken, it functioned just as it should have functioned and protected the information exchange between these registries,&#x201D; Burba told the Kyiv Independent. Knysh is especially concerned that authorities provided no details on the hack, citing &#x201C;a whole monopoly on what they are saying.&#x201D; Given that hackers re-use hacking techniques, he was concerned for other nations. It&#x2019;s not a problem limited to the Zelensky cyber team and Digital Transformation Ministry. Having worked for the Ukrainian SBU under former president Petro Poroshenko&apos;s administration, Knysh says &#x201C;Poroshenko was almost just the same,&#x201D; and acknowledged the need for a stronger digitized and federalized system of managing data. &#x201C;Before Trembita, there was total chaos,&#x201D; says Knysh. &#x201C;But then they said &#x2018;you will have a government of smartphones&#x2019; and now we have a government of smartphones open to the SBU and HUR,&#x201D; he continued, referencing Ukrainian intelligence agencies. Hackers can find backdoors left open to governments, as for example a series of legal battles to compel Apple to extract data for U.S. intelligence agencies laid out. Officials are touting an overhaul, with Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna dubbing a pending rebuild into a &#x201C;Pentagon of registries.&#x201D; What exactly a &#x201C;Pentagon of registries&#x201D; means is unclear. For Wagner, it&#x2019;s fairly simple: &#x201C;Nothing.&#x201D; &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not an emotionally mature approach,&#x201D; says Wagner, miming beating her chest. &#x201C;I heard this (Pentagon of Registries) and I thought, &#x201C;Go out and say honestly, &#x2018;we don&#x2019;t know how to make a safe system.&#x2019;&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/massive-russian-hack-on-government-database-shows-cracks-in-ukraines-warp-speed-digitalization-drive/	2025-01-20T09:12:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/upd_GettyImages-2167201208.jpg
Trump sworn in as 47th US president	Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States in a ceremony held in the United States Capitol on Jan. 20. Vice President J.D. Vance took the oath of office alongside the president. Trump assumes office as the war in Ukraine enters its third year. While Trump initially vowed to end the war within 24 hours, his team later revised the timeline to 100 days, citing the intricate challenges of resolving the conflict. Ukraine remains cautious about the incoming administration, as Trump&apos;s past remarks on NATO and his perceived sympathies toward Russian President Vladimir Putin raise concerns about potential compromises unfavorable to Kyiv. During his first meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in December, Trump acknowledged Ukraine&apos;s desire for a ceasefire but avoided discussing specifics. Trump has pledged to meet with Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; and has tasked his aides with organizing a call. According to CNN, discussions for a face-to-face meeting are ongoing. Since his election victory on Nov. 5, Trump and his administration have sent mixed signals about their approach to peace. Trump&apos;s national security picks illustrate a range of perspectives on Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Tulsi Gabbard, nominated for director of national intelligence, has opposed U.S. support for Ukraine and faced criticism for echoing Russian narratives. Michael Waltz, the likely national security advisor, and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state nominee, are considered hawkish on Russia. Defense Secretary nominee Peter Hegseth, an isolationist, walked back earlier calls to scale back U.S. involvement in NATO during confirmation hearings, emphasizing the alliance&apos;s importance. Special envoy nominee for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg has co-authored a draft peace plan involving a frozen front line, a delay in Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership, and European peacekeepers in Ukraine. The plan also reportedly proposes continued U.S. military aid and security guarantees for Kyiv, though it partially lifts sanctions on Russia. Kellogg insists the proposals aim to &quot;save Ukraine and their sovereignty,&quot; not to appease Russia. Moscow has dismissed Trump&apos;s signals as &quot;unformed&quot; and reiterated demands for Ukraine&apos;s territorial concessions and NATO exclusion. Putin has expressed willingness for dialogue, though he maintains his insistence on Russia&apos;s terms, including complete control of four Ukrainian regions. Trump has urged European leaders to take a more active role in deterring Russian aggression, including deploying peacekeepers and pressuring China to influence Russia through trade measures. Officials close to Trump maintain that U.S. military aid to Ukraine will persist, focusing on empowering Kyiv to negotiate from a position of strength.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-sworn-in-as-47th-us-president/	2025-01-20T09:02:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194362623.jpg
Lithuania sends drones, thermal imagers, loaders in new Ukraine aid package, Defense Ministry says	Ukraine received a new military aid package from Lithuania, including domestically-produced drones, thermal imagers, and five-ton telescopic loaders, the Defense Ministry announced on Jan. 20. &quot;Keeping Ukraine safe means taking care of our security. We have as much time as Ukraine has,&quot; Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene said. The country has also removed bureaucratic barriers to expedite the delivery of support to Ukraine. Vilnius has committed to prioritizing air defense systems, ammunition, drones, and anti-drone weapons in its 2025 aid packages, along with funding Ukraine&apos;s defense industry to boost local production. Kyiv plans to spend a record $35 billion on arms production in 2025, of which $17 billion will be financed by the Ukrainian government, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Jan. 13. Lithuania has been a steadfast ally of Ukraine, pledging 0.25% of its GDP annually in military assistance. By October 2024, Vilnius had provided &#x20AC;840 million ($860 million) in aid, making it one of the top donors relative to GDP, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-sends-drones-thermal-imagers-loaders-in-new-ukraine-aid-defense-ministry-says/	2025-01-20T08:53:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/1-4.webp
Russia's primitive glide bombs are still outmatching Ukraine's air defenses, killing more civilians	When a glide bomb exploded at an industrial facility in Zaporizhzhia on Jan. 8, the 13 dead, and 122 injured marked the highest number of civilian casualties in a Russian attack on Ukraine in almost two years. Despite being one of the most primitive and numerous weapons in the Russian Air Force&apos;s arsenal, Ukraine&apos;s sophisticated, Western-supplied air defense systems are still ill-equipped to deal with the threat they pose. Compounding the problem, Russia continues to modify and adapt its glide bombs, increasing their range and destructive power, meaning more and more Ukrainian towns and cities are coming under threat. &quot;Aerial glide bombs have become one of the greatest threats to civilians in cities along the frontline,&quot; Danielle Bell, head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU), said in a statement on Jan. 9. &quot;They are also one of the main reasons why the number of killed and injured in 2024 increased by 30 per cent compared with 2023.&quot; According to HRMMU figures, Russian glide bombs killed 360 Ukrainian civilians in 2024, and injured 1,861, a threefold increase in fatalities, and a sixfold increase in injuries compared to 2023. A glide bomb is a standard air-dropped bomb modified with wings and often a satellite navigation system, so they can be launched from a distance rather than directly over a target. Their origins date back as far as World War II, and have been used in conflicts since including Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Russian glide bombs are often Soviet-era FAB weapons upgraded with a Unified Gliding and Correction Module (UMPK), which allows it to glide to its target, but Moscow is also developing newer, dedicated versions.

(Russian Defense Ministry / Handout / Anadolu via Getty Images)Russian forces employ various sizes of glide bombs weighing 250, 500, and 1,000 kilograms (kg). The most powerful in Russia&apos;s arsenal is the FAB-3000, a 3,000-kilogram high-explosive bomb, which the Russian Defense Ministry claimed in March had gone into mass production. In July, it released footage of what it said was a FAB-3000 being dropped on Ukrainian territory for the first time, saying it has a combat power that &quot;cannot be ignored.&quot; Crucially, converting an unguided &quot;dumb bomb&quot; into a glide bomb is cheap. Each conversion costs around $20,000, far less than cruise and ballistic missiles that cost millions of dollars to produce. Russian forces began using glide bombs against Ukraine in early 2023 to compensate for the lack of precision-guided munitions, dropping hundreds a week, according to figures from Kyiv.

(Ivan Samoilov / Gwara Media / Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Glide bombs are most effective against static targets, including &#x200B;&#x200B;bridges, command posts, bunkers, and weapons depots, and Russia has used them to great effect on the front lines as they advance slowly in eastern Ukraine. &quot;Despite many problems and shortfalls, the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) is learning, and adapting its tactics in a constantly changing combat environment,&quot; Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent. But Moscow has also used them to devastating effect against Ukrainian population centers, with Sumy, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts particularly hard hit. Glide bombs are highly-destructive, and incredibly difficult to shoot down. &quot;Glide bombs, unlike missiles, do not have a propulsion system, so they don&apos;t generate much heat and are therefore largely immune to interception by infrared homing missiles, like the AIM-9 Sidewinder, or the FIM-92 Stinger,&quot; Jacob Parakilas, research leader in RAND Europe&apos;s Defence, Security and Justice Research Group, told the Kyiv Independent. Parakilas said anti-aircraft guns like the German-made Gepard are more effective at shooting down glide bombs, but their short range makes them ineffective at policing the hundreds of miles of front line in Ukraine. &quot;The limited range of those systems means that they would have to be right on top of the target, and able to identify and open fire on it in a very short time window &#x2014; which is difficult even if sufficient numbers of those systems were available,&quot; he said. The range of the weapons also allows the Russian fighter jets that launch them to stay out of range of Ukraine&apos;s advanced air defense systems such as the U.S.-supplied Patriot. Ukraine did have a string of successes early last year, downing several Russian military planes of the types used to launch glide bombs. But positioning air defense assets so close to the front lines is risky, and after Russian forces allegedly managed to destroy two Patriot launchers in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine appears to have abandoned the tactic. &quot;Russia can exploit gaps in Ukraine&apos;s air defense, which is stretched thin and needs to cover a very large territory,&quot; Borsari said. Russia is constantly upgrading UMPK kits to increase the range and accuracy of its glide bombs. When interviewed by the Kyiv Independent in May of last year, experts said the range of glide bombs being used by Russia was &quot;generally considered not to exceed 50-60 kilometers.&quot; But in the months since, a number of modifications mean newer models can now fly up to 90 kilometers, placing many more Ukrainian civilians within their deadly reach.

(Yevhen Titov / Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Borsari said that particular attention should be paid to the relatively new and more advanced UMPB-D-30SN system which, in addition to wings and a guidance system, also has a small jet-propulsion engine which extends the glide bomb&apos;s range. Then there are the improvements to the electronic systems. Russian forces have been improving the navigation systems that guide the UMPK via satellite, allowing it to be more accurate. They are also often equipped with Kometa antennas which stabilize satellite communications signals, and are particularly resistant to electronic warfare countermeasures. In lieu of an effective means of targeting glide bombs in flight, experts say Ukraine&apos;s best options are to target both the planes that drop them, as well as the production and storage facilities they pass through before they&apos;re used. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s allies should prioritize speeding up the pipeline for delivering, supporting, and providing training for the crews of F-16s, which can target and push back the Russian jets dropping glide bombs,&quot; Parakilas said. The first General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons received by Ukraine fly on the Day of Ukrainian Air Force in an unspecified location, Ukraine, on Aug. 4, 2024. (Vitalii Nosach / Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)&quot;Adding other air defense fighters &#x2014; as France has promised to do with the Mirage 2000 and Sweden has considered with the Gripen &#x2014; would also help, although every new type of aircraft added increases the complexity of Ukraine&apos;s supporting infrastructure and supply chain,&quot; he added. Ukraine&apos;s long-running, long-range drone strike campaign has reportedly had successes targeting sites where Russia stores FAB bombs, most recently in a series of strikes last week. But their continued and widespread use suggests Ukraine can&apos;t currently destroy them at a rate quicker than Russia can produce them. &quot;In the long-term, another possibility is the use of directed-energy weapons, such as lasers, which are being developed and tested in various countries as a cost-effective countermeasure to aerial threats,&quot; Eken said. However, the widespread deployment of such weapons is far off, and in the meantime, more and more Ukrainian towns and cities are likely to come within range of Russia&apos;s ever-evolving glide bombs.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-primitive-glide-bombs-are-still-outmatching-ukraines-air-defenses-killing-more-civilians-2/	2025-01-20T07:00:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192463415.jpg
Putin congratulates Trump amid inauguration, signals readiness for talks	Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on his upcoming inauguration and expressed readiness for dialogue during a Russian Security Council meeting on Jan. 20. Putin emphasized his openness to engaging with the incoming Trump administration, including discussions related to Russia&apos;s war war against Ukraine. &quot;We are open to dialogue with the new U.S. administration on the Ukrainian conflict (Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine). The most important thing here is to eliminate the root causes of the crisis,&quot; Putin said. This comes as reported peace proposals, including freezing the front lines, have been publicly rejected by Russia. Putin previously stated that his country would begin peace negotiations if Kyiv agreed to withdraw from the four Ukrainian regions &#x2014; Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson &#x2014; that it partly controls. Trump has signaled his intent to meet Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; after taking office, according to CNN. While the Kremlin welcomed the remarks, it noted that no preparations for the meeting are currently underway. Trump&apos;s team is reportedly working on arranging a call with Putin shortly after the inauguration, with the goal of initiating a settlement plan for the war in Ukraine within the first months of his presidency. During his campaign, Trump pledged to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours, though his choice for Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, has since adjusted this timeline to 100 days.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-congratulates-trump-amid-inauguration-signals-readiness-for-talks/	2025-01-20T06:50:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1066818340.jpg
Commander of scandal-hit Ukrainian brigade detained, accused of failing to report desertions	The commander of a scandal-hit Ukrainian brigade has been detained, accused of failing to report violations in his unit, the State Bureau of Investigation said on Jan. 20. The 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Brigade was intended to be a flagship project for Ukrainian brigades trained and armed with the assistance of foreign partners. French President Emmanuel Macron announced in June that France would provide training and military supplies as part of this initiative. Despite Paris fulfilling its commitments for training and arms provision, an investigation led by Yurii Butusov, editor-in-chief of Ukrainian media outlet Censor.net, claimed soldiers of the unit, currently deployed near Pokrovsk, have suffered losses and gone AWOL (absent without leave) in large numbers due to poor command and organization within Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership. The State Bureau of Investigation launched an investigation into the unit on Jan. 3. In a statement on Jan 20, the bureau said the commander &quot;did not respond to violations in his unit, including the unauthorized abandonment of the military unit by his fighters.&quot; &quot;The commander also deliberately failed to perform other actions assigned to him by his official duties. In particular, during 2024, he did not send a single report to pre-trial investigation bodies regarding subordinate servicemen who committed criminal offenses,&quot; it added. If found guilty, the commander faces up to 10 years in prison. The 155th Brigade has about 5,800 troops, fewer than 2,000 of whom have undergone training in France. It is armed with French AMX10 armored vehicles, Caesar howitzers, and German Leopard 2A4 tanks, among other weapons. According to Butusov&apos;s investigation, the unit&apos;s founding was &quot;organizational chaos&quot; from the very beginning. Even before the training in France began, 2,500 service members were reportedly sent to other units, thus removing many of the most qualified personnel from the brigade. Of the 1,924 soldiers eventually sent to France, only 51 had more than a year of military service, while 1,414 had served for less than two months, Butusov wrote. The unit was also plagued by large numbers of soldiers going AWOL &#x2014; about 50 deserted in France, in addition to hundreds who left their posts even before the unit was deployed at the front, according to the journalist. Between March and November, over 1,700 soldiers had gone AWOL, Butusov reported. Though the unit was replenished with new recruits, these often did not undergo a &quot;proper selection process,&quot; the journalist added.	https://kyivindependent.com/commander-of-scandal-hit-ukrainian-brigade-detained-accused-of-failing-to-report-desertions/	2025-01-20T06:11:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-20-at-15_59_41.png
Trump sees peace in Ukraine as a deal but refuses to play his winning hand	The impending Donald Trump presidency has fueled market speculation that a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine could be reached soon &#x2014; bolstered by Trump&#x2019;s campaign trail rhetoric promising to end the war within days of taking office, if not sooner. Ukrainian Eurobonds have been among the best-performing assets in emerging markets in recent months, notably alongside Lebanon, another &quot;war or peace&quot; play. However, achieving a durable peace deal between Ukraine and Russia may not be as simple as Trump has implied &#x2014; a realization that seems to have dawned on him. His initial promise of peace within days has now been extended to six months. General Keith Kellogg, Trump&#x2019;s designated Ukraine envoy, has also tempered expectations, expressing hope for a breakthrough within the first 100 days of the Trump administration &#x2014; a timeframe that is likely to slip further. Does Trump actually have a peace plan for Ukraine? It&#x2019;s doubtful. The shifting deadlines for progress reflect this uncertainty. Trump and Kellogg don&#x2019;t appear to have a deep understanding of Ukraine, Putin, or European security. Ukraine&#x2019;s fate doesn&#x2019;t seem to rank high among Trump&#x2019;s priorities, which focus instead on &quot;Making America Great Again.&quot; Campaign promises to pull financial support for Ukraine resonated with voters when framed as reallocating resources to neglected U.S. communities. However, even if U.S. support for Ukraine is cut, it&#x2019;s unlikely those funds will find their way to disadvantaged Rust Belt communities. For Trump, Ukraine is a problem for Europe. His recent comments about U.S. territorial ambitions &#x2014; regarding Canada, Greenland, and Panama &#x2014; suggest his intent to extract a quid pro quo from Russian President Vladimir Putin for signing off on Russian territorial gains in Ukraine. Trump may be signaling that if he accepts Russia&#x2019;s terms, he expects something in return, such as turning a blind eye to a U.S. claim on Greenland. This mindset underscores Trump&#x2019;s transactional approach, with Ukraine at risk of being sold out in the process. While Kellogg and Mike Waltz, Trump&#x2019;s pick for national security adviser, might attempt to articulate a coherent strategy, it&#x2019;s unclear if Trump is aligned with their efforts. Trump holds significant leverage over Putin, particularly regarding Ukraine. Russia needs a deal more than the U.S. does. A prolonged war risks economic collapse from sanctions, potential Yevgeny Prigozhin-style military mutinies, and rising social unrest. While Ukraine also faces challenges &#x2014; manpower shortages and donor fatigue &#x2014; these are manageable compared to the risks for Putin. For the U.S., the cost of supporting Ukraine, at roughly $100 billion over three years (40% from the U.S.), is a fraction of the defense budget. Much of this spending benefits the U.S. directly through payments for American arms, often older equipment being replaced by modern upgrades. Additionally, the war has prompted NATO allies and Ukraine to ramp up U.S. arms purchases, while Europe is expected to increase defense spending by over $250 billion annually. The longer the war continues, the more the U.S. benefits economically while Russia&#x2019;s capabilities are depleted &#x2014; all without risking U.S. troops.

(Charly Truballeau/AFP/Getty Images)A more effective negotiating strategy for Trump would be to pressure Putin by threatening increased support for Ukraine or imposing harsher sanctions on Russia&#x2019;s economy &#x2014; steps that would come at minimal cost to the U.S. Trump could signal support for Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership or approve the use of long-range missiles capable of striking deep into Russia. He holds all the leverage. Yet, instead of using this leverage, the Trump administration appears to be giving it away to Putin. Trump has signaled no NATO membership for Ukraine, no long-range missiles, a halt to financial aid for Ukraine, and potential sanctions relief for Russia. Meanwhile, figures like Kellogg and Waltz have floated proposals to freeze front lines, effectively allowing Russia to retain the territory it currently occupies. Despite holding all the aces, Trump seems to have handed the game to Putin. For Ukraine, security is paramount in any peace deal. The country can survive losing the territories currently occupied by Russia, but its economic prospects depend on security guarantees. These could come through NATO membership, bilateral security assurances, or robust Western military and financial support akin to the U.S.-Israel relationship. However, Trump&#x2019;s concessions &#x2014; rejecting NATO membership and dismissing bilateral guarantees &#x2014; have shifted the debate to limiting Ukraine&#x2019;s defensive capabilities. Putin will exploit this to keep Ukraine vulnerable to future invasion, deterring investment and stalling reconstruction. The resulting insecurity would discourage millions of Ukrainian refugees from returning home, risking further emigration and domestic instability. Europe faces dire consequences if Ukraine collapses: waves of Ukrainian refugees, fueling far-right populism, and a bolstered Russian military-industrial complex. A resurgent Russia, emboldened by victory in Ukraine, might target the Baltics or Moldova next. Europe&#x2019;s security hinges on Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to defend itself as the front line against Russian aggression. Trump may not grasp the stakes for Europe, but European leaders must. With the U.S. stepping back, Europe must wake up to its existential threat from Russia and take responsibility for Ukraine&#x2019;s defense. A $150 billion annual price tag to support Ukraine is manageable for Europe&#x2019;s $25 trillion economy &#x2014; especially compared to the $250-$500 billion yearly increase in defense spending likely required if Ukraine falls. Unlocking the $330 billion in immobilized Russian central bank assets could provide Ukraine with significant financing. Additionally, Europe should appeal to Trump&#x2019;s economic priorities by framing support for Ukraine as a boon for U.S. jobs, branding it as the &quot;Trump Plan for the Defense of Europe&quot; or a modern Marshall Plan. Unfortunately, European leaders remain in denial, ignoring the risks of a Trump presidency and failing to connect the dots between Ukraine&#x2019;s security and their own. Ensuring Ukraine&#x2019;s stability isn&#x2019;t just about protecting one country&#x2014;it&#x2019;s about safeguarding the future of Europe as a whole.

China imports record amount of Russian crude oil in 2024, Reuters reports	Imports of Russian crude oil to China reached a record high in 2024, rising by 1% compared to 2023, Reuters reported on Jan. 20. The Russian fossil fuel industry is the primary economic driver of Moscow&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Despite sanctions and Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil production, China, the world&apos;s largest crude oil buyer, continues to import from Russia. According to China&apos;s General Administration of Customs, in 2024, 108.5 million metric tons were imported, including through pipelines and sea deliveries, equivalent to nearly 2.17 million barrels per day. Meanwhile, China has reduced supplies from Saudi Arabia by 9%. Saudi Arabia shipped 78.64 million tons, or about 1.57 million barrels per day, which is 1.72 million barrels per day less than in 2023. China has been reducing its imports from Saudi Arabia due to rising crude oil prices in the country and the growing share of oil from Russia and Iran at lower prices, according to Reuters. Yet, in the fourth quarter, Saudi Arabia&apos;s share of China&apos;s imports increased after Iran&apos;s supplies declined and prices of the OPEC oil cartel, which Russia is a member of, fell. China also imported 28% more than usual from Malaysia, the main transshipment center for sanctioned oil from Iran and Venezuela. In December, almost 295,000 tons were exported from Venezuela. This country&apos;s total volume of supplies in 2024 amounted to 1.5 million tons or 30,000 barrels per day. No oil imports from Iran were recorded for the whole of 2024. Total crude oil imports to China decreased by 1.9%. This is the first annual decline since the pandemic due to weak economic growth and lower demand for fuel, Reuters reported. China has deepened its ties with Russia since the start of the Kremlin&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, although Beijing has denied accusations of supporting Russia&#x2019;s military efforts. Mounting economic pressure has nevertheless forced many Chinese financial institutions to scale down their economic ties with Russia, fearing secondary sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/china-imports-record-amount-of-russian-crude-oil-in-2024-reuters-says/	2025-01-20T05:42:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1209343725--1-.jpg
I didn't know who I'd be fighting' — North Korean soldier captured by Ukraine speaks in new footage	President Volodymyr Zelensky released on Jan. 20 new footage of the interrogation of a North Korean soldier captured by the Ukrainian military. Ukrainian forces captured two North Korean soldiers in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast earlier in January. Both soldiers were injured but survived. The prisoner of war (POW) said he arrived in Russia on a cargo ferry with over 100 soldiers. He was not trained with Russian military equipment but claimed that several other North Korean soldiers were taught to do so. Communication between captured North Korean soldiers and SSU investigators continues. Intelligence data on the movement of such troops to Russian territory, their training and complete information isolation have been confirmed by the prisoners. All the facts about North&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/E2wiFlPBiw He joined the army at the age of 17 and served on conscript duty in a reconnaissance battalion and said his mother does not know where he is now. The POW said he did not know he was going to war or know who he would be fighting against. The full conversation conducted via a translator is as follows: Interrogator: Did you and other North Korean servicemen undergo training on the use of Russian weapons and military equipment? If so, where and when? POW/Translator: There were a few soldiers from North Korea who were trained to use heavy Russian equipment, but I personally did not undergo such training. Interrogator: Where did you serve? In which unit? POW: (I work) in a reconnaissance battalion. Interrogator: Does your mother know where you are? POW: No she doesn&apos;t. Interrogator: How many people were on the ship that transported you from North Korea to Russia? POW: Approximately over one hundred. Interrogator: What kind of ship was it? POW: I believe it was a Russian ferry, but not a military vessel &#x2014; just one for transporting cargo. Interrogator: Were only people on board or was there cargo as well? POW: It was only us. Interrogator: How many seats were in the train car you traveled in? POW: The same people who were on the ferry were also on the train &#x2014; there were no others, it was the same group. Interrogator: Were there beds in the carriage, how many? POW: There were six tables and beds. In total there were about 100 people. Interrogator: Tell us about the beginning of your service in the ranks of the North Korean armed forces. Specifically, when did you begin your military service? How did it happen and so on? Where did you serve? POW: Typically, after finishing school all men join the military. I also joined the army after finishing school and joined the reconnaissance division and stayed there for my entire service. Interrogator: How old were you when you started your service? POW: I was 17 years old. Interrogator: Are you serving under contract or conscription? POW: Not under contract, conscription. Interrogator: Do you voluntarily wish to give truthful testimony about the circumstances of your participation in hostilities against Ukraine? POW: First of all, as I&apos;ve already said, I didn&apos;t know before coming to Russia that I would be fighting here, in Russia and I didn&apos;t even know who we were fighting against. Interrogator: What do you know about the losses suffered by North Korean units during combat operations against the Armed Forces of Ukraine? In which battles, from what types of weapons, and how many casualties &#x2014; both wounded and irrecoverable? POW: There were a lot of casualties when I was there alone, starting from the battle on Jan. 3. Overall, it&apos;s hard to answer about such large-scale numbers. Interrogator: What did you know about the world outside of North Korea? POW: Not much. Interrogator: Did you know anything about South Korea? What did you know? POW: I only know that South Korea has fewer mountains than North Korea. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces against a Ukrainian incursion launched on Aug. 6. Ukrainian troops continue to operate in the region, leveraging their positions for potential future negotiations. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) estimates that North Korean casualties have reached 300 killed and 2,700 wounded, attributing the losses to inadequate training and ineffective counter-drone tactics. The NIS also reported that some North Korean soldiers have been forced to commit suicide to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby echoed these claims on Dec. 27, adding that captured North Korean troops fear severe retaliation against their families if they surrender.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-releases-new-footage-of-interrogation-of-north-korean-soldier-captured-by-ukraine/	2025-01-20T04:18:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-11_13-23-35.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, injure 5 over past day	Russian strikes against Ukraine killed two civilians and injured five over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 20. Russian forces launched 141 drones at Ukraine overnight from the Russian cities of Bryansk, Kursk, Orel, Millerovo, and Primosk-Akhtarsk, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Russia also struck Sumy Oblast with an Iskander-M ballistic missile from Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare units, mobile firing groups, and aviation shot down 93 drones in Kyiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kherson, Vinnytsia, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Donetsk, and Mykolaiv oblasts. Forty-seven drones were lost allegedly due to electronic warfare countermeasures. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 32 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, one person was killed, and two others were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Donetsk Oblast, one person was killed, and another one was injured in the town of Pokrovsk, while one person was also injured in the village of Mykolaivka due to Russian strikes, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Kharkiv Oblast, a 14-year-old girl was hospitalized due to injuries after a glide bomb attack against the village of Zolochiv, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. As a result of a series of strikes with aerial bombs, over 20 houses, outbuildings, and two cars were damaged.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-2-injure-5-over-past-day-2/	2025-01-20T03:13:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-20-11_31_48.jpeg
Russia launched nearly 550 drones, 60 missiles, over 660 aerial bombs against Ukraine in a week, Zelensky says	Russian forces launched around 550 attack drones, nearly 60 missiles of various types, and more than 660 aerial bombs against Ukraine during the past week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Jan. 20. Russia launched a mass aerial attack against Ukraine on Jan. 15, targeting Lviv, Kharkiv, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Khmelnytskyi oblasts. On Jan. 18, Russia attacked Kyiv with missiles, killing three people, and injuring three others. Over the week, the Ukrainian military shot down 33 missiles, including ballistic missiles, and 311 attack drones, according to Zelensky. Another 136 drones used in daily attacks on infrastructure &quot;did not reach their targets,&quot; the president added. &quot;I am very grateful to all our soldiers, military aviation, anti-aircraft gunners, electronic warfare units, and mobile fire groups. But the task remains unchanged &#x2014; continue strengthening our skies&apos; protection,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;More Patriot (air defenses) for Ukraine means more protection of life. More long-range capability for Ukraine means more guarantees that the Russian war will be stopped,&quot; he added. Ukraine has lobbied international partners for more air defense capabilities in the wake of intensifying Russian strikes targeting civilian and energy infrastructure. Ukraine is also reportedly working on developing its own air defense systems, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in an interview with the Ukrainian news outlet TSN on Jan. 19.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-nearly-550-drones-60-missiles-over-660-aerial-bombs-against-ukraine-in-a-week-zelensky-says/	2025-01-20T02:50:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/IMG_6575.jpeg
Trump instructs aides to arrange call with Putin 'in coming days' after inauguration, CNN reports	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has tasked his aides with organizing a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the days after he is sworn in, CNN reported on Jan. 19, citing undisclosed sources. Trump has previously said he wants to meet with Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; after his inauguration. The Kremlin welcomed Trump&apos;s comments, but added no preparations were currently underway for the meeting. According to CNN, Trump is willing to discuss a face-to-face meeting with Putin by phone in the coming months to try to end the war in Ukraine. Trump&apos;s national security team began preparing a phone call with Putin several weeks ago, but it is unclear whether a date has been finalized, CNN added. During the election campaign, Trump promised to end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours, though his choice for special Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, has since revised this to 100 days. The Trump team hopes to quickly begin work on a settlement plan that could be implemented within the first few months of his presidency. A meeting with Putin is part of the plan, according to CNN. Trump &quot;sees things differently,&quot; which could mean that negotiations with Putin will differ from the approach taken by the Joe Biden administration, the media outlet reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. At the same time, Trump has not spoken to Putin in almost three years. Trump has often voiced sympathies for the Russian leader while criticizing the level of support the outgoing Biden administration gave to Kyiv. This prompted concerns that the new U.S. leadership might cut a deal unfavorable to Ukraine. Kellogg said the president-elect&apos;s aim is not to &quot;give something to Putin or the Russians&quot; but to &quot;save Ukraine and save their sovereignty.&quot; Trump said that specific peace proposals are still being worked out. A pitch leaked from his team &#x2014; freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2014; has already been rejected by Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-instructs-aides-to-arrange-call-with-putin-in-coming-days-after-swearing-in-cnn-reports/	2025-01-20T01:41:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-872780694.jpg
Ukraine's Svitolina defeats Russian opponent to reach Australian Open quarterfinals	Ukrainian tennis player Elina Svitolina won her fourth match at the Australian Open on Jan. 20, defeating Russian neutral Veronika Kudermentova. Svitolina is the only Ukrainian to reach the quarterfinals in Melbourne, Australia. Prior to that, the 30-year-old defeated WTA No. 4 Jasmine Paolini, Romanian Sorana Cirstea, and American Caroline Dolehide. The match against Kudermetova lasted 1 hour and 23 minutes and ended with a score of 6-4, 6-1 in favor of the Ukrainian. Svitolina served five aces, and made three double faults. The Ukrainian tennis player also converted five out of nine break points. In the first set, Svitolina was down 1-4 but won the next five games and cruised to victory. &quot;I was just trying to fight, you know, for this fighting spirit,&quot; she said. &quot;I mean, the only thing I can do when things are not going your way, you just try to really put your head down and get back to work,&quot; she added. The Australian Open quarterfinals is a personal best for Svitolina. She also played at this stage in 2018 and 2019. &quot;That was a lifetime ago,&quot; Svitolina said during an interview after the match. &quot;You know, so many things happen &#x2014; having a daughter, Skai, then surgery as well. I&#x2019;m really pleased with the performance throughout this tournament,&quot; she added. Svitolina will face Madison Keys of the U.S., who defeated Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan, in the quarterfinals.	https://kyivindependent.com/svitolina-reaches-australian-open-quarterfinals-for-3rd-time-beating-neutral-athlete-from-russian/	2025-01-20T01:06:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194508112.jpg
Ukraine Air Force specialists safe from transfer to infantry but mobilization issues remain, Syrskyi says	Highly-trained Air Force specialists are protected from being transferred to front-line infantry units, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 19. Reports last week indicated that since 2024, thousands of Air Force soldiers have been transferred to the Ground Forces. Videos filmed by Air Force specialists themselves then surfaced, claiming their transfer to front-line units was &quot;a real challenge&quot; that could &quot;destroy the very foundation of our aviation.&quot; The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces on Jan. 14 said the transfer of some personnel is &quot;a necessary step&quot; to strengthen defense by reinforcing combat brigades with soldiers from other branches of the Armed Forces. But it stressed that Syrskyi prohibited the transfer of high-tech specialists and those trained abroad on foreign models of weapons and equipment. &quot;I have an order prohibiting the transfer of highly qualified personnel who have undergone training and specialize in aircraft maintenance,&quot; Syrskyi reiterated in an interview with journalist Andriy Tsaplienko. &quot;Clearly, these are specialists on whom money has been spent, who have gained experience, and who are practically irreplaceable,&quot; he added. But in a separate interview with Ukrainian news outlet TSN on Jan. 19, Syrskyi &#xA0;acknowledged that current mobilization efforts are not sufficient on their own to meet the needs of the armed forces. Fighting has intensified in Eastern Ukraine as Ukraine and Russia try to gain the upper hand in potential upcoming peace negotiations as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is set to be inaugurated on Jan. 20. &quot;We have needs at the front. We must increase the number of personnel in our mechanized brigades, &quot; unfortunately mobilization does not cover demand from the frontline, Syrskyi said.	https://kyivindependent.com/mobilization-currently-does-not-meet-frontline-needs-syrskyi-says/	2025-01-19T22:42:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2180021122.jpg

This number includes 1,690 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,821 tanks, 20,454 armored fighting vehicles, 34,488 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,074 artillery systems, 1,262 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,049 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 22,768 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-820-430-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-19T22:10:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/LEM_1024.jpg
Fire, explosions reported near aviation plant, airfield in Russia's Tatarstan amid drone attack	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A fire erupted in the city of Kazan in Russia&apos;s Tatarstan republic overnight on Jan. 20 amid a Ukrainian drone attack on the city, Russian Telegram channels reported. Videos posted to social media appear to show a large fire ablaze following a drone attack. Drones appear to be shown striking targets in the region. Rosaviatsiya, the country&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency, said that Kazan International Airport has suspended flights amid the attack. Begishevo airport, located east of the city in nearby Nizhnekamsk also had its flights suspended. Preliminary reports indicate that the explosions and fire originated in the Aviastroitelny district of the city, which is the home to an aviation college and several aviation factories. Russian Telegram media channels also reported that drones appear to be targeting Borisoglebskoye airfield which houses several fuel storage tanks. The Kyiv Independent cannot immediately verify the reporting. Multiple explosions were reported in the city around 5:30 a.m. local time, various Russian Telegram media channels reported. Kazan &#x2013; lying over 900 kilometers (560 miles) east of the Ukrainian border &#x2013; is located in the Russian republic of Tatarstan, which has previously been the target of Ukrainian drone strikes. Ukraine has regularly attempted to disrupt Russia&apos;s military supply-chain through the use of drone attack. The country&apos;s forces regularly target oil refineries that contribute to Russia&apos;s war effort. Overnight on Jan. 18, Ukrainian forces attacked oil depots in Russia&apos;s Tula and Kaluga oblasts, according to the General Staff and the Kyiv Independent&apos;s source in Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR).	https://kyivindependent.com/fire-reported-flights-suspended-amid-drone-on-russias-tatarstan/	2025-01-19T19:41:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-19_23-01-15.jpg
150,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine in 2024, Syrskyi says	Russian forces suffered their heaviest losses last year since the start of the full-scale war, with total military losses reaching 434,000 soldiers, including approximately 150,000 killed in combat during 2024, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in a Jan. 19 interview with the Ukrainian news outlet TSN. &quot;In this year of fighting, (Russian President Vladimir Putin) lost more than in the previous two years of the war (combined),&quot; Syrskyi said. As of Jan. 19, Russia has lost a total of 818,740 troops since the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported. The estimate, which is broadly in-line with estimates made by Western intelligence agencies, likely includes those killed, captured, wounded, and missing. Russia has gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast over the past year but at the cost of heavy casualties. Russian losses reached record highs in November and December, with a daily high of 2,030 troops lost in November, marking the highest daily loss since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures, though a Defense Ministry official recently let slip that the department received 48,000 requests to identify missing soldiers. According to a joint investigation by BBC Russia and Mediazona, journalists have identified the names of 88,726 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. According to the outlets&apos; conclusions for the year, 2024 will likely mark the &quot;war&apos;s deadliest year,&quot; with a current count of over 20,000 confirmed deaths over the past 12 months &#x2014; although final conclusions cannot yet be made as data on casualties continues to emerge. In December, President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed in a rare statement that Ukraine had lost 43,000 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. When asked during the wide-ranging interview about the Ukrainian losses, Syrskyi broadly replied that there were &quot;many times&quot; less Ukrainian losses than those sustained by the Russians. At the current rate of Russian military casualties, Russian losses are expected to surpass 1 million troops within six months.	https://kyivindependent.com/150-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine-in-2024-syrskyi-says/	2025-01-19T16:31:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/5-5.jpeg
Ammunition used by Russians halved following Ukrainian strikes, Syrskyi says	Russia&apos;s ammunition use has been cut nearly in half following the impact of Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in an interview with the Ukrainian news outlet TSN on Jan. 19. Ukraine has intensified strikes deep into Russian territory in an attempt to weaken Russia&apos;s ability to wage war in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;For several months now, the artillery ammunition expenditure rates in the Russian army have practically halved. If previously the figure reached up to 40,000 rounds per day, it is now significantly lower,&quot; Syrskyi said. Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory target &quot;industrial enterprises that produce ammunition, missile parts, or dual-use products are targeted for destruction,&quot; Syrsky said, adding that oil refineries serve as regularly military targets. Despite being regularly outgunned by Russian forces since the start of the full-scale war, Ukraine has managed to progress in arms production, with the country producing about 33-34% of its annual weapons needs &#x2014; up from less than 10% before the full-scale invasion, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 15. Europe and the U.S. supply more than 60% of Ukraine&#x2019;s weaponry, with each accounting for about 30%. Earlier in his interview, Syrskyi said that Ukraine is working on developing its own air defense systems, including ones that can repel the the Oreshnik missile. &quot;This encourages us to create our own air defense system, which would be not just an air defense system, but also an anti-missile system,&quot; Syrskyi said. &quot;The work is underway, it is being actively pursued in this direction. I hope that we will soon get the desired result for us,&quot; he added. Ukraine aims to spend a record $35 billion on weapons production in 2025, according to Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. The Ukrainian government intends to provide $17 billion, while the rest may be financed by allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/ammunition-used-by-russians-halved-syrskyi-says/	2025-01-19T15:13:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/photo_2024-02-08-22_12_44.jpeg
Zelensky, first lady visit wounded soldiers, pledge to address accessibility issues	President Volodymyr Zelensky and First Lady Olena Zelenska on Jan. 19 visited soldiers undergoing medical treatment after in Kyiv being wounded at the front and discussed issues related to mental health and disability access. The battlefield toll on Ukrainian soldiers has exacerbated mental health and accessibility challenges nationwide amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Zelensky met with soldiers that were injured while fighting in Pokrovsk, Kharkiv Oblast, and Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. &quot;We want to thank you for defending our country and our people, for your service across different fronts,&quot; the president said. &quot;Every front is important, and you served on the most challenging ones. You are our heroes, and we are deeply grateful to each of you.&quot; Wounded soldiers were presented with awards, including the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi. Zelensky and the first lady, alongside Veterans Affairs Minister Natalia Kalmykova, met with military medics and psychologists to discuss the steps the country has taken to combat the negative impact Russia&apos;s war has on mental well-being among Ukrainian soldiers. These include introducing operational combat stress control groups, developing psychological rehabilitation departments within hospitals, and increasing access to education in the field of psychology. Mental health support should be comprehensive and extend beyond injured soldiers, the first lady said. &quot;We need to ensure that support is comprehensive. For example, in hospitals, it should extend not only to wounded soldiers but also to their family members and the medical staff working in high-stress conditions,&quot; Zelenska said. Zelensky also highlighted the Movement Without Barriers project, an initiative piloting new wheelchair-accessible routes in 12 cities. The project is being implemented by the community and territorial development ministry as part of Zelenska&apos;s initiative.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-first-lady-visit-wounded-soldiers-in-hospital/	2025-01-19T13:39:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/zel.jpeg
Ukraine producing its own air defense systems, Syrskyi says	Ukraine is working on developing its own air defense systems, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in an interview with the Ukrainian news outlet TSN on Jan. 19. Ukraine has lobbied international partners for more air defense capabilities in the wake of intensifying Russian strikes targeting energy infrastructure. &quot;Back in Soviet times, we actually produced all the control systems for anti-aircraft systems. That is, we have the capacities and capabilities to create, and we are working on creating, our own domestic air defense complex,&quot; Syrskyi told TSN. Ukraine&apos;s homegrown system aims to match the U.S.-made Patriot air defenses, he said. Syrskyi said that the threat posed by Russia&apos;s new intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Oreshnik, is strong motivation for Kyiv to produce its own anti-missile air defenses. Only a few air defense systems can repel the Oreshnik, Syrskyi said, and Ukraine does not yet possess these capabilities. &quot;This encourages us to create our own air defense system, which would be not just an air defense system, but also an anti-missile system,&quot; he said. &quot;This encourages us to actively negotiate with our allies to get such a system. And, of course, this should encourage us to create a modern missile system that could be a deterrent against the use of such weapons by the Russians.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed that Western air defense systems are incapable of intercepting Oreshnik missiles, even going so far as to propose a &quot;high-tech duel&quot; with the West that would involve launching the Oreshnik at Kyiv. &#xA0; The U.S. operates the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), designed to intercept intermediate-range ballistic missiles. The system has not been supplied to Ukraine and, therefore, has never been tested against the Oreshnik. Syrskyi said in the interview that work had already begun on developing Ukraine&apos;s own anti-missile system. &quot;The work is underway, it is being actively pursued in this direction. I hope that we will soon get the desired result for us,&quot; he said. &#xA0; Ukraine aims to spend a record $35 billion on weapons production in 2025, according to Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. The Ukrainian government intends to provide $17 billion, while the rest may be financed by allies. The U.K. has agreed to finance production of air defense systems and long-range weapons in Ukraine, Umerov announced on Jan. 13.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-producing-its-own-air-defense-systems-syrskyi-says/	2025-01-19T12:16:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-524224272.jpg
The Week Ahead: Key Developments Impacting Global Politics & Markets	Editor&apos;s note: This article is an on-site version of KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter covering events from Jan. 20-Jan. 26. Sign up here to start your week with an agenda of Ukraine-related events, delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday. The global spotlight will be fixed firmly on Washington D.C. next week as Donald Trump is inaugurated as the 47th President of the United States on Jan. 20. This is perhaps the most anticipated event of the year, with allies and adversaries bracing for potential shifts in U.S. foreign policy and its impact on global power dynamics. On the same day, the 55th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum will start in Davos, Switzerland, centered around the theme &#x201C;Collaboration for the Intelligent Age.&#x201D; The forum will run from Jan. 20 to Jan. 24 and focus on adapting economies to anticipated geopolitical shifts and technological advances, including artificial intelligence. Additionally, European MEPs will gear up for the Jan. 20-23 plenary session at the European Parliament to address the ongoing repression in Belarus and vote on a resolution condemning Russia&#x2019;s disinformation and historical distortions used to justify its war against Ukraine. On Jan. 22, the Polish PM, Donald Tusk, will present the priorities of the Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union to the plenary of the European Parliament. The address is expected to focus on European security, emphasizing Polish strategic objectives during its tenure (Ukraine will be looking for indications of Poland&#x2019;s willingness to help fast-track its negotiation clusters and speeding up EU accession). On Jan. 22, Ukraine marks Unity Day, commemorating the 1919 unification treaty between the West Ukrainian People&#x2019;s Republic and Ukrainian People&#x2019;s Republic (the union lasted until 1921). This will be followed by a series of historical dates, culminating with the 3rd anniversary of the full-scale invasion on Feb. 24 and the war&#x2019;s entry into its 2nd decade on Feb. 27. The week will then be capped off by the Presidential &#x201C;election&#x201D; in Belarus on Jan. 26 with Alexander Lukashenko set for another five-year term. Due to the severe political repression in the country, major protests are unlikely. If you have an upcoming event that you would like featured in our newsletter, please get in touch via insights@kyivindependent.com.

Ukraine's General Staff launches investigation into 156th Brigade	Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi has directed the military to initiate an investigation into the 156th Separate Mechanized Brigade, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces announced on Jan. 19. The investigation comes on the heels of a state probe into the French-trained 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Mechanized Brigade. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Oleh Apostol will lead the investigation, the General Staff said in a social media post. &quot;The purpose of the work is to check the progress of the brigade&apos;s formation and provide comprehensive assistance in organizing and preparing for combat operations,&quot; the post read. Recent inspections of the 156th Brigade revealed &quot;a number of significant shortcomings,&quot; according to the military. Plans to address these problems include replacing the brigade&apos;s leadership, appointing a commander with practical combat and command experience, and transferring combat-tested officers and sergeants into the unit. Other necessary steps involve improving practical training for personnel and increasing training for drone pilots and electronic warfare operators. &quot;It should be noted that the mistakes that occurred during the formation and training of the 155th &apos;Anne of Kyiv&apos; Brigade have been taken into account, and measures are being taken to prevent them in the future,&quot; the General Staff said. The 156th Brigade is one of 14 new brigades formed by Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces in recent months. The newly formed brigades have faced front-line challenges and accusations of mismanagement &#x2014;&#xA0;particularly the 155th, the French-trained brigade at the center of a mass desertion scandal. Ground Forces Chief Mykhailo Drapatyi said on Jan. 8 that &quot;inadequate management,&quot; &quot;mistakes in recruitment,&quot; and &quot;imperfect training planning&quot; contributed to the problems with the 155th Brigade. The general&apos;s remarks followed a media investigation that claimed soldiers of the unit, deployed near the front-line hot spot Pokrovsk, suffered heavy losses and deserted in large numbers due to poor command and organization. The 155th Brigade was intended to be a flagship project for Ukrainian brigades trained and armed with the assistance of foreign partners. French President Emmanuel Macron announced in June that France would provide training and military supplies as part of this initiative.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-general-staff-launches-investigation-into-156th-brigade/	2025-01-19T11:09:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193363924.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine hits 2 oil depots in Russia overnight; Zelensky sanctions top pro-Russian politicians	Key developments on Jan. 19: Ukrainian forces attacked oil depots in Russia&apos;s Tula and Kaluga oblasts overnight on Jan. 18, according to the General Staff and the Kyiv Independent&apos;s source in Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR). The attack came amid an uptick in Ukraine&apos;s drone attacks on Russia, as Kyiv aims at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry, crucial for sustaining Moscow&apos;s war effort. The drones operated by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) hit the oil depot in Tula Oblast at least 10 times in this attack, a HUR source claimed. Tula Oblast, located south of Moscow, has regularly come under attack by Ukrainian drones. Tula Oblast Governor Dmitry Milyaev said that a fuel storage tank caught fire at &quot;one of the enterprises in the region.&quot; No casualties were reported. Videos posted on social media and shared by residents appear to show a large fire at an oil depot in the town of Uzlovaya in the region. Ukrainian soldiers also hit an oil depot in the Russian town of Lyudinovo in Kaluga Oblast overnight, causing a fire, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported. Lyudinovo lies around 200 kilometers (124 miles) north of the Ukrainian border. The oil depot is owned by Kaluganefteprodukt, a subsidiary of Russia&apos;s state-controlled oil company Rosneft, according to the statement. &quot;(This is) a logistics center that supplies units of the Russian armed forces directly involved in the war against Ukraine,&quot; the military said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree imposing new sanctions on pro-Russian politicians and propagandists, he announced on Jan. 19. &quot;We are blocking propagandists working for Russia, people who have gone over to the enemy&apos;s side, and those who help Russia continue the war,&quot; Zelensky said in a video address posted on Facebook. The decree puts into effect a decision made earlier by Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. Eighteen people were listed on the formal decree. Among them are prominent pro-Russian politicians Yuriy Boyko, Nestor Shufrych, and Yevhen Muraiev. Boyko previously led the former pro-Russian political party Opposition Platform &#x2014; For Life, which was banned by the Supreme Court following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Shufrych was arrested last year on charges of subversive activities against Ukraine and financing Russia&apos;s National Guard in occupied Crimea. According to the investigation, Shufrych paid Russia&apos;s National Guard to guard his elite real estate in Crimea, illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. Muraiev, former leader of the now-banned pro-Russian Nashi party, was charged with treason in 2023. The Security Service noted that Muraiev used his media empire, including the Nash TV channel, to disseminate pro-Russian narratives. Shortly before the start of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the U.K. Foreign Office warnedthat the Kremlin intends to install Muraiev as the head of the Russian puppet regime in Kyiv. Media reports have stated that Muraiev left Ukraine in 2022. Zelensky also noted that the country is working to deprive pro-Russian figures of state awards, specifically mentioning the Hero of Ukraine title. Last month, Ukraine&apos;s parliament voted to request that Zelensky strip the Hero of Ukraine award from Boyko. Boyko had days earlier repeated Russian propaganda talking points on social media about &quot;radicals&quot; controlling the streets in Ukraine. He was awarded the title Hero of Ukraine in 2004 during his tenure as head of Ukraine&apos;s state-owned oil and gas company Naftogaz. Twenty days into her new post as Ukraine&apos;s new military rights commissioner, Olha Reshetylova said that she had already received 3,876 appeals. In what she described as a preliminary assessment in a Facebook post about her first days on the job, Reshetylova said that lack of treatment and referrals to military medical commissions and problems moving between military units are the two leading causes for the appeals she received. More than 3,500 of the appeals have been relevant to her post and concern protecting the rights of soldiers. A portion of these concerning advice or clarification, which she referred to lawyers working &quot;almost around the clock.&quot; &quot;The rest of the appeals are substantive. Although each of them has its own individual problems, in general, of course, you can already see trends and separate blocks of problematic issues,&quot; Reshetylova wrote. While acknowledging that requests for medical treatment can be abused and that commanders face a &quot;catastrophic&quot; personnel shortage, she noted cases where commanders had denied referrals for treatment of injuries, urgent and planned operations, acute PTSD or panic attacks, and symptoms of severe concussions. Regarding military unit transfers, servicemembers were promised in November a more efficient way for transfering between units using the Army+ app. However, she wrote, &quot;very often commanders do not carry out the transfer order or specifically transfer servicemen against their will to other positions, which complicates the execution of the order.&quot; &quot;Now we&apos;re also solving these issues manually, where we have time. But it&apos;s obvious that we need to look for a systemic solution,&quot; Reshetylova wrote. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry announced in April that it would create the new military ombudsman position to ensure soldiers had a way to report violations of their rights. Ukrainian forces launched an aerial attack against a Russian-occupied refractory plant in the embattled city of Chasiv Yar, Lieutenant Colonel Dmytro Zaporozhets, spokesperson for the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Jan. 18. The attack confirms earlier reports that Ukrainian troops had withdrawn from the plant. &quot;On the territory of the refractory plant, the enemy tried to gain a foothold, attacking in small and medium groups,&quot; Zaporozhets said during a television broadcast. &quot;Thanks to coordinated actions ... (occupying Russian troops) were discovered in one of the premises on the territory of the refractory plant and an air strike was carried out. The enemy suffered losses.&quot; The Ukrainian news outlet Ukrainska Pravda posted a video, obtained from the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, depicting the strike against the plant. In the past week, Russian military bloggers alleged that Russian forces had pushed Ukrainian troops out of the refractory plant in Chasiv Yar. The crowd-sourced monitoring website Deep State also reported on Jan. 12 that Russia had occupied the site. The plant served as reliable fortification for Ukrainian forces, who must now shelter in residential buildings weakened by constant shelling. A Kyiv Metro engineer allegedly let a network of agents who helped direct Russian missile and drone attacks against the capital and Kharkiv Oblast, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced on Jan. 18. The announcement coincides with multiple reports from Ukrainian law enforcement agencies on Jan. 18 exposing alleged instances of treason and plots to aid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. The agents tracked the movement and positions of Ukrainian troops in order to coordinate Russian aerial attacks, the SBU said. Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service recruited the network leader, a Kyiv Metro engineer, during a meeting in Moscow in 2015, according to the SBU. After the full-scale invasion in 2022, he was instructed to create a network of agents who would monitor the activitiy of Ukrainian troops and cargo. The leader also personally directed Russian missile strikes on Kyiv, according to intercepted conversations. SBU officers have detained the alleged leader in Kyiv and another suspected agent in Kharkiv. During the investigation, officers seized cell phones that they said contain evidence of collaboration with Russia, along with four firearms. Both suspects have been charged with high treason in conjunction with the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. A third suspect, currently in hiding abroad, may also be charged.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-hits-2-oil-depots-in-russia-overnight-zelensky-sanctions-top-pro-russian-politicians/	2025-01-19T09:55:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1249556007.webp
As Trump prepares to take office, Kyiv awaits his team's next moves	As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office on Jan. 20, Ukraine&apos;s fate hangs in the balance. While some potential details of Trump&apos;s future peace proposals have been leaked, the overall plan still remains unclear. Since the Nov. 5 presidential election, Trump and his team have sent mixed signals on whether their potential peace proposals will be favorable to Ukraine. Based on their public statements, Trump and his team have realized the complexity of the conflict and revised the timeline for achieving a peace deal. Previously, Trump talked about a 24-hour deadline, but now it has become a six-month timeframe. &quot;Over the past month and a half, they have realized that the contradictions between Ukraine and Russia are quite deep and complex,&quot; Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This problem cannot be resolved quickly or with a simplistic approach. They are adjusting their approaches and deciding how to move forward.&quot; Jenny Mathers, a lecturer in international politics at the U.K.&apos;s Aberystwyth University, said that &quot;Trump wants an end to the war and he wants credit for achieving it.&quot; &quot;So we should expect plenty of drama and bold statements, perhaps backed up by bold actions,&quot; she added. &quot;But would those bold actions favor Russia or Ukraine? There are signs pointing both ways. Trump clearly admires (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and finds his statements persuasive. But Trump also wants to be seen as strong in his own right, so he might react badly to any suggestion that he is acting as Putin&apos;s pawn.&quot; President-elect Trump has nominated people with polar views on Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Tulsi Gabbard, Trump&apos;s nominee for director of national intelligence, has opposed U.S. support for Ukraine and had previously been accused of promoting Russian narratives. Peter Hegseth, Trump&apos;s pick for defense secretary, is an isolationist who has called for reducing the U.S. commitment to NATO. He backtracked his statements during confirmation hearings, saying that the U.S. won&apos;t leave the alliance and that &quot;we know who the good guy is&quot; in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Michael Waltz, who is expected to become Trump&apos;s national security advisor, and Marco Rubio, Trump&apos;s pick for secretary of state, are seen as more pro-Ukrainian and hawkish on Russia than other nominees. Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s nominee for special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, is also seen as more favorable to Kyiv. He has stated that Ukraine should negotiate from a position of strength. Kellogg has co-authored a peace plan that would freeze the front line in Ukraine, take Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession off the table for an extended period, and partially lift sanctions imposed on Russia. According to his proposals, the U.S. will continue sending military aid to Ukraine and provide security guarantees to Kyiv to prevent further Russian aggression. The Telegraph also reported on Nov. 7 that, under one of the peace plans being considered by Trump, he might call on British and other European troops to enforce a buffer zone that the president would attempt to establish in place of the current front line in Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer (L) and French President Emmanuel Macron (R), at the Elysee palace for a working meeting in Paris, France, on Thursday, Aug. 28, 2024 (Benjamin Girette/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Meanwhile, Rubio said on Jan. 15 that both Ukraine and Russia would have to make concessions to end the war. &quot;Any quick deal (even over six months) would likely end the fighting along the current line of control while ensuring that Ukraine has long-term protections and that Russia has financial/economic incentives to stop fighting,&quot; Michael O&apos;Hanlon, a foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Beyond that, I&apos;m not sure what the Trump team plans.&quot; As the specific details of Trump&apos;s peace plan remain unclear, its timeframe has been shifting. Trump said on Jan. 7 that peace would be achieved within six months. Kellogg said that a concrete plan needs to be established within the administration&apos;s first 100 days. Stephen Biddle, a defense policy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;the longer six-month timeline is Trump&apos;s effort to weasel out of an unrealistic promise.&quot; Thomas Graham, a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, also said that &quot;the team has just realized that it will take more time and effort to reach a deal.&quot; &quot;The fact that (Trump) and his team have stepped back from insisting he will end the war in 24 hours to talking about a process that will take months is encouraging and in keeping with his and his team&apos;s practice of walking back some of his most flamboyant campaign promises to manage expectations among voters,&quot; Mathers said. The revised policy may also have had an impact on Trump&apos;s special envoy, Kellogg. Zelensky said on Dec. 19 that Kellogg would visit Ukraine before Trump&apos;s inauguration in January. However, Kellogg postponed his visit until after the inauguration due to U.S. restrictions on unauthorized negotiations by private citizens with foreign governments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said on Jan. 10. &quot;Kellogg postponed his visit because they may have started to realize that the idea of ending the war in 24 hours, or even within six months, is too ambitious and complicated,&quot; Oleksandr Merezhko, head of Ukrainian parliament&apos;s foreign affairs committee, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;They are now more realistic and are slightly adjusting their strategy.&quot; Some statements made recently by Trump and his allies appear to point in the direction of a peace deal from a position of strength. &quot;I want to reach an agreement and the only way you&apos;re going to reach an agreement is not to abandon Ukraine,&quot; Trump said in an interview with the Time magazine published on Dec. 12. Kellogg said on Jan. 8 that the president-elect&apos;s aim is not to &quot;give something to Putin or the Russians&quot; but to &quot;save Ukraine and save their sovereignty.&quot; Meanwhile, the Financial Times reported on Jan. 9, citing two European officials, that U.S. assistance to Ukraine would persist following Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20. &quot;The whole (Trump) team is obsessed with strength and looking strong, so they&apos;re recalibrating the Ukraine approach,&quot; one official said. The official added that Trump&apos;s camp is cautious about avoiding comparisons with President Joe Biden&apos;s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, which they do not want to see replicated in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky pictured in Bucha, Kyiv Oblast, on March 31, 2023. (Photo: President&apos;s Office)Trump advisors are also developing a comprehensive strategy to impose sanctions on Russia to pressure it towards a peace deal, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 16, citing anonymous sources familiar with the discussions. &quot;I don&apos;t think Trump wants to appear weak relative to Putin, or to be responsible for &apos;losing Ukraine&apos; the way the Biden &apos;lost&apos; Afghanistan,&quot; Roland Paris, a professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;He wants to be seen as a peacemaker who ends, rather than starts, wars &#x2014; and that he wants to look &apos;strong&apos; in doing so.&quot; Biddle said that &quot;the only way (Trump) could end this war as quickly as he promised in his campaign is if he could get Ukraine to surrender.&quot; &quot;I doubt that Trump fancies having an outright defeat in Ukraine get labeled as &apos;Trump&apos;s Afghanistan&apos; &#x2014; not a good look for someone as obsessed with winning as he is,&quot; he added. But some of Trump&apos;s statements point in the opposite direction. He claimed on Jan. 7 that Biden&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership had led to the war. He also claimed, without any evidence, that there had been a deal that Ukraine would not join the alliance. &quot;They had a deal (not to let Ukraine into NATO), and then Biden broke it,&quot; Trump said. Mathers argued that &quot;if Putin is able to persuade (Trump) that the only path to a stable peace is by Russia getting all of its demands met, there is a real danger that Trump will agree to support that position.&quot; &quot;The experience of his first term as president suggests that he is impatient and not good at nurturing the kind of process that would be required to move from the current situation to a stable peace. This may not be good news for Ukraine,&quot; she added. Mathers also said that &quot;Trump seems more attracted by the simple solution to a problem than trying to work through complexity, such as what kind of a meaningful security guarantee for Ukraine would the U.S. be willing to support.&quot; Biddle said that &quot;to get a deal that doesn&apos;t look like a sellout, Trump will probably have to threaten a major expansion in U.S. support for Ukraine unless Putin compromises and that will be both risky and counter to the increasing anti-Ukrainian sentiment among Trump&apos;s base.&quot; &quot;So, I suspect that Trump may stall and try to change the subject rather than facing the uncomfortable choice between midwifing an embarrassing defeat and threatening an expensive and unpopular escalation,&quot; he added. But even if Trump&apos;s peace proposals favor Ukraine rather than Russia, a lot depends on Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin&apos;s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Jan. 10 that the Kremlin &quot;welcomed&quot; Trump&apos;s &quot;readiness&quot; for talks but added that plans for any face-to-face meeting would not be drawn up until after his inauguration. Trump also said on Jan. 13 that he planned to meet Putin &quot;very quickly,&quot; adding that the Russian leader &quot;wants to meet&quot; as well. &quot;I actually find the prospect of a face to face meeting between the two men very alarming, especially if no other comparable political figures are present,&quot; Mathers told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We know that Trump admires Putin as the archetype of the strong man leader that Trump himself aspires to be.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin during a news conference in Helsinki, Finland, on July 16, 2018. (Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images)She added that, after a meeting between Putin and Trump at the 2018 Helsinki summit, &quot;Trump emerged looking beaten down and Putin was full of smiles.&quot; &quot;Everything Trump said at the press conference immediately afterward suggested that Putin got whatever he asked for, or at least persuaded Trump to echo Russian talking points in public,&quot; she added. The Helsinki meeting, conducted on the backdrop of the revelations that Russia had meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, had drawn criticism from both Republicans and Democrats. Russia has so far refused to agree to any compromise. Putin said in June 2024 that Moscow would only agree to a ceasefire and enter peace talks if Ukrainian troops withdraw from Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts. Ukraine maintains control of the regional capitals of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, holds a substantial part of Donetsk Oblast, and maintains a foothold in Luhansk Oblast. The Kremlin&apos;s other demands include the lifting of Western sanctions against Russia, Ukraine&apos;s refusal to join NATO, &quot;demilitarization&quot; &#x2014; most likely implying the decrease in the number of Ukrainian military personnel &#x2014; and &quot;denazification&quot; &#x2014; a likely reference to restrictions on nationalist parties and giving Russia an ability to bolster pro-Russian parties in the country. Meanwhile, Zelensky signed a decree on Jan. 19, imposing new sanctions on the country&apos;s pro-Russian politicians and propagandists. &quot;We are blocking propagandists working for Russia, people who have gone over to the enemy&apos;s side, and those who help Russia continue the war,&quot; Zelensky said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Dec. 29 that the Kremlin was dissatisfied with the reported peace proposals on Ukraine from Trump&apos;s team. Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) chairs a meeting regarding the situation in the Kursk region, in his residence in Novo-Ogaryovo outside Moscow, Russia on Aug. 12, 2024. (Gavriil Grigorov/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)&quot;Experts... tend to concur that Russia will not begin to face extremely tough constraints on its war effort during 2025, certainly not over the six months we&apos;re talking about,&quot; William Wohlforth, a professor focusing on international relations at Dartmouth College, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Hence, most do not expect Putin to be in the mood to make any kind of reasonable concessions.&quot; He said, &quot;The real question is, what does the Trump administration do when it discovers this?&quot; &quot;I&apos;m sure Trump really does want a deal, and I&apos;m sure he&apos;s prepared to use U.S. aid conditionality as a lever with Kyiv to get one,&quot; Biddle said. &quot;The problem here is Putin, who seems unlikely to accept anything that isn&apos;t actually tantamount to a Ukrainian surrender.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s position appears to be the opposite of Russia&apos;s demands. Zelensky&apos;s peace formula envisages punishing those responsible for war crimes, withdrawing all Russian troops from the territory of Ukraine, restoration of Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity, and the release of all prisoners of war and deportees. Mathers said that &quot;the most difficult element to resolve will be providing Ukraine with meaningful security guarantees, and without this in place, I assume that Kyiv would be very reluctant to agree to a peace deal.&quot; &quot;It is also important to remember that Ukraine will have a voice in this process,&quot; Graham said. &quot;There will be no deal without Kyiv&apos;s approval. While Washington might have leverage over Kyiv, it lacks the ability &#x2014; and I would imagine the will&#x2014; to impose a deal on Kyiv. What is (Ukraine) prepared to concede in order to achieve a lasting peace?	https://kyivindependent.com/as-trump-prepares-to-take-office-kyiv-awaits-his-teams-next-moves/	2025-01-19T09:36:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194069797.jpg
Fico accuses Slovak opposition leader of 'kissing Zelensky's ring'	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico accused opposition leader Michal Simecka of &quot;kissing Zelensky&apos;s ring&quot; during his recent visit to Kyiv and said the MP wanted to stage a coup d&apos;etat in Bratislava. Simecka, the pro-Western leader of the Progressive Slovakia party, headed a delegation of Slovak opposition MPs on a visit to Kyiv Jan. 17. The aim of the visit was to &quot;reopen the door that Robert Fico slammed with his aggressive outbursts,&quot; Simecka said. In an address posted to Facebook late on Jan. 18, Fico said the delegates were &quot;kissing (President Volodymyr) Zelensky&apos;s ring&quot; and &quot;promising him support for Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO.&quot; Fico said the opposition wanted to stage a coup and alluded to Ukraine&apos;s EuroMaidan revolution in his accusation. &quot;We are preparing for all possible alternatives,&quot; he said. &quot;We will be ready for everything. Especially for Maidan, that is, a coup d&apos;etat across the street, which the opposition, especially Progressive Slovakia, is so tenaciously trying to achieve.&quot; Fico, a pro-Russian politician who has long opposed military aid to Ukraine, has escalated threats against Kyiv following the termination of Russian gas transit via Ukrainian territory on Jan. 1. &#xA0;He has threatened to limit aid to Ukrainians and cut off electricity supplies amid an energy crisis brought on by Russia&apos;s relentless attacks against Ukraine&apos;s power grid. As tensions mount, Zelensky and Fico have signaled they may hold talks in the coming days. Fico told reporters on Jan. 16 that he might meet with Zelensky at an unspecified location in the &quot;next few days.&quot; Zelensky on Jan. 17 invited Fico to visit Kyiv. &#xA0; In his address, Fico showed no signs of softening his rhetoric against Ukraine. &quot;Robert Fico is the Slovak Prime Minister, not a Ukrainian servant,&quot; he said. The prime minister said he would likely veto future financial aid to Ukraine from the European Union and reiterated his opposition to Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership. &quot;The government I lead will never support Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO, because it would only lead to World War III,&quot; Fico said. &quot;The government will also never propose sending soldiers to Ukraine to turn their weapons against the Russian Federation.&quot; Fico&apos;s friendliness towards the Kremlin has sparked outrage both at home and abroad. His meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in December drew condemnation from other European leaders. Mass protests erupted in Bratislava in early January, with thousands chanting &quot;We are not Russia.&quot; A coalition of Slovak opposition parties announced on Jan. 14 that they planned to initiate a vote of no confidence in Fico&apos;s government.	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-accuses-slovak-opposition-leader-of-kissing-zelenskys-ring/	2025-01-19T09:01:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1957977106.jpg
Syria bans goods from Russia, Iran, Israel	Syria&apos;s new administration has banned all Russian, Iranian, and Israeli goods from entering the country in a new decree issued by the country&apos;s finance minister on Jan. 17. Any relevant goods discovered at land and sea border crossings will be confiscated, according to the ban, reported regional media outlets. The decision came shortly after the country had restricted entry of Iranian and Israeli passport holders. Ukraine has moved quickly to restore ties with Syria after rebels overthrew the Russia-backed regime of former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad on Dec. 8. Last month, Ukraine&apos;s foreign minister Andrii Sybiha visited Syria, marking the first official Ukrainian delegation to Syria in years. During the trip, he said he hoped to increase trade with Syria. As the new Syrian government looks to establish itself and reset foreign relations with its former partners and adversaries, the trade ban may exacerbate tensions in the region and impact trade.	https://kyivindependent.com/syria-bans-goods-from-russia-iran-and-israel/	2025-01-19T07:53:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188252219.jpg
Lack of medical treatment, problems with unit transfers are most common causes of appeals, new military ombudsman says	Twenty days into her new post as Ukraine&apos;s new military rights commissioner, Olha Reshetylova said that she had already received 3,876 appeals. In what she described as a preliminary assessment in a Facebook post about her first days on the job, Reshetylova said that lack of treatment and referrals to military medical commissions and problems moving between military units are the two leading causes for the appeals she received. &#xA0; More than 3,500 of the appeals have been relevant to her post and concern protecting the rights of soldiers. A portion of these concerning advice or clarification, which she referred to lawyers working &quot;almost around the clock.&quot; &quot;The rest of the appeals are substantive. Although each of them has its own individual problems, in general, of course, you can already see trends and separate blocks of problematic issues,&quot; Reshetylova wrote. While acknowledging that requests for medical treatment can be abused and that commanders face a &quot;catastrophic&quot; personnel shortage, she noted cases where commanders had denied referrals for treatment of injuries, urgent and planned operations, acute PTSD or panic attacks, and symptoms of severe concussions. In one appeal that she cited, a serviceman with HIV voluntarily mobilized at the start of the war, but has since developed bleeding ulcers and faces worsening health effects. The soldier received a referral for surgery but was threatened with a desertion complaint if he left. While Reshetylova said she is personally calling commanders in some cases to address the issues, &quot;attention to the health of a serviceman should become a priority for both military doctors, unit commanders, and the entire system as a whole,&quot; she said. &quot;It is not difficult to understand that in such a state the effectiveness of performing combat missions is low, and the mortality rate among servicemen due to diseases will grow. In addition, in the case of untreated mental disorder, a serviceman can pose a danger either to himself or to his comrades,&quot; Reshetylova wrote. Regarding military unit transfers, servicemembers were promised in November a more efficient way for transfering between units using the Army+ app. However, she wrote, &quot;very often commanders do not carry out the transfer order or specifically transfer servicemen against their will to other positions, which complicates the execution of the order.&quot; &quot;Now we&#x2019;re also solving these issues manually, where we have time. But it&#x2019;s obvious that we need to look for a systemic solution,&quot; Reshetylova wrote. The third largest category of appeals comprised of questions from relatives of prisoners of war missing soldiers, according to Reshetylova. &#xA0; Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry announced in April that it would create the new military ombudsman position to ensure soldiers had a way to report violations of their rights. The ombudsman &quot;will be responsible for considering appeals and complaints of service members, providing primary legal assistance, conducting inspections, and investigating violations of the rights of service members and their families,&quot; the Defense Ministry said at the time. Reshetylova previously co-founded and headed the Media Initiative for Human Rights, which has investigated war crimes related to the Russian war in Ukraine since 2016 and advocates for changes in government policies and social practices related to protecting human rights.	https://kyivindependent.com/lack-of-medical-treatment-and-problems-with-unit-transfers-are-most-common-causes-of-appeals-to-new-military-obudsman/	2025-01-19T06:12:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1240353607-1.jpeg
Zelensky imposes new sanctions on pro-Russian propagandists	President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree imposing new sanctions on pro-Russian propagandists, he announced on Jan. 19. &quot;We are blocking propagandists working for Russia, people who have gone over to the enemy&apos;s side, and those who help Russia continue the war,&quot; Zelensky said in a video address posted on Facebook. The decree puts into effect a decision made earlier by Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. He also noted that the country is working to deprive them of state awards, specifically mentioning the Hero of Ukraine title. Last month, Ukraine&apos;s parliament voted to request that Zelensky to strip the Hero of Ukraine award from parliamentary member Yuriy Boyko. Boyko had days earlier repeated Russian propaganda talking points on social media about &quot;radicals&quot; controlling the streets in Ukraine. Boyko previously led the former pro-Russian political party Opposition Platform &#x2014; For Life, which was banned by the Supreme Court following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. He was awarded the title Hero of Ukraine in 2004 during his tenure as head of Ukraine&apos;s state-owned oil and gas company Naftogaz. &quot;There are still many names in the request for the revocation of awards,&quot; lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said after the parliamentary vote.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-imposes-new-sanctions-on-pro-russian-propagandists/	2025-01-19T05:28:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156503093.jpg
Slovenia provides Ukraine's State Emergency Service with specialized demining, transport vehicles	Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service announced Jan. 18 that it received three specialized demining vehicles from Slovenia. The vehicles, Cossack PM-L specialized off-road trucks, can be used for demining and for transporting equipment and explosive objects. The transfer was completed with financial support from the Slovenian government and with assistance from the UNITED24 platform, which connects and coordinates raising funds for Ukraine. &quot;This will help significantly reduce the risks to the lives of our sappers and make the process of explosives disposal faster and more reliable,&quot; said the head of the State Emergency Service Andrii Danyk. &quot;We are grateful for your support, which allows us to work more efficiently even in war conditions.&quot; Last month, Slovenia pledged to continue providing significant support to Ukraine during a two-day ministerial NATO meeting in Brussels. &quot;Slovenia provides significant support to Ukraine in the form of material, humanitarian, and military aid and will continue to do so as long as it is necessary,&quot; Slovenia&apos;s Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon told journalists.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovenia-provides-ukraines-state-emergency-service-with-specialized-demining-and-transport-vehicles/	2025-01-19T04:41:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-19-at-2_05_50-PM.png
Officials believe Baltic Sea cable damage caused by accidents, not Russian sabotage, WP reports	Amid a series of incidents that have damaged critical cables in the Baltic Sea, intelligence services in the U.S. and Europe are increasingly convinced that they were caused by accidents, according to a report by the Washington Post on Jan. 19. The incidents had raised fears that Russian shadow fleet vessels were intentionally sabotaging the energy and communication lines. As a result, NATO dispatched additional patrol ships to the area earlier this month. The Washington Post report cited senior officials from three countries involved in investigating the cause of the incidents, who said they found no evidence that the ships suspected of dragging anchors across the cables were directed by Moscow or that they damaged the cables intentionally. The officials instead noted that intercepted communications and classified intelligence pointed to maritime accidents as the likely cause. Russia, NATO countries, and the Baltic Sea Region. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)The events had heightened tension between Russia and Europe, as Russian activities have been linked to intensifying hybrid warfare attacks across the continent, including cyberattacks, espionage, and election interference. Earlier this week, the New York Times reported that U.S. officials warned Russian President Vladimir Putin not to carry out plan plans to smuggle incendiary devices onto U.S.-bound cargo planes. Intelligence sources suspect Russia was behind similar cases last summer when packages mailed by individuals caught fire in warehouses in Germany and the U.K.	https://kyivindependent.com/officials-increasingly-believe-baltic-sea-cable-damage-caused-by-accidents-not-russian-sabotage-washington-post-reports/	2025-01-19T04:04:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1258782719.jpg
Ukraine downs 43 Russian drones overnight, Air Force reports	Ukrainian forces shot down 43 Russian attack drones overnight, the Air Force reported on the morning of Jan. 19. Russia launched Shahed-type drones and decoy drones from bases in Millerovo, Oryol, and Bryansk, according to the report. The Air Force said it also lost track of 15 decoy drones Russia launched alongside the attack drones, saying that this resulted in no negative effects. The drones were shot down over Poltava, Sumy, Kharkiv, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk and Mykolaiv oblasts. Russian drone attacks on Ukraine jumped to record levels at the end of 2024, with Moscow planning to ramp up its production or UAVs in 2025. Drone strikes have targeted Ukrainian residential neighborhoods and critical energy infrastructure. Ukraine has in turn stepped up its own drone attacks on Russia and has focused attacks on the country&apos;s oil industry.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-downs-43-russian-drones-overnight-air-force-reports/	2025-01-19T01:08:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/air-defenses.jpg

Merkel highlights NATO's role in supporting Ukraine, urges transatlantic unity, media reports	Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel has emphasized the critical role of the United States and NATO in ensuring Ukraine&apos;s independence amid Russia&apos;s invasion. Speaking at the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU&apos;s New Year&apos;s reception in D&#xFC;sseldorf, Merkel said that the transatlantic partnership is more essential now than ever, underscoring its importance as Donald Trump prepared to take office as U.S. president. &quot;The attack by Russian President Vladimir Putin has shattered the principle of territorial integrity that underpinned Europe&#x2019;s post-war order,&quot; Merkel said, according to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. She argued that only through a united NATO effort, with strong U.S. leadership, can Putin&apos;s ambitions be thwarted and Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty preserved. Merkel described Trump as a &quot;unique president&quot; who focuses on defending U.S. interests but views international cooperation as a zero-sum game. Unlike multilateral approaches that seek mutual benefit, Trump operates on the belief that every negotiation produces a winner and a loser, she said. While acknowledging that Trump&#x2019;s outlook cannot be changed, Merkel urged Europe to consolidate its own interests and remain a steadfast partner to the U.S. &quot;Europe is our life insurance,&quot; she said, highlighting the continent&#x2019;s strategic value in global alliances. Merkel also took aim at the challenges facing Germany&#x2019;s current government and expressed her support for Friedrich Merz, the CDU leader, to take the chancellorship after the upcoming federal election on Feb. 23. Germany has become Ukraine&#x2019;s second-largest military donor after the U.S., though Chancellor Olaf Scholz has faced criticism for his cautious stance on key issues, including his refusal to supply Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/merkel-highlights-natos-role-in-supporting-ukraine-urges-transatlantic-unity-media-reports/	2025-01-18T21:55:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2154776902.jpg
Russia condemns 100-year partnership agreement between Ukraine and UK	Russia criticized a newly announced 100-year partnership agreement between Ukraine and the U.K., rejecting any cooperation between the two nations in the Azov Sea. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Jan. 18 declared such claims to the region a &quot;gross interference&quot; in Russia&#x2019;s affairs, claiming they would face firm resistance. The Kremlin expressed concern on Jan. 17 over potential deployment of British military assets in Ukraine under the agreement, particularly in the Azov Sea. Russia views the sea as part of its territory, citing its proximity to Russian borders, areas of southern Ukraine under Russian occupation, and Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014. Zakharova dismissed the agreement as meaningless from Russia&#x2019;s perspective, calling it a &quot;PR campaign&quot; by Kyiv. She added that Moscow considers the Sea of Azov an &quot;internal sea.&quot; The partnership, announced on Jan. 16 during British Prime Minister Keir Starmer&#x2019;s visit to Kyiv, includes commitments to strengthen military cooperation in the Baltic Sea, Black Sea, and Sea of Azov. Starmer pledged to support Ukraine with robust security guarantees if negotiations for a ceasefire with Russia move forward. The agreement marked Starmer&#x2019;s first visit to Ukraine as prime minister and highlighted the U.K.&apos;s continued support for President Volodymyr Zelensky. Starmer described the long-term partnership as a commitment to Ukraine&#x2019;s security and sovereignty. Russia&#x2019;s objections underline ongoing tensions over control of the Azov Sea, a strategic waterway central to both economic and military interests in the region. Moscow&#x2019;s position signals potential challenges to Ukraine and U.K.&#x2019;s efforts to enhance cooperation in contested areas.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-condemns-100-year-partnership-agreement-between-ukraine-and-uk/	2025-01-18T21:01:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/213eb4fab6527c39e0ce5fa008b4f0b8_1737025391_extra_large.jpeg
Trump eyes China visit amid strained ties, WSJ reports	President-elect Donald Trump has expressed interest in visiting China shortly after assuming office, potentially within his first 100 days, sources familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal. This potential trip would aim to stabilize relations with Beijing, strained by Trump&#x2019;s pledge to impose steep tariffs on Chinese imports. While Trump&#x2019;s transition team has not commented, advisers have also discussed the possibility of inviting Chinese President Xi Jinping to the United States to jump-start dialogue on critical issues. A possible meeting with Xi could come during a pivotal moment for U.S.-China relations, as both leaders navigate fraught economic and geopolitical challenges, including the war in Ukraine, trade disputes, and Taiwan&#x2019;s status. Trump and Xi spoke by phone on Jan. 17 for the first time since the November election, addressing various topics including trade, the fentanyl crisis, and the social media platform TikTok. Trump shared his optimism about their collaboration, sharing on social media that he expects the two nations will &quot;solve many problems together, starting immediately.&quot; During the conversation, however, Xi underscored the importance of handling Taiwan prudently, emphasizing its significance to China&apos;s sovereignty, according to the Wall Street Journal Beijing&#x2019;s official account of the call highlighted plans to establish a strategic communication channel between the two leaders. Trump reportedly conveyed his eagerness to meet Xi in person, though it remains unclear if a potential visit to China was explicitly discussed. Xi declined an invitation to Trump&#x2019;s inauguration, opting instead to send Vice President Han Zheng, a figure seen as a pragmatist in Washington and a signal of Beijing&#x2019;s openness to future negotiations. China&#x2019;s role in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine looms large in the broader U.S.-China dynamic. Beijing has provided indirect support to Moscow, drawing criticism from American lawmakers. While Trump did not reference the war in his post-call remarks, he suggested a desire to work with Xi to promote global stability, saying: &quot;President Xi and I will do everything possible to make the World more peaceful and safe!&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-eyes-china-visit-amid-strained-ties-wsj-reports/	2025-01-18T19:25:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179841418.jpg
Russia's Jan. 18 attack damages Ukraine's oldest McDonald’s in Kyiv	A Russian missile strike on Kyiv early on Jan. 18 damaged Ukraine&apos;s oldest McDonald&#x2019;s, located near the Lukianivska metro station in the city&apos;s Shevchenkivskyi district. Open since 1997, this is the first McDonald&apos;s restaurant in the country. McDonald&#x2019;s Ukraine confirmed the damage in a statement: &quot;Today, during an aerial attack on Kyiv, a McDonald&#x2019;s restaurant near the Lukianivska metro station was damaged. Our staff were able to evacuate to a shelter in time thanks to our safety protocols.&quot; The restaurant is currently closed but the company pledged to repair the damages. Kyiv remains a frequent target of Russian attacks since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. The missile attack caused significant destruction in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv. Three people&#x2014;a 41-year-old woman and two men aged 25 and 43&#x2014;were killed, and three others sustained injuries, according to Kyiv City Military Administration head Tymur Tkachenko. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported additional damage in the area, including shattered windows and smoke filling the entrance of a residential building. The glass entrance to the Lukianivska metro station was also damaged in the attack. Several cars caught fire, and a water pipeline was damaged.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-jan-18-attack-damages-ukraines-oldest-mcdonalds-in-kyiv/	2025-01-18T15:45:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193884529-2.jpg
Germany may consider sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, defense minister says	Germany may consider deploying its troops in a peacekeeping mission to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on January 18. The idea of sending a European peacekeeping force to Ukraine has gained traction in recent months as EU countries prepare to play a greater role in Kyiv&apos;s defense once U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. When asked if Germany was prepared to deploy troops to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire agreement, Pistorius indicated that Berlin was open to the idea. &quot;We&apos;re the largest NATO partner in Europe. We&apos;ll obviously have a role to play,&quot; Pistorius said in an interview with the German media outlet Suddeutsche Zeitung. The matter will &quot;be discussed in due time,&quot; Pistorius said. The U.K. and France are reportedly already discussing the possibility of deploying French and British troops to monitor a ceasefire along the front line in Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Jan. 16 that he had discussed the option with President Volodymyr Zelensky during their meeting in Kyiv. French President Emmanuel Macron, who first floated the idea of European troops in Ukraine, has also been in talks with Zelensky regarding future peacekeepers. Zelensky has previously said that Ukraine would only consider foreign peacekeepers if it secures a clear timeline for NATO membership. Other German politicians have also commented on the issue of deploying Bundeswehr troops to Ukraine. Roderich Kiesewetter, a lawmaker from the opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said on Jan. 3 that Berlin should not rule out the possibility. Friedrich Merz, the opposition CDU/CSU alliance&apos;s candidate for chancellor in the upcoming parliamentary elections, said on Dec. 28 that Germany could join a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine but only with Russia&apos;s consent.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-may-consider-sending-peacekeeping-troops-to-ukraine-defense-minister-says/	2025-01-18T13:51:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193104154.jpg
Students who fail military exam or refuse oath cannot continue higher ed, official says	Ukrainian university students who fail the basic military training exam or refuse to swear the military oath will not be permitted to continue their studies, Deputy Defense Minister Serhii Melnyk said on Jan. 18. Melnyk&apos;s comments follow the Defense Ministry&apos;s announcement on Jan. 17 that basic military training for students enrolled in higher education institutions will begin in September 2025. &quot;I would like to emphasize that (basic military training) is mandatory for everyone,&quot; Melnyk said. &quot;And if students cannot pass the exam for some reason or pass it unsatisfactorily, if they refuse to take the military oath, they will not be able to study in higher education institutions in the future.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky approved an updated version of the law on military service in Ukraine that stipulates systematic basic military training for students. The course will consist of 90 academic hours of theoretical study and 210 academic hours of practical training. The theoretical portion is compulsory for both men and women, ages 18 to 25. The practical course is mandatory only for men. Following completion of the training course, students will take the military oath, receive a certificate, and obtain a military specialization. The law reflects the changes Ukraine&apos;s educational institutions have undergone since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The Ukrainian goverment has amended enrollment policies to curb draft evasion and launched drone education programs. Starting in 2024, Ukrainian schools also launched a pilot program updating the Defense of Ukraine subject, which has been taught since the Soviet era. The updated subject will become mandatory in 2027.	https://kyivindependent.com/students-who-fail-military-exam-or-refuse-oath-cannot-continue-studies-official-says/	2025-01-18T13:05:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/melnyk.png
Ukrainian troops withdraw from, launch attack on Chasiv Yar refractory plant	Ukrainian forces launched an aerial attack against a Russian-occupied refractory plant in the embattled city of Chasiv Yar, Lieutenant Colonel Dmytro Zaporozhets, spokesperson for the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Jan. 18. The attack confirms earlier reports that Ukrainian troops had withdrawn from the plant. &quot;On the territory of the refractory plant, the enemy tried to gain a foothold, attacking in small and medium groups,&quot; Zaporozhets said during a television broadcast. &quot;Thanks to coordinated actions ... (occupying Russian troops) were discovered in one of the premises on the territory of the refractory plant and an air strike was carried out. The enemy suffered losses.&quot; The Ukrainian news outlet Ukrainska Pravda posted a video, obtained from the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, depicting the strike against the plant. In the past week, Russian military bloggers alleged that Russian forces had pushed Ukrainian troops out of the refractory plant in Chasiv Yar. The crowd-sourced monitoring website Deep State also reported on Jan. 12 that Russia had occupied the site. The plant served as reliable fortification for Ukrainian forces, who must now shelter in residential buildings weakened by constant shelling. The front-line city of Chasiv Yar has become one of the hottest spots in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian troops continue advancing in eastern Ukraine. The city has been partially under Russian control since Ukrainian forces withdrew from the eastern Kanal neighborhood in July. Fighting has recently intensified near the city, with Russian forces reportedly using armored combat vehicles in their assault for the first time in late December.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-troops-withdraw-from-launch-attack-on-chasiv-yar-refractory-plant-military-says/	2025-01-18T12:15:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1607100920.jpg
Dnipropetrovsk firm helped Russia build nuclear weapons labs, SBU says	A building materials company in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast sent metal products to the Russian Federation that were used to build nuclear weapons laboratories, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on Jan. 18, following an investigation into the firm. The announcement coincides with multiple reports from Ukrainian law enforcement agencies on Jan. 18 exposing alleged instances of treason and plots to aid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Representatives of the company allegedly shipped a large-scale batch of stainless steel profiles to Russia after the full-scale invasion in 2022, the SBU said. These products were used to outfit the Russian Institute for Nuclear Research. In these labs, &quot;the Russians are developing designs for new models of nuclear-powered missile weapons,&quot; the SBU said. To conceal the shipment to Russia, dealers first sent the materials to a third-party company in the Middle East, according to the investigation. From there, the goods were exported to Russia. Investigators said they uncovered evidence of criminal activity in mobile phones, computer equipment, and documents seized during searches of the company and of suspects&apos; apartments. The owner of the company and three subordinates have been charged with providing assistance to an aggressor state.

SBU detains metro engineer who allegedly directed Russian missile strikes on Kyiv, Kharkiv	A Kyiv Metro engineer allegedly let a network of agents who helped direct Russian missile and drone attacks against the capital and Kharkiv Oblast, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced on Jan. 18. The agents tracked the movement and positions of Ukrainian troops in order to coordinate Russian aerial attacks, the SBU said. Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service recruited the network leader, a Kyiv Metro engineer, during a meeting in Moscow in 2015, according to the SBU. After the full-scale invasion in 2022, he was instructed to create a network of agents who would monitor the activitiy of Ukrainian troops and cargo. The engineer allegedly recruited acquaintances into the network, including a Kharkiv resident who deserted the Ukrainian military and previously worked for Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia) for 10 years. This agent tracked and reported on the movements of Ukraine&apos;s military. Another agent, an international road transport driver, identified and shared the coordinates of military checkpoints. The ringleader then passed this intelligence on to the FSB, the SBU claimed. The leader also personally directed Russian missile strikes on Kyiv, according to intercepted conversations. SBU officers have detained the alleged leader in Kyiv and another suspected agent in Kharkiv. During the investigation, officers seized cell phones that they said contain evidence of collaboration with Russia, along with four firearms. Both suspects have been charged with high treason in conjunction with the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. A third suspect, currently in hiding abroad, may also be charged. The suspects face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, along with confiscation of property.	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-detains-metro-engineer-who-allegedly-directed-russian-missile-strikes-on-kyiv-kharkiv/	2025-01-18T10:11:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/sbuykyiv.jpeg
Russia used chemical weapons 434 times in December, Ukraine's General Staff says	Russian forces used chemical weapons on the battlefield 434 times in December 2024, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 18. Since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine&apos;s radiation, chemical, and biological intelligence units have been monitoring and recording the use of hazardous chemicals in attacks. The military has recorded 5,389 cases since February 2023. Russian forces used K-51 and RG-VO munitions, anti-riot weapons that are prohibited for use in warfare, the General Staff said in their report. Russia has also used ammunition loaded with dangerous chemicals of &quot;unspecified type.&quot; The use of such weapons &quot;grossly violates the rules of warfare,&quot; the General Staff said. The report noted that chemical weapons attacks have &quot;become systemic&quot; since February 2023. Russia has been intensifying its use of chemical agents on the battlefield in Ukraine. A Kyiv Independent investigation from August 2024 showed that instances of gas attacks are rising, and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) confirmed on Nov. 18 that a riot control agent known as CS has been used in Ukraine. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, more than 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been hospitalized with chemical poisoning, and three have died, Ukrainian Colonel Artem Vlasiuk said on Dec. 13. Ukraine struck back at Russia&apos;s use of illegal chemical weapons on Dec. 17, when the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) assassinated Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops. The previous day, Ukrainain prosecutors charged Kirillov in absentia for the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-used-chemical-weapons-434-times-in-december-ukraines-general-staff-says/	2025-01-18T09:20:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2121052659.jpg
Direct threat' — Ukraine's 48th Separate Assault Battalion denounces commander replacement	Soldiers of Ukraine&apos;s 48th Separate Assault Battalion spoke out against the replacement of their commander Lenur Islyamov in a video address to Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi published on Jan. 18. The battalion is currently based in the town of Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian forces that has been the focus of fierce fighting as Russia intensifies its offensive in Donetsk Oblast. According to the soldiers, they were deployed there 10 days ago after almost a year spent defending another hot spot in the region. &#xA0;Following the redeployment, the battalion learned that Isyamov had been replaced by another commander. &quot;Changing the commander at a critical moment is a direct threat to the unit&apos;s combat capability and undermines the trust of the fighters,&quot; the statement read. The servicemembers praised Islyamov for forming and leading a battalion that consists of 90% volunteers. &quot;We have not surrendered a single position. Instead, we have conducted dozens of successful operations. During this time, we recaptured several settlements where Ukrainian flags were planted,&quot; one soldier said. &quot;All this was possible only thanks to the experience, professionalism, and dedication of our commander.&quot; The soldiers also said that they were not provided with necessary intelligence information after their redeployment. The Ukrainian military leadership has not yet commented on the address. This is the latest appeal by the Ukrainian military in support of a commander allegedly about to be removed. In the summer of 2024, soldiers from Ukraine&apos;s 24th Mechanized Brigade spoke out to oppose the dismissal of its commander, Ivan Holishevskyi. Later, officers from Ukraine&apos;s 80th Air Assault Brigade called on Ukraine&apos;s political and military leadership to keep brigade commander Emil Ishkulov in his post.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-48th-assault-battalion-denounces-commander-replacement/	2025-01-18T08:16:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/--------------2025-01-18-174743.png
Lukashenko frees 23 more Belarusian political prisoners	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko freed 23 Belarusians convicted of &quot;extremist crimes,&quot; his press office reported on Jan. 18. Lukashenko has pardoned political prisoners in rounds since July, a move that many see as an attempt to boost his approval rating ahead of the 2025 presidential election. However, political persecution continues in Belarus, according to human rights activists. The eighth round of &quot;pardons&quot; includes three women and 20 men. More than half of them are over 50 years old. Fourteen people have chronic diseases, according to the statement. The names of the released convicts have not been revealed. Since the first round of pardons on July 3, timed to coincide with Independence Day in Belarus, over 200 political prisoners have been reportedly released. Nearly 1,300 prisoners remain behind bars in Belarus, Viasna Human Rights Center reported. However, the Lukashenko regime is continuing its crackdown on dissent. In fact, arbitrary repression of political opponents has intensified in Belarus in the run-up to the 2025 presidential elections, the Viasna said. Over November and December, human rights activists added 120 new names to the list of recognized political prisoners in Belarus. Lukashenko has been in power since 1994 and is looking to reelect himself for the seventh time.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-frees-23-more-political-prisoners-in-belarus/	2025-01-18T06:55:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1257107756.jpg
Ex-MP, leader of Russia-affiliated Ukrainian Orthodox Church charged with treason	Ukrainian law enforcement officers charged former lawmaker and businessman Vadym Novynskyi with high treason and incitement to religious hatred in absentia, the State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) said. The SBI didn&apos;t mention the suspect&apos;s name, but the description and the video made it clear that this was Novynskyi. Novynskyi is an ex-lawmaker from the pro-Russian Opposition Bloc, which was banned in Ukraine shortly after the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale war, and sponsor of the Moscow-backed church in Ukraine. For years, Novynskyi was listed among the richest Ukrainians, with Forbes estimating his wealth at $1.4 billion in the spring of 2023. According to the investigation, Novynskyi has been publicly promoting Russian narratives since Moscow&apos;s invasion in 2014. &quot;The MP tried to form anti-government and pro-Russian sentiments in Ukrainian society, justify Russian aggression, etc.,&quot; the SBI said. Law enforcement officials called Novynskyi a &quot;handler&quot; of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) in Ukraine. In December 2022, Ukraine imposed sanctions against him and other leaders of the Russia-affiliated Ukrainian Orthodox Church. The former MP followed the instructions of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, maintained close ties with him for a long time, and was hierarchically subordinate to him, the statement read. After the start of the full-scale invasion, Novynskyi resigned from Ukraine&apos;s parliament and fled abroad. He continues &quot;to assist Russia in conducting subversive information activities,&quot; the SBI said. If detained and convicted, he might face up to 15 years in prison with or without confiscation of property.	https://kyivindependent.com/ex-mp-leader-of-russia-affiliated-ukrainian-orthodox-church-charged-with-treason/	2025-01-18T05:47:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-628589626.jpg
Former pro-Russian lawmaker charged with treason resurfaces in China	Former Ukrainian pro-Russian lawmaker Yevheniy Murayev published a two-hour propaganda interview on Jan. 17, marking his first public appearance after almost three years of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Murayev was a lawmaker between 2012 and 2019, and later led the pro-Russian Nashi party until it was banned in June 2022. He also was the owner of Nash TV channel, which was banned in 2022 for spreading the Kremlin&apos;s propaganda. Murayev fled Ukraine in May 2022. He said in the interview that he lived in Beijing with his family. He refused to say how he managed to leave Ukraine. In the interview, Murayev parroted Russian propaganda, blaming President Volodymyr Zelensky for Russia&apos;s all-out invasion. The ex-lawmaker opposed Ukraine&apos;s EU and NATO accession and criticized Western sanctions imposed on Moscow. He said that his reappearance is not related to the post-war elections, which have been the subject of speculations in Ukraine in recent months. &quot;I&apos;m not running for any position, and I don&apos;t see any possibility of returning to Ukraine yet. At least in the short term,&quot; Murayev said. Shortly before the start of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the U.K. Foreign Office warned that the Kremlin intends to install Murayev as the head of the Russian puppet regime in Kyiv. A day after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Murayev called on Kyiv to capitulate. In the summer of 2023, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) charged Murayev with high treason.	https://kyivindependent.com/pro-russian-politician-charged-with-treason-resurfaces-in-china/	2025-01-18T04:34:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1151714517.jpg
24-year-old Belarusian volunteer soldier killed in action near Bakhmut	Maria Zaitseva, a 24-year-old Belarusian volunteer soldier fighting for Ukraine, was killed in action near the town of Bakhmut in Donetsk Oblast on Jan. 17, Nasha Niva reported. Zaitseva joined the Ukrainian army after the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale war and fought with the 2nd International Legion Battalion. She turned 24 on Jan. 16, a day before she was killed by Russian forces. In August 2020, Zaitseva participated in the protests in Minsk against alleged presidential election fraud in Belarus. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko claimed to have won elections by a landslide with 80% of the vote, provoking nationwide protests and a subsequent regime crackdown on dissent. During protests, fragments of a flash grenade severely injured Zaitseva&apos;s arm and head. Her photo from the protests with her face covered in blood went viral. &quot;Gravely injured during the 2020 Belarus protests, she gave her life for freedom,&quot; said Belarusian opposition leader Svitlana Tsikhanouskaya, describing Zaitseva as &quot;an icon of our revolution.&quot; This is utterly heartbreaking.

Ukrainian drones hit Russian oil depot in Tula Oblast, source claims	Ukrainian drones attacked an oil depot in Russia&apos;s Tula Oblast overnight on Jan. 18, a source in Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent. According to the source, the drones, operated by HUR, hit the oil depot at least 10 times in this attack. Tula Oblast, located south of Moscow, has regularly come under attack by Ukrainian drones as Kyiv aims at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry, which is crucial for sustaining Moscow&apos;s war effort, as well as its military hardware. Tula Oblast Governor Dmitry Milyaev said that a fuel storage tank caught fire at &quot;one of the enterprises in the region.&quot; No casualties were reported. Videos posted on social media and shared by residents appear to show a large fire at an oil depot in the town of Uzlovaya in the region. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The attack came amid an uptick in Ukraine&#x2019;s drone attacks targeting Russian energy infrastructure. Earlier in the night, Ukrainian drones also reportedly attacked an oil depot in Russia&apos;s Kaluga Oblast, causing a large fire.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-hit-russian-oil-depot-in-tula-oblast-source-claims/	2025-01-18T00:47:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1249556007.webp
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 9, injure 38 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed nine people and injured at least 38 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Jan. 17. Ukrainian forces downed 24 out of the 39 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Another 14 drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are usually decoys. Russia launches them alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. Russia also launched four ballistic missiles of either the Iskander-M or the North Korean KN-23 model in the early hours of Jan. 18, with two of them downed by Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Fallen wreckage from the downed missiles killed four people and injured at least three others in Kyiv, according to local authorities. The attack damaged a water pipeline, an administrative building, a business center, a store, and cars, the State Emergency Service said. The glass entrance to the Lukianivska metro station and the neighboring McDonald&apos;s building were also damaged.

Hungary's Orban defends ally Antal Rogan sanctioned by US, media reports	Sanctions imposed by the outgoing U.S. administration against Antal Rogan, Prime Minister Viktor Orban&apos;s cabinet chief and overseer of the secret service, have only strengthened Rogan&apos;s position, Orban said during a state radio interview on Jan. 17. In his first comments since the U.S. sanctioned Rogan earlier this month for alleged corruption, Orban defended his close ally. The prime minister&#x2019;s cabinet office dismissed the sanctions as the &quot;last, petty revenge&quot; of the departing U.S. ambassador. &quot;(Rogan) is the minister in charge of national security services, the number one guardian of Hungarian national sovereignty and if he is punished by a big power that means he does his job well, so this is our starting point,&quot; Orban told the broadcaster, according to Reuters. A long-time supporter of President-elect Donald Trump, Orban expressed optimism for a &quot;golden era&quot; in U.S.-Hungarian relations under Trump&#x2019;s leadership. At home, Orban faces mounting challenges, including a rising opposition party and economic difficulties ahead of the 2026 elections. He pledged to intensify efforts to combat what he described as &quot;foreign networks&quot; undermining Hungary&#x2019;s sovereignty. Orban reiterated his criticism of Hungarian-born U.S. financier George Soros, whose liberal ideals have been a consistent target. The prime minister declared his foreign policy objective for the year: &quot;to squeeze out the Soros empire from Europe,&quot; beginning with Hungary. &quot;It is time...for us to eliminate the foreign networks that pose a threat to Hungarian national sovereignty and send them home,&quot; he reportedly said. &quot;Hungary will likely be the first country (in Europe) to squeeze out the Soros empire, this is my definite goal for this year.&quot; For over a decade, Orban&apos;s Fidesz party has targeted Soros and his Open Society Foundations. In 2017, the government introduced stricter rules for foreign-funded NGOs, requiring them to register and disclose their funding sources publicly. Orban Defends Aide Sanctioned by U.S. A year later, Central European University, founded by Soros in 1991, began relocating most of its courses from Hungary to Vienna after a prolonged standoff with Orban&#x2019;s administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungarys-orban-defends-ally-antal-rogan-sanctioned-by-us/	2025-01-17T21:33:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1689139196.jpg
3 killed following Russia's attack on Kyiv	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched an attack on Kyiv early in the morning on Jan. 18, killing at least three people, according to city authorities. According to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, windows were shattered, and smoke filled the entrance of a residential building in the Shevchenkivskyi district. Several cars caught fire following the attack. A water supply pipeline was also damaged in the area.

Fire reported at oil depot in Russia's Tula Oblast following drone attack	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A fire erupted at an oil depot in the town of Uzlovaya in Russia&apos;s Tula Oblast following a Ukrainian drone attack on the facility overnight on Jan. 18, regional Governor Dmitry Milyaev said. Milyaev said that a fuel storage tank caught fire at &quot;one of the enterprises in the region.&quot; Videos posted on social media and shared by residents appear to show a large fire at an oil depot in the town. Milyaev claimed that there were not casualties as a result of the attack. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify claims made by Russian officials. Ukraine&apos;s military has not yet commented on the attack. No information on the extent of the damage was immediately available. The attack comes amid an uptick in Ukraine&#x2019;s drone operations targeting Russian energy infrastructure. Earlier in the night, Ukrainian drones reportedly attacked an oil depot in Russia&apos;s Kaluga Oblast, causing a large fire. Tula Oblast, located south of Moscow, has regularly come under attack by Ukrainian drones as the country attempts to disrupt Russia&apos;s military supplychain. On Nov. 9, sources told the Kyiv Independent that Ukrainian drones struck the Aleksinsky chemical plant in the region, which produces gunpowder and ammunition for the Russian military. Ukraine has targeted Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure as part of its strategy to undermine a key funding source for Russia&apos;s war effort. Drone strikes on refineries in Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk have led to reductions or suspensions in operations. Overnight on Jan. 14, Ukraine carried out its &quot;most massive&quot; strike on Russian military and industrial facilities within a range of up to 1,100 kilometers (620 miles), according to the General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces. Targets included chemical plants, refineries, and ammunition depots at the Engels airbase, a source in Ukraine&#x2019;s Security Service (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. Amid an uptick in drone attacks, Russia&apos;s seaborne exports of petroleum products declined by 9.1% to 113.7 million metric tons in 2024, Reuters reported on Jan. 17.	https://kyivindependent.com/fire-reported-at-oil-depot-in-russias-tula-oblast-following-drone-attack/	2025-01-17T17:15:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1209343722.jpg
Media identifies nearly 89,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine	Journalists have identified the names of 88,726 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to a joint investigation by BBC Russia and Mediazona. Since the media outlets&apos; last update in mid-December, the names of 3,965 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties. The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, regional media reports, and statements from local authorities. The confirmed death toll now includes 20,200 volunteers, 15,300 recruited prisoners, and 10,300 mobilized soldiers, according to the media outlets. Over 4,600 officers have also been confirmed to have been killed. Russia has gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast in recent months but at the cost of heavy casualties as well as equipment losses. The journalists note that as Russian military equipment dwindles, commanders may be forced to provide less protective equipment to soldiers, highlighted by their use of civilian cars in attacks &#x2014; which ultimately may lead to a higher casualty rate. As of Jan. 17, Russia has lost a total of 815,820 troops since the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported. The estimate, which is broadly in-line with estimates made by Western intelligence agencies, likely includes those killed, captured, wounded, and missing. Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures, though a Defense Ministry official recently let slip that the department received 48,000 requests to identify missing soldiers. President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed in a rare statement in early December that Ukraine had lost 43,000 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-identifies-nearly-89-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine/	2025-01-17T16:54:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1241060998.jpg
Debris from Russian drones found in Romanian border town, defense ministry confirms	Romania&apos;s Defense Ministry confirmed on Jan. 17 that it had found Russian drone fragments in two communities situated on the Romania-Ukraine border. The two attack drones, located in the communities of Chatalchioi and Kiliya Veche in Tulcea County, were found following a Russian overnight drone attack on Ukraine. Residents in the Romanian border communities received air raid alerts amid the attack. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported it had downed 33 out of the 50 drones launched by Russia overnight on Jan. 16 - 17. Another nine were &quot;lost,&quot; and one more drone flew in the direction of Romania, according to the statement. Romania&apos;s Defense Ministry said that the Russian drones did not cause any casualties or damage. It was not the first time that wreckage of Russian drones have been found on Romanian territory, which is a NATO country. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukrainian port infrastructure on the Danube River that separates Ukraine and Romania. In previous incidents, Romania&apos;s military scrambled F-16 fighter jets to protect the country&apos;s own airspace. The country previously published a draft law that would allow the military to shoot down aircraft that illegally violate Romania&apos;s airspace. Despite the legislative efforts, Bucharest has yet to down Russian drones over its territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/debris-from-russian-drones-found-in-romanian-border-town-defense-ministry-confirms/	2025-01-17T14:55:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1704959103.jpg
French patrol aircraft was 'target of Russian intimidation' over Baltic Sea, French defense minister says	A French maritime patrol aircraft was the target of intimidation tactics over the Baltic Sea overnight on Jan. 17, after the aircraft was locked onto by the radar of a Russian ground-to-air defense system, France&apos;s Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on social media. The aircraft was patrolling in international airspace over the Baltic Sea overnight between Jan. 16 - 17 as part of a NATO operation, the defense minister said. &quot;This aggressive Russian action is not acceptable,&quot; Lecornu wrote on X. &quot;Our armies will continue to act to defend freedom of navigation in international air and maritime spaces.&quot; The Baltic Sea region has witnessed growing concerns over Russian sabotage since Western nations began supporting Ukraine following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022. On Dec. 25, four telecommunication cables and one power cable in the Baltic Sea were damaged, with Finnish authorities suspecting the involvement of the Russian &quot;shadow fleet&quot; vessel Eagle S. Following the incident, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte vowed to increase NATO&apos;s military presence in the region. On Jan. 14, eight NATO member states bordering the Baltic Sea unveiled a coordinated action plan to address risks to underwater infrastructure following the suspected sabotage. In addition to sabotage efforts, Russia has been repeatedly accused of jamming the GPS signal of various aircrafts, particularly in the Baltic Sea region. In March, Russia likely jammed the satellite signal of a Royal Air Force aircraft used to transport then-U.K. Defence Minister Grant Shapps near Kaliningrad. On Dec. 9, two Dutch F-35 fighter jets intercepted Russian aircraft over the Baltic Sea. Later they were also scrambled again to intercept a Russian IL-20 reconnaissance aircraft. Russian aircraft frequently operate over the Baltic Sea without transponders or flight plans, actions often seen as testing NATO&apos;s response capabilities. .	https://kyivindependent.com/french-patrol-aircraft-was-target-of-russian-intimidation-over-baltic-sea-french-defense-minister-says/	2025-01-17T13:44:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1625904649.jpg
Fire erupts at oil depot in Russia's Kaluga Oblast following drone attack	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A fire erupted at a oil depot in the city of Lyudinovo in Russia&apos;s Kaluga Oblast following a Ukrainian drone attack on the facility on Jan. 17, regional Governor Vladislav Shapsha said. Various Russian Telegram channels, citing residents, reported sounds of explosions in the region. Videos which appear to show a large fire at an oil depot in the city were posted to social media. Shapsha confirmed a fire had erupted at a &quot;industrial facility&quot; around 9:30 p.m. local time, additionally claiming that no casualties had been sustained as a result of the attack. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify claims made by Russian officials. Ukraine&apos;s military has not yet commented on the attack. 0:00/1&#xD7;Video of a purported fire at a erupted at an oil depot in the city of Lyudinovo in Russia&apos;s Kaluga Oblast following a Ukrainian drone attack on the facility on Jan. 17, 2025. (ASTRA/Telegram)The full extent of the damage was not immediately clear. The attack comes amid an uptick in Ukraine&#x2019;s drone operations targeting Russian energy infrastructure. Ukraine has targeted Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure as part of its strategy to undermine a key funding source for Russia&apos;s war effort. Drone strikes on refineries in Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk have led to reductions or suspensions in operations. Overnight on Jan. 14, Ukraine carried out its &quot;most massive&quot; strike on Russian military and industrial facilities within a range of up to 1,100 kilometers (620 miles), according to the General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces. Targets included chemical plants, refineries, and ammunition depots at the Engels airbase, a source in Ukraine&#x2019;s Security Service (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. Amid an uptick in drone attacks, Russia&apos;s seaborne exports of petroleum products declined by 9.1% to 113.7 million metric tons in 2024, Reuters reported on Jan. 17.	https://kyivindependent.com/fire-erupts-at-oil-depot-in-russias-kaluga-oblast-following-drone-attack/	2025-01-17T12:56:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
US imposes sanctions against Russian oil tankers under construction for 1st time	Six Russian oil tankers still under construction at Russia&apos;s Zvezda shipyard have been targeted by U.S. sanctions imposed last week, Reuters reported on Jan. 17. The latest sanctions targeted over 180 oil-carrying vessels of Russia&apos;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; a group of aging tankers routinely used for sanction evasion. Several of these vessels are also reportedly involved in transporting sanctioned Iranian oil. For the first time, Washington imposed a ban on the use of tankers even before they went to sea or transported sanctioned cargo. The sanctions will impact named vessels including the Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Alexander Beggrov, the Alexey Bogolyubov, as well as three yet to be named vessels listed as Zvezda 131080, Zvezda 131060, and Zvezda 131040, according to Reuters. The Alexander Beggrov and Alexey Bogolyubov were purchased by the Russian company Sovcomflot. The other four tankers were bought by Rosneft&apos;s shipping division Rosnefteflot. Both buyers of the vessels are under sanctions. Experts cited by Reuters said the latest measures drove up prices of tankers as demand for non-sanctioned vessels grew. The outgoing Biden administration has taken steps to undermine Russian oil exports, which are one of the key fuels of Russian aggression in Ukraine. Recent sanctions also targeted two of Russia&apos;s major oil producers, Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz, along with dozens of their subsidiaries. Combined, these companies reportedly produce over 1 million barrels of oil daily, generating an estimated $23 billion of revenue annually, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-imposes-sanctions-for-1st-time-against-russian-oil-tankers-under-construction/	2025-01-17T12:23:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167101990.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia, Iran sign strategic partnership deal; Ukraine strikes Russian S-400 radar equipment	Key developments on Jan. 17: Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian signed a strategic partnership agreement in Moscow on Jan. 17, Russian state news agency TASS reported. Moscow and Tehran have long ties but their cooperation only intensified after the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022. Iran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed drones used in attacks against Ukrainian cities, as well as short-range ballistic missiles.The document, signed during an official ceremony in the Kremlin, establishes Moscow and Tehran as strategic partners. The agreement covers various areas, including energy, finance, transportation, agriculture, culture, science, technology, and counterterrorism. Russia and Iran have also agreed to strengthen cooperation in security and defense. According to the agreement, if one of the parties is subjected to aggression, the other will not provide any assistance to the aggressor. Moscow and Tehran will also deepen partnerships between their special services, and will assist each other in the event of natural, and man-made disasters. The strategic agreement between Russia and Iran is concluded for 20 years with automatic extension for subsequent 5-year periods. With Iran&apos;s assistance, Russia has begun producing its own variants of Shahed drones called Geran-2. Iran and Russia have also been at the forefront of confronting what they see as the Western-led global order, with namely Tehran sponsoring militant groups in the Middle East attacking the West&apos;s allies. Last June, Putin signed a similar partnership agreement with North Korea, under which both parties agreed to military support each other in case of an armed attack. Months after the deal was signed, North Korea dispatched up to 12,000 troops to help fend off a Ukrainian incursion in Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian forces struck radar equipment of an advanced S-400 air defense system in Russia&apos;s Belgorod Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Jan. 17. According to the military, the positions of Russia&apos;s anti-aircraft missile division of the 568th regiment came under a &quot;long-range fire&quot; on Jan. 16. &quot;The termination of the 92H6 radar station of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system was recorded, which indicates a successful hit on the target,&quot; the statement read. Ukrainian forces also attacked positions of the radar company of Russia&apos;s radio engineering battalion of the 336th regiment in Belgorod Oblast. Damage to vehicles and equipment was recorded, the military said. Moscow has not yet commented on the statement. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Belgorod Oblast lies at the border with Ukraine and is regularly targeted in cross-border drone strikes. Ukraine also struck the Liskinskaya oil depot in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast with drones overnight on Jan. 16, the General Staff claimed. Also, a drone strike reportedly targeted a Russian gunpowder factory in the village of Kuzmino-Gat in Tambov Oblast the same night. U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration has declassified previously undisclosed efforts to support Ukraine&apos;s drone industry, including $1.5 billion funding sent in September 2024, The New York Times reported on Jan. 17, citing anonymous officials. Ukrainian drones have been utilized for reconnaissance, combat, and other missions, showcasing their versatility and impact in countering Russian forces. U.S. intelligence officers reportedly assisted in advancing Ukraine&apos;s drone capabilities, helping to design a new generation of drones intended to revolutionize modern warfare. While much of the U.S. aid for Ukraine has been publicly disclosed &#x2014; covering missiles, air defense systems, tanks, and training &#x2014; support for the drone sector has largely remained secret. The declassified data reveals that the U.S. allocated funds for drone manufacturing and facilitated partnerships between U.S. tech companies and Ukrainian drone producers. These efforts intensified during preparations for Ukraine&apos;s 2023 counteroffensive, which struggled to achieve significant territorial gains, reportedly due to Russia&apos;s extensive drone use. In response, the U.S. accelerated aid to Ukraine&apos;s drone sector. Officials reportedly believe this investment has made Ukrainian drones more effective and deadly. Ukrainian maritime drones, credited with destroying 25% of Russia&apos;s Black Sea Fleet, and aerial drones deployed on the front lines have slowed Russian advances in eastern Ukraine. By the end of 2024, Ukraine had delivered over 200,000 domestically produced drones to frontline units, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in December. The United States has assured Russian President Vladimir Putin it would not deploy nuclear weapons in Ukraine, outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden said in a Jan. 17 interview with MSNBC. &quot;Tactical nuclear in Europe scares the hell out of everybody, including the Russians,&quot; he said. Biden recounted conversations with Putin, during which the Russian leader emphasized demands to keep nuclear weapons out of Ukraine and block Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership. &quot;I said, &apos;(Nuclear weapons are) not a problem. We&apos;ve already taken the nuclear weapons out. There&apos;s none there. We&apos;re not gonna put them back in,&apos;&quot; Biden responded, without provided the date when such a conversation had occurred. The U.S. president further criticized Putin&apos;s ambitions: &quot;All he wants to do is re-establish the Warsaw Pact. I can&apos;t let that happen. This guy is not a good guy.&quot; These discussions reflect long-standing tensions over Ukraine&apos;s security, which were central to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. Under the agreement, Ukraine relinquished its nuclear arsenal &#x2014; the world&apos;s third-largest &#x2014; in exchange for assurances from the U.S., U.K., and Russia not to use force or economic coercion against Ukraine. Despite these commitments, Russia launched a war against Ukraine and has repeatedly issued nuclear threats against Ukraine and its allies. In November, Putin approved an updated nuclear doctrine, which snow allows Moscow to use nuclear arms against non-nuclear states. Russia later launched the intermediate-range ballistic missile &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; designed for nuclear weapons. A November survey by Russia&apos;s independent Levada Center revealed that 39% of Russians believe nuclear weapons use could be justified in the ongoing war against Ukraine, reflecting the domestic impact of Kremlin rhetoric. Australian volunteer soldier Oscar Jenkins has the status of a prisoner of war (POW) and there is no confirmation of his death, Ukrainian investigative journalism outlet Slidstvo.Info reported on Jan. 17, citing the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. The news comes after reports that the body of Jenkins, a 32-year-old teacher from Melbourne whose capture was reported in December, has been found. He was believed to have been executed by his Russian captors. Some media outlets and Telegram channels published a video purporting to show bodies of soldiers, claiming that Jenkins was among them. Slidstvo.Info verified that footage was published four years ago on an Iranian website. The description says that it was filmed in Nagorno-Karabakh, and the original video is in Armenian instead of Russian. Jenkins is serving in the 402nd Separate Rifle Battalion, which is part of Ukraine&apos;s 66th Separate Mechanized Brigade, the outlet wrote. He went missing on Dec. 16 in 2024 while being on a combat mission near the village of Mykolaivka in Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces Command told Slidstvo.Info. &quot;There has been no transfer of the body (of Oscar Jenkins),&quot; the military said. The Kyiv Independent has contacted the Australian Embassy in Kyiv and the Ukrainian authorities but has not received a response at the time of publication. The Geneva Conventions mandate all warring parties to treat POW with respect and dignity, while executing POWs is considered a gross violation of international law and a war crime. Russia has been repeatedly accused of summarily executing Ukrainian POWs throughout the war. Moscow calls foreign volunteers &quot;mercenaries&quot; and claims they are not entitled to protection under the Geneva Conventions. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese pledged the &quot;strongest action possible&quot; if reports of an Australian national captured while fighting for Ukraine being executed by Russian forces are confirmed. Australia&apos;s Foreign Ministry has also summoned the Russian ambassador on Jan. 15 to demand information and stress compliance with international law.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-iran-sign-strategic-partnership-ukraine-strikes-russian-s-400-radar-equipment/	2025-01-17T12:21:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193780871.jpg
Four Russian officers reportedly killed in Kursk Oblast by Ukraine's Dec. 30 strike	At least four Russian officers were killed in Ukraine&apos;s attack on the town of Lgov in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast on Dec. 30, independent Russian media outlet Mediazona reported on Jan. 17, citing recently published obituaries. Alexander Khinshtein, the acting governor of Kursk Oblast, claimed on Dec. 30 that the attack had injured an 86-year-old woman and damaged a two-story building. The Russian official did not mention any losses among the military. Yet, according to Mediazona, at least four officers of the 76th Air Assault Division with the rank of lieutenant colonel were killed by U.K.-made missiles. One of the killed was Lieutenant Colonel Valeriy Tereshchenko, Mediazona reported, citing an obituary from the Officers&apos; Hockey League page on social media. Eight people from the division&apos;s senior staff were killed, and 22 others were injured in the attack, the obituary read. Two more obituaries about Lieutenant Colonels Pavel Maletsky and Alexei Seliverstov were found by Mediazona on their relatives&apos; social media pages. Another killed officer is Major Ali Tsurov from Ingushetia, who also served in the 76th Air Assault Division, Mediazona reported, citing Russian media outlet Fortanka. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Ukrainian troops carried out another attack on Lgov on Dec. 26, hitting a Russian command post. The attack allegedly killed 18 Russian soldiers. Despite the high losses within Russian and North Korean ranks, Ukrainian forces in Kursk Oblast seem to be increasingly on the back foot, facing a Russian advantage in manpower and equipment. Ukraine&apos;s foothold in Kursk is considered a possible bargaining chip ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s expected push for peace negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/at-least-4-russian-officers-killed-in-kursk-oblast-as-result-of-ukrainian-dec-30-strike-media-reports/	2025-01-17T11:44:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1240563519.jpg
It's not enough' — Ukrainians react to Biden's farewell speech	In his farewell speech from the White House on Jan.15, outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden took the opportunity to highlight his achievements in office in an attempt to help cement his legacy. Yet, despite being one of the world&apos;s biggest international crises that spanned much of Biden&apos;s term in office, Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine only gained a single mention. &quot;Ukraine is still free, and we&apos;ve pulled ahead of our competition with China and so much more,&quot; Biden said as he listed his administration&apos;s accomplishments, including a stronger NATO military alliance. &quot;It will take time to feel the full impact of what we&apos;ve done together. But the seeds are planted, and they&apos;ll grow, and they&apos;ll bloom for decades to come,&quot; he added. The Biden administration provided Ukraine with $65.9 billion in military assistance since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion, making it the largest donor in absolute terms. But how this aid was given has regularly attracted criticism, particularly over the speed of the decision-making process in the White House. Big ticket weapons, including heavy tanks, F-16 fighter jets, and the decision to greenlight long-range missile strikes deep inside Russian territory often only came after weeks or months of political wrangling, hampering Ukraine&apos;s ability to fight back against Russian forces. Then there is Biden&apos;s assertion that &quot;Ukraine is free&quot; &#x2014; Russia continues to occupy roughly one-fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory while its forces are pushing forward in Donetsk Oblast. We asked Ukrainians for their assessment of Biden&apos;s presidency, his legacy in regard to the full-scale invasion, and what he could have done more to help Ukraine. Professor at Kyiv Mohyla Academy, and research advisor at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation We are thankful to the U.S. and personally to President Biden for all the support they have given to Ukraine, including military support. It was of immense importance in rebuffing Vladimir Putin of Russia. I believe that for Biden, Ukraine became a personal issue that he took deeply into his heart. However, all the time support was delayed and not enough. There are different reasons for that but the main one is Putin&apos;s nuclear blackmail which worked, as in the case with other Western leaders, unfortunately. As a result we were not prepared enough for the counteroffensive in late 2022 and summer 2023. The lack of weapons and, therefore, the lack of success have decreased the levels of optimism for Ukrainian soldiers in the war of attrition and, among other reasons, created additional problems for mobilization. U.S. President Joe Biden in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, U.S. on Jan. 10, 2025. (Leigh Vogel / UPI / Bloomberg via Getty Images)Khrystia VengryniukAuthor, and book publisher At the beginning of the war, I believed that NATO would intervene, protect us, that their planes would fly and close the sky over Ukraine, and that this hell would end very quickly. This did not happen. And when they were destroying Mariupol, I was simply convinced, minute to minute, from day to day, they would close the sky over at least this city, where thousands of people and children were killed every day. The world knew what was happening there, but no one intervened. Now they say that 117,000 people died in Mariupol, 15,000 of them children. This can only mean one thing &#x2014; everyone was afraid of Russia. They were so afraid that they could not even protect innocent civilians. But would we have survived as a state if it were not for America and Europe? No, we would not have survived. And the fact that we still exist is indeed a very great, if not the greatest, merit of the U.S. during the Biden presidency. All the weapons, aid, and sanctions from the U.S. helped us hold out. We lost 20% of our territory, we lost hundreds of thousands of people, but we are here and we will be, thanks to Joe Biden first and foremost. the chair of the parliament&apos;s foreign affairs policy I expected the outgoing U.S. president to devote more attention to Ukraine in his farewell speech. Ukraine was mentioned only once. I understand that it was worded very carefully, but it doesn&apos;t sound optimistic enough. It doesn&apos;t say something encouraging and certain about the future of Ukraine. I would like to hear from the outgoing president something more optimistic and encouraging, something like: &apos;The people of the U.S. will never leave Ukraine alone, and American friends of Ukraine will not allow anyone to throw Ukraine under the bus.&apos; This mention of Ukraine is just a statement of a fact, but it&apos;s not about our future. Just one mention of Ukraine after three years of difficult struggle is not enough. Biden knows that we are worried about our future in connection with the new administration, and a few more words of support and encouragement would be psychologically appropriate.	https://kyivindependent.com/its-not-enough-ukrainians-react-to-bidens-farewell-speech/	2025-01-17T10:44:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193208114.jpg
Ukraine ready to help Slovakia achieve energy stability, Zelensky says	Ukraine is ready for dialogue on energy security with Slovakia and can help it achieve energy stability, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 17 at a meeting with a delegation of the Progressive Slovakia political party, which is led by Michal Simecka. Zelensky&apos;s statement follows Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit via its territory, including supplies to Slovakia. Slovak Prime Minister Robet Fico has threatened to limit aid to Ukrainians and cut off electricity supplies due to the termination of Russian gas transit. Earlier on Jan. 17, pro-Western opposition leader Simecka arrived in Kyiv. The Slovak politician&apos;s visit comes a few days after Zelensky invited Fico to Ukraine&apos;s capital to discuss the energy situation. &quot;We are ready to help the Slovak people in ensuring their energy stability and security,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;It is very important for us to hear a signal from the Slovak people that you will also support Ukrainians on our path to the European Union and NATO. This is a key issue for us because of the war, because of the security guarantees that are very important for us.&quot; Zelensky added that the visit of the Slovak delegation &quot;is a signal&quot; that Slovakia will continue to support Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty and independence. The president also reminded that he had invited Fico to Kyiv. &quot;We were ready to host the leader of our friends from Slovakia but another leader arrived,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine did not renew a pre-war agreement to transit Russian gas to Europe via Ukrainian territory, instead allowing the deal to expire on Jan. 1. Kyiv warned repeatedly that it would not extend the deal in order to stop financing Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Fico and his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban have been among some of the most vocal opponents of Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit. Despite Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, Orban and Fico have continued to maintain friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting with him and promoting pro-Russian narratives in Europe. On Jan. 14, Slovakia&apos;s opposition parties announced plans to initiate a vote of no confidence in Fico&apos;s government, citing concerns over his governance and foreign policy direction.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-ready-to-help-slovakia-achieve-energy-stability-zelensky-says/	2025-01-17T10:25:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190701439.jpg

Basic military training to start in Ukrainian higher education institutions in September 2025	Basic general military training for students of Ukrainian higher education institutions will begin in September 2025, the Defense Ministry announced on Jan. 17. President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier approved amendments to the law on military duty and military service in Ukraine. The updated law stipulates systematic basic military training for students. The course will consist of 90 academic hours of theory study ,and 210 academic hours of practical training. The theory part is compulsory for both men and women, aged 18 to 25. The practical course is mandatory only for men. Women can attend it at their own request, having previously passed a medical examination. During the course, students will gain basic knowledge of tactical, intelligence, and psychological training, first aid, and the basics of military discipline. They will also master the skills of handling weapons, according to the ministry&apos;s statement. Following the basic military training, students will take the military oath, receive a certificate, and obtain a military specialization. Men who complete the course will become liable for military service, but according to the law on mobilization training and mobilization, they will not be drafted into the army until they are 25 years old. Up until that age, they can do so voluntarily. As the full-scale invasion broke out, the Ukrainian government began reviewing educational programs in schools and higher education institutions to ensure that civilians were better prepared for the challenges posed by the war. Starting in 2024, Ukrainian schools also launched a pilot program of the updated Defense of Ukraine subject, which has been taught since Soviet times. The updated program&apos;s subject will become mandatory in 2027.	https://kyivindependent.com/basic-general-military-training-to-start-in-ukrainian-higher-education-institutions-in-september-2025/	2025-01-17T07:54:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2136562481.jpg

Belarus Week: Belarus to host over 13,000 Russian troops for Zapad-2025 joint military drills	OSCE observers not invited to monitor upcoming presidential election in Belarus. Belarus to host over 13,000 Russian troops for Zapad-2025 joint military drills with Russia. Belarus sentences EU diplomatic staffer to four years in prison. Irregular crossings into EU from eastern borders more than triple in 2024, Frontex reports. Belarusian state TV airs a propaganda film with jailed journalists, attempting to discredit their coverage of 2020 elections ahead of upcoming vote. Belarusian opposition announced it will issue &#x201C;New Belarus&#x201D; passports, yet legal uncertainty remains for exiles. Minsk has not invited observers from the OSCE&#x2019;s Office for Democratic Institutions to monitor the upcoming presidential elections in Belarus, the OSCE announced on Jan. 9. The presidential elections, which are expected to provide Belarus&#x2019;s longtime dictator Alexander Lukashenko with a seventh term in office, are scheduled for Jan. 26. The poll, dismissed as a &#x201C;sham&#x201D; by the Belarusian opposition, will be the first presidential race since the 2020 election &#x2014; which sparked an unprecedented wave of anti-government protests and an ongoing domestic political crisis. The OSCE said Belarus&#x2019; decision not to invite its member states via the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) was &#x201C;regrettable&#x201D; and &#x201C;deprives the country&#x2019;s citizens of a transparent and full assessment of the entire process.&#x201D; &#x201C;The lack of transparency further undermines faith in the electoral system of Belarus,&#x201D; said OSCE PA President Pia Kauma. This is the third time the office will be unable to observe elections in Belarus since the contested 2020 vote &#x2014; it was not invited to observe the 2022 constitutional referendum or parliamentary elections. Speaking at a meeting with the chairs of regional executive committees on Jan. 3, Lukashenko mentioned the idea of inviting international observers, saying, &#x201C;We should meet with the Central Commission once again and decide whether we will invite these foreigners (Western observers) to the elections.&#x201D; However, Lukashenko raised the issue less than three weeks before the elections, with the key stages of the campaign &#x2014; the nomination of candidates, the formation of local electoral committees, and the selection of national observers &#x2014; already having been carried out. The rushed presidential election campaign is being held nearly half a year earlier than is stipulated in Belarus&#x2019;s election law. The Belarusian Central Election Committee (CEC) cleared the heads of three loyalist parties &#x2014; Aleh Haidukevich, Alexander Hizhnyak, and Siarhei Syrankou &#x2014; along with another sham candidate representing the so-called &#x201C;constructive opposition&#x201D; &#x2014; Hanna Kanapatskaya &#x2014; to &#x201C;challenge&#x201D; Lukashenko for the presidency. As of Jan. 8, the Belarusian Central Electoral Committee (CEC) had accredited 362 foreign observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Parliamentary Assembly of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (PA CSTO) &#x2014; all Russia-led international alliances favoring the Lukashenko regime. Among the 28,330 national observers, 79% come from political parties or pro-government professional unions, the independent news outlet Pozirk reports. Since 2020, Lukashenko has eliminated all but four loyal political parties and liquidated over 1,800 civil society organizations. The expert observation mission organized by the Viasna Human Rights Center and the Belarusian Helsinki Committee claims that the electoral campaign is organized in a &#x201C;repressive climate of threat, fear-mongering, pressure, and persecution in connection with any civil activity unauthorized by the state.&#x201D; Over 13,000 Russian troops will participate in the Zapad-2025 joint military exercise, the Belarusian Defense Ministry announced on Jan. 10, citing Major General Valery Revenka. Military allies Russia and Belarus have been conducting the Zapad (&#x201C;West&#x201D; in Russian) strategic drills every two years since 2009. Approximately 12,800 Russian soldiers were hosted in Belarus in 2021. Another military drill, &#x201C;Union Resolve 2022,&#x201D; followed the Zapad-2021, and was used to disguise a troop buildup on the Ukrainian border ahead of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022. In an interview with a state-owned TV channel, Major General Revenka said that Belarus has already notified OSCE member states about the drills in line with the Vienna Document, extending an invitation to &#x201C;allies, friends, partners&#x201D; to observe the exercises. According to Revenka, Belarus &#x201C;views positively&#x201D; only some EU and NATO member countries &#x2014; without specifying which ones. Noting that Belarus had not been invited to observe European military drills last year, Revenka said that a decision regarding an invitation to NATO members remained to be taken. The date of the Zapad-2025 drills has not officially been announced, but they are believed to be scheduled for September 2025. In October 2024, the Belarusian Air Force announced &#x201C;major drills with Russia in September 2025,&#x201D; right after a meeting of the joint board of the Belarusian and Russian Defense Ministries approved a concept plan for the Zapad-2025 joint strategic exercise. The Vienna Document on security and confidence-building requires its members to provide notification 42 days or more prior to holding military drills. Aside from Zapad-2025, Belarus plans to host three military drills &#x2014; Search, Interaction, and Echelon &#x2014; along with members of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), the Russia-led bloc Moscow set up in 2002, over a decade after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact. While not committing Belarusian troops to Russia&#x2019;s war on Ukraine, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko allowed Russia to use Belarusian territory as a jumping off point for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, provided supplies to the Russian army, and offered to host Russian tactical nuclear weapons. Minsk City Court has handed down a four-year prison sentence to a local staff member of the European Union&#x2019;s diplomatic service in Belarus, Politico reported on Jan. 9. The sentence, issued in late December 2024, has only now been made public. The court found the EU staffer, Mikalai Khilo, guilty of &#x201C;incitement of hatred and calls for actions harming Belarus&#x2019;s national security.&#x201D; The EU&#x2019;s External Action Service condemned the decision and reiterated calls for Khilo to be released. &#x201C;We continue calling for Mikalai Khilo&#x2019;s immediate and unconditional release,&#x201D; EU spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Anitta Hipper said in a statement shared with Politico. The EU diplomatic service previously called for Khilo&#x2019;s release ahead of his trial, which was held on Dec. 23. At the time, a Lithuanian member of the European Parliament, Petras Au&#x161;trevi&#x10D;ius, told Politico that Minsk was &#x201C;testing the EU&#x201D; by arresting its employee. He said Belarusian diplomats should be expelled from the EU if Khilo was convicted. Forty-one-year-old Khilo split his time between working for the EU diplomatic mission and serving as a preacher in a local Baptist church, as confirmed by CV (formerly known as Christian Vision) &#x2014; an international Christian ministry that monitors the repression of clergy and religious groups. &#xA0; According to an unnamed EU official, Khilo was detained by the Belarusian KGB security service in front of the EU delegation office on April 24, 2024. The Viasna Human Rights Center, a human rights organization based in Belarus, recognizes Khilo as a political prisoner. Although there have recently been eight rounds of pardons of political prisoners in Belarus, 1,240 political prisoners remain behind bars in the country. According to CV, 86 clergymen from various confessions are behind bars because of their public support for anti-government protests in 2020. The number of detected cases of migrants irregularly entering the European Union through its eastern borders more than tripled in 2024, to 17,000, the European border agency Frontex said in a report on Jan. 14. Following the introduction of European sanctions in 2021 over the contested 2020 presidential election and crackdown on dissent, the regime of Lukashenko orchestrated an artificial migration crisis, allowing migrants from the Middle East and African to storm Belarus-EU borders. Frontex preliminary data show that while the overall number of irregular border crossings to the European Union declined by 38% (returning to the post-pandemic level of 2021), the eastern border route (including Belarus and Ukraine) bucked the general trend: There were 17,000 illegal crossings of the bloc&#x2019;s eastern border out of a total of 239,000 crossings recorded in Europe last year.

(Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images)In 2021, the EU recorded 8,000 illegal crossings of its eastern border, in what Frontex monitoring described as a &#x201C;hybrid operation targeting the EU external border.&#x201D; Following an initial settlement that led to a decline in the registered irregular border crossings to 5,608 in 2023, the artificial migration crisis reignited again, with Russia joining the effort. In late 2024, the EU authorities revealed that 90% of the migrants arriving via Belarus had Russian student or travel visas. The bloc pledged 170 million euros to its eastern members &#x2014; Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Estonia, and Finland &#x2014; and to Norway to fortify their borders. As &#x201C;hybrid warfare&#x201D; involving migrants continues, the border security agencies of Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia have thwarted a total of 36,291 attempts to illegally cross their borders from Belarus in 2024. In 2024, Poland reimposed a 200-meter-wide buffer zone next to its border with Belarus, and considered temporarily suspending the right to asylum. The Belarusian state-owned TV channel ONT aired on Jan. 14 the first segment of propaganda interviews with journalists held in Belarusian prisons, in an apparent attempt to discredit the work of independent media during the 2020 presidential elections. In the aftermath of the 2020 presidential elections in Belarus, widely viewed as neither free nor fair, the free media field in Belarus was eradicated. Thirty-seven journalists remain behind bars on politically motivated charges, and hundreds were forced into exile. In 2024 alone, 35 independent media were branded as &#x201C;extremist&#x201D; and banned in Belarus. The first part of the series &#x201C;about employees of American Media,&#x201D; was filmed in prisons, yet is titled &#x201C;Freedom of Speech.&#x201D; RFE/RL&#x2019;s Belarus Service freelancer and political prisoner Andrey Kuznechyk, who was charged with six years of imprisonment for allegedly &#x201C;creating and participating in an extremist formation.&#x201D; In the interview, Kuznechyk appears in a black robe in the prison yard, looking emaciated. The interviewer urges him to condemn the independent media in Belarus for biased coverage and &#x201C;trying to set Belarus on fire&#x201D; during the 2020 elections. The program is airing ahead of the Jan. 26 presidential elections, the first presidential vote since the contested 2020 race, which is expected to provide Lukashenko with a seventh consecutive term in office. After winning the country&#x2019;s first and last fair election in 1994, Lukashenko remained in power for 30 years, gradually giving up parts of Belarusian sovereignty to Russia. Other segments are to feature RFE/RL Belarus Service journalist Ihar Losik, who has been held incommunicado for nearly two years, as well as former reporter Ihar Karney and opposition activist Yuras Zyankovich, who hold dual citizenship of Belarus and the United States. The international press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) &#xA0;placed Belarus 167th out of 180 countries in its 2024 Press Freedom Index, calling the country the fourth largest jailer of journalists in the world, and Europe&apos;s most dangerous country for journalists up until Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine. Political opponents of the regime of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko will start accepting applications for the alternative identity documents for exiled Belarusians on Jan. 26, Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya has announced on her Telegram channel. In September 2023, Lukashenko barred Belarusian embassies from issuing or renewing passports of Belarusians living abroad, forcing the regime&#x2019;s critics to return to Belarus &#x2014; risking arrest &#x2014; to renew their essential documents. As a result of Lukashenko&#x2019;s move, over 300,000 exiles who have fled Belarus since the contested 2020 elections risk finding themselves in legal limbo, unable to prove their identity, renew residence permits, or access essential services in host countries with expired passports. In response, the Belarusian opposition in exile announced the &#x201C;New Belarus&#x201D; passport project in 2023, but there was little progress on it in 2024. After a change of leadership of the project and a scandal involving the Lithuanian contractor for producing the passports &#x2014; which was found to have ties with the Lukashenko regime &#x2014; the opposition has since produced the first prototypes of the passport. However, the new document has yet to be recognized as suitable for travel or as official proof of identity, and it will initially be available only to EU-based Belarusians due to verification constraints, according to project head Marius Gudelaitis. Franak Viachorka, a chief advisor to Tsikhanouskaya, said that the passports will have &#x201C;specific functionality&#x201D; within a year. &#x201C;Our goal is that this document can replace a foreign passport, be used for travel, and also replace expired (Belarusian) passports when submitting documents for legalization, for example,&#x201D; Viachorka told news outlet Zerkalo. However, the former head of the passport project, Valery Kavaleuski, who earlier resigned from Tsikhanouskaya&#x2019;s Transitional Cabinet, has warned that gaining recognition for the document under present conditions is unlikely. According to Kavaleuski, the issuing center has had to undergo an independent audit before issuing the documents. Besides, the passport will reportedly use a new country code, instead of the existing Belarusian one, which Kavaleuski described as a &quot;dead end&quot; for the recognition process. The passport will be presented to the public at the &#x201C;Belarusians Deserve Better&#x201D; congress in Warsaw, Poland on Jan. 26 &#x2013; the same day as Lukashenko&apos;s latest presidential election, which has been dismissed as a sham by the Belarusian opposition. Meanwhile, Belarusian prosecutors have already issued warnings that congress participants could face criminal prosecution.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-week-belarus-to-host-over-13-000-russian-troops-for-zapad-2025-joint-military-drills/	2025-01-17T07:41:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2176902499.jpg
Hungary's Orban urges EU to lift Russia sanctions, media reports	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban urged the European Union to lift sanctions on Russia, news portal Telex reported on Jan. 17. According to the Hungarian outlet, Orban said it&apos;s &quot;time to throw sanctions out the window&quot; and establish a sanctions-free relationship with Russia during a radio interview. He also described the European Union as being in a &quot;drunken stage&quot; but predicted a &quot;sobering up&quot; in Brussels. The statements come as Orban reportedly told EU leaders he plans to wait until U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office before deciding on extending the bloc&apos;s sanctions against Russia, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 19. Orban, whose government is widely regarded as the EU&apos;s most Russia-friendly, has repeatedly criticized aid for Ukraine, arguing it prolongs and escalates the war. &quot;If they hadn&#x2019;t cheated in 2020, Donald Trump would have remained president, and then there would be no Ukrainian-Russian war,&quot; he said, referencing false claims that President Joe Biden stole the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Orban framed peace in Ukraine as essential to Hungary&apos;s economic goals, saying that European perspectives on Ukraine should go beyond the &quot;lens of war.&quot; Orban also announced plans for protective economic measures to &quot;safeguard&quot; Hungarian agricultural sectors, citing Ukraine as a potential economic threat to Europe. Orban&apos;s remarks come amid strained relations between Hungary and the EU. In July, the European Commission criticized Hungary for failing to meet democratic standards, particularly regarding political financing, conflicts of interest, and media independence. Opposition leader Peter Magyar called for early elections on Jan. 1, citing Orban&apos;s declining popularity and allegations of corruption, which Magyar claims have turned Hungary into &quot;the EU&apos;s poorest, most corrupt nation.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/hungarys-orban-urges-eu-to-lift-sanctions-restore-ties-with-russia-media-reports/	2025-01-17T07:25:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190447641.jpg
How will Russia’s war end?	Incoming U.S. President Donald Trump promised to end the Ukraine-Russia war during his campaign. As inauguration approaches on Jan. 20, the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Francis Farrell lays out the four scenarios that could see an end to the war in Ukraine &#x2014; for better or worse.	https://kyivindependent.com/how-will-russias-war-end/	2025-01-17T07:04:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/4-1.jpg
Ukrainian special forces target Russian soldiers behind POW executions — several reportedly killed, captured	Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces reported on Jan. 17 that they had located and targeted Russian soldiers responsible for executing two Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs). According to the unit, several were killed, and three were captured. The detainees are reportedly providing testimony. The targeted Russian soldiers had allegedly taken two Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces fighters captive days earlier, later executing them on the orders of their company commander, the Special Operations Forces said. The unit conducted an operation to eliminate the group, recover the bodies of the Ukrainian soldiers, and capture any surviving members. The captured Russians were identified as marines from the 40th Arctic Brigade. During interrogations, they allegedly admitted to taking the Ukrainian POWs and executing them under orders. Ukrainian forces reportedly killed three members of the firing squad during the operation, while three others, including one identified by the call sign &quot;Yaryy,&quot; were captured. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify the claims. Throughout the full-scale war, Ukraine has documented widespread violations of the Geneva Conventions by Russian forces, including the execution of at least 124 Ukrainian POWs, according to the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. Reports of torture, murder, and abuse of Ukrainian captives &#x2014; particularly in Donetsk Oblast &#x2014; have surged in recent months. Visual evidence of these atrocities continues to emerge, underscoring Russia&apos;s disregard for international law.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-targets-russian-soldiers-behind-pow-executions-several-killed-captured/	2025-01-17T06:53:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-17-at-1_45_03-PM.jpeg
Russia’s seaborne oil exports decline 9.1% in 2024 amid Ukrainian drone attacks, Reuters reports	Russia&apos;s seaborne exports of petroleum products declined by 9.1% to 113.7 million metric tons in 2024, reflecting mounting challenges to its fossil fuel industry, Reuters reported on Jan. 17. Ukraine has targeted Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure as part of its strategy to undermine a key funding source for Russia&apos;s war effort. Drone strikes on refineries in Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk have led to reductions or suspensions in operations. Russian refineries reportedly processed approximately 267 million metric tons of oil in 2024, the lowest since 2012, as rising production costs, falling prices, and an export ban on gasoline strained operations. Exports through Baltic ports fell by 9% to 61.96 million tons, while shipments via Black and Azov Sea ports dropped 10% to 42.75 million tons. Notably, exports from Tuapse plummeted by a third to 9.1 million tons, largely due to drone attacks and operational disruptions at state-owned Rosneft refineries. Exports from Novorossiysk increased by 4% to 19 million tons. Arctic ports, including Murmansk and Arkhangelsk, saw a 14% decline in exports to 1.01 million tons, while Far Eastern ports experienced a 3% drop to 7.97 million tons. Despite the overall annual decline, marine exports of petroleum products rose 10.8% in December to 10.37 million tons. Sanctions from the Biden administration and the U.K., announced on Jan. 10, have further pressured Russia&apos;s oil sector. These measures target nearly 200 vessels in the &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; key oil companies, and associated entities. The sanctions have driven Brent crude prices up by nearly $5 per barrel. G7 nations are reportedly considering tightening the $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian oil.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-marine-oil-exports-decline-9-1-in-2024-amid-ukraines-attacks-reuters-reports/	2025-01-17T05:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/Rosneft.jpg
Europe needs plans A, B, and C for Trump and Russia	Listening to the confirmation hearings of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s various appointees in Congress this week, it&apos;s becoming clear there is no meaningful grand plan from Trump to end the war in Ukraine quickly. In fact, Trump, along with figures like Keith Kellogg, the incoming Ukraine envoy, has backtracked from claiming the war could be ended in days &#x2014; around the time of the inauguration &#x2014; to acknowledging it may take months. This suggests they are still searching for a strategy. There is a genuine desire to end the war, as Trump says, to &quot;stop the killing&quot; and reduce the U.S. budget burden. For some hardline MAGA China hawks (such as former White House chief strategic Steve Bannon), there&apos;s also a desire to strike a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, possibly in a Nixonian way, realigning for an eventual confrontation with China. These hawks often envision a world where the West and Russia form a Judeo-Christian alliance against China&#x2019;s non-believers. For Trump, the solution seems simplistic: give Putin some &#x201C;wins&#x201D; &#x2014; allowing him to keep the territories he holds, blocking NATO membership for Ukraine, restricting Ukraine&apos;s use of Western long-range missiles, and moderating sanctions. In return, Trump believes Putin would halt the war. The assumption here is that Ukraine&#x2019;s victory would simply be Putin halting offensive military actions. This is naive. It overlooks Ukraine&#x2019;s security, which is central to both its stability and Europe&#x2019;s security. Trump&#x2019;s recent comments about territorial claims on Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal suggest he shares Putin&#x2019;s long-held view that great powers deserve &#x201C;spheres of influence.&#x201D; This could indicate that Trump might even entertain a &quot;Yalta 2&quot; scenario, where Putin gets Ukraine, and Trump gains Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal. The question remains &#x2014; would Chinese President Xi Jinping be invited to the table, and what would he get? The issue from the perspective of long-term Putin watchers is that such a deal wouldn&#x2019;t satisfy Putin. He would take everything Trump offers, then push for more. This is the pattern of all Putin&#x2019;s conflicts, from Georgia to Moldova, Ukraine, Syria, and Libya. For Putin, it&#x2019;s not just about territory &#x2014; it&apos;s about eradicating the very system of Western liberal market democracy. Putin&apos;s invasion of Ukraine wasn&#x2019;t about NATO membership &#x2014; an unrealistic prospect in 2014. It was about the threat posed by Ukraine&#x2019;s shift from a Russian client state under then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych to a potential member of the Western club of liberal market democracies with the 2013 EU association agreement. Putin feared that if Ukraine succeeded in adopting a democratic, rules-based order, Russians would demand the same, threatening his own rule. It is democracy, not NATO, that Putin despises. He&#x2019;s in an existential battle with the West &#x2014; it&#x2019;s kill or be killed. Trump simply doesn&#x2019;t understand this, or doesn&#x2019;t care. Putin will not stop at a &#x201C;Yalta 2.&#x201D; He seeks total victory over the West. What Trump doesn&#x2019;t grasp is that unless any peace deal ensures Ukraine&#x2019;s security from future attack, Putin will inevitably use any perceived weakness as an excuse for further military invasions. This reality means Ukraine won&#x2019;t receive the investment necessary for its economic development. Without this, Ukraine risks repeating the 22 years of failed economic progress between 1991 and 2013, a period when it remained caught between East and West without a clear anchor, leading to social and political instability.

(Mathilde Kaczkowski /Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images)Ask why Ukraine had two revolutions in 2004-2005 and again in 2014. History will surely repeat itself if millions of soldiers and migrants return to disappointment, leading to further instability that Putin could exploit, either to influence Ukrainian politics or justify future invasions. Trump isn&#x2019;t going to provide the leadership Ukraine or European security needs. Yes, his call for European partners to boost defense spending to 5% of GDP is a bold one, but because Trump will likely fail in his peace plan for Ukraine, Europe must take the lead &#x2014; and perhaps should have done so already. Europe needs Plans A, B, and C. Plan A: Educate Trump about the importance of securing a lasting peace for Ukraine. The pitch to Trump should focus on his aversion to failure. He must be told that if Ukraine lacks the security to fend off Putin, it could collapse entirely. This would be devastating for Europe, as millions of migrants would move westward, destabilizing European economies and their social fabric. A weakened Europe would become a reduced market for U.S. goods and a less valuable long-term ally in the looming battle with China. All this would happen on Trump&#x2019;s watch &#x2014; it would make Biden&#x2019;s failure in Afghanistan look like a sideshow. Plan B: Emphasize how ensuring Ukraine&#x2019;s security could benefit the U.S. economy. Ukraine has proven capable of defending itself but could have already won the war with timely, well-supplied Western &#x2014; mainly U.S. &#x2014; military support. NATO membership and bilateral security agreements are desirable but unlikely given the politics. Better for Ukraine to trust in its own defense, provided it is assured the necessary military technology and kit will be delivered. The U.S. defense industry is the only one capable of supplying these. Europe, a $26 trillion economy, is more than capable of funding this effort &#x2014; likely around $150 billion annually, a modest price considering that each 1% increase in NATO spending, due to the Russian threat, costs Europe $250 billion per year. Europe could even fund increased defense spending by unlocking $330 billion in frozen Russian assets, dedicating a significant portion to purchasing U.S. military equipment. Europe should also play to Trump&#x2019;s ego. Pledge a ten-year, $1 trillion European-Ukrainian U.S. defense purchasing program, naming it the &quot;Trump Defense of Democracy in Europe&quot; program &#x2014; a modern-day Marshall Plan. Plan C: Prepare for Trump&#x2019;s potential failure and a bad peace deal that could lead to Ukraine&#x2019;s eventual defeat. If this occurs, Europe must step up financial and arms supplies to Ukraine, buying time to ramp up its own defense capacity to 4-5% of GDP. At the same time, Europe should maintain sanctions against Russia, regardless of U.S. actions. If the U.S. doesn&#x2019;t provide support, Europe should explore diplomatic, economic, and security ties with other powers like Turkey and even China. Though China poses a strategic threat to the U.S., for Europe, Russia remains the primary concern.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-needs-plans-a-b-and-c-for-trump-and-russia/	2025-01-17T05:26:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2179656491.jpg
Slovak opposition leader arrives in Kyiv to 'reopen door Fico slammed'	A Slovak delegation headed by pro-Western opposition leader Michal Simecka of Progressive Slovakia party arrived in Kyiv on Jan. 17, he said on social media. &quot;Our goal is clear &#x2014; to reopen the door that Robert Fico slammed with his aggressive outbursts,&quot; Simecka wrote, who in turn initiated a confidence vote set for next week. His visit comes days after President Volodymyr Zelensky invited Fico to visit Kyiv on Jan. 17 amid the Slovak prime minister&apos;s threats to limit aid to Ukrainians and cut off electricity supplies due to the termination of Russian gas transit through Ukraine to Europe. Fico said on Jan. 16 he may meet with Zelensky in the &quot;next few days.&quot; According to the opposition leader, the Slovak delegation is planning to hold &quot;important talks&quot; with a Ukrainian side. &quot;Slovakia and Ukraine are close partners and can help each other a great deal,&quot; he said. Ukraine did not renew a pre-war agreement to transit Russian gas to Europe via Ukrainian territory, instead allowing the deal to expire on Jan. 1. Kyiv warned repeatedly that it would not extend the deal in order to stop financing Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Fico and his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban have been among some of the most vocal opponents of Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit. Despite Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, Orban and Fico have continued to maintain friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting with him, and promoting pro-Russian narratives in Europe. On Jan. 14, Slovakia&apos;s opposition parties announced plans to initiate a vote of no confidence in Fico&apos;s government, citing concerns over his governance and foreign policy direction. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/slovak-opposition-leader-arrives-in-kyiv-to-reopen-door-fico-slammed/	2025-01-17T04:54:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/--------------2025-01-17-140018.png
First Deputy Education and Science Minister: Rebuilding Ukraine, one classroom at a time	The Economist recently reported that Ukraine is winning the economic war against Russia for the first time since the full-scale invasion began. Although the country has yet to return to its pre-war economic levels, the trajectory is promising. To sustain and accelerate this momentum, strategic investments, particularly in education, are crucial. Investments in education have a multiplier effect, acting as a key driver of long-term economic growth. International support for Ukraine&#x2019;s education sector is vital not just for recovery but for the social capital necessary for enduring progress. As Ukraine enters its third year of full-scale war, the education system continues to operate under extraordinary circumstances. At the start of last year, one in seven schools was destroyed or damaged, and over 1.8 million students lost access to in-person education. The true cost, however, goes beyond physical destruction. It includes disrupted learning, emotional tolls on children, and the disconnection of students in occupied territories or abroad. Despite these challenges, Ukraine has made significant strides in restoring education, prioritizing in-person learning where possible. These efforts have been bolstered by a 40% increase in state education funding over the past two years and substantial international support. For the past year and a half, I&#x2019;ve worked at Ukraine&#x2019;s Ministry of Education and Science, promoting what I call &#x201C;educational diplomacy&#x201D; &#x2014; advocating for Ukraine&#x2019;s needs on global platforms and mobilizing resources. Today, 35 countries and more than 80 international organizations are helping support Ukrainian education, including leaders from UNICEF, UNESCO, the World Bank, and the Global Partnership for Education (GPE). This international collaboration is delivering tangible results that extend beyond financial contributions, translating into concrete initiatives that impact students and teachers, laying a strong foundation for Ukraine&#x2019;s recovery and future development. In wartime, education &#x2014; a fundamental right &#x2014; is often one of the first casualties. Restoring it requires both innovation and collaboration. For example, the Device Coalition and international partners have provided over 247,990 devices since 2022, particularly to students in front-line and border areas, ensuring access to online learning. Workers clear debris from a school building damaged by a missile attack in Kramatorsk, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on April 24, 2023, amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. (Anatolii Stepanov/AFP via Getty Images)Safe in-person learning also depends on the availability of shelters. In response, the Ukrainian government allocated $178 million for the construction of underground schools in 2024, with $147 million more planned for 2025. &#xA0;Together with the support of partners such as the European Union, Belgium, Lithuania, UNESCO, and UNITED24 donors, we will be able to help over 100,000 children return to school. Additionally, the Coalition for Textbooks has distributed more than 7.5 million books to ensure students have the resources to thrive. Key funding initiatives include a $28.2 million collaboration with GPE and a $21 million project with Education Cannot Wait, focused on Ukraine&#x2019;s most affected regions. Looking to the future, Ukraine is aligning its education system with European Union standards and investing in its human capital. For instance, UNICEF is supporting reforms in preschool and inclusive education, while the World Bank has provided unprecedented financial backing for general secondary education. I recall the early days of my tenure when our team traveled to Washington to discuss education funding with the World Bank. What seemed an uphill battle led to the groundbreaking $415 million LEARN project &#x2014; one of the largest in the World Bank&#x2019;s portfolio &#x2014; supporting the New Ukrainian School (NUS) reform and marking the first significant World Bank funding for Ukrainian schools in over a decade. Ukraine&#x2019;s educational transformation extends beyond recovery. By 2027, the country will adopt a European-style 12-year education model. Vocational education is being revitalized with support from Swiss experts and DECIDE, while higher education reform is being advanced through a $200 million program in partnership with the World Bank. Throughout the war, Ukraine continues to develop sustainable educational reforms. A $2.7 million capacity-building grant from GPE is one of the resources enabling these efforts. Building international partnerships is a long and rewarding process. Behind every achievement is a great deal of coordination, advocacy, and collaboration. These partnerships are built on mutual trust, shared vision, and a deep commitment to Ukraine&#x2019;s future. Educational diplomacy is a two-way street, and we are committed to being a reliable and innovative partner, sharing our expertise gained through adversity. Ukraine&#x2019;s experience is unique: despite the devastation of war, we are not only restoring education but also laying the groundwork for a stronger, more resilient future. This progress would not be possible without the collective efforts of the global community. The quality of Ukraine&#x2019;s education system reflects the strength of international cooperation and the shared commitment to achieving sustainable development goals. By investing in Ukrainian education today, we are shaping a brighter future for both our country and the world. To all those who stand with us, I extend my deepest gratitude.

The flaws in Ukraine's new brigades and foreign training programs	Newly formed brigades within the Ukrainian military face critical challenges on the front lines. Poor management, lack of experience, and inadequate training have resulted in territorial losses, damaged equipment, and tragic casualties. NATO&#x2019;s training methods often fail to align with the realities of modern warfare. Despite receiving advanced equipment and personnel, these brigades falter due to weak coordination and leadership. These units lack a solid command and control &#x201C;backbone.&#x201D; Their core comprises reserve officers, officers from non-combat roles, and individuals promoted despite prior underperformance in combat positions. One of the most striking examples is the 155th Mechanized Brigade. Despite receiving modern equipment, training in France, and near full staffing, the unit&#x2019;s command lacked experience and an understanding of combat management, organization, and critical support elements, rendering it ineffective. Over 1,700 soldiers have gone AWOL (absent without leave). These brigades are often redeployed to the front, far from their assigned sectors. After gaining some battlefield experience within &#x201C;established&#x201D; brigades, they are stripped of equipment, weapons, and personnel. I know of approximately 10 such brigades operating under these conditions. Commanders are chosen by military leadership, and Western partners equip these units with advanced weaponry, including armored personnel carriers, infantry fighting vehicles, and tanks. However, most soldiers lack the training to effectively operate this equipment in combat. Instead, experienced specialists in the established brigades, who know how to operate such weapons, are temporarily assigned to infantry roles. Artillerymen, mechanics, anti-tank gunners, and drone operators are placed in infantry positions due to limited expertise elsewhere. New equipment, like Mk 19 grenade launchers and M2 Browning machine guns, replace older systems, like T-64 tanks and AGS-17 grenade launchers &#x2014; but only temporarily. In Europe, soldiers may learn basic skills like shooting rifles and throwing grenades, but this accounts for only 10-15% of what is needed to survive. To endure on the battlefield, an infantryman must know how to camouflage, maneuver, set up positions, counter drones, provide medical aid, conduct surveillance, report accurately, and coordinate with comrades. Trust in leadership, which ensures comprehensive planning and support, is paramount. Unfortunately, such vital training is often neglected abroad and exists in Ukraine only within seasoned units. For example, officers of the 155th Mechanized Brigade were unable to lead troops to positions near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast because their transport lacked a radio-electronic warfare system, leaving them unable to navigate safely. Driving unarmored vehicles to the front is perilous, and even military buses are unsafe just 10 kilometers from the front line. An infantryman typically receives an assault rifle, four magazines, body armor, a helmet, a first aid kit, and a uniform. Yet, survival also requires radios, extra batteries, tablets, additional magazines, grenades, shovels, trench radio-electronic warfare systems, and drones like the Mavic. Volunteers and soldiers&apos; families supply most of these essentials &#x2014; everything except the grenades. Photo for illustrative purposes: A recruit from the 108th Separate Mechanized Battalion &quot;Da Vinci Wolves&quot; trains to operate drones in central Ukraine on March 12, 2024. (Valentyna Polishchuk / Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)When a soldier joins a unit equipped with adequate resources and confident leadership, he will do everything to stay. Conversely, soldiers sent to positions immediately after European training or basic military training in Ukraine, without further preparation, often face fatal outcomes or abandon their posts. Time that could have been spent on coordination, adaptation, and effective task distribution was squandered. This failure to prepare has resulted in poorly motivated, untrained soldiers, leading to operational setbacks and heavy casualties. The realities of modern warfare show that foreign training, unless adapted to Ukrainian conditions and integrated with unit practices, is not only ineffective but dangerous. Ironically, our soldiers &#x2014; mechanics, drivers, tankers, artillerymen, grenade launchers, and machine gunners &#x2014; often teach NATO instructors how to operate the equipment provided. All we truly need from our partners is a proper maintenance manual. Substantial reforms are urgently needed in Ukraine&#x2019;s basic combat training. However, no reforms can succeed without commanders who earn the trust of soldiers and volunteers alike. The absence of this trust has led many soldiers to leave struggling brigades in favor of units with better leadership, taking advantage of laws decriminalizing initial desertion. Resources &#x2014; both personnel and equipment &#x2014; must be allocated to units that prioritize the lives of Ukrainian soldiers and deliver results.

Russian attack on Kryvyi Rih kills 4, injures 3, damages educational institution	Russia launched a missile attack on Kryvyi Rih, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, on Jan. 17, resulting in the deaths of four people and leaving at least three others injured, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Lysak said the attack damaged an educational institution and a residential building. Local authorities are assessing the full scope of casualties and damage. According to the governor, the injured are a 22-year-old woman and two men, aged 34 and 56, all of whom are in critical condition. The Ukrainian Air Force had earlier warned of a ballistic threat and detected a high-speed target heading toward the city. An air alert remains active in the region, with Lysak urging residents to stay in shelters until it is lifted. 0:00/1&#xD7;Video showing the aftermath of the Russian missile attack on Kryvyi Rih, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, on Jan. 17 (Governor Serhii Lysak / Telegram)Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s hometown, is a frequent target of Russian missile strikes.

US assured Putin no nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Biden says	The United States assured Russian President Vladimir Putin it would not deploy nuclear weapons in Ukraine, outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden said in a Jan. 17 interview with MSNBC. &quot;Tactical nuclear in Europe scares the hell out of everybody, including the Russians,&quot; he said. Biden recounted conversations with Putin, during which the Russian leader emphasized demands to keep nuclear weapons out of Ukraine and block Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership. &quot;I said, &apos;(Nuclear weapons are) not a problem. We&apos;ve already taken the nuclear weapons out. There&apos;s none there. We&apos;re not gonna put them back in,&apos;&quot; Biden responded, without provided the date when such a conversation had occurred. The U.S. president further criticized Putin&apos;s ambitions: &quot;All he wants to do is re-establish the Warsaw Pact. I can&apos;t let that happen. This guy is not a good guy.&quot; These discussions reflect long-standing tensions over Ukraine&apos;s security, which were central to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. Under the agreement, Ukraine relinquished its nuclear arsenal &#x2014; the world&apos;s third-largest &#x2014; in exchange for assurances from the U.S., U.K., and Russia not to use force or economic coercion against Ukraine. Despite these commitments, Russia launched a war against Ukraine and has repeatedly issued nuclear threats against Ukraine and its allies. In November, Putin approved an updated nuclear doctrine, which snow allows Moscow to use nuclear arms against non-nuclear states. Russia later launched the intermediate-range ballistic missile &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; designed for nuclear weapons. A November survey by Russia&apos;s independent Levada Center revealed that 39% of Russians believe nuclear weapons use could be justified in the ongoing war against Ukraine, reflecting the domestic impact of Kremlin rhetoric.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-assured-putin-no-nuclear-weapons-in-ukraine-biden-says/	2025-01-17T03:28:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184603402.jpg
There's no evidence that Australian fighter was executed by Russia, prosecutors told media	Australian volunteer soldier Oscar Jenkins has the status of a prisoner of war (POW) and there is no confirmation of his death, a Ukrainian investigative journalism outlet Slidstvo.Info reported on Jan. 17, citing the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. The news comes after reports that the body of Jenkins, a 32-year-old teacher from Melbourne whose capture was reported in December, has been found. He was believed to have been executed by his Russian captors. Some media outlets and Telegram channels published a video purporting to show bodies of soldiers, claiming that Jenkins was among them. Slidstvo.Info verified that footage was published four years ago on an Iranian website. The description says that it was filmed in Nagorno-Karabakh, and the original video is in Armenian instead of Russian. Jenkins is serving in the 402nd Separate Rifle Battalion, which is part of Ukraine&apos;s 66th Separate Mechanized Brigade, the outlet wrote. He went missing on Dec. 16 in 2024 while being on a combat mission near the village of Mykolaivka in Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces Command told Slidstvo.Info. &quot;There has been no transfer of the body (of Oscar Jenkins),&quot; the military said. The Kyiv Independent has contacted the Australian Embassy in Kyiv and the Ukrainian authorities but has not received a response at the time of publication. The Geneva Conventions mandate all warring parties to treat POW with respect and dignity, while executing POWs is considered a gross violation of international law and a war crime. Russia has been repeatedly accused of summarily executing Ukrainian POWs throughout the war. Moscow calls foreign volunteers &quot;mercenaries&quot; and claims they are not entitled to protection under the Geneva Conventions. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese pledged the &quot;strongest action possible&quot; if reports of an Australian national captured while fighting for Ukraine being executed by Russian forces are confirmed. Australia&apos;s Foreign Ministry has also summoned the Russian ambassador on Jan. 15 to demand information and stress compliance with international law.	https://kyivindependent.com/no-evidence-that-australian-volunteer-was-executed-by-russia/	2025-01-17T02:58:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Oscar-Jenkins-1.png
Trump has opportunity to 'negotiate a good deal' in Ukraine, Blinken says	The incoming Trump administration will be in a position to broker a &quot;good&quot; and &quot;strong&quot; peace deal in Ukraine, provided that Kyiv agrees, outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a press briefing on Jan. 16. &quot;So I believe that the incoming administration is in a position where, if the Ukrainians so desire and so choose, it can help to negotiate a good deal,&quot; Blinken said after commenting that thanks to the Biden administration and international partners, Russia has failed to subdue Ukraine. &quot;And President (Donald) Trump talks about having good, strong deals. &#xA0;I think there&#x2019;s an opportunity to get one.&quot; Trump, taking office on Jan. 20, has pledged to swiftly push for a peace settlement in the Russia-Ukraine war after taking office, prompting fears he might pressure Kyiv toward painful concessions. His team signaled that the new administration would seek to preserve Ukraine&apos;s independence, though Blinken&apos;s expected successor, Marco Rubio, said that both Kyiv and Moscow would have to make concessions to achieve a peace deal. Since invading Ukraine in 2014 and escalating its war of aggression in 2022, Russia has occupied about 20% of Ukrainian territory, imposing repressive measures on the local population and prohibiting any expressions of Ukrainian identity. Ukraine has repeatedly said it would not recognize its territory currently under Moscow&apos;s control as Russian. Blinken noted that any potential ceasefire must be enduring and not simply a pause that will give Russian President Vladimir Putin a chance to &quot;rest, refit, and then when he deems the moment right, re-attack.&quot; &quot;So you have to have built into any ceasefire the effective deterrence necessary so that he doesn&#x2019;t re-attack. &#xA0;That is, I think, a necessary part of any good, strong deal for Ukraine,&quot; the chief U.S. diplomat said. The secretary of state also highlighted the Biden administration&apos;s efforts to put Ukraine into the strongest possible position in any peace talks, stressing that Russia suffered massive battlefield losses and faces mounting economic difficulties. &quot;The losses that Russia has incurred are almost unimaginable &#x2013; I think, by some assessments, 700,000-800,000 casualties. &#xA0;That includes those killed and those wounded,&quot; Blinken said. The Biden administration ramped up its support for Ukraine since Trump&apos;s reelection, announcing several major packages of security assistance, easing restrictions on long-range strikes inside Russia, and imposing sweeping sanctions on the Russian energy sector.	https://kyivindependent.com/blinken-on-trump-ukraine-deal/	2025-01-17T01:58:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160746692.jpg
Ukraine produced over 30,000 bomber drones in 2024, minister says	Ukraine produced more than 30,000 bomber drones in 2024, Ukraine&apos;s Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin said on Jan. 16, as unmanned systems become an increasingly vital capability in the war with Russia. The bomber drones were created during Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and operate mainly at night. They can also remotely disperse mines or transport ammunition, food, and medicine to Ukrainian positions. Due to their ability to strike at night, Russian soldiers reportedly dub these drones &quot;Baba Yaga,&quot; after a mythical witch. &quot;There are already dozens of bomber drones in Ukraine, and more than 30,000 pieces were produced last year,&quot; Smetanin said. These, as well as several other reconnaissance drones, were presented to President Volodymyr Zelensky and the U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer during the latter&apos;s visit to Kyiv on Jan. 16. According to Smetanin, Kyiv and London also developed a carrier platform for first-person-view (FPV) drones. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks by Ukrainian troops. Kyiv delivered more than 200,000 domestically-produced drones to front-line units as of the end of 2024, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-produced-over-30-000-bomber-drones-in-2024-minister-says/	2025-01-17T01:23:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-16_21-40-22.jpg
Navalny's lawyers sentenced to 3.5-5.5 years in prison	A court in Russia&apos;s Vladimir Oblast sentenced three former lawyers of late opposition leader Alexei Navalny to between three and a half and five and half years in prison, the independent news outlet Mediazona reported on Jan. 17. Vadim Kobzev, Alexei Liptser, and Igor Sergunin were sentenced after a closed-door trial on &quot;extremism&quot; charges over their involvement with Navalny&apos;s Anti-Corruption Foundation. The foundation was the flagship project of Navalny, Russia&apos;s most known opposition leader, who died under unclear circumstances in a Russian prison colony in February 2024. The news underscores Russia&apos;s increasingly harsh repressions against domestic opposition, which only escalated with the outbreak of the full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022. &quot;Extremism&quot; charges are widely seen as a tool to suppress and scare off voices that criticize the current leadership or Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. Kobzev was sentenced to five and half years, Liptser to five years, and Sergunin to three and half years in prison. They sare also barred from practicing law for three years after the completion of their prison sentences. The three were detained in October 2023 after being accused of &quot;using their status&quot; as lawyers to facilitate communication between imprisoned Navalny and his organization, labeled as &quot;extremist&quot; by Russian authorities, Meduza reported. Launched in 2011, the Anti-Corruption Foundation has published investigations into suspected corruption among top Russian officials, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and former President Dmitry Medvedev. Russia designated the group as &quot;extremist&quot; and formally dissolved it in 2021. The foundation was relaunched as an international organization the following year. Olga Mikhailova and Alexander Fedolov, two other Navalny&apos;s ex-lawyers charged with &quot;extremism,&quot; have left Russia and are wanted by Russian authorities. Moscow&apos;s crackdown targets other prominent opposition figures as well. On Jan. 16, Russian law enforcement officers raided the home of oppositionist Illia Yashin&apos;s parents. Yashin was previously sentenced to eight and half years in 2022 for denouncing Russia&apos;s war crimes in Ukraine. He was released during a large-scale prisoner exchange between Moscow and the West in August 2024 and now resides abroad.	https://kyivindependent.com/navalny-lawyers-jailed/	2025-01-17T01:17:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2170733603.jpg
Ukraine strikes Russian S-400 radar equipment in Belgorod Oblast, military claims	Ukrainian forces struck radar equipment of the advanced S-400 air defense system in Russia&apos;s Belgorod Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Jan. 17. According to the military, the positions of Russia&apos;s anti-aircraft missile division of the 568th regiment came under a &quot;long-range fire&quot; on Jan. 16. &quot;The termination of the 92H6 radar station of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system was recorded, which indicates a successful hit on the target,&quot; the statement read.

Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 1, injure 16 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed one person and injured at least 16 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Jan. 17. Ukrainian forces downed 33 out of the 50 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Another nine were &quot;lost,&quot; and one more drone flew in the direction of Romania, according to the statement. Fallen wreckage from the downed drones injured a 12-year-old boy in Kyiv Oblast, said Mykola Kalashnyk, acting head of the regional military administration. The debris caused a fire in a cafe and the adjacent boiler room. The fire, which covered an area of around 200 square meters, has now been contained. The blast broke windows in a nearby building. Russian drones also targeted port infrastructure near the town of Izmail in Odesa Oblast, Governor Oleh Kiper said. The residential building was damaged. No casualties were reported. A Russian Molniya-1 drone hit the roadway in the city of Kharkiv, injuring three men aged 44, 46, and 48, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Five cars were damaged. In Sumy Oblast, three people suffered injuries as a result of a Russian first-person-view (FPV) drone attack, according to the region&apos;s military administration. The attack also damaged an apartment building and a car. Two people were injured in the town of Rodynske in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 37 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Seven people were injured over the past day, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. A Russian drone also attacked a bus stop in the village of Antonivka in Kherson Oblast, killing a man on the morning of Jan. 17, Prokudin said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-1-injure-16-over-past-day/	2025-01-16T23:49:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-17_08-33-51.jpg
Allied support for Ukraine won't suddenly change with Trump's inauguration, top NATO officer assures	NATO has taken over some responsibilities in coordinating aid for Ukraine from the U.S. with Washington&apos;s consent, ensuring a stable support mechanism going forward, NATO Military Committee Chief Admiral Rob Bauer said on Jan. 16. &quot;And that doesn&apos;t change on Monday,&quot; Bauer said at a press conference of NATO military chiefs in Brussels, referring to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump has pledged to swiftly push for a peace settlement in the Russia-Ukraine war after taking office, prompting fears he might reduce military support or push Kyiv toward painful concessions. This led to other partners in the pro-Kyiv coalition preparing mechanisms for stable security assistance for Ukraine should Trump decide to withdraw the U.S. involvement. &quot;The framework after Washington (summit) is to transfer some of the things that were organized by the U.S. now into NATO,&quot; Bauer said. &quot;The SAG-U (Security Assistance Group - Ukraine), the IDCC (International Donor Coordination Center), that was a group of nations helping Ukraine. Now, NATO is taking over that responsibility, and the United States has agreed to that.&quot; These decisions are based on the NATO Washington Summit in July 2024 and were included in its final communique. Bauer said these changes aim to create a stable mechanism to ensure continued support for Ukraine, regardless of political changes. The Dutch admiral added that this is reassuring for Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi &quot;because for him, the war doesn&apos;t change because of what happens in the White House. The war is there (in Ukraine) on Monday as well.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/allied-support-for-ukraine-wont-suddenly-change-with-trumps-inauguration-top-nato-officer-says/	2025-01-16T23:44:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2095077756.jpg
Italy's upcoming military aid package to Ukraine includes 'modern weaponry,' Umerov says	Ukraine will receive a new military aid package from Italy, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Jan. 16 after meeting with his Italian counterpart Guido Crosetto in Kyiv. &quot;(The military aid package) is already on its way to Ukraine,&quot; Umerov said. &quot;This is modern weaponry that will help our soldiers to deliver powerful strikes against the enemy.&quot; The two ministers agreed to strengthen defense cooperation between Kyiv and Rome. The countries also plan to launch joint ventures and other initiatives to support the Ukrainian defense industry. According to Umerov, Crosetto backed the continuation of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meetings, known as the Ramstein format. &quot;This is critical for providing everything our defenders need,&quot; the Ukrainian minister said. Crosetto also met with President Volodymyr Zelensky and discussed security guarantees for Ukraine. Italy&apos;s 10 military aid packages to Ukraine have included advanced weapons systems like the French-Italian SAMP/T air defense units. The country&apos;s cabinet approved a decree on Dec. 23 extending the supply of military aid to Kyiv through the end of 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/italys-upcoming-military-aid-package-to-ukraine-includes-modern-weaponry-umerov-says/	2025-01-16T23:08:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-16_21-55-42.jpg
German FM slams her government over hesitancy on Ukraine aid	Germany is not currently seen as a &quot;driving force for peace policy in Europe,&quot; German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told Politico in comments published on Jan. 17, criticizing her own government for hesitancy in the support of Ukraine. &quot;Even now, during the election campaign, some prioritize a national perspective &#x2014; or how to quickly gain a few votes in the parliamentary election &#x2014; rather than taking real responsibility for securing Europe&#x2019;s peace and freedom,&quot; Baerbock said Her comments come a little over a month before the snap parliamentary elections prompted by the Free Democratic Party (FDP) leaving the governing coalition with Baerbock&apos;s Greens and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s Social Democrats (SPD). Foreign policy issues like the Russia-Ukraine war are becoming key topics of the electoral campaign as the parties gear up for the vote on Feb. 23. The conservative CDU/CSU alliance, which has called for more decisive steps in support of Kyiv, is currently leading the polls. Baerbock&apos;s statement also reveals a growing rift in the intermin Social Democrat-Greens cabinet as Scholz is reluctant to greenlight an additional 3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) in security assistance for Kyiv. Despite Baerbock&apos;s and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius&apos; (SPD) support for the new assistance tranche, the chancellor said he would sign off on it only if it is paid with additional borrowing, an unpopular step among other parties. Delays in German assistance &quot;means that Ukraine is less able to defend itself and, therefore, less able to defend us,&quot; Baerbock said during a meeting of diplomats in Saudi Arabia last week. Berlin stands as Ukraine&apos;s second largest military donor, a role of growing importance as Ukraine faces a heavy Russian onslaught in the east of the country, and the future of U.S. support appears uncertain under the incoming Trump administration. Germany has allocated 4 billion euros ($4.1 billion) in military support for Ukraine this year, and the additional package would raise this to 7 billion ($7.2 billion). The defense articles contained in the new assistance include three IRIS-T air defense systems, three Skyranger air defense systems, 10 howitzers, surface-to-air missiles, 20 protective vehicles, artillery shells, and drones, the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported. Scholz&apos;s stance was criticized by the FDP, which claimed that the chancellor initially actively pushed for approving the 3 billion euro package, provided it is paid through borrowing. The opposition by the FDP&apos;s Finance Minister Christian Lindner reportedly led to his dismissal and the coalition&apos;s collapse.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-fm-slams-her-government-over-hesitancy-on-ukraine-aid/	2025-01-16T23:02:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190247028.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 815,820 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 815,820 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 17. This number includes 1,670 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,803 tanks, 20,381 armored fighting vehicles, 34,256 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,019 artillery systems, 1,262 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,046 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 22,566 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-815-820-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-16T22:10:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193326050.jpg
Russian hackers target WhatsApp in new tactic, Microsoft warns	The Russian hacker group Star Blizzard launched a spear phishing campaign in November via the messaging platform WhatsApp, marking a change in longstanding tactics, Microsoft reported in a blog post on Jan. 16. Phishing messages use social engineering tactics to manipulate recipients, exploiting emotions to trick targets into revealing sensitive information or clicking malicious links. Star Blizzard sent invitations to join a WhatsApp group to current and former officials in government and diplomacy, international relations and defense researchers, and people and organizations offering assistance to Ukraine amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war, according to Microsoft. This is the first time the hacker group has been observed using this tactic. The shift to WhatsApp may be related to successful cybersecurity efforts exposing Star Blizzard&apos;s techniques, Microsoft said. In the most recent campaign, Star Blizzard hackers impersonated U.S. government officials in emails directing recipients to join a WhatsApp group via QR code. The WhatsApp group claimed to focus on &quot;the latest non-governmental initiatives aimed at supporting Ukraine NGOs.&quot; The purpose of the campaign was to gain access to targets&apos; WhatsApp accounts and extract their data. While the campaign seemed to subside in late November 2024, Microsoft warned that the shift in tactics signals Star Blizzard&apos;s versatility and &quot;tenacity in continuing spear phishing campaigns to gain access to sensitive information.&quot; Russian hacker groups have engaged in various forms of cyber warfare throughout the full-scale war, including cyberattacks against Ukraine, hacks of civilian infrastructure in Europe, and interference in foreign elections.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-hackers-target-whatsapp-in-new-tactic-microsoft-warns/	2025-01-16T21:25:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189475787.jpg
UK to play 'full part' in peacekeeping efforts in Ukraine, Starmer says	The United Kingdom will play its &quot;full part&quot; in supporting efforts to maintain an enduring peace in Ukraine, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer told Sky News on Jan. 16. Starmer&apos;s remarks followed his meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, where the leaders signed a historic 100-year partnership agreement between Ukraine and the U.K. When asked if the U.K. was prepared to deploy peacekeeping troops to Ukraine to monitor a potential ceasefire, Starmer said he had discussed the matter with Zelensky during his visit. &quot;I&apos;ve been discussing this with a number of allies ... including President Zelensky here today,&quot; Starmer said in an interview with Sky News. &quot;But we will play our full part. We have always been one of the leading countries in relation to the defense of Ukraine, so you can read into that that we will be playing our full part.&quot; Bloomberg reported on Jan. 10 that Starmer was expected to discuss the possible peacekeeping mission with Zelensky during his visit. Starmer said he did not want to &quot;get ahead of ourselves&quot; in terms of specific plans but said the U.K. was committed to taking a leading role in ensuring a lasting peace in Ukraine. &quot;Because this isn&apos;t just about sovereignty in Ukraine ... If Russia succeeds in its aggression, it will impact us for a very long time,&quot; he said. London and Paris have already begun discussing the possibility of deploying French and U.K. troops to monitor a ceasefire along the front line in Ukraine, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported in December. Starmer on Jan. 16 confirmed that he and French President Emmanuel Macron have discussed the issue. The idea of deploying a peacekeeping force on the ground in Ukraine has gained traction in recent months as European nations prepare to play a greater role in Kyiv&apos;s defense once U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Trump reportedly supports the idea and told Zelensky and Macron during their trilateral meeting on Dec. 7 that he wants European troops to monitor a future ceasefire. Ahead of Zelensky&apos;s meeting with Starmer, the president spoke with Macron on Jan. 14 regarding &quot;practical steps&quot; for implementing such a plan.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-to-play-full-part-in-peacekeeping-efforts-in-ukraine-starmer-says/	2025-01-16T19:44:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194219228.jpg
Zelensky, Italian Defense Minister discuss security guarantees at meeting in Kyiv	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto in Kyiv on Jan. 16 to discuss Italy&apos;s ongoing military assistance to Ukraine. Crosetto&apos;s arrival in Kyiv was announced earlier on Jan. 16, the same day that U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer signed a 100-year partnership agreement with Zelensky. Zelensky and Crosetto discussed defense support and security guarantees for Ukraine, the presidential office said. Topics addressed included bolstering air defense systems, training Ukrainian personnel in Italy, and joint defense production. The president highlighted the importance of investing in Ukraine&apos;s defense industry, particularly drone production. Ukraine&apos;s future NATO membership as &quot;the most effective&quot; security guarantee possible, one that would advance &quot;a just and lasting peace for all Europe.&quot; The leaders also discussed plans for the Ukraine Recovery Conference, scheduled to take place in Rome July 10-11. Zelensky thanked Crosetto and the Italian government for the country&apos;s 10th military aid package to Ukraine, approved last month. Crosetto said Italy remains committed to supporting Ukraine&apos;s defense needs and that the focus is now on the next round of military aid to Kyiv. &quot;I came here to discuss the 11th support package, as the 10th has already been approved,&quot; Crosetto said. &quot;As we have already discussed, now is the moment &#x2014; perhaps the most critical moment in the past three years &#x2014; to increase support.&quot; Crosetto&apos;s visit comes mere days before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. The transition of power in Washington is expected to significantly disrupt the balance of Western support for Ukraine amid the full-scale war. European countries are preparing to play a greater role in addressing Ukraine&apos;s defense priorities if the U.S. shifts its focus from aid to negotiations. Italy&apos;s 10 military aid packages to Ukraine have included advanced weapons systems like the French-Italian SAMP/T air defense units. The country&apos;s cabinet approved a decree on Dec. 23 extending the supply of military aid to Kyiv through the end of 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-italian-defense-minister-discuss-security-guarantees-at-meeting-in-kyiv/	2025-01-16T18:51:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/ItalianDM.jpeg
Russian drone attack in Kyiv Oblast injures child	Russia launched a drone attack against Kyiv Oblast the evening of Jan. 16, causing a fire and injuring a child, Mykola Kalashnyk, acting head of the regional military administration, reported. Air defense units intercepted targets over an unnamed town in Kyiv Oblast, Kalashnyk said. Falling wreckage from the downed drones injured a 12-year-old boy. &#xA0; The boy has been hospitalized and is receiving medical attention, Kalashnyk said. No other casualties were reported. The falling debris also caused a fire to break out in a cafe and the attached boiler room. The fire, which covered an area of around 200 square meters, has now been contained. The blast broke windows in a nearby building. &#xA0; Russian drone attacks against Kyiv Oblast and the city of Kyiv surged in late fall 2024. Drone strikes have targeted residential areas and critical energy infrastructure in the region. As Moscow intensifies strikes, it also aims to ramp up domestic drone production, with plans to manufacture 6,000 Shahed-style attack drones per year at the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in Tatarstan.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-attack-in-kyiv-oblast-injures-child/	2025-01-16T17:40:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2147527243.jpg
Netherlands announces $27 million in aid for Ukraine following Dutch Foreign Minister's visit to Kyiv	Following his visit to Kyiv, Dutch Foreign Minister Kaspar Veldkamp announced 27 million euros ($27.8 million) in new aid for Ukraine on Jan. 16. According to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, the package includes 7 million euros ($7.2 million) through the Comprehensive Assistance Package, coordinated by NATO, to provide non-lethal support such as fuel, medical supplies, winter equipment, and electronic warfare systems. An additional 20 million euros ($20.6 million) is being allocated to the Ukraine Energy Support Fund to assist with critical infrastructure needs. The announcement came during Veldkamp&#x2019;s meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha. In Dec. 2024, The Netherlands pledged a contribution of $23 million to bolster Ukraine&apos;s air defense systems and cyber resilience. The country also previously supplied Ukraine with several Patriot air defense launchers, most recently delivering three in November.	https://kyivindependent.com/netherlands-announces-27-million-in-aid-for-ukraine-following-dutch-foreign-ministers-visit-to-kyiv/	2025-01-16T16:54:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2162501104.jpg
Biden administration prioritized sanctions strategies over designating Russia as state sponsor of terrorism, US official says	The Biden administration believes that large-scale sanctions have been more effective politically than designating Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, Ukrinform reported on Jan. 16, citing U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller. &quot;We do not consider this [recognizing Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism] to be the most effective way to achieve existing political goals when we talk about Russia,&#x201D; Miller said at a press briefing. He noted that recent US sanctions, including measures targeting Russia&apos;s energy sector, have had tangible effects, such as halting tankers carrying Russian oil worldwide. Miller also said that labeling Russia as a terrorism sponsor could hinder international humanitarian efforts and complicate operations in the region. The latest round of U.S. sanctions was passed on Jan. 15. The U.S. Treasury imposed new sanctions on a total of over 150 entities and individuals, including companies in Russia&#x2019;s defense industry and those supporting it, as well as dozens of entities across multiple countries that help Russia evade U.S. sanctions. The Treasury also expanded measures against almost 100 entities already under sanctions for their cooperation with Russia&#x2019;s military-industrial complex.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-administration-prioritized-sanctions-strategies-over-designating-russia-as-state-sponsor-of-terrorism-us-official-says/	2025-01-16T14:17:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2155312256.jpg
Absurd phenomenon' — The manpower issue threatening to weaken Ukraine's Air Force	Critically lacking manpower on the front lines where Russia continues to use its vast manpower advantage to make grinding advances, Ukraine has been scrambling specialists into the infantry in an effort to replenish losses. Criticized widely by soldiers and experts for a &#x201C;wasteful&#x201D; use of specialist troops that have spent years honing their skills, the short-term solution has frequently led to their death or injury, according to soldiers interviewed by the Kyiv Independent over 2024. Ukraine has been struggling with a manpower shortage &#x2014; especially in the infantry &#x2014; while Russia has intensified its offensive in Donetsk Oblast since the summer of 2024. The issue of sending specialist troops to infantry units had largely been hidden in the shadows until a video surfaced online on Jan. 14, prompting responses from President Volodymyr Zelensky, and the General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces. In the almost three-minute-long video, around a dozen Ukrainian servicemen from the Air Force stand, as one reads aloud a message about what they describe as &#x201C;a real challenge&#x201D; that could &#x201C;destroy the very foundation of our aviation.&#x201D; &#x201C;Since 2014, we have been preparing and maintaining the aircraft, ensuring combat missions in the most difficult conditions, both day and night, defending our homeland from the enemy,&#x201D; the speaker of the group &#x2013; all wearing masks &#x2014; says. A Ukrainian Tactical Aviation pilot poses in the cockpit of his MIG-29 fighter jet at sunset in eastern Ukraine on Aug. 1, 2023. (Libkos / Getty Images)The aviation and technical personnel, who say that they have been fulfilling missions on Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets for over a decade, said they received an order to send &quot;almost all technicians to the infantry, which means we will be left without technical personnel to service our aircraft.&quot; The Ukrainian military command was trying to transfer 218 specialists to the infantry when the video was released, and 250 were previously transferred, according to the speaker. &#x201C;The technical staff is actually being destroyed, and without us, the aviation will not be able to function,&#x201D; he says. According to the Ukrainian online newspaper Ukrainska Pravda, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order on Jan. 11 to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units. A senior Air Force officer, speaking anonymously to the outlet, said transfers began in spring 2024 and have now reached a &quot;critical level,&quot; with unit staffing dropping to 50%. An Air Force serviceman speaking on the condition of anonymity to the Kyiv Independent, painted an even grimmer picture. He said around a couple thousand Air Force servicemen had already been transferred to the infantry since the beginning of the full-scale war, with about 40 % being killed, and 40% wounded in the first days if they were directly sent to the front, while some were still fighting. He added that these are often people who studied for around four years, and further built their knowledge over years of service, stressing the issue dampens morale. In a rare example of a public outcry reaching the Ukrainian authorities, Zelensky on Jan. 14 tried to reassure that such transfers wouldn&#x2019;t be made. &#x201C;There has been much concern and discussion today regarding these reassignments,&quot; he said in his evening address. &quot;I have instructed that everything be explained to the public and not to reduce the ranks of specialists critical to the Air Force &#x2014; aviation, air defense, and mobile fire units.&quot; The General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces also insisted on the same day that &quot;there were no plans to transfer the acute shortage of specialists of the Air Force&#x2019;s engineering and aviation service who maintain aircraft to infantry units.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky speaks at a press conference during the European Council Meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on Dec. 19, 2024. (Pier Marco Tacca / Getty Images)&#x201C;Instead, the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is increasing the number of technical and flight personnel,&#x201D; it added. Acknowledging the &quot;not easy&quot; situation on the front, and that &quot;many areas lack infantrymen,&quot; the General Staff said the transfer of some personnel is &quot;a necessary step&quot; to strengthen defense by reinforcing combat brigades with soldiers from other branches of the Armed Forces. But it stressed that Syrskyi prohibited the transfer of high-tech specialists and those trained abroad on foreign models of weapons and equipment. Understanding the complexity of the issue, some soldiers however remain pessimistic about the prospect of possible improvements going forward. The core issue is that no one is bearing responsibility, according to the anonymous Air Force serviceman. He said that the order comes to transfer a certain number from a specialist unit, and the local commander has to pick whom to send, which he said is often difficult because &#x201C;we need everyone&#x201D; and there is no replenishment. &#x201C;Maybe for them (in the military leadership), it&apos;s just a number, not people,&#x201D; the Air Force serviceman said, adding there should be a &#x201C;responsibility and accountability&#x201D; mechanism for the generals making the decisions. Glen Grant, a former British army lieutenant colonel who has advised the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, and closely observes military issues in Ukraine, said that resource management problems persist due to the lack of competent generals, and the inability to learn from mistakes. &#x201C;You just don&apos;t take your technicians and put them into harm&apos;s way because you need them as technicians,&#x201D; the Latvia-based military expert told the Kyiv Independent. A Ukrainian MiG-29 performs a combat mission in eastern Ukraine on Aug. 1, 2023. (Libkos / Getty Images)&#x201C;You may strengthen one area, but then you weaken another area, so the compensation is lost. You&apos;re still back where you are, except you are actually twice worse off because you probably lose the technicians, dead.&#x201D; A couple of recent appointments, such as that of General Mykhailo Drapatyi as the commander of Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces in November 2024, offers hope, according to Grant, but it is still unclear whether it will be enough to change the overall dynamics of the Ukrainian military leadership. &#x201C;The message is clear that the people don&apos;t value soldier&apos;s lives if they&apos;re going to send them into the front line without being properly trained,&#x201D; Grant said. Ukrainian military expert Mykhailo Zhyrokhov on the other hand said he was skeptical of the number of specialists that the Air Force members said were being transferred to the infantry. He argued that the situation is &#x201C;ambiguous&#x201D; because there is no confirmation that such a number is thrown into the front-line trenches, and he doubts the Ukrainian military leadership would &#x201C;shoot itself in the foot&#x201D; and &#x201C;destroy aviation&#x201D; as has been claimed. &#x201C;It is typical human behavior &#x2014; nobody wants to go to the front, despite the fact that they are professional soldiers, they are contract soldiers, and they have been there all this time, these last twenty years defending the sky,&#x201D; Zhyrokhov told the Kyiv Independent. He also raised questions about how the servicemen obtained the numbers when the information was &#x201C;secret.&#x201D; With the Air Force gradually Westernizing its Soviet-era models of aircraft, there is a surplus of specialists who are only familiar with the older versions who would be sent to the reserves if the country was not at war, according to Zhyrokhov. He said he believed that the surplus, such as the guards based at the airbases, would be sent to non-combat roles as a solution. Mentioning Air Force personnel who fought in hot spots in the east in 2023, such as in the Battle of Bakhmut, Zhyrokhov argued that Air Force servicemen have to immediately get used to the grim realities of the war, just like civilian-turned-soldiers. &#x201C;In wartime, such cases exist, have existed, are present, and will continue to exist,&#x201D; Zhyrokhov said. Ukrainian open-source war monitoring website DeepState, which said that it received a hundred reports from soldiers about the issue concerning the transfer of Air Force and Air Defense specialists to the infantry after the scandal came to light, said that a large number said they received only a few days&#x2019; training before being sent into brigades and &quot;the picture there is not the best.&#x201D; &#x201C;The deliberate sending of specialists who have specific skills, knowledge and experience and their absence directly affects the work of the unit,&#x201D; DeepState said in a Telegram post. Summarizing it an &#x201C;absurd phenomenon,&#x201D; DeepState said the effectiveness of the transfer of specialists to infantry &#x201C;has always been minimal&#x201D; and also resulted in the loss of some servicemen who attained valuable skills abroad.	https://kyivindependent.com/absurd-phenomenon-the-manpower-issue-threatening-to-weaken-ukraines-air-force/	2025-01-16T12:12:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1677405750.jpg
NATO deploys Norwegian F-35 fighters for 1st time during Russian Jan. 15 attack on Ukraine	NATO scrambled Norwegian F-35 fighter jets stationed in Poland for the first time to protect airspace during a Russian attack on Ukraine on Jan. 15, the NATO Air Command reported on X. Russia attacked Ukraine using cruise and ballistic missiles on Jan. 15, targeting critical infrastructure in several oblasts. Ukrainian forces shot down 30 missiles and 47 drones. &quot;This is the first time the Norwegian jets have scrambled in the active air defense of Polish Airspace, demonstrating Allied commitment to NATO&apos;s eastern flank,&quot; the statement read. Two F-35 fighter jets were involved in the defense of NATO airspace, according to the NATO Air Command. Poland announced on the same day that it was scaling up its air force due to Russia&apos;s mass attack on Ukraine, with additional pairs of fighter jets deployed and ground-based air defense and radar systems on high alert. Russian drones and missiles have previously entered Poland&apos;s airspace during attacks on Ukraine. However, Polish allies advised the government to exercise restraint when dealing with unidentified airspace violations, according to Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Most Poles believe the Polish military should shoot down Russian drones that enter Polish airspace during aerial attacks on Ukraine, according to a survey published on Sept. 1 by the Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said in September that Poland and neighboring countries to Ukraine are &quot;responsible for protecting their own airspace,&quot; despite NATO&apos;s opposition.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-deploys-norwegian-f-35-fighters-for-1st-time-during-russian-jan-15-attack-on-ukraine/	2025-01-16T12:03:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2173881672.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine, UK sign 100-year partnership agreement	Key developments on Jan. 16: President Volodymyr Zelensky and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer signed a 100-year partnership agreement during their meeting in Kyiv on Jan. 16. The wide-ranging deal encompasses cooperation in military, energy, scientific, cultural, economic, and other sectors. The agreement builds upon the trade and partnership agreement signed by the two countries in 2020 and the bilateral security deal penned in January 2024. The document, published by Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office, includes 10 main pillars from strengthening defefense capabilities and supporting Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations to cooperation in trade, energy, and justice and accountability. &quot;(Russian President Vladimir) Putin&apos;s ambition to wrench Ukraine away from its closest partners has been a monumental strategic failure,&quot; Starmer said in a statement. &quot;Instead, we are closer than ever, and this partnership will take that friendship to the next level.&quot; The United Kingdom will also provide new military aid for Ukraine, including 150 artillery barrels, a mobile air defense system, and an expanded training initiative with allied nations, the government announced on Jan. 16. This year, the U.K. plans to deliver unprecedented military support to Ukraine, with 3 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) already committed for lethal aid. &quot;This funding will not only support Ukraine but also bolster the U.K.&apos;s defense industry, creating jobs across the country,&quot; the statement reads. The first 1.5 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) of a 2.26-billion-pound ($2.7 billion) loan, part of the G7 loan program to Kyiv, will also be released for major procurement projects. The loan will be repaid using profits from immobilized Russian assets. The military aid includes artillery barrels manufactured by Sheffield Forgemasters, the first such production in the U.K. in over 20 years. The barrels are expected to be delivered to Ukraine within weeks. The U.K. will also provide a mobile air defense system developed in partnership with Denmark, aimed at enhancing Ukraine&apos;s ability to counter Russian missile and drone attacks. The training initiative builds on the success of Operation Interflex, which has trained over 51,000 Ukrainian recruits in the past two years. The U.K. plans to expand this effort in collaboration with international allies. Ukrainian soldiers struck the Liskinskaya oil depot in Voronezh Oblast and gunpowder factory in Tambov Oblast with drones overnight on Jan. 16, Ukraine&apos;s military said. According to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, the targeted oil depot stored fuel used for the needs of the Russian army. The statement came after Russian reports of the oil depot on fire in Voronezh Oblast. The village of Liski in Voronezh Oblast lies over 150 kilometers (98 miles) east of the Ukrainian border. In an attack conducted by the Special Operations Forces and other units of Ukraine&apos;s Defense Forces, at least three drones hit the facility, causing a large-scale fire, the General Staff said. A Ukrainian drone strike also reportedly targeted a Russian gunpowder factory in the village of Kuzmino-Gat in Tambov Oblast overnight on Jan. 16. Eyewitnesses in the nearby city of Kotovsk heard the sound of a drone engine as it was passing over their houses, presumably heading to the factory, the Shot Telegram channel reported. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its forces downed 27 Ukrainian drones over various regions overnight, including three in Tambov Oblast. Russian authorities said there were no casualties as a result of the attack in Tambov Oblast and that the roof of a house was damaged by drone debris. It is not immediately clear whether the plant suffered any damage due to the attack. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The Kuzmino-Gat gunpowder factory is &quot;one of the key facilities of the Russian military-industrial complex involved in the war against Ukraine,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &quot;The gunpowder produced here is used for various types of small arms, artillery, and rocket launchers.&quot; The plant also produces colloxylin, which is used to manufacture explosives and other products, Kovalenko added. Kuzmino-Gat lies roughly 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of the Russia-Ukraine border. Ukrainian paratroopers and other units captured 27 Russian service members during hostilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the Airborne Assault Troops&apos; press service said on Jan. 16. &quot;Among them are officers, sergeants, and privates from motorized rifle units, Marines, airborne troops, and other units, coming from various Russian regions and the occupied city of Sevastopol,&quot; the press service announced on its Telegram channel. Ukraine has been fighting in Russia&apos;s southwestern Kursk Oblast since August 2024, hoping to use its positions there as a trump card in potential negotiations with Russia. Moscow has ramped up its efforts to throw Ukraine out of its territory, deploying North Korean troops and reportedly retaking around half of the area initially taken by Kyiv. &quot;We call on other Russian soldiers not to resist and surrender!&quot; the Airborne Assault Troops&apos; press service said, promising to treat Russian prisoners of war (POW) in accordance with international humanitarian law. Only a day earlier, Ukraine&apos;s National Guard announced the capture of 23 Russian soldiers during combat operations near Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast. Ukraine and Russia regularly hold prisoner exchanges, most recently on Jan. 15 when 25 Ukrainians, including Azovstal defenders, were released. Kyiv is extending its cooperation with Norwegian defense company Kongsberg, one of the suppliers of NASAMS air defense systems to Ukraine, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Jan. 16. The defense minister met with Eirik Lie, executive vice president of Kongsberg Gruppen ASA and president of Kongsberg Defense &amp; Aerospace. The two discussed anti-drone systems and the possibility of localizing their production in Ukraine, as well as the development of maritime capabilities. Ukraine and Norway also discussed the possibility of integrating Ukrainian-made air defense systems into NASAMS &quot;to increase its effectiveness,&quot; Umerov said. The NASAMS systems have been in service with Ukrainian forces since November 2022, when the U.S. delivered the first batteries amid escalating Russian airstrikes. Ukraine has lobbied international partners for more air defense capabilities in the wake of intensifying Russian strikes targeting energy infrastructure. Norway has been one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters in Europe. According to Umerov, Oslo allocated 2 billion euros &#xA0;($2.1 billion) for military aid to Ukraine in 2025. The 63rd Separate Mechanized Brigade shared a video on Jan. 16 purporting to show the downing of Russian forces&apos; rare reconnaissance drone Merlin-VR. Throughout the full-scale invasion, drones have become pivotal for both Ukraine and Russia, used on and off the battlefield for attack and reconnaissance purposes. &quot;A rare bird was shot down by anti-aircraft gunners and pilots of the 63rd Brigade &#x2014; a Russian experimental Merlin-VR reconnaissance drone,&quot; the brigade&apos;s statement read. The Merlin-VR was shot down by a Ukrainian first-person-view (FPV) drone. The brigade did not specify where the air battle took place. Russian developers presented the Merlin-VR in 2021, and the Russian army has been using it on the battlefield since 2022. The drone reportedly has a hybrid engine, which reduces its noise while in motion. It can also fly for up to 10 hours and reach altitudes of up to 5 kilometers (3 miles). Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks by Ukrainian troops. Kyiv has delivered more than 200,000 domestically-produced drones to front-line units so far in December, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-uk-sign-100-year-partnership-agreement-ukrainian-drones-hit-oil-depot-gunpower-factory-in-russia/	2025-01-16T11:56:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/c31891f7d5c074d8d496bd47a146d66b_1737036022.jpeg
They are better prepared than Russians' — Ukrainian soldiers on capturing North Korean POWs	Editor&apos;s note: In accordance with the security protocols of the Ukrainian military, soldiers featured in this story are identified by first names and callsigns only. It was a month-long mission with one primary goal &#x2014; capturing a North Korean soldier alive. One of the biggest obstacles facing the Ukrainian forces tasked with the objective while operating in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast was overcoming the fanatical, suicidal zeal instilled in Pyongyang&apos;s troops. &quot;(One North Korean soldier) was about to be taken prisoner, but with the words &#x2018;Glory to the Party&apos; or &apos;Glory to Kim Jong-un,&apos; he blew himself up with a grenade,&quot; a Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces soldier with the callsign &quot;Borsuk&quot; told the Kyiv Independent. The mission eventually succeeded earlier this month with the capture of one North Korean soldier by Special Operations Forces and another one by Ukraine&#x2019;s Airborne Forces. President Volodymyr Zelensky described their capture as &quot;irrefutable evidence&quot; of Pyongyang&apos;s involvement in the Kremlin&apos;s full-scale war. According to Ukraine, North Korea has deployed around 12,000 soldiers in Kursk Oblast, where Kyiv launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August 2024. Neither Russia nor North Korea have officially acknowledged the deployment, which is the latest move in Moscow&apos;s ever-increasing &#x2014; and humiliating &#x2014; reliance on Pyongyang to bolster its military, following long-running shipments of artillery shells and ballistic missiles. &quot;Essentially, this was about conveying to the international community that third countries are indeed involved in this war. And that Russia is not as invincible as they claim,&quot; Borsuk said. The Kyiv Independent got exclusive footage of the mission, as well as interviewed Borsuk and his fellow soldier &quot;Bernard,&quot; who described how they carried out their task, the moment of capture, and why North Korean troops are far more formidable than their Russian counterparts. To prove North Korea&apos;s involvement definitively, capturing one of their soldiers alive was the only option. While Borsuk and Bernard could not disclose details of their preparation, timing, location, or the number of personnel involved in the mission, they revealed they had been monitoring a specific area in Kursk Oblast for an extended period of time, waiting for the perfect opportunity to act. The enemy group operating in the area under surveillance consisted entirely of North Koreans, according to the Ukrainian soldiers. &quot;We approached the target where we were supposed to operate. We had been observing it and knew their base positions were there,&quot; Bernard said. &quot;We started moving, and contact was made.&quot; &#xA0; Screenshot from the video showing the capturing a North Korean soldier.

(President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)In the ensuing firefight, the enemy group took casualties and began to retreat. One wounded North Korean soldier was left behind. &quot;Our guys kept him under constant fire control to ensure he didn&apos;t move or make any sudden moves,&quot; says Borsuk. After approaching his position, disarming him was a delicate and potentially fatal maneuver. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) has previously reported that some North Korean soldiers have been forced to commit suicide to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby also earlier echoed these claims, adding that captured North Korean troops fear severe retaliation against their families if they surrender. &quot;He still had a grenade with him, in addition to his weapon, and it was very difficult to take it away,&quot; Borsuk says, describing the moment caught on headcam footage when they approached the soldier. Eventually, the North Korean soldier allowed them to get close, and they were able to provide him with first aid. Borsuk recalls their prisoner behaving &quot;calmly,&quot; and assessed he was in a stable condition. &quot;He was able to speak. The only issue he had was with his leg; everything else was normal,&quot; he says. Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces soldier, callsign &quot;Bernard,&quot; speaks with the Kyiv Independent. (Jason Blevins/The Kyiv Independent)According to Bernard, Russian artillery started firing not long after they reached the North Korean soldier, likely realizing they were trying to take him as a prisoner. &quot;(Russia&apos;s) desire to hide the presence of North Korean units was very great,&quot; Borsuk says. &quot;As (the hits) got closer and closer, he also realized what was happening&#x2026; It was clear from his eyes that he was a human; after all, he wanted to live,&quot; Bernard says. &quot;We looked at him. Well, he was just a young guy&#x2026; There were no thoughts, no desire to use physical force, or anything like that,&quot; Bernard says. &quot;We simply saved him. And that&apos;s it.&quot; The two captured North Korean POWs are currently in the custody of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) in Kyiv. Both were wounded and are reportedly receiving medical attention. One has said he was born in 2005 and began serving as a rifleman in North Korea in 2021, while the other POW was born in 1999 and has served in the North Korean army since 2016 as a sniper reconnaissance officer. Both B&#x43E;rsuk and Bernard say there are noticeable differences between the battlefield performance of North Korean and Russian soldiers. &quot;Compared to Russian soldiers, they are much better prepared physically and mentally. They are deliberately trained for where they&apos;re going and what they&apos;ll be doing,&quot; says Borsuk. &quot;It&apos;s clear that the Russians don&apos;t push themselves as hard as they do. They (North Korean soldiers) can carry heavy loads, run for long distances, and survive much better in extreme conditions.&quot; Bernard suggests they are better prepared thanks to their eight-year-long military service. However, when it comes to more &quot;complex maneuvers,&quot; the North Korean soldiers struggle to execute them effectively, he adds. &quot;&#x200B;&#x200B;Here, they can&apos;t apply everything they were trained for because the war is not the same as what they were told, or shown it would be,&quot; says Bernard. According to Bernard, North Koreans appear to be struggling to adapt to drones and aerial reconnaissance, both of which play a dominant role on the modern battlefield. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service has previously claimed that at least 300 North Korean soldiers had been killed and another 2,700 wounded fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, attributing their high casualties to the soldiers&apos; &#x201C;lack of understanding of modern warfare,&quot; including their &quot;useless&quot; attempts to shoot down long-range drones. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reported that one of the captured North Korean POWs was carrying a Russian ID document under the name of a Tuva Republic resident. (President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)The SBU said that one of the captured North Korean POWs was carrying a Russian ID document under the name of a Tuva Republic resident. (President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)Borsuk believes that the ratio of killed to wounded among North Koreans is actually quite different. &quot;They have many more killed,&quot; he says, adding their coordination with the Russian units is &quot;clearly poor,&quot; partially because of the language barrier. However, the North Korean soldiers also appear to be more motivated and resilient than the Russian troops, according to Bernard. &quot;They seem very committed to their ideology. That&apos;s why they are true to their norms and what they were told about who they are and what they should do. And they simply can&apos;t do it any other way,&quot; he says. While Western officials including outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin have described Russia&apos;s use of North Korean troops as an indication of Moscow&apos;s &quot;growing desperation,&quot; Borsuk says their use could potentially shift the dynamics of the war. &quot;Imagine a battalion facing a force of up to 10,000 troops,&quot; says Borsuk. &quot;They can throw battalion after battalion into the fight, and they&apos;re not running out of personnel.&quot; This relentless tactic strains both Ukrainian soldiers and logistical support, as significant resources are required to counter such waves, according to Borsuk. &quot;These actions usually bring minimal results. However, it&apos;s not ruled out that they could deploy a larger number of troops,&quot; he says. &quot;Well, they come, die, and that&apos;s it,&quot; says Bernard. &quot;It&apos;s just that, perhaps, we should be doing a slightly different job, but instead, we&apos;re focused on eliminating them.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/they-are-better-prepared-than-russians-ukrainian-soldiers-on-capturing-north-korean-pows/	2025-01-16T11:13:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/v2_00_04_47_15_Still001.png
Fico may meet with Zelensky in 'next few days'	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico may meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the &quot;next few days,&quot; he told journalists on Jan. 16, iRozhlas reported. &quot;We are looking for another date, which should be in the next few days,&quot; Fico said when asked about a potential meeting with Zelensky. Fico did not specify where the meeting might take place. Fico had earlier offered Zelensky a meeting at the Slovak-Ukrainian border to discuss Ukraine&apos;s decision to end Russian gas transit through Ukraine. In response, the Ukrainian president invited the Slovak prime minister to Kyiv. Following Zelensky&apos;s invitation, Tibor Gaspar, deputy speaker of the Slovak Parliament, said that Fico would not be visiting the Ukrainian capital. Ukraine did not renew a pre-war agreement to transit Russian gas to Europe via Ukrainian territory, instead allowing the deal to expire on Jan. 1. Kyiv warned repeatedly that it would not extend the deal in order to stop financing Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Fico and his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban have been among some of the most vocal opponents of Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit. Despite Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, Orban and Fico have continued to maintain friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting with him, and promoting pro-Russian narratives in Europe. Fico previously threatened to cut off electricity supplies to Ukraine amid increasing blackouts due to Russian attacks targeting Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure. While the EU has made efforts to reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuels following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many countries, including Slovakia and Hungary, remain reliant on Russian gas.	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-may-meet-with-zelensky-in-next-few-days/	2025-01-16T11:05:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190743977.jpg
Ukrainian forces repel Russian assault on border with Russia's Kursk Oblast, military says	The 67th Separate Mechanized Brigade repelled an assault of Russian troops near the village of Zhuravka in Sumy Oblast on the border with Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, according to the brigade&apos;s Jan. 15 statement. Sumy Oblast, located on Ukraine&apos;s northeast border with Russia, is subject to daily attacks and is situated just across from Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast &#x2014; the region subject to Ukraine&apos;s ongoing incursion. Russia has amassed troops along the border near Zhuravka and tried to assault the settlement but has so far failed, according to the brigade. &quot;The enemy is expected to repeat the movements, as they have resources there,&quot; the statement read.

Partners, not allies: What to expect from Russia-Iran agreement set to be signed on Jan. 17	For Moscow, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian&apos;s visit to Russia on Jan. 17 is a diplomatic victory. The trip&apos;s centerpiece will be the finalization of a long-heralded partnership deal between Russia and Iran, signed by Pezeshkian and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin. The agreement is the latest chapter in Moscow&apos;s ongoing efforts to seek out global allies and acceptance amid its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Pezeshkian and Putin will use their Moscow meeting to discuss greater cooperation in trade, transport, and logistics, as well as &quot;acute issues on the regional and international agenda,&quot; the Kremlin said on Monday. But it is the prospect of greater military cooperation between the two countries that most concern onlookers. Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine has already prompted closer ties: Moscow&apos;s troops use Iranian Shahed-type drones to bombard Ukrainian cities, while Tehran has been accused by the U.S. of giving Russia close-range ballistic missiles. Iranian officials deny the allegations. The new agreement highlights this growing military exchange. But it also comes at a time when the balance of power between Russia and Iran has shifted. Since Vladimir Putin came to power in 2000, Moscow has always held the upper hand in negotiations with Tehran. But Russia&apos;s need for arms and allies gives Iran new leverage in a changing partnership &#x2014; one that both sides hope will give them an edge. Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 left Moscow isolated on the world stage and targeted by bruising Western sanctions. Iran has been a helpful example for Russian officials on how to navigate this strange new world. Having survived for decades under its own barrage of sanctions, Iran has also been able to act as a template for Moscow. Cornerstone sanctions-busting tactics, such as using a shadow fleet of tankers to transport sanctioned oil, have been used for years by Iranian officials. Moscow has been able to adopt such templates to great effect. Their own sanctioned status also means that Iranian officials are happy to ignore Western bans on Russian trade. After almost three years of war, equipping Russia&apos;s troops in Ukraine remains a priority for the Kremlin. Iranian weapon systems are cheap and easy to make, ideal for a conflict that has seen Moscow&apos;s forces bogged down on the battlefield. An Iranian-made unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the Shahed-136, is being displayed at the Azadi (Freedom) Square during a rally in western Tehran, Iran, on Feb. 11, 2024. (Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)&quot;Iranian weapon systems are not advanced like Western or even Russian weapon systems &#x2014; but they work, and they work very effectively,&quot; says Sina Azodi, a visiting scholar and lecturer at the Institute for Middle East Studies at George Washington University. &quot;After Western sanctions on Russia that cut off the country&apos;s access to advanced microchips, the Russians learned that these more simple weapons systems would work in their favor.&quot; But it&apos;s not only Moscow that needs military technology. It&apos;s likely that Tehran also wants modern Russian weapons: something that has become particularly pressing after Israeli strikes on Iran&apos;s air defence installations in October. &quot;Iran needs a modern air force. Iran needs a modern air defense system,&quot; says Azodi. &quot;Russia is the only country that can &#x2014; and is willing &#x2014; to provide that to Iran.&quot; There is no guarantee, however, that once such promises are made that either partner will be able to deliver. Reports have repeatedly surfaced in recent years on Iran&apos;s alleged purchase of Russian Sukhoi fighter jets &#x2014; but the planes themselves have not appeared, suggesting that such deals have not been successful. While Iran&apos;s increased leverage in Moscow could help such acquisitions become a reality, the Kremlin also has other priorities to protect. &quot;Iran desperately needs a replacement for its air defense systems that the Israelis destroyed,&quot; says Azodi. &quot;But the question is whether Russia can provide it, given that it needs air defenses for its own war in Ukraine.&quot; There are also other potential sticking points between the two sides. With Moscow and Tehran both under heavy sanctions, both countries are now competing to sell goods such as oil on the same grey market. While Iran may have a longer history of using shadow tankers, ultimately, Russia&apos;s economic clout has allowed it to undercut its rivals on price. &quot;Russia and Iran have been drawn into a battle on providing discounts for oil buyers in countries such as China and India,&quot; says Arman Mahmoudian, a research fellow at the Global and National Security Institute and a faculty member at the University of South Florida. &quot;But some of these discounts are so heavy that it&apos;s very difficult for Iran to beat.&quot; A general view of the Guwahati Refinery operated by Indian Oil Corporation in Guwahati, India, on March 30, 2023. On March 29, Russian oil giant Rosneft announced a deal with Indian Oil to significantly increase oil supplies. India has become a major buyer of Russian oil since the Ukraine war. (Biju Boro / AFP via Getty Images)There are also ongoing geopolitical disagreements and rivalries. The fall of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria is a fresh wound for both Iran and Russia: in a recording that surfaced in the Iranian media in early January, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps General Behrouz Esbati accused Moscow of failing Tehran by allowing Israeli strikes on Iranian assets in Syria. He also said that the Kremlin had misled Iranian officials by claiming to strike rebel forces while, in fact, bombing empty fields. The tussle between Iranian and Russian influence in the Caucasus remains another sensitive topic. In September, Iran warned Moscow against siding with Azerbaijan in an ongoing dispute between Baku and neighboring Armenia on the placement of a land corridor to Azerbaijan&apos;s Nakhchivan enclave. &quot;Any threat from north, south, east, or west to territorial integrity of our neighbors or redrawing of boundaries is totally unacceptable and a red line for Iran,&quot; Iranian Foreign Minister Sayeed Abbas Araghchi wrote on X at the time. However, such issues can be pushed aside as both sides react to changing political tides. For now, both can use their shared agreement to push back against a common foe &#x2014; the United States. &quot;Iran sees Russia as a powerful partner to force the United States out of the Middle East. They see the United States as the main obstacle in expanding their own influence in the region,&quot; says Azodi. &quot;Russia, obviously, is a very good partner because they want the same thing.&quot; The imminent inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump will be felt keenly in both Moscow and Tehran. For Iranian officials, Trump&apos;s president comes with a sense of trepidation. Trump has consistently advocated for a harder line on Iran, as have many among his advisors. As his second term looms, it is natural for Iran to seek refuge among powers such as Russia and China, says Mahmoudian. Moscow will also be trying to make its own impression on the White House.

(Win McNamee / Getty Images)&quot;Russia wants to send a signal to the White House: we still can make things worse for you,&quot; says Mahmoudian. &quot;(The agreement signals), &apos;we understand that you are trying to take a harsher stand against Iran, but it&apos;s going to be very hard without having us on board.&quot; Yet while closer Iranian-Russia ties currently aid both countries on the global stage, this agreement could also be easily shed as world events shift. If Moscow begins peace negotiations with Ukraine, then it may distance itself from Tehran in order to win favors in Washington. &quot;Russia&apos;s top foreign policy issue is Ukraine. They want to make a favorable deal. And for that, they need to make an agreement with the Americans as Ukraine&apos;s top backers. Russia is not going to, in my view, risk or jeopardize such a deal over Iran,&quot; says Mahmoudian. Ultimately, it is these external considerations that undermine the long-term effectiveness of the Russia-Iran deal. &quot;An agreement can be game-changing or influential, but not if it&apos;s at the mercy of another third party,&quot; Mahmoudian says. &quot;The destiny of this agreement and its survival is at the mercy of the White House and the new administration.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/for-moscow-iranian-president-masoud-pezeshkians-visit-to-russia-on-jan-17-is-a-diplomatic-victory/	2025-01-16T09:29:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2177151725.jpg

How Trump could use sanctions in negotiations with Russia	In the run-up to his departure from the White House, President Joe Biden has slapped a number of major new sanctions on Russia&#x2019;s financial systems and energy sector. The U.S. originally threatened Russia with &#x201C;the mother of all sanctions&#x201D; as Moscow prepared to invade Ukraine in February 2022. Since then, Washington and its allies have gone after tens of thousands of Russian citizens and companies in a bid to eat away Russia&#x2019;s economy and stifle its war machine. The effects of the sanctions have taken time to kick in while Russia has managed to circumvent the bans, particularly on its energy sector. But proponents of sanctions say they are a crucial tool in the economic war with Moscow and point to Russia&#x2019;s stuttering economy as an example. They have also gotten under the skin of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He tried to get grain and fertilizer sanctions lifted by offering to revive the failed Black Sea grain deal in September 2023, to no avail. Ships, including those carrying grain from Ukraine and awaiting inspections, are seen anchored off the Istanbul coastline in Istanbul, Turkey on Nov. 2, 2022. (Chris McGrath/Getty Images)In less than a week, President-elect Donald Trump will take over from Biden, casting uncertainty over the future of the sanctions. Trump has not yet indicated what he will do with the sanctions. He could lift certain sanctions, impose more, or simply leave everything as it is. Experts agree, however, that Trump will follow the proposal of Keith Kellog, Trump&#x2019;s Ukraine envoy who has suggested offering Russia sanctions relief as part of potential peace agreements. Trump&#x2019;s advisors are currently preparing a sanctions strategy to pressure Moscow toward a peace deal, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 16.But any change in the sanctions regime by Washington without proper coordination with allies like the U.K. and EU could undermine their efforts to contain Russia and wind up strengthening Moscow, experts say. &#x201C;If some major energy sanctions are lifted, Russia gains revenues and improves its financial situation and starts accumulating money again to produce missiles and weapons,&#x201D; said Yuliya Pavytska, the manager of the sanctions program at the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE). Trump will not be able to wipe away all the sanctions imposed on Russia on his first day in office. The Russian sanctions fall into two camps: executive, which the president has the power to impose or repeal on his own, and statutory, which requires going through Congress. The easiest sanctions for Trump to lift will be those implemented under Biden&#x2019;s executive order, says Yuliya Ziskina, a senior legal fellow at Razom for Ukraine, a nonprofit. These include travel bans, asset freezes, the oil price cap, bans on new investments in Russia, as well as bans on imports and exports of non-essential Russian goods like vodka and seafood. &#x201C;(Trump) could also lift technology export controls, which would be a pretty big deal because a lot of (U.S.) microchips find their way into Russian missiles,&#x201D; Ziskina added. The statutory orders require a back-and-forth between Trump and Congress. Trump would have to make determinations to Congress to get approval followed by a review period where Congress can issue a joint disapproval if they want the sanctions to remain which in turn can be vetoed by Trump. But Trump&#x2019;s veto could be overruled by Congress with a two-thirds majority. Congressional approval will be needed if Trump wants to lift the REPO Act, which greenlights the confiscation of the roughly $4-5 billion in frozen Russian assets in the U.S, as well as sanctions imposed under the 2017 Countering America&apos;s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). Trump&#x2019;s main goal will be to negotiate from a position of strength, said Steven Moore, a former chief of staff in the U.S. House of Representatives and founder of Ukraine Freedom Project, an NGO. He thinks Trump could tighten up sanctions and step up enforcement to plug the loopholes. &#x201C;Trump would be better served focusing on sanctions enforcement in the first year of his term to create some pain to which Vladimir Putin might be receptive to ending,&#x201D; he said. One of the glaring issues is Russia&#x2019;s shadow fleet which negates oil and gas sanctions through a network of hundreds of tankers. Biden cracked down on the fleet last week, imposing sanctions on 183 tankers, two dodgy insurance companies, and major oil producers Gazprom Neft, which is a subsidiary of state-energy giant Gazprom, and Surgutneftegas.

(Mikhail Metzel / Pool / AFP via Getty Images)Both companies produce over 1 million barrels of oil a day and make an estimated $23 billion a year, according to the U.S. Treasury. Biden&#x2019;s recent actions also include sanctions on Gazprom Bank and 50 other banks in November 2024. Most recently on Jan. 15, he imposed sanctions and secondary sanctions on 150 Russian and non-Russian financial institutions, energy companies, enterprises supporting the Russian military, and entities involved in sanctions evasion, particularly in China. These actions could be part of the outgoing administration&#x2019;s plan to &#x201C;amass bargaining chips&#x201D; for the next administration when Trump takes over, said Taisa Markus, adjunct professor at the University of Illinois College of Law and visiting professor at Kyiv Mohyla Faculty of Law. &#x201C;Some of these new sanctions can be lifted unilaterally by a president. Others require going to Congress perhaps revealing some desire on the part of the Biden administration to ensure the incoming administration keeps up pressure on Russia,&#x201D; she said. &#xA0; &#x201C;Or if Putin doesn&apos;t do what Trump wants, Trump can sanction more. Under existing authority, there is a lot more a President can do in terms of imposing sanctions or enforcement without going to Congress,&#x201D; Markus added. Trump&#x2019;s team has shared differing views on sanctions, which could impact his decision-making. Vice President-elect JD Vance brushed off the Russian sanctions, saying they have &#x201C;gone off like a wet firecracker&#x201D; and objected to the Repo Act believing it limits the president&#x2019;s political power.Marco Rubio, Trump&#x2019;s pick for Secretary of State, backed the idea of using sanctions as leverage over Russia. &#x201C;(Sanctions) will have to be part of this conversation in terms of bringing about a peaceful resolution,&#x201D; he said, CNN reported on Jan 15. Trump&#x2019;s advisors are in the early stages of preparing a sanctions strategy, Bloomberg reported, citing sources close to the matter. This could include some relief for sanctioned oil producers if a peace deal looks likely or expanding sanctions to bolster Washington&#x2019;s position. Sanctions are only one tool in the West&#x2019;s economic war, said Moore. He thinks Trump will ramp up energy production in the U.S. and increase liquified natural gas (LNG) sales to Europe to relinquish Russia&#x2019;s grip on Europe&#x2019;s LNG market and drive down Russian prices. Trump could also broker a deal with Saudi Arabia to bring down the price of oil following Riyad&#x2019;s decision to hike production last October which would further hinder Russia&#x2019;s economy. The fossil fuel is Russia&#x2019;s lifeline and it earned 12.4 billion euros ($12.6 billion) from oil exports in December alone, according to the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). &#x201C;Anything that can increase economic pressure is something that may keep Russia from being able to fight. That&apos;s what we&apos;re looking for,&#x201D; Moore said. Lifting sanctions does not appeal to everyone, particularly in Ukraine, largely due to distrust of Putin to keep his word. In Congress, opinions are split with pro-Ukrainian politicians less likely to back lifting sanctions. &#x201C;There&apos;s a very strong argument for keeping the sanctions in place long after a peace agreement to ensure compliance,&#x201D; Markus said. Lifting sanctions means that Russia will be able to expand its revenue streams again. If Putin agrees to a ceasefire, he could bolster Russia&#x2019;s economy and war machine and attack again if there are no security guarantees in place for Ukraine, like NATO membership. &#x201C;There has to be something very big from Putin&apos;s side, like fully getting out of Ukraine. (Lifting sanctions) is definitely not worth a ceasefire, as Putin won&#x2019;t follow it,&#x201D; said KSE&#x2019;s Pavytska.

(Anatolii Stepanov/AFP via Getty Images)The consequences could be dire if Trump doesn&#x2019;t act in coordination with other partners, particularly Europe. Since the sanctions are designed to work in tandem with each other, lifting U.S. sanctions would undermine European efforts and alleviate the economic burden on Russia. This could force the EU and U.K. to bear greater responsibility and step up on their own, said Pavytska. Or it could erode unity between Ukraine&#x2019;s allies. &#x201C;&#x200A;If the U.S. is seen as regaining access to Russia&apos;s market while Europeans keep their sanctions in place and their companies don&apos;t get access to that market, they&apos;re at a competitive edge,&#x201D; said Ziskina. This may aggravate tension within Europe and embolden anti-Ukrainian factions within the EU like Hungary and Slovakia to push for sanction relief, she added. In general, Congress looks at sanctions favorably as they are perceived as costing the U.S. &#x201C;nothing,&#x201D; Ziskina said. Trump&#x2019;s administration will look at sanctions through the eyes of U.S. interests and what&#x2019;s best for them. &#x201C;It&apos;s not necessarily about helping Ukraine,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s more support for sanctions within Congress than there is for allocating a budget to Ukraine&#x2019;s defense,&#x201D; she added.	https://kyivindependent.com/heres-what-trump-could-do-with-russian-sanctions/	2025-01-16T08:39:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192427196.jpg
Trump advisers draft sanctions plan to pressure Moscow toward peace, Bloomberg reports	Advisers to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump are developing a comprehensive sanctions strategy aimed at facilitating a diplomatic resolution to the Russia-Ukraine war, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 16, citing anonymous sources familiar with the discussions. This comes as Russia&apos;s fossil fuel industry continues to serve as a primary source of funding for its war against Ukraine. The Trump team is reportedly weighing two primary approaches. The first set of policy recommendations suggests that, if a resolution to the war appears possible, the administration should focus on good-faith measures to benefit sanctioned Russian oil producers that could help seal a peace deal. The second option would involve expanding sanctions to exert maximum pressure, increasing leverage over Moscow. Trump&apos;s team is also evaluating sanctions policy options to put pressure on Iran and Venezuela, Bloomberg reported. The strategy is in its early stages and ultimately depends on what Trump decides to do, the people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The Biden administration and the U.K. recently imposed their most extensive sanctions yet on Russia&apos;s oil sector, targeting nearly 200 vessels in the &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; key oil companies, and related entities. These measures, announced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on Jan. 10, have already impacted the global oil market, pushing Brent crude prices up by nearly $5 per barrel. The G7 nations are also considering tightening the existing $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 19. Ukraine has disrupted Russia&apos;s oil production through targeted drone strikes on key infrastructure. Refineries in Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk have reportedly reduced or suspended operations due to the combined effects of sanctions and Ukrainian attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-advisers-draft-sanctions-plan-to-pressure-moscow-toward-peace-bloomberg-reports/	2025-01-16T07:21:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192427196.jpg
UK announces new $2.6 billion aid package to Ukraine	U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a new military aid package worth $2.6 billion for Ukraine during his visit to Kyiv on Jan. 16, European Pravda reported. This visit marks Starmer&apos;s second trip to the Ukrainian capital and the first since becoming prime minister in July 2024. During the visit, Starmer and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a 100-year partnership agreement to solidify long-term cooperation. Starmer revealed that the U.K. has already provided 3 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) in military aid to Ukraine this year and pledged an additional 2.2 billion pounds ($2.6 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian assets. The prime minister said that separate from the new aid package, the U.K. would send Ukraine 150 artillery barrels produced by Sheffield Forgemasters, the first such barrels manufactured in the U.K. in over two decades. &quot;They will start arriving in Ukraine in a few weeks,&quot; Starmer said at a press conference. The prime minister also announced the delivery of a mobile air defense system developed in collaboration with Denmark, signaling ongoing efforts to bolster Ukraine&apos;s air defense capabilities. In the days leading up to Starmer&apos;s visit, Bloomberg reported that Starmer and Zelensky were set to discuss the potential deployment of an international peacekeeping force to Ukraine during the trip.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-to-send-ukraine-artillery-barrels-air-defense-system-as-part-of-2-6b-package-funded-by-russian-assets/	2025-01-16T06:22:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193577260.jpg
North Korean troops deployed to fight for Russia learn modern warfare — albeit at heavy cost	Since December, North Korean troops have been taking part in active combat on Russia&apos;s side in the country&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine has held territory since August. This unprecedented move, made against the backdrop of a deepening Moscow-Pyongyang alliance, provided some insight into how North Korean troops fare in modern warfare. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 9 that North Korea had suffered 4,000 soldiers killed or wounded while fighting for Russia against Ukraine. A week later, South Korea&apos;s intelligence agency placed North Korean losses at 300 killed and 2,700 injured. Though these claims cannot be independently verified, experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent for this article believe the figures to be credible. This means that up to one-third of the 12,000-strong North Korean contingent sent to aid Russia&apos;s war have been killed or injured. But despite gaps in knowledge and experience, observers acknowledge that the North Koreans have proven to be committed, even fanatical fighters. As a testament of their will to fight and die in war a continent away, Ukraine has so far managed to capture only two North Korean soldiers &#x2014; the others reportedly commit suicide or are killed by their comrades to avoid falling into captivity. A North Korean POW captured by Ukrainian forces during hostilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, as seen in a photo published on Jan. 11, 2025. (President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)What&apos;s behind North Korean losses?Though Ukraine reported the first limited clashes with North Korean troops in Kursk Oblast in early November 2024, full-fledged combat deployment in ground assaults can be traced to mid-December. North Korean soldiers have joined Russian efforts in retaking Ukrainian-held territory in Kursk Oblast, held since early August 2024. Since then, Kyiv&apos;s forces began churning out footage of North Korean soldiers being hunted down by FPV drones or killed by Ukrainian fire as reports of casualties mounted. Despite the training and equipment Russia provided to its new allies, North Korean troops proved ill-prepared for the realities of modern warfare, lacking the experience of their Russian and Ukrainian counterparts. &quot;North Korean troops are being &apos;consumed&apos; for front-line assaults in an unfamiliar battlefield environment of open fields, and they lack the ability to respond to drone attacks,&quot; said a South Korean official briefed by his country&apos;s intelligence agency in December. The high casualty rates can also be attributed to the &quot;human wave&quot; tactic mirroring Russian attacks in eastern Ukraine as North Korean soldiers are funneled against fortified Ukrainian defenses. The battlefield environment in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine has been especially deadly, with Russia itself suffering between 600,000-800,000 casualties throughout the full-scale invasion, according to Ukrainian sources. Speaking to the Kyiv Independent, defense expert Viktor Kevliuk said that the purpose of the North Korean contingent is to &quot;solve tactical tasks that involve a high level of losses.&quot; Similarly, White House spokesperson John Kirby noted that North Korea employs &quot;massed dismounted assaults&quot; which &quot;haven&apos;t really been that effective&quot; and result in &quot;heavy casualties.&quot; &quot;At night, small, overstretched groups (10-15 soldiers) come in, accumulate, and then enter the village from different directions,&quot; a Ukrainian soldier fighting near Sudzha told the Kyiv Independent on Jan. 6, confirming that North Korean assaults resemble the infamous &quot;human wave&quot; tactics.

(Oksana Parafeniuk for The Washington Post via Getty Images)&quot;I think these columns are entirely Koreans, they come in, and then they are replaced by Russians already in the positions they occupy.&quot; Sydney Seiler, a senior advisor at the Center of Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and former U.S. intelligence officer for North Korea, told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;cards (have been) stacked against&quot; North Korean soldiers from the beginning. &quot;And when you throw on top of that command and control language differences and just the fact that this is high casualty warfare,&quot; the current casualty rates are to be expected, the expert said. Western and Ukrainian officials nevertheless acknowledged that the &quot;indoctrinated&quot; North Korean soldiers, including elite &quot;Storm Corps&quot; units, showed high resolve and continued attacking no matter the casualties or chances of success. South Korea&apos;s intelligence agency recently said that the North Korean soldiers chose suicide rather than falling into captivity, ramping up the losses even further. A video published by Special Operations Forces of Ukraine on Jan. 13, showed Ukrainian troops taking part in active combat with allegedly North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. In one instance, the video captures a soldier fighting against Ukrainian troops committing suicide. While the deployment of North Korean soldiers is mutually beneficial to both Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, The New York Times reported that the idea came from Pyongyang. North Korea receives not only assistance for its nuclear weapons program, hard cash, and other tangible benefits but also valuable military experience. The threat of the North Korean regime acquiring a battle-hardened force adept at modern warfare has indeed become a cause for concern both in Seoul and Washington. Pyongyang &quot;is significantly benefiting from receiving Russian military equipment, technology, and experience, rendering it more capable of waging war against its neighbors,&quot; said Dorothy Camille Shea, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Special Operations Forces shared an alleged excerpt from a diary of a killed North Korean soldier that seems to confirm these concerns. &quot;I emphasize once again that the most important, vital task for our Armed Forces is readiness in the event of war,&quot; the diary reads. The goal of North Korea&apos;s involvement in Russia&apos;s war is &quot;to prepare versatile battalions that can perform any task perfectly, even at the cost of death.&quot; Indeed, it appears that the North Koreans are learning their lesson &#x2014; albeit the hard way.

(Kim Jae-Hwan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)&quot;There&apos;s evidence that they&apos;re (North Korean troops) starting to learn how to use soldiers as decoys for drones while others shoot them down,&quot; Mick Ryan, a retired Australian major general and non-resident fellow at the CSIS, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It&apos;s going to be a long, slow learning process for them, but they will learn &#x2014; those who survive &#x2014; and they&apos;ll pass those lessons on to subsequent deployments to Kursk and to their military back home in North Korea.&quot; Seiler told the Kyiv Independent that North Koreans &quot;probably engaged in military actions that are relatively simple in their complexity and become highly repetitive.&quot; &quot;They&apos;ve overcome the shock of the sudden deployment,&quot; he added. The expert nevertheless voiced skepticism about the usefulness of the gained experience unless North Korea dispatches a larger contingent. &quot;I don&apos;t really believe that unless this is a protracted contribution of troops somewhere up towards 100,000 or more (who) get experience&#x2026; that that&apos;s going to be a big payoff,&quot; Seiler said. There are signals that the initial 12,000-strong contingent might not be the last batch of reinforcements Moscow receives. Speaking to U.S. podcaster Lex Fridman, Zelensky said that North Korea could dispatch an additional 30,000&#x2013;40,000 troops to the front as Russia ramps up pressure in Kursk Oblast. On Russia&apos;s part, North Korean troops can help beef up the front in Kursk Oblast while experienced Russian forces continue pushing forward in Ukraine&apos;s east. &quot;The North Korean contingent is a discount way to increase the density of&#x2026; (Russia&apos;s) battle formations in the Kursk region,&quot; Kevliuk said, acknowledging that they are &quot;useful in this context.&quot; Putin is likely to try and squeeze Ukraine out of his home turf before Kyiv can leverage its positions there in possible peace talks this year. Russia has been steadily chipping away at Ukrainian gains in its southwestern region for the past months. A recent Ukrainian offensive appeared to have achieved only limited gains so far rather than turning the tide. As for North Korea, experts concur that both tangible and intangible benefits the country&apos;s regime receives outweigh any potential losses. &quot;Whether it&apos;s broader lessons from the war about drones and air defense, strategic coercion, information operations, whether it&apos;s about access to new technologies for its missiles and these kinds of things, there will be other kinds of returns that North Korean will be expecting,&quot; Ryan said. According to Seiler, Kim Jong Un&apos;s ambition to &quot;show himself as a leader among this new axis of upheaval&quot; and gain diplomatic benefits from his partners could be even more important than any potential battlefield experience. Western officials have warned that North Korea could grow bolder should Ukraine be defeated, with potential repercussions for the security in the Korean Peninsula and the Asia-Pacific region at large.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-koreas-troops-learn-the-lessons-of-russias-war-albeit-at-heavy-cost/	2025-01-16T05:57:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2157787216.jpg
Russian drone flew over presidential palace during Zelensky-Starmer meeting, Guardian reports	A Russian drone flew over the Mariinsky Palace in Kyiv as President Volodymyr Zelensky was meeting U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Jan. 16, The Guardian reported. The drone incursion came as Starmer arrived in Ukraine&apos;s capital on his first visit since taking office. Explosions were heard in downtown Kyiv around 12:20 p.m. local time, according to Kyiv Independent reporters. Air defense was trying to shoot down a drone as two leaders held talks, The Guardian reported. The drone was spotted and heard buzzing above the Mariinsky Palace, the presidential residence, located not far from the Presidential Office. Zelensky and Starmer held a press conference there later the same day. The unmanned aerial vehicle spotted above the palace may have been a decoy, according to The Guardian. Kyiv and London signed a wide-ranging &quot;100 Year Partnership&quot; treaty covering a number of areas, including defense, energy, trade, culture, and other sectors. &quot;We will send greetings (to Russia) too,&quot; Zelensky said at a press conference when asked about the recent Russian drone attack, Interfax-Ukraine reported. Debris from downed Russian drones fell in five districts of Kyiv, said Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the city&apos;s military administration. No casualties or fires were reported. The Pecherskyi district, where the Presidential Office is located, came under a Russian drone attack also on the morning of Jan. 1. Two people, a couple of prominent scientists, were killed, and six others were injured.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-flew-over-presidential-palace-during-zelensky-starmer-meeting-guardian-reports/	2025-01-16T05:56:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193577080.jpg
Ukrainian families of war victims can now seek compensation through The Hague's Register of Damage	The International Register of Damage for Ukraine has begun accepting applications for compensation from families who lost close relatives due to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office announced on Jan. 16. The application process for this category was delayed after a December 2024 cyberattack on Ukrainian state registers, according to a statement on the register&apos;s website. The Hague-based Register of Damage was established under the auspices of the Council of Europe in accordance with a U.N. General Assembly resolution. It marked the first step toward creating a mechanism to ensure compensation for those who suffered from the war. Claims can now be submitted for over 40 categories of harm, including deaths, torture, sexual violence, bodily harm, forced displacement, property loss, damage to infrastructure, harm to cultural and historical heritage, and environmental destruction. Ukrainians can also provide evidence of damage to or destruction of their properties, including houses and apartments. The World Bank estimates Ukraine&apos;s post-war recovery and reconstruction costs at $486 billion over a 10-year period. Meanwhile, approximately $300 billion of Russian Central Bank assets remain frozen in the West. The G7 nations pledged in October 2023 to keep these assets frozen until Moscow pays reparations to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/families-of-war-victims-can-now-seek-compensation-through-ukraines-register-of-damage/	2025-01-16T05:44:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/signal-2025-01-12-154342_008.jpeg
Ukraine, UK sign 100-year partnership agreement	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer signed a 100-year partnership agreement during their meeting in Kyiv on Jan. 16. The wide-ranging deal encompasses cooperation in military, energy, scientific, cultural, economic, and other sectors. The agreement builds upon the trade and partnership agreement signed by the two countries in 2020 and the bilateral security deal penned in January 2024. The document, published by Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office, includes 10 main pillars: &quot;(Russian President Vladimir) Putin&#x2019;s ambition to wrench Ukraine away from its closest partners has been a monumental strategic failure,&quot; Starmer said in a statement. &quot;Instead, we are closer than ever, and this partnership will take that friendship to the next level.&quot; Starmer&apos;s visit marks his second to the Ukrainian capital and the first since he was elected prime minister in July 2024. It comes as the U.K. reportedly discusses deploying an international peacekeeping force to the embattled country after a potential ceasefire. Bloomberg reported on Jan. 10 that Starmer was expected to visit Kyiv to discuss the peacekeepers&apos; potential deployment with Zelensky.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-uk-sign-100-year-partnership-agreement/	2025-01-16T05:17:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193577260.jpg
North Korean troops to join Russia’s Victory Day for the first time, media reports	North Korean soldiers will participate in Russia&#x2019;s Victory Day parade in Moscow on May 9, marking the first such instance in history, the Japanese broadcaster NHK World reported on Jan. 16, citing undisclosed Russian sources. Since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has deepened its diplomatic and military ties with North Korea. Last fall, Pyongyang sent troops to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to bolster Moscow&apos;s efforts against a Ukrainian incursion. Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov announced on Jan. 15 that military from 19 &quot;friendly&quot; countries have been invited to the Victory Day parade. NHK&apos;s sources said that tens of North Korean personnel are expected to participate in the commemoration of the victory in World War II. Kremlin foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov signaled back in December 2024 that North Korean troops might join the event. Additionally, a North Korean military band is reportedly set to perform at a music event in Moscow in late August, marking the first time North Korean military representatives will participate in such events in Russia. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico also accepted Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s invitation to attend the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow. The Kremlin heavily leverages the annual Victory Day celebrations to project military strength and propagate its narrative of Soviet heroism in World War II. Russian propaganda continues to exploit these historical victories, using them to justify its current aggression against Ukraine. Putin has framed the war as a mission to &quot;de-Nazify&quot; Ukraine, a false accusation rooted in his broader disinformation campaign.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-to-join-russias-victory-day-parade/	2025-01-16T05:06:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1074306244.jpg
Ukrainian drones hit Russian oil depot in Voronezh Oblast, military claims	Ukrainian soldiers struck the Liskinskaya oil depot in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast with drones overnight on Jan. 16, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported. According to the military, the targeted oil depot stored fuel, which was used for the needs of the Russian army. The statement came after Russian reports of the oil depot on fire in Voronezh Oblast. The village of Liski in Voronezh Oblast lies over 150 kilometers (98 miles) east of the Ukrainian border. In an attack conducted by the Special Operations Forces and other units of Ukraine&apos;s Defense Forces, at least three drones hit the facility, causing a large-scale fire, the General Staff said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The attack comes amid an uptick in Ukraine&#x2019;s drone operations targeting Russian energy infrastructure. A Ukrainian drone strike also reportedly targeted a Russian gunpowder factory in the village of Kuzmino-Gat in Tambov Oblast overnight on Jan. 16. Ukrainian forces have previously targeted military airfields, oil refineries, and ammunition depots in Voronezh Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-hit-russian-oil-depot-in-voronezh-oblast-military-claims/	2025-01-16T04:52:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2069256477.jpg
Russia claims it struck Lviv Oblast gas storage facilities; Ukraine reports no disruptions	Russia claimed it had damaged ground facilities at one of Ukraine&apos;s largest natural gas storage sites in Lviv Oblast during a series of missile and drone attacks on Jan. 15. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed the attacks were retaliation for an alleged Ukrainian strike on a gas compressor station in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar region on Jan. 11, a key point for the TurkStream pipeline, the last conduit for Russian gas to Europe. Russian attacks also occurred a day after Ukraine launched a series of strikes on Russian military and industrial facilities, including ammunition depots and refineries. Moscow has consistently targeted Ukraine&apos;s residential areas and energy infrastructure throughout the full-scale war, regardless of Ukraine&apos;s actions. Lviv Oblast officials confirmed damage to critical infrastructure in two districts but reported no casualties. The acting CEO of Ukraine&apos;s state-owned Naftogaz energy company, Roman Chumak, also confirmed that gas infrastructure was targeted but said that gas supplies were uninterrupted and repairs would be conducted swiftly. The strikes, which included Kh-101, Kh-22, and Kalibr cruise missiles, were part of a broader assault on Ukraine&apos;s energy sector. President Volodymyr Zelensky highlighted the timing and intent of the strikes, writing, &quot;It&apos;s the middle of winter, and Russia&apos;s goal remains the same: our energy sector.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha previously praised Kyiv&apos;s decision to halt Russian gas transit as a critical measure to weaken the Kremlin&apos;s leverage over Europe. Ukraine ceased the transit through its territory on Jan. 1, aiming to avoid financing Moscow&apos;s war effort.	https://kyivindependent.com/gas-storage-facilities-attack/	2025-01-16T04:45:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1240508647.jpg
You were shot. Why didn't you forgive?' Zelensky tells Fico, drawing parallels to Russian aggression	The Slovak government is playing very dangerous game by criticizing military support for Ukraine and getting closer to Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with the Polish media on Jan. 16. &quot;The Slovak leaders are playing a very dangerous game. They will continue to do so until the war reaches their own homes,&quot; Zelensky said. The comments come amid a growing rift between Ukraine and Slovakia as Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico threatened Kyiv with repercussions over its decision to halt the Russian gas transit to the EU. Fico, who visited Moscow in December to discuss gas supply issues with Russian President Vladimir Putin, has also consistently criticized military aid for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. Talking to Polish journalists, Zelensky recalled his conversation with the Slovak prime minister during a meeting of European leaders. &quot;I told him: &apos;You were shot at. Why didn&apos;t you forgive? Why did you arrest this person who injured you?&apos;&quot; Zelensky said, drawing a parallel between the Russian invasion of Ukraine and an assassination attempt on the Slovak prime minister. Fico was critically injured after being shot in the Slovak town of Handlova on May 15, 2024, following a government meeting. Slovak authorities said that the attack was politically motivated. The suspect, 71-year-old writer Juraj Cintula, has been detained and is awaiting trial. &quot;I reminded this to him (Fico) and told him that all of us, no matter your positions, condemned such steps because a living person was shot at,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;And that&apos;s Putin. He is the same; he shoots living people, albeit through the hands of others.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/you-were-shot-at-why-didnt-you-forgive-zelensky-tells-fico/	2025-01-16T04:35:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2152712934.jpg
Trump sending 'non-public messages' on war, he must force Putin to diplomacy, Zelensky says	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump can end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with Polish media released on Jan. 16, not ruling out that it may happen in 2025. &quot;These are his (Trump&apos;s) messages, both public and non-public. And he is a capable leader to put pressure on Russia,&quot; Zelensky said. Trump is set to take office on Jan. 20. Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump promised to negotiate a swift end to the war in Ukraine, often referring to his good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to the Ukrainian president, Trump should agree on real security guarantees for Ukraine. &quot;He must force Putin to diplomacy, to end this war,&quot; Zelensky added. Trump&apos;s push for a quick end to the war has led to fears that Kyiv will be pressured into unfavorable concessions, including loss of land. About 20% of Ukrainian territory is currently under occupation by Russian forces. Some of Trump&apos;s advisors have signaled a timeline of at least several months to strike a deal to settle the Russia-Ukraine war, Reuters reported on Jan. 15.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-must-force-putin-to-diplomacy-zelensky-says/	2025-01-16T03:43:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192427196.jpg
Russian officer jailed for accidentally shooting down own helicopter in Crimea	A Russian air defense officer stationed in occupied Sevastopol, Igor Pashkov, has been sentenced to two years and 10 months in prison for shooting down a Russian army helicopter after mistaking it for a drone, pro-government outlet Kommersant reported on Jan. 16. Russian investigative authorities charged Pashko with violations of combat duty rules, which resulted in grave consequences. The incident occurred on Dec. 18, 2023, in occupied Crimea. Pashkov, while on combat duty, received a report on what he believed to be a low-flying drone. Acting on incomplete information and failing to confirm the target&apos;s identity in time, he launched a missile salvo from a TOR-M2DT anti-aircraft system. The missile struck a Russian Mi-8 helicopter, which crashed into the Black Sea, killing the crew on board. Pashkov admitted guilt in May 2024, and the prosecution sought a seven-year sentence. In the first instance, the military court sentenced him to three years, a term later reduced by a higher court by two months. In addition to his prison sentence, Pashkov is barred from holding positions involving organizational or administrative functions in the civil service or local government for one year.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-officer-jailed-over-helicopter-downing/	2025-01-16T03:26:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1212056374.jpg
Ukraine’s Emergency Service denies claims of mass mobilization, says 90% of staff are exempt	Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service refuted claims that 50% of its employees would be mobilized, saying on Jan. 16 via Facebook that 90% of its personnel are exempt from mobilization. &quot;Every day, State Emergency Service employees rescue citizens and mitigate the consequences of Russian attacks, often at the cost of their health and lives,&quot; the agency said, urging the public to rely on verified information. The State Emergency Service clarified that rapid response units &#x2014; firefighters, sappers, rescuers, chemists, engineers, and similar specialists &#x2014; are fully exempt from mobilization to continue critical operations. This denial follows opposition MP Oleksii Honcharenko&apos;s Telegram post alleging plans for widespread State Emergency Service mobilization after Feb. 28, which the State Emergency Service labeled as misinformation. The news also comes amid reports of personnel transfers from Ukraine&apos;s Air Force to the Ground Forces, reported by Ukrainska Pravda on Jan. 14. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi allegedly had ordered the reassignment of over 5,000 Air Force personnel to address infantry shortages, particularly in Donetsk Oblast. Speaking anonymously, a senior Air Force officer warned that such transfers risk undermining unit effectiveness, especially for anti-aircraft missile systems that require highly trained and cohesive teams. The officer added that if transfers proceed as planned, some units could see staffing levels drop to 40%. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces denied these claims on Jan. 14, saying that technical and aviation personnel numbers are increasing rather than being reassigned. Ukraine has been struggling with a manpower shortage, especially in the infantry, while Russia has intensified its offensive in Donetsk Oblast since the summer of 2024. About 930,000 Ukrainians liable for military service are temporarily exempt from conscription, Forbes Ukraine reported last August. The Ukrainian government has also permitted businesses to reserve up to 50% of their employees if their enterprises are deemed critical to the economy&#x2019;s functioning.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-emergency-service-denies-claims-of-mass-mobilization-says-90-of-staff-are-exempt/	2025-01-16T03:08:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-25_09-40-25.jpg
Ukraine extends cooperation with Norwegian NASAMS systems supplier	Kyiv is extending its cooperation with Norwegian defense company Kongsberg, one of the suppliers of NASAMS air defense systems to Ukraine, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Jan. 16. The defense minister met with Eirik Lie, executive vice president of Kongsberg Gruppen ASA and president of Kongsberg Defense &amp; Aerospace. The two discussed anti-drone systems and the possibility of localizing their production in Ukraine, as well as the development of maritime capabilities. Ukraine and Norway also discussed the possibility of integrating Ukrainian-made air defense systems into NASAMS &quot;to increase its effectiveness,&quot; Umerov said. The NASAMS systems have been in service with Ukrainian forces since November 2022, when the U.S. delivered the first batteries amid escalating Russian airstrikes. Ukraine has lobbied international partners for more air defense capabilities in the wake of intensifying Russian strikes targeting energy infrastructure. Norway has been one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters in Europe. According to Umerov, Oslo allocated 2 billion euros &#xA0;($2.1 billion) for military aid to Ukraine in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-extends-cooperation-with-norwegian-nasams-systems-supplier/	2025-01-16T02:33:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-16_11-31-44.jpg
Russia discusses buying gas for Transnistria in Europe, media reports	Moscow and local authorities in Transnistria are discussing the possibility of purchasing gas for Moldova&apos;s Russian-occupied region on the European spot market via an intermediary company, the Russian state-controlled media outlet Kommersant reported on Jan. 15, citing unnamed sources. The costs are likely to be compensated by the Russian budget, the newspaper reported. Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom halted gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1 as Ukraine ended Russian gas transit through its territory. Gazprom claimed that it halted supplies because of Moldova&apos;s alleged unpaid debts rather than transit issues. The gas suspension has led to widespread power outages in Transnistria, pushing the region toward industrial collapse. The Russian-held region is dependent on Russian supplies while the rest of the country pivoted toward European sellers. According to Kommersant&apos;s sources, gas may be purchased from January to April in amounts of up to 3 million cubic meters per day. The outlet estimates the price at $164 million. Supplies to Tiraspoltransgaz, the largest gas provider in the region, are likely to be carried out not by Moldovagaz, which has a monopoly on supplies to Transnistria, but by another Moldovan gas supplier, Natural Gaz D.C., the outlet wrote. &#xA0; Arkady Vikol, the co-owner of Natural Gaz D.C., confirmed that his company had signed a framework contract with Tiraspoltransgaz to supply 2 to 3 million cubic meters of gas per day to Transnistria. Moldova&apos;s Security and Intelligence Service interrogated Vikol over his company&apos;s plans to organize gas supplies to Transnistria, Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean said. Russia will resume gas supplies to Transnistria in the form of humanitarian aid, said Vadim Krasnoselsky, the head of the Moscow-controlled region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-discusses-buying-gas-for-transnistria-in-europe-media-reports/	2025-01-16T02:08:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1686320111-1.jpg
Ukrainian paratroopers capture 27 Russian soldiers in Kursk Oblast	Ukrainian paratroopers and other units captured 27 Russian service members during hostilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the Airborne Assault Troops&apos; press service said on Jan. 16. &quot;Among them are officers, sergeants, and privates from motorized rifle units, Marines, airborne troops, and other units, coming from various Russian regions and the occupied city of Sevastopol,&quot; the press service announced on its Telegram channel. Ukraine has been fighting in the southwestern Kursk Oblast since August 2024, hoping to use its positions there as a trump card in potential negotiations with Russia. Moscow has ramped up its efforts to throw Ukrainian out of its territory, deploying North Korean troops and reportedly retaking around half of the area initially taken by Kyiv. &quot;We call on other Russian soldiers not to resist and surrender!&quot; the Airborne Assault Troops&apos; press service said, promising to treat Russian prisoners of war (POW) in accordance with international humanitarian law. Only a day earlier, Ukraine&apos;s National Guard announced the capture of 23 Russian soldiers during combat operations near Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast. Ukraine and Russia regularly hold prisoner exchanges, most recently on Jan. 15 when 25 Ukrainians, including Azovstal defenders, were released.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-paratroopers-capture-27-russian-soldiers-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-01-16T01:44:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Prisoners.png
Italy's Defense Minister Crosetto arrives in Kyiv on official visit	Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto arrived in Kyiv on Jan. 16 for a &quot;series of institutional meetings,&quot; Italy&apos;s Defense Ministry announced. Crosetto arrived in Kyiv on the same day as U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is in the Ukrainian capital to sign a &quot;100 Year Partnership&quot; agreement and discuss further cooperation with President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Italian ministry did not reveal who is Crosetto expected to meet or the topic of the discussions. The European officials are visiting Ukraine mere days before the start of Donald Trump&apos;s presidency, which could have a major impact on the progress of the Russia-Ukraine war. Trump has pledged to push both sides to the negotiating table and reportedly backed the idea of European partners deploying peacekeepers to monitor a potential ceasefire. Crosetto previously voiced support for the idea, suggesting Italy is open to joining the peacekeeping mission. Starmer is also expected to discuss the topic with Zelensky during his visit. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, Italy has delivered 10 military aid packages, including advanced SAMP/T air defenses, to Ukraine. The country&apos;s cabinet recently approved the extension of the assistance for Ukraine throughout 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/italys-defense-minister-crosetto-arrives-in-kyiv-on-official-visit/	2025-01-16T01:14:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/808eccb3-7186-4cfb-83f3-59e9cc1f33b1.jpeg
Ukraine is still free' — Biden touts his admin's accomplishments in farewell speech	Outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden briefly mentioned Ukraine during his farewell speech on Jan. 15, saying his administration helped to preserve the country&apos;s freedom. &quot;Ukraine is still free, and we&#x2019;ve pulled ahead of our competition with China and so much more,&quot; the U.S. president said as he listed his administration&apos;s accomplishments, including stronger NATO. Biden ends his first and only four-year term on Jan. 20, to be succeeded by former President Donald Trump. The Biden administration has provided $65.9 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, making it Kyiv&apos;s largest donor. &quot;It will take time to feel the full impact of what we&#x2019;ve done together. But the seeds are planted, and they&#x2019;ll grow, and they&#x2019;ll bloom for decades to come,&quot; Biden said. Despite the provided support, the Biden administration has often attracted criticism for its self-restricting and hesitant approach, with many key military capabilities being greenlighted only after prolonged pressure. Before winning his reelection, Trump had criticized the military aid for Ukraine and pledged to cut a swift deal to end the war and get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the conflict. This sparked concerns that the incoming U.S. president could reduce defense aid or push Kyiv toward a painful peace deal. Trump and his team later signaled that they do not plan to abandon Ukraine, though Secretary of State nominee Marc Rubio said Kyiv would have to make concessions to achieve a ceasefire. Russia continues to occupy roughly one-fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory while its forces are pushing forward in Donetsk Oblast. In turn, Ukrainian forces hold on to a piece of Russian territory in Kursk Oblast, which is seen as a potential trump card in expected talks. Both Kyiv and Moscow face mounting challenges connected to the full-scale war, with Ukraine dealing with manpower shortages and Russia with a struggling economy.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-is-free-biden-stresses-in-farewell-speech/	2025-01-16T00:31:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193228711.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 4, injure 27 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed four people and injured at least 27 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Jan. 16. Ukrainian forces downed 34 out of 55 drones, including Shahed-type ones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Another 18 were &quot;lost,&quot; it added. Debris from downed drones damaged energy infrastructure in Poltava Oblast, leaving hundreds of people without power, the local military administration said. Russian attacks on the town of Nikopol in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast killed a 54-year-old woman and injured a 45-year-old man, according to Governor Serhii Lysak. The attack damaged around 30 houses, five high-rise buildings, industrial enterprises, and cars, he added. A total of 15 people were injured in the town of Kramatorsk and the villages of Kostiantynopil, Oleksiievo-Druzhkivka, Stinky, and Chernihivka in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. A Russian drone attack on the town of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast injured a 73-year-old man, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 36 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Three people were killed and 10 were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-4-injure-27-over-past-day/	2025-01-16T00:00:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-15_16-09-03.jpg
Ukraine blows up mine shaft to hamper Russian advance to Pokrovsk, NYT reports	Ukraine blew up the No. 3 mine&apos;s shaft in the village of Pishchane in Donetsk Oblast to prevent Russia from deploying its troops closer to the front-line town of Pokrovsk, The New York Times (NYT) reported on Jan. 15, citing miners. According to the Ukrainian miners, at some point, the shaft, located southeast of Pokrovsk, became too dangerous to work in due to constant Russian attacks. They switched to descending into the mine through another shaft. Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian forces, has been the focus of fierce fighting as Russia intensifies its offensive in Donetsk Oblast. In the meantime, Russian troops advanced to within a mile of mine No. 3, raising fears that they could seize it and use its tunnels to outflank Ukraine&apos;s positions, according to the NYT. The miners and Ukrainian soldiers began drilling holes under the shaft to plant explosives, several workers told the outlet. The shaft was blown up around Dec. 20, 2024. Keeping the mine operational as long as possible was crucial to the Ukrainian economy, as it produced coking coal required for steelmaking &#x2014; Ukraine&apos;s second-largest export after agriculture. An unnamed manager at Metinvest, Ukraine&apos;s largest steel producer, told the NYT that explosives were also planted in the facility&#x2019;s two other shafts located further west, near the Ukraine-controlled villages of Kotlyne and Udachne. It is unknown whether they have been detonated. Earlier this month, Metinvest announced it had suspended operations at the Pokrovsk coking coal mine in Donetsk Oblast due to worsening security conditions and power outages. Steel exports generated nearly $2 billion in the first eight months of 2024, with production projected to reach 7.5 million metric tons by year-end. Plans to increase output to over 10 million tons in 2025 are now threatened, as the loss of Pokrovsk could slash annual production to 2-3 million tons, according to Reuters.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-blows-up-shaft-in-pokrovsk-nyt/	2025-01-15T23:33:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2184979920.jpg
Ukraine hopes to open all 6 negotiating clusters on EU accession in 2025, Zelensky says	Ukraine has the &quot;ambitious goal&quot; to open five or six EU accession negotiation clusters in 2025, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 15. Ukraine applied for EU membership at the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. The country has made quick progress, achieving candidate status within months, with the initial negotiations formally launching in June 2024. Ukraine will open two or three negotiation clusters in the first six months of 2025 under Poland&apos;s rotating presidency, Zelensky said during his official visit to Warsaw. Poland will lead the EU Council&apos;s presidency for six months from January, and Denmark will take over the role in July. Ukraine aims to open three more negotiation clusters in the second half of 2025 under the Danish chairmanship, the president noted. &quot;We have an ambitious goal to open five to six clusters. In principle, we can open them all this year, if we succeed. We will try to do it all,&quot; Zelensky said. There are six accession negotiation clusters, consisting of several individual chapters. Negotiations prepare a candidate country to become an EU member. The EU&#x2019;s Commissioner for Enlargement, Oliver Varhelyi, said that Ukraine could potentially join the bloc by 2029 if it successfully implements necessary reforms. EU membership, alongside continued weapons shipments and NATO accession, are among the key security guarantees for Ukraine, Zelensky said on Jan. 15 as his country continues to face Russian aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-eu-negotiations/	2025-01-15T23:20:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190061070.jpg
Ukrainian drone strike reportedly targets gunpowder factory in Russia's Tambov Oblast	A Ukrainian drone strike targeted a Russian gunpowder factory in the village of Kuzmino-Gat in Tambov Oblast overnight on Jan. 16, local Telegram channels and a Ukrainian official claimed. Eyewitnesses in the nearby city of Kotovsk heard the sound of a drone engine as it was passing over their houses, presumably heading to the factory, the Shot Telegram channel reported. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its forces downed 27 Ukrainian drones over various regions overnight, including three in Tambov Oblast. The same night, a Russian oil depot in Voronezh Oblast reportedly caught fire as a result of the drone attack. Russian authorities said there were no casualties as a result of the attack in Tambov Oblast and that the roof of a house was damaged by drone debris. It is not immediately clear whether the plant suffered any damage due to the attack. The Kuzmino-Gat gunpowder factory is &quot;one of the key facilities of the Russian military-industrial complex involved in the war against Ukraine,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &quot;The gunpowder produced here is used for various types of small arms, artillery, and rocket launchers.&quot; The plant also produces colloxylin, which is used to manufacture explosives and other products, Kovalenko added. Kuzmino-Gat lies roughly 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of the Russia-Ukraine border. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. The news comes amid Ukraine&apos;s escalating drone campaign targeting Russian military and industrial facilities in the rear. Kyiv launched one of its most massive long-range attacks on Jan. 14, successfully striking refineries, chemical plants, and ammunition depots, including a distillery in Novaya Lyada in Tambov Oblast. The Kuzmino-Gat gunpowder factory was previously struck by Ukrainian drones in July 2024, a military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent at the time.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drone-strike-reportedly-targets-gunpowder-factory-in-russias-tambov-oblast/	2025-01-15T22:58:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1604726426.jpg

UK PM Starmer makes surprise visit to Kyiv, will sign '100 Year Partnership' with Ukraine	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in Kyiv on Jan. 16 amid an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian capital, where Starmer is set to sign a wide-ranging &quot;100 Year Partnership&quot; treaty, covering a number of areas including defense, energy, and trade. Starmer&apos;s visit marks just his second trip to the Ukrainian capital, and the first since he was elected prime minister in July 2024. &quot;This is not just about the here and now, it is also about an investment in our two countries for the next century, bringing together technology development, scientific advances and cultural exchanges, and harnessing the phenomenal innovation shown by Ukraine in recent years for generations to come,&quot; Starmer said in a news release on the treaty. Starmer&apos;s visit to Ukraine comes as the U.K. continues to discuss the potential deployment of an international peacekeeping force to the embattled country ahead of potential peace negotiations. Bloomberg reported on Jan. 10 that Starmer was expected to visit Kyiv in the coming weeks to further discuss with Zelensky the peacekeepers&apos; potential deployment. Donald Trump has also advocated for Europe to take the lead in monitoring a potential ceasefire. The Wall Street Journal reported on Dec. 12 that Trump emphasized Europe&#x2019;s greater responsibility in addressing Russian aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-pm-starmer-make-surprise-visit-to-kyiv-will-sign-100-year-partnership-with-ukraine/	2025-01-15T21:54:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160310001.jpg
Members of Trump's team admit Ukraine-Russia peace settlement could take months, Reuters reports	Several advisors to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump have accepted a timeline of several months to strike a deal to settle the Russia-Ukraine war, Reuters reported on Jan. 15, citing two Trump associates who directly spoke to president-elect about the war. Trump has previously promised to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine in 24 hours. As Trump&apos;s inauguration approaches, Keith Kellogg Trump&apos;s choice for special Ukraine peace envoy has said the Trump administration aims to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine within 100 days after inauguration. Trump&apos;s campaign promise to end the war in a day was a lack of appreciation for intractability of the conflict due to its complexity, and did not consider how long it would take to staff a new administration, the two Trump associates said. Trump has voiced readiness to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to begin the process of establishing a potential peace agreement. Kellogg is also slated to meet with Ukrainian officials following Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20, and will also visit other European capitals to discuss the war. Trump has called for more European leadership to end the war, including the potential of European peacekeepers. Marco Rubio, Trump&apos;s pick for secretary of state, said on Jan. 15 that both sides need to be &quot;realistic,&quot; in a potential ceasefire agreement. Rubio suggested a concession from Russia would be to not advance any further, while Ukraine&apos;s concession would be to give its territories currently under Russian occupation. Previously, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the U.S. can not approach peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia as a neutral mediator, and recognize Russia as an aggressor.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-team-admits-ukraine-peace-settlement-could-take-months-reuters-reports/	2025-01-15T20:59:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-643210102.jpg
NATO, EU membership, military strength are strategic security guarantees for Ukraine, Zelensky says	NATO and EU membership, as well as the country&apos;s own military strength are key security guarantees for Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at a press conference alongside Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Jan. 15. With U.S. President-elect Donald Trump set to take office in days, Zelensky and European allies are preparing for a potential shift in U.S. foreign policy, including a proposed ceasefire and peace negotiations. &quot;We want to end the war with a just peace, but for that, we need to be sure that Russia will not return to wage war against Ukraine. We need strong security guarantees,&quot; Zelensky said. Continued weapons shipments, NATO accession, and EU membership are key security guarantees, Zelensky said, noting that the country cannot engage in &quot;games&quot; reducing the size of its military. Ahead of potential peace negotiation, a large military was &quot;the only security guarantee,&quot; Zelensky added. Zelensky&apos;s comment on the size of Ukraine&apos;s military come as Russian President Vladimir Putin is set demand that Ukraine cut its ties with NATO and become &quot;a neutral state with a limited military&quot; during upcoming talks with Donald Trump, Bloomberg reported. Zelensky touted the size of Ukraine&apos;s military during the press conference, stating that the country&apos;s military now comprises 880,000 soldiers, tasked with defending the entire country against 600,000 Russian troops concentrated in specific areas. Ukrainian officials are expected to meet with members of Trump&apos;s administration shortly after his inauguration on Jan. 20 to discuss the details of peace negotiations. Despite unease over Trump&apos;s stance on Ukraine, there have been reports that European allies have grown optimistic Trump will not abandon Ukraine. Trump met with Zelensky during his election campaign and a second time following his U.S. presidential election victory on Dec. 7 on the sidelines of the Notre Dame Cathedrals re-opening in a trilateral meeting with Macron. Trump has voiced he is ready to meet with Putin once he takes office to spearhead peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, a move Ukraine and European allies are approaching cautiously.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-and-eu-membership-are-strategic-security-guarantees-for-ukraine/	2025-01-15T19:28:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193453413.jpg
US sanctions Russian entity operating occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant	The U.S. Department of the Treasury on Jan. 15 sanctioned Russia&apos;s Federal State Unitary Enterprise Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, a Moscow-created entity that took control of Ukraine&apos;s Zaporizhzhia power plant in the partially occupied oblast. The updated sanctions list also targets Vladislav Isaev, the company&#x2019;s CEO since April 2024. In October 2022, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin signed a decree establishing the Russian entity to oversee the captured power plant. This followed an order from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who declared the facilities of the Ukrainian nuclear power plant as Russian federal property. Russian forces have occupied the Zaporizhzhia plant, the largest nuclear station in Europe, since March 2022, and have been using the site in ways that increase the risk of a nuclear disaster. Throughout its occupation, the plant has been repeatedly disconnected from the Ukrainian power grid due to Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure. The region, particularly the city of Zaporizhzhia and the areas around the nuclear power plant, has endured regular missile strikes, artillery shelling, and drone attacks. On Jan. 8, Russian forces targeted an industrial facility in Zaporizhzhia, killing 13 people and injuring 122, including a child, according to State Emergency Service.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-sanctions-russian-entity-operating-occupied-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant/	2025-01-15T17:39:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1249892066.jpg
Ukraine captures 23 Russian soldiers in Donetsk Oblast	Ukraine&#x2019;s Azov Brigade captured 23 Russian soldiers during combat operations in the Toretsk area of Donetsk Oblast, the National Guard of Ukraine reported on Jan. 15. According to the statement, some Russian troops surrendered willingly, while others were found hiding in basements or captured during assaults. The captives, taken into custody by the 12th Special Forces Brigade Azov, are reportedly in satisfactory condition. &#x1F4CD;&#x422;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x435;&#x446;&#x44C;&#x43A;&#x438;&#x439; &#x43D;&#x430;&#x43F;&#x440;&#x44F;&#x43C;&#x43E;&#x43A; &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1E6;&#x412;&#x43E;&#x457;&#x43D;&#x438; 12 &#x431;&#x440;&#x438;&#x433;&#x430;&#x434;&#x438; &#x41D;&#x430;&#x446;&#x433;&#x432;&#x430;&#x440;&#x434;&#x456;&#x457; &#xAB;&#x410;&#x437;&#x43E;&#x432;&#xBB; &#x432;&#x437;&#x44F;&#x43B;&#x438; &#x443; &#x43F;&#x43E;&#x43B;&#x43E;&#x43D; &#x43E;&#x434;&#x440;&#x430;&#x437;&#x443; 23 (!) &#x437;&#x430;&#x433;&#x430;&#x440;&#x431;&#x43D;&#x438;&#x43A;&#x430;-&#x43D;&#x435;&#x432;&#x434;&#x430;&#x445;&#x438; &#x456; &#x437;&#x43C;&#x43E;&#x43D;&#x442;&#x443;&#x432;&#x430;&#x43B;&#x438; &#x43D;&#x435;&#x432;&#x435;&#x43B;&#x438;&#x447;&#x43A;&#x435; &#xAB;&#x43C;&#x43E;&#x442;&#x438;&#x432;&#x430;&#x446;&#x456;&#x439;&#x43D;&#x435;&#xBB; &#x432;&#x456;&#x434;&#x435;&#x43E; &#x434;&#x43B;&#x44F; &#x43A;&#x440;&#x430;&#x457;&#x43D;&#x438;-&#x430;&#x433;&#x440;&#x435;&#x441;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x430;. &#x426;&#x456;&#x43A;&#x430;&#x432;&#x43E;, &#x449;&#x43E; &#x431;&#x430;&#x433;&#x430;&#x442;&#x43E; &#x440;&#x43E;&#x441;&#x456;&#x439;&#x441;&#x44C;&#x43A;&#x438;&#x445; &#x43F;&#x43E;&#x43B;&#x43E;&#x43D;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x438;&#x445; &#x432;&#x438;&#x433;&#x43B;&#x44F;&#x434;&#x430;&#x44E;&#x442;&#x44C; &#x434;&#x43E; &#x43F;&#x43E;&#x43B;&#x43E;&#x43D;&#x443; &#x442;&#x430;&#x43A;, &#x44F;&#x43A; &#x43D;&#x430;&#x448;&#x456; &#x433;&#x435;&#x440;&#x43E;&#x457; &#x2014; &#x43F;&#x456;&#x441;&#x43B;&#x44F; &#x1F914;&#x1F4F9;: @azov_media pic.twitter.com/sE00z6HM2Z The National Guard confirmed that the prisoners would be transferred to the relevant authorities. &quot;We hope they will soon be exchanged for Ukrainian defenders held in captivity,&quot; it said. On Jan. 15, Ukraine successfully secured the release of 25 individuals from Russian captivity, including Azovstal defenders. The returning Ukrainian POWs were captured during the defense of Mariupol and its Azovstal steel plant, as well as during the defense of other key areas of the front line in Kharkiv, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-captures-23-russian-soldiers-in-donetsk-oblast/	2025-01-15T15:30:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1251978609.jpg
Oil depot on fire in Russia's Voronezh region	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. An oil depot in Russia&apos;s Voronezh region caught fire following multiple drone strikes, regional governor Alexander Gusev said on Jan. 15. No casualties were reported, according to Gusev. The Kyiv Independent is unable to immediately verify the reports. Voronezh is located approximately 465 kilometers (289 miles) south of Moscow. The attack comes amid an uptick in Ukraine&#x2019;s drone operations targeting Russian energy infrastructure. Overnight on Jan. 14, Ukraine carried out its &quot;most massive&quot; strike on Russian military and industrial facilities within a range of up to 1,100 kilometers (620 miles), according to the General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces. Targets included chemical plants, refineries, and ammunition depots at the Engels airbase, a source in Ukraine&#x2019;s Security Service (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. In response, Russia has continued missile strikes on Ukraine&#x2019;s already battered energy network. On Jan. 15, explosions were reported in several Ukrainian oblasts. In Lviv Oblast, &#xA0;Andriy Sadovyi, city mayor, said Russian forces had &quot;attacked the energy infrastructure of our region and Ukraine.&quot; Later in the morning, Lviv Oblast officials said critical infrastructure facilities had been hit in two districts of the oblast but added there were no casualties.	https://kyivindependent.com/oil-depot-on-fire-in-russias-voronezh-region/	2025-01-15T13:35:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1342639538.jpg
Putin to demand Ukraine never join NATO during talks with Trump, Bloomberg reports	Russia will demand that Ukraine cut its ties with NATO and become &quot;a neutral state with a limited military&quot; during talks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 15, citing its sources. Trump has previously signaled that he is ready to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; following his inauguration, adding that the Kremlin is also seeking it. Trump has repeatedly reiterated that he plans to end the war in Ukraine swiftly, in part because he allegedly has good ties with Putin. The Kremlin reportedly accepts that individual NATO member states can continue to send weapons to Ukraine as part of bilateral security agreements, but the weapons &quot;should not be used against Russia or to recapture territory,&quot; one of the sources told Bloomberg. Moscow&apos;s position is that it will de facto retain control over almost 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory, including the Crimean peninsula, annexed in 2014. In the meantime, Russia is allegedly open to exchange some territories, the media outlet reported, citing its sources. Kyiv and Moscow are currently holding talks only on the exchange of prisoners and the return of deported children, Ukrainian officials told the media outlet on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, Ukraine and Russia are also having &quot;limited talks&quot; in Qatar on the rules for protecting nuclear facilities from attacks, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the Kremlin&apos;s preparations. Trump has often voiced sympathies for the Russian leader while criticizing the level of support the outgoing Biden administration threw behind Kyiv. This prompted concerns that the new U.S. leadership might cut a deal unfavorable to Ukraine. Trump&apos;s incoming peace envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said that the president-elect&apos;s aim is not to &quot;give something to Putin or the Russians&quot; but to &quot;save Ukraine and save their sovereignty.&quot; Trump said that specific peace proposals are still being worked out. A pitch leaked from his team &#x2014; freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2014; has already been rejected by Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-to-demand-ukraine-never-join-nato-during-talks-with-trump-bloomberg-reports/	2025-01-15T12:17:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2160580179.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine's military now totals 880,000 soldiers, facing 600,000 Russian troops, Kyiv claims	Key developments on Jan. 15: President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 15 that Ukraine&apos;s military now comprises 880,000 soldiers, tasked with defending the entire country against 600,000 Russian troops concentrated in specific areas. Speaking at a joint press conference with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in Warsaw, Zelensky said that Russia&apos;s localized troop concentration creates a numerical advantage. &quot;Russian troops are concentrated in several areas, so in some areas, they have a quantitative advantage,&quot; he said. Ukraine has been struggling with a manpower shortage, especially in the infantry, while Russia has intensified its offensive in Donetsk Oblast since the summer of 2024. Earlier on Jan. 14, a scandal erupted in Ukraine as Air Force members claimed they were being transferred to bolster the infantry. According to Ukrainska Pravda, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order on Jan. 11 to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units. A senior Air Force officer, speaking anonymously, said transfers began in spring 2024 and have now reached a &quot;critical level,&quot; with unit staffing dropping to 50%. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces denied claims of transferring technical and aviation personnel, saying that these resources are being increased. Critics have called for deeper mobilization reforms, as Ukraine&apos;s army faces challenges related to demographics and an uneven mobilization process. In 2024, Ukraine lowered its minimum mobilization age from 27 to 25 but resisted calls from international partners to reduce it further to 18. Zelensky also reported progress in arms production, saying that Ukraine now covers 33-34% of its annual weapons needs &#x2014; up from less than 10% before the full-scale invasion. Europe and the U.S. supply more than 60% of Ukraine&apos;s weaponry, with each accounting for about 30%. Russia launched a large-scale missile attack against Ukraine on the morning of Jan. 15, using Kh-101, Kh-22, and Kalibr cruise missiles, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported. The Russian Defense Ministry had previously threatened to retaliate after Ukraine targeted military and industrial sites throughout Russia in a mass attack on Jan. 14. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force issued a nationwide aerial alert in the early hours of Jan. 15, following warnings that a group of Tu-95MS strategic bombers had taken flight from Russia&apos;s Olenya airfield in Murmansk Oblast. Russia also reportedly launched ballistic missiles from Belgorod Oblast. Explosions were reported in Kharkiv, Khmelnytsky Oblast, and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. In Lviv Oblast, Lviv Mayor Andrii Sadovyi said Russian forces had &quot;attacked the energy infrastructure of our region and Ukraine.&quot; Later in the morning of Jan. 15, officials in Lviv Oblast said critical infrastructure facilities had been hit in two districts of the oblast but added there were no casualties. There was no information on what was hit or the extent of the damage caused. Svitlana Onyshchuk, head of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast Military Administration, said the attacks had targeted &quot;critical infrastructure facilities&quot; in the oblast but had not caused any casualties. No further details were provided. Ukraine&apos;s state grid operator, Ukrenergo, imposed emergency blackouts as a preventative measure, Energy Minister Herman Haluschenko announced. &quot;It&apos;s the middle of winter, and the target for the Russians remains the same: our energy sector,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on his Telegram channel later in the morning on Jan. 15. &quot;More than 40 missiles were involved in this strike, including ballistic missiles. At least 30 were destroyed. There were also more than 70 Russian attack drones overnight,&quot; he added. &quot;We constantly need to strengthen the existing capabilities of the Ukrainian air shield. Our partners at the NATO summit in Washington and in the Ramstein format made promises that have not yet been fully realized.&quot; Shortly after eight in the morning, the all-clear was given across much of the country. Poland scrambled fighter jets due to the Russian missile threat in western Ukraine, according to the Polish Operational Command. Both Ukraine and Russia will have to make concessions to end the war, Marco Rubio, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s pick for secretary of state, said on Jan. 15 at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Rubio called on everyone to be realistic, suggesting that Russia&apos;s concession would be to not advance any further, while Ukraine&apos;s concession would be to give its territories currently under Russian occupation. &quot;It is important for everyone to be realistic: There will have to be concessions &#x2014; made by the Russian Federation, but also by the Ukrainians&#x2026; It is also important that there be some balance on both sides,&quot; Rubio said. Since invading Ukraine in 2014 and escalating its war of aggression in 2022, Russia has occupied about 20% of Ukrainian territory, imposing repressive measures on the local population and prohibiting any expressions of Ukrainian identity. Ukraine has repeatedly said it would not recognize its territory currently under Moscow&apos;s control as Russian. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, repeatedly pledged during his election campaign to negotiate a swift end to the war after taking office. However, he has never elaborated on how exactly he plans to achieve that. &quot;There is no way Russia takes all of Ukraine. The Ukrainians are too brave and fight too hard, and the country is too big. That&apos;s not gonna happen,&quot; Rubio said. &quot;It is also unrealistic to believe that somehow a nation the size of Ukraine&#x2026; gonna push these people (Russian troops) all the way back to where they were on the eve of the invasion,&quot; he added. According to Rubio, the U.S. must not allow Russian President Vladimir Putin to return to his plans to take over Ukraine in four or five years. Rubio publicly praised the bravery of Ukrainian defenders but was among the 15 Republican lawmakers in the Senate who voted against the $61 billion aid package for Ukraine, which was eventually passed in April 2024. Rubio did not support President Joe Biden&apos;s administration&apos;s policy regarding assistance to Ukraine, as, according to him, the White House &quot;has never been clear about how this conflict will end.&quot; The 53-year-old Florida Senator will replace Antony Blinken in the position, and as the top U.S. diplomat, he would be at the forefront of potential peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. Ukraine managed to bring back 25 Ukrainians from Russian captivity, including Azovstal defenders, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Jan. 15. &quot;Returning our people home is something that Ukraine is constantly working on. And we will not stop until we bring all of our people back,&quot; Zelensky said in a post on Telegram. The returning Ukrainian POWs were captured during the defense of Mariupol and its Azovstal steel plant, as well as during the defense of other key areas of the front line in Kharkiv, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, Zelensky added. He said some of those brought back have serious injuries and illnesses. The exchange was conducted on a 25 for 25 basis. In a recent agreement, Russia and Ukraine agreed to prioritize wounded POWs at the selection of exchanges, followed by those held longest in captivity. President Zelensky also expressed his gratitude to the United Arab Emirates for mediating between the parties. Over the past year, Ukraine conducted 11 prisoner exchanges and secured the return of 356 more people than in 2023. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Nearly 4,000 people have been released, including 1,358 in 2024. Vilnius would consider deploying troops to Ukraine with its allies in the future if Kyiv were to make such a request, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys told LRT TV on Jan. 14. The proposal for an international peacekeeping force has gained traction recently, as European nations prepare to take a more prominent role in Ukraine&apos;s defense when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Budrys said that Lithuania did not rule out such possibilities which were touted at a summit in Paris last year when French President Emmanuel Macron invited Lithuania&apos;s president and others to explore expanded military involvement in Ukraine. &quot;Lithuania is a security provider in the region, not just a recipient,&quot; Budrys said. &quot;If the question arises, I have no doubt that the Lithuanian flag will be there.&quot; &quot;We&apos;d talk with our allies and partners about what it looks like, and we&apos;d talk with Ukraine about what it looks like,&quot; he added. Macron has championed the idea of deploying European troops in Ukraine since early 2024. President Volodymyr Zelensky and Macron discussed the possibility during a meeting on Dec. 18, and Macron raised the proposal again during a trilateral meeting with Trump on Dec. 7. Trump reportedly expressed interest in European-led ceasefire monitoring. On Jan. 13, Zelensky and Macron held a phone call to discuss Ukraine&apos;s air defense priorities and the possible deployment of peacekeepers. Both leaders agreed to meet soon to advance plans for securing guarantees for Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is also expected to visit Ukraine in the coming weeks to discuss the peacekeeping initiative, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 10. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk advocated for increased defense spending across NATO on Jan. 15, arguing that if all European members matched Poland&apos;s spending, NATO&apos;s defense budget would be ten times that of Russia&apos;s. &quot;No one but Europe will solve its defense problems,&quot; he said during a joint press conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Warsaw. Tusk&apos;s comment comes amid growing calls for higher defense spending across NATO, a topic reignited by Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and advocated for by incoming U.S. President Donald Trump. &quot;Other countries should not pay 1.5 percent of their GDP for defense &#x2014; this is not enough,&quot; he said, emphasizing that robust European defense contributions could help maintain friendly U.S.-European relations. On Jan. 7, Trump called for NATO&apos;s spending target to rise to 5% of GDP, significantly higher than the current 2% goal. &quot;If all European countries start taking their obligations in NATO seriously, I am sure America will be happy to cooperate with us,&quot; Tusk added. While the 5% suggestion has faced resistance, some NATO members are reportedly open to a more modest increase, potentially to 3% of GDP, Reuters reported on Jan. 10. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte quipped on Jan. 13 that allies should increase spending or prepare to &quot;take Russian language courses or move to New Zealand.&quot; Currently, 24 out of 32 NATO countries meet the 2% GDP target, but several, including Italy, Canada, and Spain, fall short. Zelensky praised his discussions with Tusk, highlighting their focus on bolstering Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities and advancing sanctions against Russia. &quot;We discussed our defense, including the supply of weapons, weapons production, and related investments. We also focused on strengthening sanctions against Russia and bringing peace closer for Ukraine and all of Europe,&quot; Zelensky said on X.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraines-military-now-totals-880-000-soldiers-facing-600-000-russian-troops-kyiv-claims/	2025-01-15T12:12:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190608033.jpg

US targets China-Russia sanctions evasion scheme with new measures	The U.S. Treasury Department has targeted actors involved in a sanctions evasion scheme facilitating cross-border payments for sensitive goods between China and Russia as part of a new package of sanctions, according to a Jan. 15 announcement. The U.S. Treasury imposed new sanctions on a total of over 150 entities and individuals, including companies in Russia&#x2019;s defense industry and those supporting it, as well as dozens of entities across multiple countries that help Russia evade U.S. sanctions. The Treasury also expanded measures against almost 100 entities already under sanctions for their cooperation with Russia&#x2019;s military-industrial complex. &quot;Today&apos;s actions frustrate the Kremlin&apos;s ability to circumvent our sanctions and get access to the goods they need to build weapons for their war of choice in Ukraine,&quot; said Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Wally Adeyemo. Moscow and Beijing set up regional clearing platforms (RCPs) in both Russia and China to act as counterparties for cross-border payments for sensitive goods. This allows for non-cash mutual payments for sanctioned goods, according to the Treasury. The Russian-Chinese scheme involves Russian financial institutions on the U.S. sanctions list, such as Public Joint Stock Company Sberbank of Russia, Joint Stock Company Alfa-Bank, Open Joint Stock Company Sovcombank, T-Bank, and Limited Liability Company Bank Tochka. The sanctions also target OJSC Keremet Bank, based in Kyrgyzstan, which has been coordinating with Russian officials and Promsvyazbank, a Russian bank under U.S. sanctions, to evade sanctions since the summer of 2024. In 2024, the Kyrgyz Finance Ministry sold a controlling stake in Keremet Bank to a firm closely linked to Russian-Moldovan oligarch Ilan Shor, who has ties to the Russian government. The purchase of Keremet Bank was intended to create a hub for circumventing sanctions through which Russia could pay for imports and receive payments for exports, according to the statement. The new sanctions also target 20 Russian energy companies and over 30 organizations and institutions from the defense and related sectors. Earlier on Jan. 10, the U.S. and U.K. imposed broad sanctions against the Russian oil industry, taking aim at Moscow&apos;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; The restrictions targeted nearly 200 vessels, along with Russian oil companies and industry officials. President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the sanctions as a &quot;significant blow to the financial foundation of Russia&apos;s war machine.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-targets-china-russia-sanctions-evasion-scheme-with-new-measures/	2025-01-15T11:16:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1781860144.jpg
Will Europe put ‘boots on the ground’ for peace in Ukraine? We asked top Nordic, Baltic officials	Just days out from the return of Donald Trump to the White House, the future of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine is dominated by a great unknown: whether the incoming president will manage to push Moscow to stop its advance on the battlefield, or whether he will disengage and perhaps abandon U.S. support for Ukraine entirely. Either way, one thing is clear: the war cannot come to an end with a secure Ukraine without Europe playing a braver role. The chance of the guns and drones going silent across Ukraine in 24 hours after Trump takes office &#x2014; as Trump had frequently promised on the campaign trail &#x2014; is slim to none. Nonetheless, amid consistent rhetoric from Washington that Europe must up defense spending and take more responsibility for their continent&#x2019;s security, European countries are faced with an urgent task: taking the braver steps to secure Ukraine against a bullish Moscow seemingly more convinced in its forthcoming victory than at any time since February 2022. In a new reality far removed from the war of 2022, the catch phrase going into 2025 is now &#x201C;boots on the ground.&#x201D; The first serious floating of the idea of European troops entering Ukrainian territory came from French President Emmanuel Macron in the spring of 2024. &#x201C;In fact, many countries said that in the weeks that followed that they understood our approach, that they agreed with our position and that this position was a good thing.&#x201D; French soldiers with the 1st Infantry Regiment fire mortars near Rena, Norway, during Exercise Brilliant Jump 2022, on March 17, 2022. The exercise, aimed at training the very high-readiness component of the NATO Response Force, involved around 2,500 troops from France, Italy, Norway, Poland, and Spain, with 10 warships and 750 sailors supporting the operation at sea.

(Photo by Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP via Getty Images)Media coverage of hypothetical European &#x201C;boots on the ground&#x201D; is often presented in the context of a peacekeeping force entering Ukrainian territory after a hypothetical peace deal. While clear that larger players like France, Poland, or the U.K. would need to be involved, and that it is hard to imagine a new level of European action without the backing of the incoming U.S. administration, the role of smaller countries in the Nordic and Baltic states also looks to be critical. Consistently among the top providers of military aid to Kyiv as a percentage of GDP, countries like Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have also been the most outspoken in their support for Ukrainian victory, beyond the tired repetitions of &#x201C;as long as it takes.&#x201D; Recent alleged Russian sabotage attacks in the Baltic Sea, including the damaging of undersea cables running between Nordic and Baltic states, have served as a reminder that Russia&#x2019;s war is not limited to Ukrainian territory. The Kyiv Independent spoke to top officials, experts, and other stakeholders in some of Ukraine&#x2019;s top European partners to take the pulse of countries that could be part of a new &#x201C;coalition of the willing&#x201D; in their support of Ukraine in 2025. Before facing up to Trump, let alone Putin, the first major hurdle European countries must overcome is their own mindset, according to Jukka Kopra, chair of the Finnish parliament&#x2019;s defense committee. &#x201C;Finland has always taken defense seriously. So we have a conscription system. We have a large reserve-based army,&#x201D; Kopra said to the Kyiv Independent in Helsinki. &#x201C;Nobody&apos;s ever ready for war, but we have things in order. We take it seriously, unlike some other countries who only have things working on paper.&#x201D; Although relatively small in terms of hard geopolitical sway, since the launch of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, the countries immediately bordering Russia have often found themselves in the role of activist, pushing Ukraine&#x2019;s crystal-clear message that peace must come through strength in the NATO arena. &#x201C;One might think that when the escalated aggression started in February 2022, everybody&apos;s eyes would open,&#x201D; said Kopra. &#x201C;They are opening slowly, but not everywhere.&#x201D; Of all NATO member states, none show more clarity than the Baltic States, where the memory of Soviet occupation and the totalitarian repression that came with it remains fresh. Only recently stepping down after his country&#x2019;s last elections, former Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrelius Landsbergis has been one the most eloquent pro-Ukrainian voices among foreign officials. Lithuania&apos;s former Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis at Munich Security Conference 2024 in Munich, Germany on Feb. 18, 2024. (Olena Zashko / The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;Appeasement is a recurring virus; the seasons vary in how often it does reoccur in Europe, but it always comes back,&#x201D; said Landsbergis to the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;The logic is always the same. I am the person who can appease, who can offer part of some other country to a dictator and all of us will be fine. It&apos;s so iconic when you see Chamberlain resurrected in 2024 in Europe and picking up the phone and saying, &#x2018;I have this.&#x2019;&#x201D; Landsbergis wasn&#x2019;t the only Baltic minister to mention the infamous British prime minister, who had signed the Munich Agreement with Nazi Germany less than a year before Adolf Hitler invaded Poland. &#x201C;If it is a Chamberlain peace, it will be the start of more and more aggression,&#x201D; said Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsakhna to the Kyiv Independent in Tallinn. &#x201C;Now, we have every opportunity to avoid everything that came after 1938: World War II. This is not only about Europe, it is about the world order.&#x201D; As clear as the rhetoric of the Nordics and Baltics has been, taking braver steps still requires the leadership of countries with more weight to throw around. &#x201C;These conversations have matured,&#x201D; said French security expert Leonie Allard to the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;But you need much more political weight from other Europeans, which we haven&apos;t seen so much.&#x201D; Germany, traditionally cautious but still the second-largest provider of military aid to Ukraine, looks to be completely absorbed by upcoming federal elections in February, while France&#x2019;s government collapsed in December. These countries that have traditionally been the leaders of Europe, they are kind of incapable at the moment,&#x201D; said Kopra, &#x201C;and what a coincidence it is, what a good position for the Kremlin.&#x201D; Still, the clear choice to take the lead is Paris, said Allard, who co-authored a recent paper published by the Atlantic Council entitled &#x201C;Europe needs a coalition of the resolute.&#x201D; Macron brings with him to the table personal experience dealing with both Putin and Trump, which could be crucial in coordinating a braver European bloc. &#x201C;France cannot do anything on its own, nothing at all,&#x201D; said Allard, &#x201C;it&apos;s also up to other Europeans to, you know, take this opportunity to put forward their own ideas on what they want to do.&#x201D; The other obvious candidate to strengthen such a coalition would be Poland, the nation with the most to lose in national security from an abandonment of neighboring Ukraine.

(Chesnot / Getty Images)Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has denied reports claiming he discussed deploying troops to Ukraine with Macron, as Warsaw sticks closely to a doctrine of beefing up its military to defend NATO borders. Still, the possibility of Poland changing its tune shouldn&#x2019;t be ruled out, said Allard. &#x201C;What other war is NATO preparing for apart from one with Russia?&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;There&apos;s only one thing, and if that thing means being in Ukraine, then it should be being in Ukraine. There is no other scenario.&#x201D; &#x201C;Whatever the solution is to the present situation in the war between Ukraine and Russia,&#x201D; said Kopra, &#x201C;in any case, we are back in the Cold War, and all of Europe should start accelerating accordingly.&#x201D; Since the launch of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Kyiv has stressed that Ukraine doesn&#x2019;t need foreign militaries to join the fight: the West only needs to provide the weaponry and ammunition, and Ukraine will do the job. When it comes to direct combat with Russian forces, this position hasn&#x2019;t changed, but with a dangerous and unpredictable outlook for the war in 2025, other versions of &#x201C;boots on the ground&#x201D; are being explored to improve Ukraine&#x2019;s position. A starting point often discussed is training. If conducted far from the front line, moving the existing overseas training programs into Ukrainian territory would not only make them more efficient, but send a strong signal to Moscow that the West will not just retreat to NATO&#x2019;s eastern flank. Speaking to the Kyiv Independent in Stockholm, Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson pointed out that representatives of his country&#x2019;s defense procurement agency were already on the ground in Ukraine, and that Sweden wouldn&#x2019;t rule out training Ukrainian troops on Ukrainian territory.

(Olena Zashko / The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;We think it&apos;s good if we can find unity on this, there are ongoing discussions in several different places in Europe,&#x201D; he said. According to Landsbergis, a move for European countries to begin training Ukrainian soldiers inside Ukraine could be the first step in a series of careful moves that will slowly but surely up the deterrence factor for Moscow. &#x201C;If they&apos;re trained in Ukraine, imagine that where troops are trained, the areas are defended with additional air defense support. You bring Lithuanian and French troops, the French bring in the air defense, and we start covering parts of Ukrainian territory.&#x201D; Nonetheless, for now, the majority of attention has been on the use of European troops as a physical security guarantee, as expressed by Zelensky after his calls with Macron. After a tough two years of attritional warfare which saw a failed Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 and a steadily worsening manpower crisis, the fading perspective of a complete Ukrainian victory has turned attention to the need for peace to come with hard guarantees against a repeat Russian invasion.

(Kevin Dietsch / Getty Images)Trump and his team, many of whom publicly subscribe to the myth that &#x201C;NATO expansion&#x201D; was one of the main causes of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, have spoken strongly against inviting Kyiv to the alliance, an offer that sat at the top of Zelensky&#x2019;s victory plan as presented to partners in October. &#x201C;What are these security guarantees in real life? Are they peacekeeping missions, military missions? Our point is very clear: NATO membership for Ukraine is the most secure, most clear, most efficient, and cheapest way to give real security guarantees. Any other structure is much more complicated.&#x201D; &#x201C;There are four countries that gave security guarantees for Ukraine (in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum). One of them attacked Ukraine &#x2015; Russia &#x2015; and the three others are not fulfilling that agreement.&#x201D; &#x201C;Currently, NATO is not ready to enter the war,&#x201D; said Braze, &#x201C;because the clear concept is that Ukraine&apos;s self-defense is supported, everybody provides what is necessary, but nobody wants to be part of the war, fighting the war.&#x201D; Though not as physically threatened by Russia as the Nordics or Baltics, France&#x2019;s leading role in a future troop deployment makes a lot of sense due to the organization of its military and recent experience, said Allard. &#x201C;France is the country that has an army structure that&apos;s based a lot on expeditionary forces, used to send forces abroad,&#x201D; she said, pointing to a wealth of recent French experience operating in the Sahel region in Africa.

(Alain Jocard / AFP via Getty Images)Once the time comes for deployment, it is very unlikely that European troops could be stationed along the contact line itself, as sometimes broached in visions of a so-called &#x201C;demilitarized zone.&#x201D; What is more realistic, said Allard, is the deployment of European forces in bases further back, with the explicit purpose of acting as a so-called &#x201C;tripwire force,&#x201D; with the explicit purpose of making any further Russian aggression in Ukraine immediately come at the cost of direct conflict with NATO. &#x201C;The size and the ability of this tripwire force to weigh on Ukraine security would be dependent on the level of lethality that we find ourselves in, in a situation of a deal.&#x201D; Ultimately, in the absence of NATO membership for Ukraine, &#x201C;boots on the ground&#x201D; might just be the kind of ad-hoc measure that is enough to deter an aging, weakened Putin from launching a repeat invasion. &#x201C;It changes Putin&apos;s calculations,&#x201D; said Landsbergis of the tripwire effect, &#x201C;because as President Macron clearly said, Putin will have to keep in mind that if you enter Odesa, you will find French troops.&#x201D; As much as real discussions might be ongoing among a potential future European &#x201C;coalition of the willing,&#x201D; even the most basic public specifics are still lacking. The reason for indecisiveness and delay is one person, Trump, but even more so, said Allard, is the looming anticipation of the results of his first steps for ending the war. &#x201C;We&apos;re waiting for the U.S. to put forward the terms of the potential negotiations,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;since it&apos;s their view &#x2014; that of the Trump team &#x2014; and try to help Ukraine to also be able to shape that. But if this goes forward, Europeans are ready to take on more responsibility.&#x201D; With Russia publicly rejecting early attempts at drawing up a tentative peace deal, Trump&#x2019;s incoming envoy for peace in Ukraine, retired General Keith Kellogg, has named 100 days as his personal target to reach a deal.

(Sean Gallup / Getty Images)&#x201C;The coin is still in the air, right? We don&apos;t know which side it will land on,&#x201D; said Landsbergis of Trump&#x2019;s approach to Putin upon inauguration. &#x201C;I think it&apos;s rather black and white, right? It&apos;s impossible that it lands on a situation which would be comfortable for both, for Ukrainians and Russians. That means that if you give something to Putin, that will be his victory and Ukrainian loss.&#x201D; In the meantime though, argues Allard, the last thing Europe should do is sit idle. If wants to weigh on Putin&apos;s decision to enter negotiations, Europe should try to move forward with a developed public position on troops in Ukraine now, she said. &#x201C;It&apos;s now that we, Europeans, should prepare and form this notion and not after a negotiation.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/will-europe-put-boots-on-the-ground-for-peace-in-ukraine-we-asked-top-nordic-baltic-officials/	2025-01-15T10:14:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2154604513.jpg
Ukrainian soldiers on capturing North Korean POW	After numerous attempts, Ukrainian forces operating in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast have finally captured two North Korean soldiers. President Volodymyr Zelensky called this &#x201C;irrefutable evidence&#x201D; of Pyongyang&#x2019;s involvement in the Kremlin&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine. One of the two soldiers was taken prisoner by Ukraine&#x2019;s Special Operations Forces. Watch this video to find out why capturing North Korean soldiers is so challenging &#x2014; and how Ukrainian forces ultimately succeeded.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-soldiers-on-capturing-north-korean-pow/	2025-01-15T09:48:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/3_1.jpg
Ukraine’s military now totals 880,000 soldiers, facing 600,000 Russian troops, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 15 that Ukraine&apos;s military now comprises 880,000 soldiers, tasked with defending the entire country against 600,000 Russian troops concentrated in specific areas. Speaking at a joint press conference with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in Warsaw, Zelensky said that Russia&apos;s localized troop concentration creates a numerical advantage. &quot;Russian troops are concentrated in several areas, so in some areas, they have a quantitative advantage,&quot; he said. Ukraine has been struggling with a manpower shortage, especially in the infantry, while Russia has intensified its offensive in Donetsk Oblast since the summer of 2024. Earlier on Jan. 14, a scandal erupted in Ukraine as Air Force members claimed they were being transferred to bolster the infantry. According to Ukrainska Pravda, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order on Jan. 11 to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units. A senior Air Force officer, speaking anonymously, said transfers began in spring 2024 and have now reached a &quot;critical level,&quot; with unit staffing dropping to 50%. The General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces denied claims of transferring technical and aviation personnel, saying that these resources are being increased. Critics have called for deeper mobilization reforms, as Ukraine&#x2019;s army faces challenges related to demographics and an uneven mobilization process. In 2024, Ukraine lowered its minimum mobilization age from 27 to 25 but resisted calls from international partners to reduce it further to 18. Zelensky also reported progress in arms production, saying that Ukraine now covers 33-34% of its annual weapons needs &#x2014; up from less than 10% before the full-scale invasion. Europe and the U.S. supply more than 60% of Ukraine&#x2019;s weaponry, with each accounting for about 30%.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-military-now-totals-880-000-soldiers-facing-600-000-russian-troops-zelensky-says/	2025-01-15T09:11:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187689001.jpg
Why Ukraine’s long-delayed missile production ambitions have yet to get off the ground	The Ukrainian government in recent months has been aggressively touting fresh developments in its missile-making. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the country had built 100 of its own missiles in 2024 as of November. He called for 3,000 &#x201C;cruise missiles or missile-drones&#x201D; to be manufactured in 2025. Traditional missiles are tricky. Ukraine&#x2019;s notable successes in scaling up drone production were to a large degree a workaround of the country&#x2019;s limits in defense industry autonomy. Russia and the West gutted Ukraine&#x2019;s weapons factories after the fall of the USSR, with the help of local corruption. Those that remain are subject to constant Russian bombardment. As a result, analysts call Zelensky&#x2019;s figures and the claimed features of traditional missiles made at home an oversell. &#x201C;If Ukraine can only deliver half of what Zelensky promised at the end of 2024 in terms of missile and drone production, I will be very content. But that&apos;s going to be challenging,&#x201D; says Fabian Hoffmann, a missile expert and research fellow at the Oslo Nuclear Project. Ukraine&#x2019;s budding missile program joins a long tradition of metaphorical and literal saber-rattling between hostile armies. For the time being, the missiles have yet to prove themselves on the battlefield. The challenge for outside observers is in sorting out ballistics from bluster. Here is what we know and can assess of the roster of Ukraine&#x2019;s home-grown missiles today. Originally designed to hit ships from coastal positions, the Neptune has been converted into a cruise missile that can be launched from land, per Ukrainian authorities. It is what Hoffmann calls &#x201C;by far the most mature of these large missile projects.&#x201D; Ukrainian officials said it was a Neptune that struck and sank the Russian cruiser Moskva back in April 2022. An unnamed official told the War Zone that they had reconfigured the Neptune to strike and disable an S-400 Russian air defense battery back in August 2023. Various Ukrainian Telegram channels cited anonymous sources saying that the Neptune was used to hit a Russian ammunition depot in Rostov Oblast on Jan. 11. But evidence of Neptunes flying is largely limited to government statements or citations of unnamed officials. That is despite Zelensky touting that the Neptune had been &#x201C;accepted into weaponry&#x201D; in a speech to Ukraine&#x2019;s Parliament all the way back in 2020. &#x201C;There were discussions that Ukraine would set up production for at least the anti-ship cruise missiles,&#x201D; says Hoffmann. &#x201C;Initially we heard that they were very artisanaly producing them &#x2014; just a couple per month at most, but there was not really a production line. But there was this assumption that Ukraine would be able to streamline that to some extent. And that obviously hasn&apos;t happened, at least if we derive it from the rate of usage which really hasn&apos;t seen any kind of uptick since 2023.&#x201D; Distinct from the cruise missile Neptune, the Hrim 2 &#x2014; or Thunder 2 in English &#x2014; is a ballistic rocket program, based on solid fuel and inertial guidance and in theory reaching speeds several times that of sound. Unlike a cruise missile, a ballistic missile goes far into the atmosphere, with many traveling at speeds many times that of sound. The program goes back as far as 2006 under the name Sapsan, which at some point became the internal name, as opposed to the envisioned international export model, the Hrim 2. Ukrainian officials said that the Hrim 2 finally passed testing toward the end of 2024, with Zelensky announcing &#x201C;positive results&#x201D; in August. The head of the permanent Ukrainian delegation to NATO, Yehor Cherniev, said of the Hrim 2s in October: &#x201C;Here, believe me, there will soon be concrete results that not only Ukraine, but the Russian Federation will see.&#x201D; &#x201C;I&#x2019;m seeing test launch claims from last year but, eh,&#x201D; says Michael Duitsman, a missile specialist at the Middlebury Institute in California, doubtfully, about the Hrim 2. Two projects, the Korshun and Vilcha &#x2014; respectively a cruise missile and multiple-launch rocket system &#x2014; were the subject of extensive press speculation in the mid- to late-2010s. The Korshun was a cruise missile, a scale model of which was getting dragged around weapons conferences a decade ago. Despite being a cruise missile, one pro-Russian Telegram channel in 2017 named it as the basis for the Hrim 2. The Korshun project has effectively been shelved since Zelensky&#x2019;s election. The Vilcha is an updated Soviet rocket complex that promised to use modernized, Ukrainian-made rockets with higher precision than its predecessor. Despite appearing in Ukrainian military parades as far back as 2018, there&#x2019;s been no evidence of a functional system playing a role since the full-scale invasion. Ukraine-made Trembita cruise missile. (mil.in.ua)In the same speech in which he promised &#x201C;concrete results&#x201D; for the Hrim 2, Cherniev noted certain components of the Vilcha that &#x201C;unfortunately, we won&#x2019;t be able to get quickly,&#x201D; without specifying what those components were. Various other projects like the volunteer-based &#x201C;Trembita&#x201D; are described as &#x201C;cruise missiles,&#x201D; including in reports from the Economist and the Telegraph, but have nowhere near the speed, range, or payload to merit that title as it is generally understood, maxing out at 400 kilometers/hour, 200 kilometers, and 20 kilograms in each field, respectively.. &#x201C;If you throw a rock fast enough you can call it a missile,&#x201D; says James Acuna, a former naval architect and CIA officer in Eastern Europe, currently consulting on drone production from Estonia, about the Trembita. The main distinction between making classic cruise or ballistic missiles and, for example, Ukraine&#x2019;s &#x201C;missile-drones,&#x201D; which the Trembita more closely resembles, is that the lighter and slower missile-drones can be made in smaller facilities with a far larger proportion of off-the-shelf commercial components. The production of those more advanced engines, guidance systems, and fuel for more traditional missiles requires bigger permanent facilities and massively more precise engineering. &#x201C;This is like another level of science and engineering and physics,&#x201D; says Acuna. &#x201C;Ukraine does not currently have the military-industrial complex to make missiles. Can they make a good Frankenstein missile? Sure, they can do that, but is it going to take down a Kh-31?&#x201D; Designed during the USSR, the Kh-31 is an air-launched missile that hits Mach 3.5 and still sees regular use in the Russian military. Duitsman for one doesn&#x2019;t think the problem is Ukrainian technological savvy so much as Russian air attacks. &#x201C;Once you get the basic industry down it&#x2019;s not that hard, it just becomes immensely harder when someone is trying to bomb all of your factories.&#x201D; Unlike the small workshops in which Ukrainians can produce drones, the factories involved in missile production are massive and their locations well-known. Many Russians still alive once worked in them during the Soviet Union. For the duration of the war, Russian airstrikes have targeted them avidly. In the first months of the war, Russia blew up a massive stockpile of solid rocket fuel in a chemical plant in Pavlohrad, on the western edge of the Donbas. Following a Dec. 20 attack on Kyiv, the Russian Defense Ministry said it had hit &#x201C;the construction bureau &#x2018;Luch,&#x2019; which has accomplished planning and production of rocket complex &#x2018;Neptune&#x2019; and the land-based guided rocket complex &#x2018;Vilcha.&#x2019;&#x201D; Aircraft engines are displayed at the Motor Sich Aviation Museum in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, on July 1, 2022. (Julia Kochetova / Bloomberg via Getty Images)And on Jan. 8, Russia bombarded the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia with glide bombs, resulting in the death of some 13 people and 113 more injured. Among the targeted areas, photos from the national police show damage to a &#x201C;Motor Sich&#x201D; factory that has long produced jet engines, including the MS400 Turbofan engines that at least at some point powered the Neptune. Given such security threats it is not surprising that Ukraine has been secretive in details about its missile program. When reached, a representative for the Strategic Industries Ministry declined to comment, calling it &#x201C;a sensitive subject.&#x201D; Still, little has been seen of these missiles in action, casting great doubt on Ukraine&#x2019;s actual production. Mass use within Russia would almost certainly have ended up on social media via Russians under bombardment. Despite the secrecy, Ukraine is obviously eager to tout successes in these missile programs. The development of a local missile program would allow Ukraine to strike back at Russia directly, freed from Western terms for donated weaponry. Missiles have also become more intangible symbols of independence. Eastern Ukraine was the heartland for much of the Soviet Union&#x2019;s heavy industry. Yuzhnomash in Dnipro was the &#x201C;largest ICBM factory in the world,&#x201D; notes Duitsman. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Ukraine&#x2019;s missile production was dismantled and cannibalized. The government has spent 20 years claiming that a rocket renaissance is at hand. Renamed to Pivdenmash &#x2014; a shift from the Russian to Ukrainian word &#x201C;pivden&#x201D; meaning &#x201C;south&#x201D; &#x2014; the same factory remains an epicenter of Ukraine&#x2019;s weapons production, including the Hrim itself. As with many such plants, Pivdenmash is a target for Russian missile attacks, including the infamous strike by Russia&#x2019;s new Oreshnik on Nov. 21, an event that had many Western observers wringing their hands over the world&#x2019;s first launch of an ICBM. Ukraine is hardly alone in treating missiles as fonts of national pride. U.S. military sources were positively gleeful in touting the Patriot air defense missile&#x2019;s success in shooting down Russia&#x2019;s hypersonic Kinzhal in May 2023. Russia has often bragged about weapons developments beyond their utility. The Russian Oreshnik that struck Pivdenmash in November, for example, was far less impressive than the headlines it managed to gather, says Duitsman. The Oreshnik, he argues, was a fairly minor adaptation of a prior missile that was touted as novel based on the maker&#x2019;s advertising and President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s sudden desire to cause a stir after the U.S. and U.K. permitted Ukraine to strike some Russian territory. &#x201C;States are not monoliths. Russia does not as a whole choose to pursue different missile programs,&#x201D; says Duitsman. &#x201C;These are the results of conflicting political, military, industrial, and engineering goals. The Oreshnik does not necessarily make sense in a military context. It does make sense in the context of these missile design bureaus and missile production factories wanting a piece of the sweet sweet war money pie.&#x201D; Ukraine seems likewise to be overselling the tangible results of local missile development, Hoffmann says. &#x201C;They have a vested interest in making it look like they&apos;re doing well,&#x201D; as Duitsman puts it.	https://kyivindependent.com/why-ukraines-long-delayed-missile-production-ambitions-have-yet-to-get-off-the-ground/	2025-01-15T08:43:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/2022-04-2560px-neptune-cruise-missile-05-1024x689.jpg
NATO defense budget could surpass Russia’s tenfold if Europe matches Poland’s spending, Tusk says	Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk advocated for increased defense spending across NATO on Jan. 15, arguing that if all European members matched Poland&#x2019;s spending, NATO&#x2019;s defense budget would be ten times that of Russia&#x2019;s. &quot;No one but Europe will solve its defense problems,&quot; he said during a joint press conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Warsaw. Tusk&#x2019;s comment comes amid growing calls for higher defense spending across NATO, a topic reignited by Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and advocated for by incoming U.S. President Donald Trump. &quot;Other countries should not pay 1.5 percent of their GDP for defense &#x2014; this is not enough,&quot; he said, emphasizing that robust European defense contributions could help maintain friendly U.S.-European relations. On Jan. 7, Trump called for NATO&#x2019;s spending target to rise to 5% of GDP, significantly higher than the current 2% goal. &quot;If all European countries start taking their obligations in NATO seriously, I am sure America will be happy to cooperate with us,&quot; Tusk added. While the 5% suggestion has faced resistance, some NATO members are reportedly open to a more modest increase, potentially to 3% of GDP, Reuters reported on Jan. 10. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte quipped on Jan. 13 that allies should increase spending or prepare to &quot;take Russian language courses or move to New Zealand.&quot; Currently, 24 out of 32 NATO countries meet the 2% GDP target, but several, including Italy, Canada, and Spain, fall short. Zelensky praised his discussions with Tusk, highlighting their focus on bolstering Ukraine&#x2019;s defense capabilities and advancing sanctions against Russia. &quot;We discussed our defense, including the supply of weapons, weapons production, and related investments. We also focused on strengthening sanctions against Russia and bringing peace closer for Ukraine and all of Europe,&quot; Zelensky said on X.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-defense-budget-could-surpass-russias-tenfold-if-europe-matches-polands-spending-pm-says/	2025-01-15T08:42:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GhVq_yOXcAAXWBM.jpeg
‘Absolutely unacceptable’ — Appointment of Ukrainian judge who visited occupied Crimea, Russia triggers criticism	The appointment of a Ukrainian judge who visited Russia and occupied Crimea during Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine has sparked criticism from the head of the country&#x2019;s main judicial watchdog. The High Council of Justice, Ukraine&apos;s top judicial governing body, appointed Oleksandra Shulika as a judge of Kirovohrad Oblast&apos;s Onufriivka District Court on Jan. 14. The decision highlights the continued presence of officials with ties to Russia in the Ukrainian government. While some officials with Russian passports and other links to Russia have been fired, others remain in their positions. Ukraine has a constitutional ban on judges and other officials with foreign passports. Shulika went to Crimea in 2014 after its illegal annexation by Russia and visited Russia several times from 2015 to 2019. &quot;This is absolutely unacceptable,&quot; Mykhailo Zhernakov, executive director of the judicial watchdog the Dejure Foundation, wrote in a post on Facebook. &#x201C;Not only do they help representatives of the judicial mafia remain in their positions but also allow sympathizers of Russia to take vacant positions in the judicial system,&#x201D; he said. Ukraine&apos;s judiciary is still notoriously corrupt despite repeated attempts to reform it, according to watchdogs. Some Ukrainian judges have routinely obstructed justice and blocked reforms. &#x201C;How do you like this &apos;reformed&apos; body? And what do you think &#x2014; will they let us into the EU with this kind of system?&quot; The High Council of Justice did not respond to a request for comment. Zhernakov said the appointment of judges who visited Russia and the occupied territories during the war violates the High Council of Justice&apos;s own guidelines. This is not the first scandal around a judge with ties to Russia. Bohdan Lvov, a former deputy chairman of the Supreme Court, received Russian citizenship in 1999 and still had a valid Russian passport, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s Schemes investigation project reported in 2022. Schemes cited official information from Russia&#x2019;s Federal Tax Service and leaked documents from Russia&#x2019;s official passport database. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) later confirmed that Lvov had Russian citizenship. Vsevolod Knyazev, then head of the Supreme Court, fired Lvov in October 2022 due to a constitutional ban on judges having foreign citizenship. The Kyiv District Administrative Court issued a ruling in January 2024 to reinstate Lvov as a Supreme Court judge. The court claimed that there was not enough proof of Lvov&#x2019;s Russian citizenship. In June 2024, an appellate court reversed the ruling and rejected Lvov&apos;s lawsuit for reinstatement.	https://kyivindependent.com/appointment-of-judge-who-visited-occupied-crimea-russia-triggers-criticism/	2025-01-15T07:35:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-479350285.jpg
Polish PM accuses Russia of planning 'air terror,' condemns sabotage efforts	Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Jan. 15 accused Russia of planning terrorist attacks against international airlines, including in Poland. &quot;Russia has been planning air terror &#x2014; not only against Poland but also against airlines around the world,&quot; he said during a joint press conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Warsaw. Tusk&apos;s remarks come after a Jan. 14 New York Times report claiming the outgoing U.S. administration warned Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt intelligence operations involving planting incendiary devices on U.S.-bound cargo planes. &quot;These acts of sabotage are versions of the war that Russia has declared to the whole world, not just Ukraine. They require joint action, and Poland plays a key role in countering such threats,&quot; Tusk said. U.S. intelligence reportedly intercepted communications in August 2024 among Russian secret service officers discussing plots to smuggle incendiary devices onto cargo planes. Moscow has been suspected of being behind incidents in July 2024, where several parcels sent by individuals caught fire in warehouses in Germany and the U.K. Had these fires occurred mid-flight, they could have resulted in catastrophic crashes. U.S. media reported these operations were intended as preparations for similar plots targeting the U.S. and Canada, which reportedly raised alarm among White House officials. Zelensky traveled to Poland to meet Tusk after reaching a &quot;breakthrough&quot; agreement over World War II exhumations, a long-standing source of tension between the nations. The leaders emphasized shared efforts to counter Russian aggression and address regional security challenges. Zelensky and Tusk last met in December 2024 in Lviv to discuss historical reconciliation, including issues surrounding the Volyn massacre.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-pm-accuses-russia-of-planning-global-airline-terror-attacks-condemns-sabotage-efforts/	2025-01-15T06:23:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193453413.jpg
Ukraine brings back 25 people from Russian captivity, including Azovstal defenders	Ukraine managed to bring back 25 Ukrainians from Russian captivity including Azovstal defenders, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Jan. 15. &quot;Returning our people home is something that Ukraine is constantly working on. And we will not stop until we bring all of our people back,&quot; Zelensky said in a post on Telegram. The returning Ukrainian POWs were captured during the defense of Mariupol and its Azovstal steel plant, as well as during the defense of other key areas of the front line in Kharkiv, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts, Zelensky added. He said some of those brought back have serious injuries and illnesses. Bringing our people home is what Ukraine is constantly working on, and we will not stop until we bring all of our people back. Today, 25 more of our people are returning home to Ukraine. These are our military and civilians. Among them are the defenders of Mariupol and&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/wDMeTUxYK0 The exchange was conducted on a 25 for 25 basis. In a recent agreement, Russia and Ukraine agreed to prioritize wounded POWs at selection of exchanges, followed by those held longest in captivity. President Zelensky also expressed his gratitude for the United Arab Emirates for mediating between the parties. Over the past year, Ukraine conducted 11 prisoner exchanges and secured the return of 356 more people than in 2023. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Nearly 4,000 people have been released, including 1,358 in 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-brings-back-25-people-from-russian-captivity-including-azovstal-defenders/	2025-01-15T05:27:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-15-at-15_18_38.png
Strongest action possible' — Albanese vows to act if Australian fighting for Ukraine was executed by Russia	Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese pledged the &quot;strongest action possible&quot; during a Jan. 15 press conference if reports of an Australian national captured while fighting for Ukraine being executed by Russian forces are confirmed, CNN reported. Oscar Jenkins, a 32-year-old teacher from Melbourne, was reported captured by Russian forces in December. Ukrainian sources told 7News that Jenkins&apos; body had been found, suggesting he was executed by his captors. Australia&apos;s Foreign Ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador to demand information and stress compliance with international law. Albanese said his government seeks &quot;urgent clarification&quot; and described the reports as &quot;gravely concerning.&quot; &quot;If there has been any harm caused to Oscar Jenkins, that is absolutely reprehensible,&quot; Albanese said, as reported by CNN. He did not specify potential actions Canberra might take. In late December, Russian Telegram channels circulated a video showing Jenkins in military fatigues, interrogated and beaten by his captors. Jenkins is seen providing his name and background as the interrogators question his desire to live. Jenkins introduces himself in the video as a biology teacher who came to help Ukraine and is now based near Kramatorsk, a city in Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk Oblast, located approximately 700 kilometers (430 miles) east of Kyiv, and 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of the front line. The Geneva Conventions require humane treatment of prisoners of war (POWs) and prohibit executions, which are classified as war crimes. Russia has repeatedly been accused of violating these laws by summarily executing Ukrainian POWs. Moscow, however, labels foreign volunteers as &quot;mercenaries&quot; and denies them the protections afforded to POWs under international law. If confirmed, Jenkins&apos; execution would mark the first instance of an Australian volunteer fighter captured and executed by Russian forces since the full-scale invasion began. At least six Australians are believed to have been killed fighting for Ukraine. The Australian government and Ukrainian authorities continue to investigate Jenkins&apos; fate.	https://kyivindependent.com/strongest-action-possible-pm-albanese-pledges-action-if-australian-fighting-for-ukraine-was-executed-by-russia/	2025-01-15T04:59:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1257670533.jpeg
Putin's war economy is running on fumes as inflation and shortages surge	Russian President Vladimir Putin frequently boasts about the strength of his country&#x2019;s economy, claiming that Western sanctions only made it stronger (while in the same breath demanding that they be lifted). In fact, &#x201C;stagflation&#x201D; &#x2014; inflation combined with minimal growth &#x2014; is coming to Russia. His war on Ukraine has caused both high and rising prices and labor shortages, because many workers have been mobilized or killed, while many others have fled the country. Heading into the Russian Central Bank&#x2019;s regularly scheduled board meeting in late December, most observers expected monetary authorities to raise the policy rate from 21% to 23%. Yet the Russian Central Bank kept the rate unchanged, despite an increase in the official annual inflation figure, from 8.4% to 9.5% in the space of two months. It is easy to guess what happened. Just a day before, Putin said he had spoken with Russian Central Bank Chair Elvira Nabiullina, and it is safe to assume that he told her to leave the policy rate where it is. Any illusion about the Russian Central Bank&apos;s independence vanished. For the first time, Putin appears to have listened to Russia&#x2019;s oligarchs rather than the professional economists overseeing monetary policy. In the last couple of months, numerous top loyalists and businessmen &#x2014; from Sergei Chemezov of Rostec (defense production) and Igor Sechin of Rosneft (oil) to Alexander Shokin of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs &#x2014; have bitterly complained that high interest rates will drive many companies into bankruptcy. These warnings are not unfounded. Since the Russian government ended mortgage subsidies last July, sales of newly built properties have plummeted by around 50%, pushing Russia&#x2019;s two biggest real-estate developers, Samolet and PIK, to the brink of insolvency. Meanwhile, Russia&#x2019;s official inflation figure becomes less credible by the day. According to the independent research firm ROMIR, the average cost of a Russian basket of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), such as food and household chemicals, had risen by 22.1% year on year in September. The company has published no new inflation readings since. It is easy to guess why. Oil storage tanks are illuminated at night at the RN-Tuapsinsky refinery, operated by Rosneft Oil Co., in Tuapse, Russia, on March 22, 2020. (Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images)To be sure, the FMCG price index does not reflect overall consumer inflation, since it does not track the prices of durable goods and services, which have risen less sharply compared to food prices. Yet there can be little doubt that the official Russian price index figure is too low. We might not know whether inflation is 12% or 22%, but we can be quite confident that it is higher than 9.5%. Even at Putin&#x2019;s own highly choreographed annual press conference last month, inflation was the dominant concern. Russia&#x2019;s inflation is not overtly caused by fiscal profligacy. On the contrary, the Kremlin has long maintained budget surpluses (though it did register a small budget deficit of around 2% of GDP in 2022 and 2023, and it is likely to do so again in 2024). The Russia expert and former banker Craig Kennedy, however, has recently uncovered evidence that since mid-2022, the Kremlin has been strong-arming Russian banks to lend to war-related businesses on preferential terms. This off-budget financing scheme has contributed to a $415 billion surge in corporate borrowing, boosting inflation and rendering Russia&#x2019;s finances highly vulnerable. For a normal country, a budget deficit of 2% of GDP would be of no concern. But Russia is not a normal country. It has been the subject of Western financial sanctions since July 2014, and these have been quite effective at blocking access to international financing. Russia&#x2019;s total private and public foreign debt has fallen from $729 billion at the end of 2013 to $293 billion at the end of September 2024. Yet nobody &#x2014; including Chinese state banks &#x2014; dares to lend it money. Starved of financing, Russia has raised taxes substantially this year. Abandoning the 13% flat income tax established in 2000, it has introduced a progressive income tax system with rates starting at 15% and rising to 22% for top earners. Meanwhile, the tax rate on corporate profits has increased from 20% to 25%. But since these changes will generate only around 1.4% of GDP more in state revenues, the rest of the deficit must be financed with domestic bonds whose interest rates have already skyrocketed, doubling the cost of debt service as a share of total expenditure since 2019. Russia thus remains dependent on a single source of financing: the National Wealth Fund, whose liquid reserves have fallen from $117 billion in 2021 to $31 billion at the end of November. That is only enough to finance three-quarters of the budget deficit in 2025. Western financial sanctions have also weighed on the ruble, which has sunk from 34 to the dollar in 2013 to 103 today. This, too, aggravates inflation, because the central bank no longer has the reserves to defend the exchange rate (by spending dollars to buy rubles). Though Russia has stopped publishing most of its foreign-trade statistics, the Bank of Finland Institute for Emerging Economics (whose scientific council I chair) estimates that its total exports plummeted by 28% (to $425 billion) from 2022 to 2023. Most likely, they remained at the same level in 2024, because Western energy sanctions had not been significantly tightened, although the outgoing Biden administration did so on January 10. At the same time, tighter Western technology sanctions have had devastating effects on Russian manufacturing. Of the 108 airliners Russia planned to build since 2022, only seven have been completed. Dire conditions in the civilian sector presumably extend to the armaments sector, which is largely monopolized by Chemezov&#x2019;s corrupt Rostec. Strained by these factors, the Russian economy is approaching its moment of truth. Inflation will continue to rise in 2025, and people will get even angrier over higher food prices. Major bankruptcies are looming, and the Russian state cannot afford large bailouts. Business leaders are fiercely objecting to high interest rates, and the shortage of labor &#x2014; and soldiers &#x2014; is reaching a crisis stage. The most critical shortage, however, is budget financing, as Russia&#x2019;s last liquid reserves are likely to run out in the fall of 2025. Budget cuts will then become necessary. In the meantime, the war economy might also require price controls and rationing &#x2014; the old Soviet sins. As the risk of a financial crash rises, Russia&#x2019;s imperiled economy is about to pose serious constraints on Putin&#x2019;s war. Editor&#x2019;s Note: Copyright, Project Syndicate.

Lithuania would consider troop deployment to Ukraine upon Kyiv’s request, FM Budrys says	Vilnius would consider deploying troops to Ukraine with its allies in the future if Kyiv were to make such a request, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys told LRT TV on Jan. 14. The proposal for an international peacekeeping force has gained traction recently, as European nations prepare to take a more prominent role in Ukraine&apos;s defense when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Budrys said that Lithuania did not rule out such possibilities which were touted at a summit in Paris last year when French President Emmanuel Macron invited Lithuania&#x2019;s president and others to explore expanded military involvement in Ukraine. &quot;Lithuania is a security provider in the region, not just a recipient,&quot; Budrys said. &quot;If the question arises, I have no doubt that the Lithuanian flag will be there.&quot; &quot;We&#x2019;d talk with our allies and partners about what it looks like, and we&#x2019;d talk with Ukraine about what it looks like,&quot; he added. Macron has championed the idea of deploying European troops in Ukraine since early 2024. President Volodymyr Zelensky and Macron discussed the possibility during a meeting on Dec. 18, and Macron raised the proposal again during a trilateral meeting with Trump on Dec. 7. Trump reportedly expressed interest in European-led ceasefire monitoring. On Jan. 13, Zelensky and Macron held a phone call to discuss Ukraine&#x2019;s air defense priorities and the possible deployment of peacekeepers. Both leaders agreed to meet soon to advance plans for securing guarantees for Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is also expected to visit Ukraine in the coming weeks to discuss the peacekeeping initiative, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 10.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-would-consider-troop-deployment-to-ukraine-upon-kyivs-request-fm-budrys-says/	2025-01-15T04:37:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1527606933.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine wound at least 16, kill 1 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine wounded 16 and killed one person over the past day, regional authorities, and the Office of the Prosecutor General reported on Jan. 15. Eight people, including two children were injured in Donetsk Oblast, the Office of the Prosecutor General reported on its Telegram channel, when the Russian military struck a multi-storey building in Kramatorsk. On the night of January 14-15 the Russian military attacked Ukraine with one Iskander-M/KN ballistic missile, seven Kh-22/32, 27 Kh-101/Kh-55 and four Kalibr cruise missiles, as well as four Kh-59/Kh-69 guided missiles. During the overnight attack, Russia also launched 74 Shahed-type and various other types of dummy drones, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported on their Telegram channel. Air defenses shot down 23 Kh-101/Kh-55 and three Kalibr cruise missiles, along with Kh-59/Kh-69 guided missiles. They also downed 47 drones, while 27 other drones were lost in the airspace, the Air Force said. The missiles hit critical infrastructure in Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblasts, with no reports of casualties. A 52-year-old man died, and a 74-year-old woman was injured during Russian attacks on Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported on his Telegram channel. Seven were injured as a result of Russian attacks on the city of Kherson and 36 other settlements, Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on his Telegram channel.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-wound-at-least-16-kill-1-over-past-day/	2025-01-15T04:27:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GhVGQqmXkAAx1mF.jpeg
Transnistria to receive Russian gas as humanitarian aid, head of breakaway region says	Russia will resume gas supplies to Transnistria in the form of humanitarian aid, the head of the Moscow-controlled breakaway region said on Jan. 15, but those to the rest of Moldova will remain cut off. Vadim Krasnoselsky made the announcement in a statement after returning from a trip to Moscow, where he attended talks at Russia&#x2019;s Ministry of Energy. Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom halted gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1, citing alleged unpaid debts by Moldovagaz. The gas suspension has led to widespread power outages in Transnistria, pushing the region toward industrial collapse. &quot;Gas supplies for the needs of Transnistrians and the functioning of the economy of Transnistria will be restored in the format of providing humanitarian and technical assistance to the republic,&quot; Krasnoselsky said. He did not provide technical details nor a timeline for the restoration of gas flows. Transnistrian authorities previously rejected an offer from Chisinau to help purchase gas via European platforms. While Moldova has transitioned to European energy supplies, Transnistria remains heavily reliant on Russian gas. Russian troops have been stationed in the region since the early 1990s. Gazprom&#x2019;s suspension coincided with the expiration of a deal allowing Russian gas to transit through Ukraine. However, Gazprom attributed the cutoff to Moldova&apos;s purported debt rather than transit issues. Moldovan officials dispute these claims, pointing to an international audit that failed to verify the alleged debt.	https://kyivindependent.com/transnistria-to-receive-russian-gas-humanitarian-aid/	2025-01-15T03:37:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2043777119.jpg

Biden team seeks European support to leverage frozen Russian assets in talks with Moscow, CNN reports	As the Biden administration prepares to leave office, it is reportedly urging European partners to support the transfer of frozen Russian central bank assets worth $300 billion to a special account as leverage in negotiations with Moscow, CNN reported on Jan. 15, citing anonymous administration officials. The strategy reportedly aims to pressure Moscow by signaling the funds could only be reclaimed through negotiations with Ukraine. &quot;If you want to get this money, you will have to negotiate,&quot; a source told CNN. The proposal involves moving the frozen assets, currently held primarily in European banks, to a deposit account from which withdrawals would only be allowed as part of a future peace deal with Ukraine. Biden officials are reportedly discussing the plan with President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s team, including Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio, and incoming National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. Both reportedly back the initiative, aligning with Trump&apos;s goal to expedite a resolution to the war. European governments have reportedly expressed hesitancy about the plan, citing concerns over its compliance with international law. Confiscation of frozen Russian funds has been a contentious issue, and even using the assets&apos; annual income &#x2014; around $3.2 billion &#x2014; required significant negotiation. The European Union recently disbursed &#x20AC;3 billion ($3.09 billion) to Ukraine as part of a $50 billion G7 loan initiative. The EU&apos;s &#x20AC;20 billion ($20.6 billion) contribution to the program is partially funded by income from frozen Russian assets. The U.S. has also contributed $20 billion toward the loan assistance, showcasing a concerted Western effort to support Ukraine financially while leveraging Russian assets. Outgoing President Joe Biden expressed confidence on Jan. 10 in his administration&apos;s support for Ukraine, saying he did &quot;all I could to help&quot; while voicing hope for continued U.S. backing under Trump. As the U.S. transitions to a new administration, the international community&apos;s stance on utilizing these assets may significantly influence diplomatic efforts to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-team-seeks-european-support-to-leverage-frozen-russian-assets-in-talks-with-moscow-cnn-reports/	2025-01-15T03:12:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184603402.jpg
Ukrainians divided over what peace with Russia should look like, new poll reveals	There is no clear consensus among Ukrainians about what a potential peace agreement with Russia should look like, a new global poll published on Jan. 15 has found. The poll, conducted by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), presented respondents with four options relating to NATO/EU membership, security guarantees, and ceding/regaining occupied territories. Not one gained a majority for or against from respondents. (European Council on Foreign Relations)&quot;Such disagreements could stoke political turmoil if and when negotiations begin,&quot; the report reads. Though peace negotiations are a long way off, the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20 has accelerated discussion of their possibility in Kyiv, Moscow, and capitals around the world. Trump vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table and swiftly end the full-scale war that nears its third anniversary. Earlier this week, he told reporters that arrangements for a meeting with Putin are underway. The wide-ranging, global poll surveyed respondents in 16 European countries including the U.K., Russia, and Ukraine, and eight non-European countries including Brazil, China, India, Saudi Arabia, and the U.S. about attitudes towards the U.S. and international powers ahead of Trump&apos;s inauguration. Many of the questions related to Trump&apos;s possible influence on global events such as the wars in Ukraine, and the Middle East, as well as the future balance of global power. In Ukraine, expectations of an outright victory in the war against Russia have fallen sharply in just the last six months since the poll was last conducted, from 58% in May 2024, to 34% in November 2024. Of the options available, most Ukrainians &#x2014; 47% &#x2014; now say a compromise settlement with Russia is the most likely outcome of the war. (European Council on Foreign Relations)Ukrainians are split on whether or not the incoming Trump administration will make peace more or less likely &#x2014; 39% say it will be more likely, 35% less likely, and 26% say it will make no difference. (European Council on Foreign Relations)The question is still largely hypothetical &#x2014; despite multiple promises during the U.S. presidential election campaign to negotiate an end to the war as soon as he was elected, Donald Trump is yet to lay out any concrete plans of how he intends to do so. Tempering expectations further, Trump&apos;s choice for special Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, earlier this month said Trump wants to end the war in 100 days. Then there is the issue of what Trump will demand from both sides. While much of the election rhetoric from Trump and his allies suggested Kyiv could be forced to pay a heavy price and cede territory, Kellogg has also sought to play this down. &quot;People need to understand, he&apos;s not trying to give something to Putin or to the Russians, he&apos;s actually trying to save Ukraine and save their sovereignty,&quot; Kellogg said. &quot;And he&apos;s going to make sure that it&apos;s equitable and it&apos;s fair.&quot; As for the global implications of a second Trump presidency, and how he deals with issues such as the war in Ukraine, the poll found a wide range of views across the countries polled. In India, China, and Brazil, majorities or pluralities believe Trump will be a &quot;good thing&quot; for prospects of peace around the world, as well as for their own countries. But in countries more allied with the U.S. there was skepticism &#x2014; only 24% of those in the UK, 31% in South Korea, and 34% in the EU countries polled said Trump&apos;s presidency would make peace in Ukraine more likely, while even fewer thought the same about the Middle East. The authors of the report suggested that while there is obviously a nervousness in Europe about Trump, there is also an opportunity for Europe to reassert itself on the global stage. &quot;Europe may stand almost alone in a Trumpian world, but this doesn&#x2019;t mean we Europeans are powerless to act,&quot; historian Timothy Garton Ash said, adding: &quot;There are opportunities in this new, transactional space for alliances and influence. &quot;Indeed, the very fact that the EU is held in such high regard by people in so many countries and is even expected to grow in strength in the coming decade, should give leaders hope that there is room for a strong and independent-minded Europe in the world.&quot; The poll was conducted in November 2024 in 16 European countries (Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, T&#xFC;rkiye, Ukraine and the United Kingdom), and eight non-European countries (Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea and the United States). The total number of respondents was 28,549.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-divided-over-what-peace-with-russia-should-look-like-new-poll-reveals/	2025-01-15T02:45:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2191058089.jpg
‘We know how the good guy is’ — Trump’s defense nominee grilled over war in Ukraine	President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s nominee for defense secretary was grilled over the war in Ukraine during a confirmation hearing on Jan. 14, after he failed to mention Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion during his opening remarks. Speaking to the Armed Services Committee, Pete Hegseth was asked if the omission was &quot;code for &apos;we&#x2019;re going to abandon Ukraine.&apos;&quot; &quot;We know who the aggressor is,&quot; Hegesth replied, adding: &quot;We know who the good guy is. We&#x2019;d like to see (the resolution of the war be) as advantageous for the Ukrainians as possible.&quot; &quot;But that war needs to come to an end,&quot; he added. The Armed Services Committee is expected to vote on Hegseth&#x2019;s confirmation as soon as Monday, Reuters reports. He will then be considered by the full U.S. Senate. Hegseth&#x2019;s nomination in November sent shockwaves through Pentagon corridors, with officials anonymously questioning his qualifications to lead the department. He would lead 1.3 million troops and over 750,000 civilians, preside over a $850 billion budget, and hold meetings with U.S. allies, acting as the principal defense policymaker and adviser. A former conservative talk show host on Fox News, Hegesth is seen as an isolationist who has called for reducing the U.S. commitment to the NATO military alliance. He previously served as an infantry captain in the Army National Guard, doing multiple tours of Afghanistan and Iraq. Following his discharge from the army, he became head of the conservative organization Concerned Veterans for America and, in June 2024, released a book titled &quot;The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.&quot; Hegseth also unsuccessfully ran as a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Minnesota in 2012.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-know-how-the-good-guy-is-trumps-defense-nominee-grilled-over-war-in-ukraine/	2025-01-15T01:32:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193430534.jpg

Parliament pushes forward draft law at odds with IMF requirements Last week, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, rejected draft law #12368, submitted by the Cabinet of Ministers, which aimed to establish a High Administrative Court. Instead, lawmakers backed an alternative proposal, draft law #12368-1, introduced by MP Vlasenko of the Batkivshchyna faction, in its first reading. This version designates the Kyiv City District Administrative Court to handle cases concerning the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine and Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&apos;s Office competitions and audits. For appeals it proposes to establish a separate Kyiv City Appeal Administrative Court. This move diverges from Ukraine&#x2019;s commitments under the International Monetary Fund&apos;s Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). Parliament set to vote public investment management bill During sessions scheduled for Jan. 14-17, 2025, the Verkhovna Rada will review draft law #12245 on public investment management in its second and final reading. The Budget Committee approved it on Monday morning. This legislation is crucial for meeting a structural benchmark under the MEFP, with a deadline at the end of January 2025. Transparency International Ukraine has flagged concerns over recent amendments that grant the Cabinet of Ministers authority to increase salaries for State Audit Service employees and assign special ranks and statuses to the SAS. Parliament to vote on draft law to repeal &quot;Lozovyy Amendments,&quot; rejection likely The Verkhovna Rada is set to consider a revised draft law #12367 amending the Criminal Procedure Code in its first reading. This government-backed legislation aims to fulfill obligations related to repealing the &quot;Lozovyy amendments&quot; and addressing the implications of expired pre-trial investigation time limits. Our information indicates a significant risk of rejection when it comes to a vote. The Law Enforcement Committee hasn&#x2019;t decided on the draft law during its meeting on Jan. 13. It is more likely that MPs will submit an alternative bill. Ukraine advances energy sector commitments The Verkhovna Rada has adopted draft law #12131, reinstating monitoring and reporting on greenhouse gas emissions, fulfilling a key requirement under the Ukraine Plan. The deadline for this measure was set for the end of the second quarter of 2025. Corporate governance reform sees progress Parliament has passed draft law #6013, mandating corporate governance standards across utility and state-owned enterprises. In particular, these companies will have to sell assets via &#x201C;Prozorro.Sales&#x201D; and publish financial reports. Moreover, the Cabinet of Ministers approved new procedures for evaluating the performance of supervisory boards in SOEs. Oleksii Sobolev, first deputy economy minister, noted that this includes mandatory performance assessments for the boards of Ukrenergo, Naftogaz, and the Gas Transmission System Operator (GTSO) for the previous year. The reform aims to ensure supervisory board independence and adherence to OECD corporate governance principles, requiring annual submission of development and performance reports by the end of March.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-9/	2025-01-15T01:19:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1245855806.jpg
Zelensky to visit Poland after ‘breakthrough’ agreement on Volyn tragedy exhumations	President Volodymyr Zelensky will travel to Poland on Jan 15 to meet with Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Reuters reported, after a &#x201C;breakthrough&#x201D; agreement was reached between the two countries in a long-running dispute over World War II exhumations. The Volyn massacre involved widespread violence that claimed tens of thousands of Polish and Ukrainian lives. Poland characterizes the events as genocide perpetrated by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), while Ukraine has called for shared acknowledgment of responsibility for the atrocities. Tusk announced on Jan. 10 that a decision has been made to exhume the first victims of the Volyn tragedy. &quot;There are a lot of topics (to discuss), including of course exhumations,&quot; a Polish government official was quoted as saying by Reuters. &quot;What interests us is the way these decisions (about exhumations) are carried out.&quot; They added the two leaders would hold a joint press conference in Poland. According to Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita, exhumations will begin as early as April 2025. Zelensky and Tusk previously met in Lviv in December 2024, to address historical reconciliation, including the legacy of the Volyn massacre. Tusk emphasized the importance of unity despite historical challenges. &#x201C;History certainly cannot divide us,&#x201D; he said in December 2024. The exhumations represent a significant step forward in resolving longstanding historical tensions and strengthening Polish-Ukrainian relations amid challenges posed by Russia&apos;s aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-visit-poland-after-breakthrough-agreement-on-volyn-tragedy-exhumations/	2025-01-14T23:24:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/ad251d9b370ace3d876b64ad229cbd6c_1734456764.jpeg
General Staff: Russia has lost 812,670 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 812,670 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 15. This number includes 1,580 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,780 tanks, 20,348 armored fighting vehicles, 33,995 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,975 artillery systems, 1,262 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,046 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 22,383 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-812-670-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-14T22:50:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2183596448-1.jpg
Russia launches mass missile attack against Ukraine	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched a large-scale missile attack against Ukraine on the morning of Jan. 15, launching Kh-101, Kh-22, and Kalibr cruise missiles, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported. The Russian Defense Ministry had previously threatened to retaliate after Ukraine targeted military and industrial sites throughout Russia in a mass attack on Jan. 14. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force issued a nationwide aerial alert in the early hours of Jan. 15, following warnings that a group of Tu-95MS strategic bombers had taken flight from Russia&apos;s Olenya airfield in Murmansk Oblast. Russia also reportedly launched ballistic missiles from Belgorod Oblast. Explosions were reported in Kharkiv, Khmelnytsky Oblast, and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. In Lviv Oblast, Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said Russian forces had &quot;attacked the energy infrastructure of our region and Ukraine.&quot; There are no reports of casualties or damage at this time. Shortly after eight in the morning, the all clear was given across much of the country. Poland scrambled fighter jets due to the Russian missile threat in western Ukraine, according to the Polish Operational Command. Ukraine&apos;s state grid operator, Ukrenergo, imposed emergency blackouts as a preventative measure, Energy Minister Herman Haluschenko announced.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-mass-missile-attack-against-ukraine/	2025-01-14T22:42:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1240508647.jpg
US, Armenia sign strategic partnership agreement	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan signed a strategic partnership commission charter between the U.S and Armenia on Jan. 14 in Washington, D.C. The agreement comes as Armenia, once a close ally of Russia, moves to strengthen ties with the West amid deteriorating relations with Moscow. The charter establishes a framework for expanded bilateral cooperation between the U.S. and Armenia in the areas of economic cooperation, security and defense, and democracy, among others. &quot;We are increasingly strong partners, and I think that is for the good of both of our countries as well as the good of the region and beyond,&quot; Blinken said at the signing. The two countries are also preparing to start negotations on an agreement to support Armenia&apos;s nuclear energy sector, Blinken said. &quot;Our relations, based on shared values and mutual interests, have witnessed remarkable growth in recent years,&quot; Mirzoyan said. &#xA0; &quot;They have matured to a point where upgrading them to a strategic partnership is not only fitting but essential for navigating the complex geopolitical landscape.&quot; The strategic partnership marks Armenia&apos;s latest pro-Western foreign policy move as it continues to distance itself from Russia, its traditional ally. Relations between Russia and Armenia deteriorated rapidly after Moscow failed to prevent an Azerbaijani lighting offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh in September 2023. Yerevan has since forged deeper alliances with the U.S. and Europe, signaling interest in joining the EU and breaking from the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a Russian-led security alliance.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-armenia-sign-strategic-partnership-agreement/	2025-01-14T20:25:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/armenia.png
EU considering ban on Russian LNG, aluminum, Bloomberg reports	The European Union is considering a gradual ban on Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) and new restrictions on Russian aluminum as part of its next round of sanctions, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 14, citing undisclosed officials. The EU has begun drafting its 16th round of sanctions against Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The bloc aims to approve the package on Feb. 24, the third anniversary of the all-out war. The phase-out of Russian LNG could be enacted as a sanction or part of a road map presented by the European Commission next month, people familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg. Restrictions on aluminum would be gradual, with a time frame yet to be determined. The new sanctions may also target dozens of vessels belonging to Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; &#x2014; tankers that transport Russian oil products in violation of international sanctions &#x2014; and cut more banks off from the SWIFT international payment system, Bloomberg&apos;s sources said. The draft measures are currently under discussion and subject to change before they are formally presented. The EU is still debating whether to impose restrictions on Russian LNG via sanctions or as a set of regulations within a road map, or a combination thereof, undisclosed officials and diplomats said. Sanctions, which may carry the most weight, require unanimous approval of all member states. This requirement has prevented the EU from banning Russian pipeline gas, as member nations such as Slovakia and Hungary remain heavily reliant on energy imports from Russia. The EU&apos;s largest importers of Russian LNG &#x2014;&#xA0;Spain, Belgium, and France &#x2014;&#xA0;are not expected to block sanctions against Moscow, the officials said. The EU imposed its first major restrictions on Russian gas, including LNG, in its 14th sanctions package in June 2024. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proposed replacing Russian LNG with U.S. imports in a phone call with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in November. The 16th sanctions package comes on the heels of a joint U.S.-U.K. crackdown on Russia&apos;s oil sector and shadow fleet. The two countries on Jan. 10 imposed major restrictions on over 180 Russian tankers and a number of oil companies. Following the sanctions, 65 oil tankers around the world paused operations and remain idling offshore.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-considering-ban-on-russian-lng-aluminum-bloomberg-reports/	2025-01-14T18:50:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1775102025.jpeg
Drone hits distillery in Russia's Tambov Oblast, local media reports	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A drone struck a distillery in the village of Novaya Lyada in Russia&apos;s Tambov Oblast the night of Jan. 14, the Russian Telegram news channel Astra reported, citing local residents. Local residents said a fire broke out at the distillery, which is located near a military training ground. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Russian officials have not commented on the alleged attack at the distillery. The government of Tambov Oblast claimed that air defense units intercepted a drone over the region and that it exploded &quot;in a tree.&quot; Previous drone attacks have reportedly targeted Russian alcohol plants, including facilities in Tambov Oblast. The Biokhim distillery in the town of Rasskazovo in Tambov Oblast allegedly caught fire after being struck by a drone in October 2025. The distillery advertised its manufacture of &quot;products of strategic importance for the state,&quot; including ethanol, a solvent used in the production of explosives. The reported attack on Novaya Lyada comes a day after Ukraine launched its &quot;most massive&quot; attack against Russian military and industrial facilities, covering a range of up to 1,100 kilometers (620 miles), overnight on Jan. 13-14. Ukrainian forces successfully struck chemical plants, refineries, and the Engels airbase&apos;s ammunition depots, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/drone-hits-distillery-in-russias-tambov-oblast-local-media-reports/	2025-01-14T17:47:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/distillery.png
Putin aide claims that 'Moldova will become part of another state or cease to exist', Chisinau responds	Moldovan officials have condemned recent remarks by Nikolai Patrushev, an aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who claimed that Moldova &#x201C;will either become part of another state or cease to exist&#x201D; due to its &#x201C;anti-Russian policy,&#x201D; Moldovan media outlet NewsMaker reported on January 14. Patrushev made the controversial statement in an interview, further blaming the Moldovan government for the energy crisis and urging Chisinau to &quot;not deceive itself or its people,&quot; but instead &quot;admit its mistakes and start fixing the situation.&quot; Moldova&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry called the remarks unnaceptable interference in the internal affairs of the country. &#x201C;Moldova is a sovereign state that stands firmly on the path of democracy and European integration, in line with the will of its citizens,&#x201D; the Foreign Ministry said. The energy crisis, worsened by Russia&apos;s suspension of gas supplies in December 2024, has been labeled by Chisinau as Kremlin blackmail and a threat to national security. Moldova began sourcing electricity from European markets, resulting in significant disruptions in the Russian-controlled Transnistria region, including power outages and industrial shutdowns. Transnistrian authorities previously rejected an offer from Chisinau to help purchase gas via European platforms. While Moldova has transitioned to European energy supplies, Transnistria remains heavily reliant on Russian gas. Russian troops have been stationed in the region since the early 1990s.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-aide-claims-that-moldova-will-become-part-of-another-state-or-cease-to-exist-chisinau-responds/	2025-01-14T16:26:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2178578557.jpg
Zelensky addresses personnel transfer controversy, orders Air Force commander not to reassign specialists to Ground Forces	President Volodymyr Zelensky has addressed the controversy surrounding the reassignment of Air Force personnel to the Ground Forces, in his evening address on Jan. 14. Reports indicated that since 2024, thousands of Air Force soldiers have been transferred to the Ground Forces. The latest directive was issued on Jan. 11, when Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units. A senior Air Force officer, speaking anonymously, said transfers have now reached a &quot;critical level,&quot; with unit staffing dropping to 50%. However, this move has sparked significant debate and concern about its impact on the Air Force&#x2019;s operational capabilities. Zelensky directed Anatolii Kryvonozhko, Commander of the Ukrainian Air Force, to ensure the Air Force maintains its required personnel levels and to address public concerns about recent transfers to the Ground Forces. &quot;There has been much concern and discussion today regarding these reassignments. I have instructed that everything be explained to the public and not to reduce the ranks of specialists critical to the Air Force &#x2013; aviation, air defense, and mobile fire units,&#x201D; he said. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine also weighed in, reassuring the public that critical engineering and aviation specialists servicing aircraft are not being transferred. Instead, selected Air Force personnel are undergoing training to address personnel shortages in infantry and other units.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-addresses-personnel-transfer-controversy-orders-air-force-commander-not-to-reassign-specialists-to-ground-forces/	2025-01-14T14:02:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188503703.jpg
Slovak opposition announces no-confidence vote against PM	Slovakia&apos;s pro-Western opposition parties announced plans to initiate a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Robert Fico&apos;s government, citing concerns over his governance and foreign policy direction, TASR news agency reported on Jan. 14. The opposition &#x2014; Progressive Slovakia, Freedom and Solidarity, the Christian Democrats, and others &#x2014; criticized Fico for undermining Slovakia&apos;s pro-European stance and failing to address domestic issues such as healthcare, rising prices, and administrative inefficiencies. Opposition leader Michal Simecka of Progressive Slovakia accused Fico of steering Slovakia toward pro-Russian policies. &quot;Fico has left Slovakia,&quot; Simecka said, referencing the prime minister&apos;s recent travels, including a controversial visit to Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. Fico&apos;s Kremlin-friendly stance has drawn widespread criticism, with accusations that he prioritizes ties with autocratic regimes over Slovakia&apos;s Western alliances. Protests erupted in Slovakia&apos;s capital on Jan. 3, with thousands chanting pro-EU slogans and condemning Fico&apos;s policies. The opposition has criticized Fico&apos;s domestic governance, accusing him of neglecting pressing national issues while alienating Slovakia from its Western allies. &quot;We will not allow Fico to turn Slovakia eastward,&quot; Simecka said, as reported by Aktuality. Efforts to convene an extraordinary parliamentary session to reaffirm Slovakia&apos;s foreign policy orientation failed due to a lack of coalition support. The opposition now plans to use the no-confidence vote as a platform to challenge Fico&apos;s policies and leadership. Relations between Slovakia and Ukraine have deteriorated after Kyiv allowed a pre-war Russian gas transit deal to expire on Dec. 31, 2024. In retaliation, Fico threatened to reduce aid to Ukrainian refugees and cut electricity exports to Ukraine. Before Fico&apos;s government took power, Slovakia had been a leading supporter of Ukraine, delivering military aid and fighter jets. Fico&apos;s administration reversed this policy, halting arms shipments and adopting rhetoric critical of the West&apos;s role in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Public dissatisfaction with Fico&apos;s policies has been growing, as demonstrated by the Bratislava protests. Demonstrators carried Slovak and EU flags, played the EU anthem, and displayed banners like &quot;We are Europe&quot; and &quot;Fico, go to Moscow, leave Slovakia in peace.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/slovak-opposition-announces-no-confidence-vote-against-pm-fico-criticizing-pro-russian-stance/	2025-01-14T13:08:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190743977.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine targets Russian industrial plants, ammunition depots in overnight strike	Key developments on Jan. 14: Ukraine launched its &quot;most massive&quot; attack against Russian military and industrial facilities in a range of up to 1,100 kilometers (620 miles) overnight on Jan. 14, the General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces reported. Chemical plants, refineries, and the Engels airbase&apos;s ammunition depots were successfully targeted, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The SBU, together with the Defense Forces, continues to strike enemy military facilities and enterprises supporting Russia&#x2019;s military-industrial complex. Each hit &#x2014; whether on ammunition depots, refineries, oil depots, or chemical plants &#x2014; weakens Russia&#x2019;s capacity to wage war in Ukraine,&quot; an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. Ukrainian drones reportedly targeted multiple regions, including Saratov, Voronezh, and Orel oblasts, as well as Tatarstan. The Russian Defense Ministry did not specify the number of drones involved. Dmitry Milyaev, the governor of Russia&apos;s Tula region, described a &quot;massive drone attack&quot; in a Telegram post, claiming at least 17 drones were launched. In Aleksin, debris from a downed drone reportedly damaged vehicles and outbuildings, with no casualties reported. The SBU source indicated the Aleksino chemical plant &#x2014; producing gunpowder and ammunition for the Russian military &#x2014; was successfully hit, igniting a large fire. In Saratov and Engels, Governor Roman Busargin confirmed damage at two industrial facilities following drone strikes. The General Staff said that the Kristal oil facility in Engels, which burned for five days after an earlier strike on Jan. 8, was again successfully targeted. The Engels airfield, located in Saratov Oblast over 750 kilometers (460 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s nearest controlled territory, allegedly sustained hits to ammunition depots containing FAB glide bombs, KAB bombs, and cruise missiles. The Saratov oil refinery was also reportedly engulfed in a fire. Engels hosts three types of Russian strategic bombers &#x2014; the Tupolev Tu-95, Tu-22, and Tu-160 &#x2014; all frequently used to launch missile strikes on Ukrainian cities. Mikhail Isayev, the acting head of the Engels district, announced that schools in the city would transition to remote learning due to the continued threat of drone strikes. Explosions were reported in the town of Seltso near Bryansk, where the chemical plant reportedly was hit, according to the Russian opposition Telegram channel Astra. Ukraine&#x2019;s Unmanned Systems Forces confirmed the strike, saying that the plant produces gunpowder, explosives, and missile fuel components, including ammunition for barrel artillery, multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), aircraft, and Kh-59 cruise missiles. It also carries out overhauls of Grad, Uragan, and Tornado-G MLRS. The unit reported that the drones distracted Russian air defense, paving the way for missiles to hit the main targets. Following the missile strike, long-range drones allegedly destroyed substations and other critical infrastructure. In Tatarstan&#x2019;s capital, Kazan, a fuel facility was struck in the early hours of Jan. 14, igniting a gas tank. The fire occurred about 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Tatarstan Republic head Rustam Minnikhanov confirmed that a fire broke out in the city as a result of the drone strike but claimed that it resulted in no significant damage. &quot;I went to the scene of a fire that occurred as a result of the drone attack. Emergency services quickly arrived at the scene to extinguish the fire. I heard reports that there were no casualties or serious damage,&quot; Minnikhanov wrote on his Telegram channel. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. Ukraine&apos;s immediate focus is on adequately equipping its military, rather than further reducing the draft age, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 14, according to Interfax-Ukraine. &quot;When we talk about increasing the number of our people (in the military), we must first address the issue of adequately equipping our brigades. Our partners have all these requests,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky noted that Ukraine fields over 100 brigades, all requiring sustained staffing and consistent resupply of equipment to maintain their combat effectiveness. The remarks follow reports that U.S. lawmakers and NATO allies are urging Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 to address manpower shortages. U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration has reportedly advocated for the move as part of broader efforts to address Ukraine&apos;s personnel needs at the full-scale war with Russia stretches into its third year. However, Kyiv has resisted the proposal, citing concerns over equipment shortages and the economic impact of drafting younger workers. Under martial law, men aged 18 to 60 are prohibited from leaving Ukraine, but only those aged 25 and older are eligible for the draft. The Ukrainian government lowered the draft age from 27 to 25 in April 2024, adding 50,000 troops to its forces. While the measure bolstered numbers, it fell short of meeting the military&apos;s full requirements. The Ukrainian Air Force will transfer military personnel &quot;en masse&quot; to reinforce the Ground Forces&apos; combat brigades in early 2025, Ukrainska Pravda reported on Jan. 14, citing an undisclosed Air Force source. Facing an infantry shortage along the front lines, Ukraine has been forced to make difficult adjustments as Russia ramps up its offensive in Donetsk Oblast. According to Ukrainska Pravda, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order on Jan. 11 to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units. A senior Air Force officer, speaking anonymously, said transfers began in spring 2024 and have now reached a &quot;critical level,&quot; with unit staffing dropping to 50%. &quot;If we carry out the order of the 11th, which was sent to us by the commander-in-chief, the manning of units will drop to 40%&quot; the officer told Ukrainska Pravda. They added that even transferring &quot;unimportant personnel&quot; weakens unit effectiveness, particularly for anti-aircraft missile systems, which rely on cohesive teams. Over 200 personnel are reportedly set to be taken from seven Air Force brigades, including units defending Kyiv, Ukrainska Pravda reported, citing an undisclosed source. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. In a Jan. 14 statement, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces denied transferring Air Force engineering and aviation personnel to infantry units, emphasizing that technical and flight personnel numbers are increasing. However, some Air Force and other branch personnel, after training, are being reassigned to strengthen ground brigades due to a critical infantry shortage. The General Staff noted this as a necessary measure to bolster frontline defense but confirmed that specialists in high-tech roles or those trained abroad on foreign equipment are exempt from transfers. Germany will deploy the promised Patriot air defenses around the Polish airport of Rzeszow by the end of January, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said during his visit to Warsaw on Jan. 13. Monitoring group German Aid to Ukraine wrote earlier that two MIM-104 Patriot fire units and a total of 200 Bundeswehr soldiers will be deployed to Poland for an estimated six months to protect Polish airspace. Pistorius called Rzeszow a key logistics hub for Ukraine and said he would personally ensure that the U.S.-made air defenses begin operating by the end of the month. The Rzeszow-Jasionka airport is located less than 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the Ukrainian border and transports a significant percentage of Western materiel bound for the front lines in Ukraine. It is also a main stopover point for foreign leadership traveling to Kyiv on official visits. Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said that the airport is also a key conduit for humanitarian support heading to Ukraine, adding that more than 90% of all allied aid flows through it. Currently, a NASAMS air defense system protects the airport, which is manned by Norwegian soldiers. Kyiv&apos;s European partners are growing optimistic that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will not pressure Ukraine into accepting a painful peace deal, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 14, citing undisclosed European officials. Following closed-door talks with Trump&apos;s team, the officials see a rising chance that the new U.S. leadership will seek to help Ukraine negotiate from the position of strength, the outlet wrote. Trump, returning to the White House on Jan. 20, initially caused concern among the pro-Kyiv coalition by his declared sympathies for Russian President Vladimir Putin and criticism of the Biden administration&apos;s military support for Ukraine. The president-elect has reportedly proved more flexible on the matter than expected. His team is particularly receptive to arguments about Russia&apos;s victory emboldening China and dealing the U.S. a humiliation similar to the Taliban&apos;s victory in Afghanistan in 2021, according to Bloomberg&apos;s sources. Trump has pledged to bring a swift end to the war but provided few details on how he plans to achieve this. A pitch leaked from his team &#x2014; freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2014; has already been rejected by Russia. There were other signals that Trump does not intend to cut the support for Ukraine completely as part of his plan to resolve the war. Speaking to the Time magazine, the president-elect said he would not &quot;abandon&quot; the besieged country, though criticizing the Biden administration for permitting long-range strikes on Russian soil. According to the Financial Times, Trump told the Europan allies he plans to continue supporting Ukraine while asking them to raise their defense spending levels to 5% of GDP. This echoes Trump&apos;s earlier appeals to Europe to take up greater responsibility both for Ukraine&apos;s defense and for their own security.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-targets-russian-industrial-plants-ammunition-depots-in-overnight-strike/	2025-01-14T12:12:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-14-at-12_47_35-PM.png
Seoul to consult with Kyiv on transfer of captured North Korean soldiers, Yonhap reports	Seoul plans to hold consultations with Kyiv regarding the transfer of captured North Korean soldiers if they request defection, Yonhap reported on Jan. 14, citing South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lee Jae-woong. President Volodymyr Zelensky recently announced the capture of two North Korean soldiers in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. &quot;Since North Korean soldiers are our citizens under the constitution, our government plans to have talks with Ukraine if they ask to defect to South Korea,&quot; Lee said. The South Korean constitution defines the entire Korean peninsula as its territory and considers all residents as citizens. However, neither of the captured soldiers has expressed a willingness to be transferred to South Korea, Lee added. Seoul remains in contact with Kyiv on matters related to the captured North Korean soldiers. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces against a Ukrainian incursion launched on Aug. 6. Ukrainian troops continue to operate in the region, leveraging their positions for potential future negotiations. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) estimates that North Korean casualties have reached 300 killed and 2,700 wounded, attributing the losses to inadequate training and ineffective counter-drone tactics. The NIS also reported that some North Korean soldiers have been forced to commit suicide to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby echoed these claims on Dec. 27, adding that captured North Korean troops fear severe retaliation against their families if they surrender.	https://kyivindependent.com/seoul-to-consult-with-kyiv-on-transfer-of-captured-north-korean-soldiers-yonhap-reports/	2025-01-14T12:09:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-11_13-23-35--3-.jpg
Biden leaves nearly $4 billion in US aid to Ukraine unused. What will happen to them under Trump?	U.S. President Joe Biden will be passing around $3.8 billion in the so-called Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) to his successor &#x2014; Donald Trump. On the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly criticized the Biden administration for providing Ukraine with military assistance, including through military shipments using the PDA. Countering Trump&apos;s rhetoric, the outgoing administration stated its desire to use the available funds to help Kyiv withstand the ongoing Russian offensive in the country&apos;s east. &quot;We are determined &#x2014; and it&apos;s fully my intent and the president&apos;s (Joe Biden) intent &#x2014; to spend every cent that we have available from the $61 billion that was authorized by Congress in the supplemental appropriation,&quot; U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at the end of 2024. The Kyiv Independent explains what the Presidential Drawdown Authority is, how it was used, and why the Biden administration failed to use up the funds provided to him by Congress. On Jan. 9, the outgoing president signed into force a military aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million. The aid package was said to be the last one before a new administration takes office on Jan. 20. The last tranche included missiles for air defense, air-to-ground munitions, armored bridging systems, as well as equipment to support Ukraine&apos;s use of F-16 fighter jets. The final aid package from the Biden administration was expected to be much larger, with nearly $4.3 billion in available funding open to the president&apos;s signing at the start of 2025.

(Saul Loeb / AFP via Getty Images)Despite the ongoing attempts to frame Biden&apos;s military aid shipments as a charity, the PDA doesn&apos;t involve actual funds being spent. The PDA allows Washington to supply Ukraine with military equipment from existing U.S. military stockpiles, considered to be surplus, which can begin arriving within days of approval. The sums showing up in White House reports are an estimated value of the equipment provided and shipped to the recipient country. Concerns over the fact that Biden&apos;s administration won&apos;t be able to provide the promised funding arose months prior. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the crucial foreign aid package, which included around $61 billion for Ukraine, in April 2024. The bill was first introduced in October 2023, yet was delayed for months due to political infighting in the lower chamber of the U.S. Congress. Following Trump&apos;s election victory, the Biden administration rushed military aid shipments to Ukraine. Soon, the U.S. aid packages to Kyiv shrank. The Pentagon has reached the limit of weapons it can send to Ukraine monthly without affecting its own combat capability and started facing logistical problems in delivering weapons, the Wall Street Journal reported in late November, citing unnamed U.S. officials. Pentagon spokesperson Major General Pat Ryder said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) published on Jan. 10 that Washington has to balance its own readiness needs, as well as look at what the U.S. do to support Ukraine. Asked again, a few days later, why the U.S. was unable to provide all the PDA authorization to Ukraine, Ryder dodged the question, adding that &quot;the authority will get passed to the next administration and it will be their call on whether they will choose to expend &#x2014; or employ that authority to expend those funds.&quot; &quot;It could be a simple political calculation to avoid leaving the Trump administration with a completely zero balance (in aid to Ukraine),&quot; Vladyslav Faraponov, the head of the Kyiv-based Institute of American Studies, told the Kyiv Independent.

(Rebecca Noble / Getty Images)Meanwhile, Daria Kaleniuk, co-founder of the Kyiv-based NGO Anti Corruption Action Center (ANTAC), said that Biden failed to fulfill his promise. She also blamed Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry for not being ready for such a scenario and not persuading the Pentagon to move forward with the promised aid. Kaleniuk told the Kyiv Independent that the ANTAC and other experts had warned the Defense Ministry that Washington would run out of time to spend all the money and that it lacked the necessary military hardware requested by Ukraine, primarily air defense systems and missiles. Kaleniuk suggested that the remaining U.S. funds could have been redirected to other arms assistance programs in case of better cooperation. Kyiv could also expand the list of weapons priorities to include lower-priority equipment that might still be available in stockpiles, she added. &quot;By the time we realized, it was too late,&quot; Kaleniuk said. The Kyiv Independent sent a request for comments to Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry but has not received a response at the time of publication. The remaining PDA funds are now at Trump&apos;s disposal. &quot;It&apos;s really up to the incoming administration to decide what they use &#x2014; what they decide to do with the remaining authority that&apos;s left,&quot; Pentagon&apos;s deputy spokesperson Sabrina Singh said on Jan. 8. When asked if the Biden administration is concerned about remaining funds and if there is a danger of a lag, she answered that Ukraine has &quot;strong&quot; bipartisan support within Congress. Under the Biden administration, the U.S. has committed over $66.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, the Pentagon said. Washington also provides Ukraine with aid through the USAI (Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative), a Pentagon-led program that supplies arms to Ukraine through contracts with U.S. defense companies. Another program, Foreign Military Financing (FMF), enables Ukraine to purchase weapons and munitions from U.S. defense companies. Under Biden&apos;s administration, Ukraine was provided with the long-awaited High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), Patriot air-defense systems, and Abrams battle tanks. But protracted decision-making on the provision of much-needed weapons, such as ATACMS long-range missiles and permission to use the provided missiles against targets deep inside Russia, slowed Ukraine&apos;s ability to fight back.

(Ozge Elif Kizil/Anadolu via Getty Images)The holdup on approving U.S. aid in 2024 led to the fall of the key eastern city of Avdiivka in Donetsk Oblast, followed by the loss of several other major towns in the region. Faraponov suggests that Trump will use the remaining money, but not immediately. Trump&apos;s administration may utilize it as leverage or as a bargaining chip in potential negotiations. &quot;The decision (to provide Ukraine with more aid) will be less popular with the Republican audience, in particular, who are generally skeptical of all international aid,&quot; he said. &quot;For the Trump administration, it is less risky in terms of reputation to transfer these remaining funds than to promote another aid package in Congress.&quot; Kaleniuk also believes that the remaining $3.8 billion may be used for Ukraine under the Trump administration. &quot;But the change of any administration implies a delay in decision-making. That is why we can get bogged down in their internal political struggle.	https://kyivindependent.com/nearly-4-billion-in-us-aid-to-ukraine-remained-unused-what-will-happen-to-them/	2025-01-14T12:07:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2188625792.jpg
Germany continues talks on $3 billion aid package for Ukraine, Pistorius says	The German government is still discussing a proposed 3 billion euros ($3.09 billion) aid package for Ukraine, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on Jan. 14, according to Ukrinform. Pistorius, who made an unannounced visit to Kyiv, met with Ukrainian officials to discuss defense industry cooperation, including boosting joint ventures and direct procurement of Ukrainian defense production with European funds. &quot;We have prepared everything we need, but we are still in the process of negotiations within the government because there is still the issue of funds that are not yet available because there is still no budget,&quot; Pistorius said. Pistorius assured that Germany&#x2019;s support for Ukraine would remain &quot;reliable, unwavering, committed, and energetic&quot; regardless of the outcome of Germany&#x2019;s Feb. 23 elections. On Jan. 9, Der Spiegel reported that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz blocked an additional military aid package, allegedly arguing that the 4 billion euros ($4.1 billion) already allocated for 2025, along with funds from a $50 billion G7 loan financed by frozen Russian assets, should suffice. Pistorius denied the report, stating that no final decision on the funding had been made. Germany, under Scholz&#x2019;s leadership, has become Ukraine&#x2019;s second-largest military donor after the U.S., though Scholz has faced criticism for his cautious stance on key issues, including his refusal to supply Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-government-continues-discussions-on-providing-ukraine-with-aid-worth-3-billion-pistorius-says/	2025-01-14T12:05:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/PistoriusRamstein.jpg
Transnistria head travels to Russia for talks amid energy crisis, Russian state media claims	Vadim Krasnoselsky, the head of Moldova&apos;s Russian-controlled region of Transnistria, held talks in Moscow regarding the region&#x2019;s energy crisis, Russian state news agency TASS claimed on Jan. 14, citing sources within Transnistria&apos;s administration. TASS did not specify whom Krasnoselsky met with during his visit. The crisis began when Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom halted gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1, citing alleged unpaid debts by Moldovagaz. The gas suspension has led to widespread power outages in Transnistria, pushing the region toward industrial collapse. Transnistrian authorities previously rejected an offer from Chisinau to help purchase gas via European platforms. While Moldova has transitioned to European energy supplies, Transnistria remains heavily reliant on Russian gas. Russian troops have been stationed in the region since the early 1990s. Gazprom&#x2019;s suspension coincided with the expiration of a deal allowing Russian gas to transit through Ukraine. However, Gazprom attributed the cutoff to Moldova&apos;s purported debt rather than transit issues. Moldovan officials dispute these claims, pointing to an international audit that failed to verify the alleged debt.	https://kyivindependent.com/transnistria-head-travels-to-russia-for-talks-amid-energy-crisis-russian-state-media-claims/	2025-01-14T10:56:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1235528511.jpg
Metinvest suspends operations at Pokrovsk coal mine amid security concerns	Metinvest, Ukraine&apos;s largest steel producer, has suspended operations at the Pokrovsk coking coal mine in Donetsk Oblast due to worsening security conditions and power outages, the company announced on Jan. 14. Located 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of Pokrovsk, the mine is one of Eastern Europe&#x2019;s largest and Ukraine&#x2019;s sole producer of coking coal, a key component in steelmaking&#x2014;Ukraine&apos;s second-largest export after agriculture. The mine remains under Ukrainian control, and Metinvest is evacuating employees and their families. &quot;The suspension of operations is a necessary step to preserve lives during these challenging times. We believe in Ukraine&apos;s victory and are prepared to resume operations and rebuild Pokrovsk after the Russian invasion is repelled,&quot; said Metinvest CEO Yuriy Ryzhenkov. To sustain steel production at its plants in Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, Metinvest has developed a contingency plan. This includes sourcing coking coal from the U.S.-based United Coal Company, utilizing existing reserves, and securing additional supplies from third-party vendors. Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian forces, has been the focus of fierce fighting as Russia intensifies its offensive in Donetsk Oblast. Steel exports generated nearly $2 billion in the first eight months of 2024, with production projected to reach 7.5 million metric tons by year-end. Plans to increase output to over 10 million tons in 2025 are now threatened, as the loss of Pokrovsk could slash annual production to 2-3 million tons, according to Reuters.	https://kyivindependent.com/metinvest-suspends-operations-at-pokrovsk-coking-coal-mine-amid-security-concerns/	2025-01-14T10:11:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190947297.jpg
Ukraine denies transferring Air Force personnel to infantry amid troop shortages	The Ukrainian Air Force will transfer military personnel &quot;en masse&quot; to reinforce the Ground Forces&apos; combat brigades in early 2025, Ukrainska Pravda reported on Jan. 14, citing an undisclosed Air Force source. Facing an infantry shortage along the front lines, Ukraine has been forced to make difficult adjustments as Russia ramps up its offensive in Donetsk Oblast. According to Ukrainska Pravda, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order on Jan. 11 to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units. A senior Air Force officer, speaking anonymously, said transfers began in spring 2024 and have now reached a &quot;critical level,&quot; with unit staffing dropping to 50%. &quot;If we carry out the order of the 11th, which was sent to us by the commander-in-chief, the manning of units will drop to 40%&quot; the officer told Ukrainska Pravda. They added that even transferring &quot;unimportant personnel&quot; weakens unit effectiveness, particularly for anti-aircraft missile systems, which rely on cohesive teams. Over 200 personnel are reportedly set to be taken from seven Air Force brigades, including units defending Kyiv, Ukrainska Pravda reported, citing an undisclosed source. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. In a Jan. 14 statement, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces denied transferring Air Force engineering and aviation personnel to infantry units, emphasizing that technical and flight personnel numbers are increasing. However, some Air Force and other branch personnel, after training, are being reassigned to strengthen ground brigades due to a critical infantry shortage. The General Staff noted this as a necessary measure to bolster frontline defense but confirmed that specialists in high-tech roles or those trained abroad on foreign equipment are exempt from transfers.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-denies-transferring-key-air-force-specialists-to-infantry-amid-troop-shortages/	2025-01-14T08:15:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2181306801.jpg
Equipping troops takes priority over lowering draft age, Zelensky says	Ukraine&apos;s immediate focus is on adequately equipping its military, rather than further reducing the draft age, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 14, according to Interfax-Ukraine. &quot;When we talk about increasing the number of our people (in the military), we must first address the issue of adequately equipping our brigades. Our partners have all these requests,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky noted that Ukraine fields over 100 brigades, all requiring sustained staffing and consistent resupply of equipment to maintain their combat effectiveness. The remarks follow reports that U.S. lawmakers and NATO allies are urging Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 to address manpower shortages. U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration has reportedly advocated for the move as part of broader efforts to address Ukraine&apos;s personnel needs at the full-scale war with Russia stretches into its third year. However, Kyiv has resisted the proposal, citing concerns over equipment shortages and the economic impact of drafting younger workers. Under martial law, men aged 18 to 60 are prohibited from leaving Ukraine, but only those aged 25 and older are eligible for the draft. The Ukrainian government lowered the draft age from 27 to 25 in April 2024, adding 50,000 troops to its forces. While the measure bolstered numbers, it fell short of meeting the military&#x2019;s full requirements.	https://kyivindependent.com/equipping-troops-takes-priority-over-lowering-draft-age-zelensky-says/	2025-01-14T07:22:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187689001.jpg
NATO launches Baltic Sea naval operation after undersea infrastructure sabotage	Eight NATO member states bordering the Baltic Sea unveiled a coordinated action plan on Jan. 14 to address risks to underwater infrastructure following recent cases of suspected sabotage. The declaration follows the Dec. 25 sabotage of four telecommunication cables and one power cable in the Baltic Sea, with Finnish authorities suspecting the involvement of the Russian &quot;shadow fleet&quot; vessel Eagle S. The plan was announced after a summit co-organized by Finland and Estonia, which included leaders from Denmark, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Sweden. The summit welcomed NATO&#x2019;s &quot;Baltic Sentry&quot; mission, aimed at monitoring, deterring, and responding to potential threats. Up to 10 NATO vessels will patrol the Baltic Sea until April, enhancing situational awareness and protecting critical undersea infrastructure. The leaders pledged to deter, detect, and respond robustly to any attempts at sabotage, emphasizing that hostile actions would be attributed and countered as appropriate. &quot;We are determined to attribute and counter any actions threatening our infrastructure. Any attack will be met with a robust and determined response,&quot; the statement read. NATO&#x2019;s Maritime Center for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure, established in May, will lead efforts to deploy innovative surveillance technologies and develop rapid response mechanisms for repairing damaged infrastructure. The leaders expressed concern over Russia&apos;s so-called shadow fleet, tankers allegedly used for sanction evasion and espionage, which also threaten maritime security. &quot;We reserve our rights, in accordance with international law, to take action against any vessels circumventing sanctions and threatening security, infrastructure, and the environment,&quot; the statement said. A Memorandum of Understanding on Critical Infrastructure Protection will be prepared to coordinate joint efforts. The leaders also agreed to enhance network resilience and readiness for rapid repairs. The Baltic Sea region has witnessed growing concerns over Russian sabotage since Western nations began supporting Ukraine following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Recent incidents, including suspicious activity by Russian-registered vessels near Denmark and Sweden, have heightened tensions. The summit highlights NATO&#x2019;s commitment to safeguarding the Baltic Sea amid escalating challenges posed by Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/baltic-nato-states-unite-in-response-to-underwater-sabotage-including-russian-vessel-involvement/	2025-01-14T06:07:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1238924684--1-.jpg
Germany to deploy Patriot at Poland's key hub for Ukraine aid by end of January	Germany will deploy the promised Patriot air defenses around the Polish airport of Rzeszow by the end of January, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said during his visit to Warsaw on Jan. 13. Monitoring group German Aid to Ukraine wrote earlier that two MIM-104 Patriot fire units and a total of 200 Bundeswehr soldiers will be deployed to Poland for an estimated six months to protect Polish airspace. Pistorius called Rzeszow a key logistics hub for Ukraine and said he would personally ensure that the U.S.-made air defenses begin operating by the end of the month. The Rzeszow-Jasionka airport is located less than 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the Ukrainian border and transports a significant percentage of Western materiel bound for the front lines in Ukraine. It is also a main stopover point for foreign leadership traveling to Kyiv on official visits. Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said that the airport is also a key conduit for humanitarian support heading to Ukraine, adding that more than 90% of all allied aid flows through it. Currently, a NASAMS air defense system protects the airport, which is manned by Norwegian soldiers.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-to-deploy-patriot-near-polish-hub-for-ukraine-aid/	2025-01-14T05:54:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-524224272.jpg
Ukraine targets Russia's industrial plants, ammunition depots in 'massive' strike overnight	Ukraine launched its &quot;most massive&quot; attack against Russian military and industrial facilities in a range of up to 1,100 kilometers (620 miles) overnight on Jan. 14, the General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces reported. Chemical plants, refineries, and the Engels airbase&apos;s ammunition depots were successfully targeted, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The SBU, together with the Defense Forces, continues to strike enemy military facilities and enterprises supporting Russia&#x2019;s military-industrial complex. Each hit &#x2014; whether on ammunition depots, refineries, oil depots, or chemical plants &#x2014; weakens Russia&#x2019;s capacity to wage war in Ukraine,&quot; an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. Ukrainian drones reportedly targeted multiple regions, including Saratov, Voronezh, and Orel oblasts, as well as Tatarstan. The Russian Defense Ministry did not specify the number of drones involved. Dmitry Milyaev, the governor of Russia&apos;s Tula region, described a &quot;massive drone attack&quot; in a Telegram post, claiming at least 17 drones were launched. In Aleksin, debris from a downed drone reportedly damaged vehicles and outbuildings, with no casualties reported. The SBU source indicated the Aleksino chemical plant &#x2014; producing gunpowder and ammunition for the Russian military &#x2014; was successfully hit, igniting a large fire. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage that purports to show an attack on Tula Region, Russia, overnight on Jan. 14, 2024. (Baza/Telegram)In Saratov and Engels, Governor Roman Busargin confirmed damage at two industrial facilities following drone strikes. The General Staff said that the Kristal oil facility in Engels, which burned for five days after an earlier strike on Jan. 8, was again successfully targeted. The Engels airfield, located in Saratov Oblast over 750 kilometers (460 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s nearest controlled territory, allegedly sustained hits to ammunition depots containing FAB glide bombs, KAB bombs, and cruise missiles. The Saratov oil refinery was also reportedly engulfed in a fire. Engels hosts three types of Russian strategic bombers &#x2014; the Tupolev Tu-95, Tu-22, and Tu-160 &#x2014; all frequently used to launch missile strikes on Ukrainian cities. Mikhail Isayev, the acting head of the Engels district, announced that schools in the city would transition to remote learning due to the continued threat of drone strikes. Explosions were reported in the town of Seltso near Bryansk, where the chemical plant reportedly was hit, according to the Russian opposition Telegram channel Astra. Ukraine&#x2019;s Unmanned Systems Forces confirmed the strike, saying that the plant produces gunpowder, explosives, and missile fuel components, including ammunition for barrel artillery, multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), aircraft, and Kh-59 cruise missiles. It also carries out overhauls of Grad, Uragan, and Tornado-G MLRS. The unit reported that the drones distracted Russian air defense, paving the way for missiles to hit the main targets. Following the missile strike, long-range drones allegedly destroyed substations and other critical infrastructure. In Tatarstan&#x2019;s capital, Kazan, a fuel facility was struck in the early hours of Jan. 14, igniting a gas tank. The fire occurred about 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Tatarstan Republic head Rustam Minnikhanov confirmed that a fire broke out in the city as a result of the drone strike but claimed that it resulted in no significant damage. &quot;I went to the scene of a fire that occurred as a result of the drone attack. Emergency services quickly arrived at the scene to extinguish the fire. I heard reports that there were no casualties or serious damage,&quot; Minnikhanov wrote on his Telegram channel. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage that purports to show a fire rising in Kazan, Tatarstan Republic, Russia, after a drone attack overnight on Jan. 14, 2024. (Mash/Telegram)The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. Ukrainian forces have increasingly targeted Russia&#x2019;s oil industry, ammunition depots, and military airfields, aiming to disrupt supply chains critical to Russia&#x2019;s war efforts. Fossil fuel exports remain a major revenue stream for the Kremlin&#x2019;s military operations. These attacks are part of Ukraine&#x2019;s ongoing efforts to undermine Russia&#x2019;s ability to sustain its full-scale invasion, striking deep into Russian territory, including regions far from the front lines.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-chemical-plants-refineries-warehouses-in-russia/	2025-01-14T05:33:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/WhatsApp-Image-2025-01-14-at-12_20_10_f5c6c958.jpg
Russian FSB officer found dead in Moscow Defense Ministry building, media reports	Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) counterintelligence officer Vladimir Feshchenko was found dead in a Russian Defense Ministry building in Moscow, Russian state-owned outlet RIA Novosti reported on Jan. 14. Preliminary information suggests he was murdered, an undisclosed source told the news agency. The pro-Kremlin Telegram channel Baza also described the death as violent, citing a deep wound in Feshchenko&#x2019;s forehead. The body was discovered in a building on Olkhovskaya Street, which houses the Russian Defense Ministry and the FSB Office for the Moscow Military District. While Baza identified Feshchenko as a Russian weightlifting champion and international master of sports, his status as an FSB officer was not indicated. The Vchk-Ogpu Telegram channel, known for connections to Russian security forces, confirmed his affiliation with the FSB. According to Vchk-Ogpu, Feshchenko was allegedly killed during a conflict with a friend with whom he had previously served in the Far East. The suspect, reportedly detained, has pleaded guilty to the murder. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The Russian Justice Ministry has designated Vchk-Ogpu as a &quot;foreign agent,&quot; accusing the Telegram channel of spreading allegedly false information about government decisions and creating a negative image of the Russian military. The FSB has gained notoriety for suppressing dissent, targeting activists, independent journalists, and pro-democracy movements. President Vladimir Putin has also tasked the agency with locating Russian nationals fighting for Ukraine&#x2019;s military or pro-Kyiv militias. Feshchenko&#x2019;s death highlights mounting internal tensions within Russia&#x2019;s security and military institutions amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-fsb-officer-found-with-fatal-head-wound-in-moscow-defense-ministry-building-media-reports/	2025-01-14T04:57:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1249616715--1-.jpg
Biden's aides warned Putin against Russia's plot to smuggle incendiary devices onto cargo planes, NYT reports	Outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s team delivered a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin to put an end to Russian intelligence&apos;s suspected plans to smuggle incendiary devices onto U.S.-bound cargo planes, The New York Times reported on Jan. 14, citing unnamed sources. Moscow has been suspected of being behind incidents in July 2024 that saw several parcels sent by individuals catch fire in warehouses in Germany and the U.K. The fires could have resulted in plane crashes if they had happened during the flight. The U.S. media wrote that these operations were intended as preparations for similar plots targeting the U.S. and Canada, which reportedly alarmed White House officials. U.S. intelligence obtained conversations in August 2024 between Russian secret service officers discussing details of the plan. The White House, uncertain whether the Russian leader knew about the plan, warned Putin through back-channel communication to stop the operation, the outlet wrote. At least five high-ranking Russian officials, including foreign intelligence chief Sergey Naryshkin, FSB head Alexander Bortnikov, and presidential advisor Yuriy Ushakov, were contacted to ensure Putin received the Biden administration&#x2019;s warning. The article does not reveal the details or nature of this warning. Russia has long engaged in a variety of disruptive behavior toward Europe, also using its cyber capabilities to target civilian infrastructure. Moscow is responsible for 80% of all the foreign influence operations in Europe, Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said at a conference in Prague in October 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/bidens-aides-sent-warnings-to-putin-not-to-send-incendiary-parcels-with-cargo-planes-nyt-reports/	2025-01-14T04:49:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184603402.jpg
Australia making 'urgent inquiries' after reports of volunteer fighter's execution in Russian captivity	Canberra is making &quot;urgent inquiries&quot; about the status of Australian citizen Oscar Jenkins, a volunteer soldier captured by Russia while fighting for &#xA0;Ukraine, after reports of his death, the 7News outlet wrote on Jan. 14. Undisclosed sources in Ukraine told 7News that the body of Jenkins, a 32-year-old teacher from Melbourne whose capture was reported in December, has been found. He is believed to have been executed by his Russian captors. Australian officials are yet to confirm Jenkins&apos; death, while Australia&apos;s Foreign Ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador to &quot;seek information&quot; and urge Moscow to comply with international law. 7News reported &quot;speculations&quot; that Jenkins&apos; body has been found but is yet to be officially identified, without providing details on the circumstances of the body&apos;s discovery. Ukrainian authorities are said to be working to verify the reports. The Kyiv Independent has contacted the Australian Embassy in Kyiv and the Ukrainian authorities but has not received a response as of publication. The Geneva Conventions mandate all warring parties to treat prisoners of war (POW) with respect and dignity, while executing POWs is considered a gross violation of international law and a war crime. Russia has been repeatedly accused of summarily executing Ukrainian POWs throughout the war. Moscow calls foreign volunteers &quot;mercenaries&quot; and claims they are not entitled to protection under the Geneva Conventions. A spokesperson of the Australian Foreign Ministry told the local media that the government has &quot;grave concerns for Mr Jenkins&apos;s welfare.&quot; If confirmed, this would be the first Australian volunteer fighter executed in Russian captivity during the full-scale war. At least six other Australians are believed to have been killed while fighting on Ukraine&apos;s side. In a video that emerged on Russian Telegram channels in late December, Jenkins is seen in military fatigues, interrogated by Russian captors. The man behind the camera asks the captive about his name and background and whether he wants to live while beating him over the head.

Unlike most other foreigners volunteering to join Ukraine&apos;s resistance against Russia, Jenkins has had no military experience.

Will Transnistria's gas crisis lead to its collapse and reintegration into Moldova?	By halting natural gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1, Russia created an unprecedented economic crisis in the Russian-occupied part of the country &#x2014; Transnistria. The crisis prompted a question: will the breakaway region, occupied by Russia since 1992, survive without Russian gas? Free-of-charge Russian gas had been the backbone of Transnistria&apos;s economy and ensured the preservation of the breakaway region and its de facto independence from Moldova. Some argue that the gas crisis may lead to Transnistria&apos;s political collapse and reintegration into Moldova, dealing a blow to Russia&apos;s regional influence. But analysts say that Transnistria&apos;s reintegration is unlikely since it would be too difficult for Moldova to achieve, could provoke Russian aggression against Chisinau or destabilize Moldova by increasing the share of pro-Russian voters. They argue that Moldova has not taken any steps in that direction intentionally. &quot;There are far too many forces and actors in the Republic of Moldova with whose help the Russian Federation will try to prevent a possible effort to reunify the country and reintegrate Transnistria,&quot; Ion Manole, head of Moldovan think-tank Promo-LEX, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The goal of this crisis is to destabilize the Republic of Moldova and bring it under Russia&apos;s total control, and by no means to lose control over the Transnistrian region.&quot; A more likely scenario is that Russia will use the ongoing gas and electricity crisis to destabilize Moldova itself and try to bring pro-Russian parties back into power in the upcoming parliamentary elections set to be held in the second half of 2025. Chisinau has not been buying Russian gas since 2022, but Russian-occupied Transnistria continued to get its gas from Russia until Jan. 1, 2025. The halt in gas deliveries was due to Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit, including supplies to Moldova, and Moldova&apos;s debt for gas supplies. Transnistria had been effectively acquiring gas free of charge &#x2014; a political tool that Russia used to keep the region under its control. The breakaway region&apos;s debt for Russian gas amounts to more than $10 billion, according to Moldovagaz, a subsidiary of Russian gas giant Gazprom. Chisinau&apos;s separate debt for Russian gas supplies totals $709 million, according to Gazprom. However, the Moldovan government recognizes only an $8.6 million debt, citing financial audits. Gazprom said on Dec. 28 it would stop its gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1 due to its debt. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Jan. 9 blamed Ukraine and Moldova for Transnistria&apos;s gas crisis. Some 1,500 high-rise buildings in Transnistria were without heating and hot water on Jan. 4, and nearly 72,000 homes remained without gas, Transnistria&apos;s unrecognized leader Vadim Krasnoselsky said.

(Valeria Mongelli / Bloomberg via Getty Images)The end of Russian gas supplies via Ukraine has also halted all industrial activity in Transnistria, Sergey Obolonik, the first deputy chairman of Transnistria&apos;s self-proclaimed government, said on Jan. 2. Despite the crisis, Transnistria has rejected Chisinau&apos;s offer to help the region purchase gas from Europe, Vadim Cheban, CEO of Moldovagaz, said on Jan. 3. Transnistria instead expects Russia&apos;s Gazprom to resume deliveries of natural gas, Cheban said. Russia is technically capable of supplying its gas through pipelines via Turkey, Bulgaria, and Romania to Transnistria, but such supplies would have to be approved by Chisinau. The non-occupied part of Moldova has also been affected by the crisis because it had previously bought electricity from Transnistria&apos;s Cuciurgan power station, which used Russian gas as fuel. As a result of the halt in gas supplies, electricity prices in Moldova are rising. Analysts say that the crisis is likely to cause discontent in Transnistria but, due to a lack of opposition, the crisis won&apos;t have any major political consequences inside the occupied region. &quot;No matter how dissatisfied the population may be, it will not lead to an increase in opposition ratings because, in essence, there is no real opposition in Transnistria,&quot; Serhiy Gerasimchuk, a Moldova and Romania expert at the Ukrainian Prism think-tank, told the Kyiv Independent. Anatoly Dirun, a political analyst from Transnistria currently based in Chisinau, also said that &quot;there is no political opposition or alternative political forces (in the breakaway region) that could criticize the current leadership.&quot; &quot;It is difficult to speak of any potential political changes at this point,&quot; he added. The energy crisis in Transnistria prompted speculation that the Russian-controlled entity&apos;s survival is at stake and that it may be forced to reintegrate into Moldova at some point in the future. &quot;The people in Transnistria are realizing that the so-called &apos;government&apos; in Tiraspol cannot ensure basic needs like heating, gas or electricity,&quot; Eugen Muravschi, an associated expert at Chisinau-based watchdogs WatchDog MD and CPR-Moldova, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Naturally, the question will arise &#x2014; what then is the point of this regime?&quot; He argued that the &quot;situation is a big blow to the credibility and legitimacy of the Tiraspol regime, but also to the narrative of Russia as a trustworthy protector.&quot; Manole told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;in the absence of a direct corridor (linking Russia and Transnistria), the possibilities of the Russian Federation to further control and influence the Republic of Moldova through the Transnistrian region have diminished since Russia&apos;s annexation of Crimea and virtually disappeared with the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.&quot; Women pose by decorations in Russian flag colors on Republic Day in Tiraspol, Transnistria, Moldova on Sept. 2, 2023. (Peter Dench / Getty Images)Despite that, analysts argue that Transnistria&apos;s reintegration into Moldova is unlikely. &quot;Questions related to reintegration are currently out of focus. In the short term, the crisis is unlikely to trigger any political change,&quot; Victoria Nemerenco, a program coordinator at Moldova&apos;s Institute for European Policies and Reforms, told the Kyiv Independent. Manole also said that Moldova is not ready &quot;to reintegrate Transnistria, because in the last 2-3 years Russia has taken care to reactivate another source of instability in the south of the Republic of Moldova (Gagauzia), while there are numerous groups in the country that openly support the Russian Federation and its efforts to occupy Ukraine and implicitly later the Republic of Moldova.&quot; The pro-Western government may be reluctant to reintegrate Transnistria because it would dramatically increase the share of pro-Russian voters in elections. &quot;In theory, these are suitable circumstances for kicking off the reintegration process,&quot; Muravschi said. &quot;The problem is that the authorities in Chisinau do not seem to have a plan in this regard &#x2014; they seem preoccupied only with managing the crisis, not turning it into an opportunity. In short, this crisis is shaking the Tiraspol regime, but it will not necessarily topple it without more initiative and assertiveness from the Moldovan government.&quot; Dirun also said that &quot;there are discussions among colleagues in Chisinau that this could lead to the collapse of (Transnistria), but this will not happen.&quot; One reason why Moldova&apos;s reintegration is unlikely is that it may lead to a Russian economic or even military attack. However, Russia will also face difficulties if it decides to launch an actual military operation. Jamie Shea, a defense and security analyst at Chatham House, told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;Russia is today fully engaged in eastern Ukraine and in trying to push Ukrainian forces out of the Kursk Oblast.&quot; &quot;So it would probably have to halt its operations at least for a period in order to invade and subsequently occupy Moldova, although this country is much smaller and with far less defensive capacity than Ukraine,&quot; he added. He also said that Russian troops currently deployed in Transnistria &quot;are not trained and equipped for offensive operations and would not be able to move against the rest of Moldova without significant reinforcements.&quot; Moldovan army recruits take a break at their camp in Bulboaca, Moldova, May 16, 2024.

Moldova is neither a NATO or EU member, but was granted EU candidate status in 2022. A major obstacle to EU accession, however, will be resolving the conflict with its breakaway Transnistria region, which has had a Russian military presence since 1992. (Will Baxter/Getty Images)Russia has a mere 1,700 troops in Transnistria, while Transnistria&apos;s army comprises about 7,500 troops. It would also be difficult for Russia to move troops to Moldova because it does not control any Ukrainian areas adjacent to the country, such as Odesa Oblast. &quot;Russia would also need to transport troops by air, and the transport planes could easily be shot down by Ukraine&apos;s air defense or over the Black Sea,&quot; Shea said. &quot;It would be a dangerous undertaking to move Russian ground forces and aircraft across Ukrainian territory in a wartime situation.&quot; He added that, instead of a direct invasion, Russia might &quot;use pro-Russian groups inside Moldova and Transnistria to destabilize the country and organize violence and disturbances.&quot; Muravschi also said that &quot;as long as Russia does not advance on the southern front in Ukraine and obtain a land bridge towards Transnistria, it would be very difficult for them to mount a military operation against Moldova.&quot; Analysts argue that, rather than using military force, Russia is more likely to use the gas and electricity crisis in Moldova to destabilize the political situation in the republic and help pro-Kremlin groups win the upcoming parliamentary election, which must be held in the second half of 2025. Moldovan authorities, independent observers, and officials from the EU and the U.S. have pointed to a malign influence campaign involving criminal networks and political groups tied to Russia. Moldovan lawmakers claimed that Moscow had spent millions of dollars to fund Alexandr Stoianoglo, a pro-Russian candidate who lost to pro-Western President Maia Sandu in the Nov. 3 presidential election. Simultaneously with the election, Moldova held a referendum on adding the country&apos;s aspiration to join the EU to its constitution, with 50.35% of the voters supporting the move and 49.65% voting against it. A majority of voters living in Moldova voted against Sandu and amending the constitution, and the narrow victories were achieved due to the support of Moldovans living abroad, who account for nearly 15% of all registered voters. &quot;Why would Moscow need (a military operation) now, if it can achieve an electoral victory and have Moldova fall into the Kremlin&apos;s hands?&quot; Gerasimchuk said.

(Daniel Mihailescu / AFP via Getty Images)He also said that Russia may &quot;choose a candidate capable of negotiating with Gazprom to restore gas supplies.&quot; &quot;Naturally, with promises of this kind, reinforced by unambiguous signals from Moscow, any politician or political force could gain the support of the socially vulnerable population and thus improve their results in the parliamentary elections,&quot; Gerasimchuk added. &quot;In such conditions, Moldova risks descending into governance chaos, where a weakened president will rely on an unstable parliament, which could lead to a prolonged socio-economic crisis,&quot; he added. &quot;In this situation, European integration will be off the table.&quot; Muravschi said that &quot;pro-Russian parties are claiming that this crisis is the result of the government&apos;s &apos;Russophobia&apos; and &quot;promise a secure supply of cheap energy from Russia if they come to power.&quot; He added that &quot;the popularity of the ruling pro-European party has been eroding for years now and the energy crisis is not helping them.&quot; &quot;At the moment, it seems impossible for Maia Sandu&apos;s party to retain a parliamentary majority by themselves at the next election,&quot; Muravschi said. &quot;Russia&apos;s goal is clearly to destabilize the situation in Moldova, undermine the government, and help pro-Russian parties win the parliamentary election.&quot; Nemerenco also said that &quot;energy dependence has historically been one of Russia&apos;s key tools for exerting pressure, and the current crisis offers Moscow an opportunity to exploit Moldova&apos;s vulnerabilities.&quot; &quot;Rising energy prices and supply insecurity could directly affect household incomes and living standards, increasing public frustration; and the president, as well as the pro-European government, could thus become vulnerable to blame, even if the crisis stems from external factors,&quot; she said.	https://kyivindependent.com/will-transnistrias-gas-crisis-lead-to-its-collapse-and-reintegration-into-moldova/	2025-01-14T04:02:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-2043797379.jpg
65 oil tankers drop anchor after latest US sanctions against Russia, Reuters reports	Sixty-five oil tankers paused operations in various places around the world following the recent U.S.-U.K. sanctions against Russia&#x2019;s oil industry and shadow fleet, Reuters reported on Jan. 13, citing maritime tracking data. According to the news agency, five of those tankers were anchoring off China and Singapore, while others were idling in the Baltic Sea and near Russia&apos;s Far East. The latest sanctions targeted more than 180 oil-carrying vessels of Russia&apos;s so-called shadow fleet, a group of aging tankers routinely used for sanction evasion. Several of these vessels are also reportedly involved in transporting sanctioned Iranian oil. Experts cited by Reuters said the latest measures drove up prices of tankers as demand for non-sanctioned vessels grew. The recent sanctions also targeted two of Russia&apos;s major oil producers, Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz, along with dozens of their subsidiaries. Combined, these companies reportedly produce over 1 million barrels of oil daily, generating an estimated $23 billion of revenue annually, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The sanctions also extend to dozens of Russian energy officials and corporate executives, further tightening restrictions on Moscow&apos;s oil industry.	https://kyivindependent.com/65-oil-tankers-drop-anchor-after-latest-us-sanctions-against-russia-reuters-reports/	2025-01-14T03:00:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1822474446.jpg
European allies grow optimistic about Trump not abandoning Ukraine, Bloomberg reports	Kyiv&apos;s European partners are growing optimistic that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will not pressure Ukraine into accepting a painful peace deal, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 14, citing undisclosed European officials. Following closed-door talks with Trump&apos;s team, the officials see a rising chance that the new U.S. leadership will seek to help Ukraine negotiate from the position of strength, the outlet wrote. Trump, returning to the White House on Jan. 20, initially caused concern among the pro-Kyiv coalition by his declared sympathies for Russian President Vladimir Putin and criticism of the Biden administration&apos;s military support for Ukraine. The president-elect has reportedly proved more flexible on the matter than expected. His team is particularly receptive to arguments about Russia&apos;s victory emboldening China and dealing the U.S. a humiliation similar to the Taliban&apos;s victory in Afghanistan in 2021, according to Bloomberg&apos;s sources. Trump has pledged to bring a swift end to the war but provided few details on how he plans to achieve this. A pitch leaked from his team &#x2014; freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2014; has already been rejected by Russia. There were other signals that Trump does not intend to cut the support for Ukraine completely as part of his plan to resolve the war. Speaking to the Time magazine, the president-elect said he would not &quot;abandon&quot; the besieged country, though criticizing the Biden administration for permitting long-range strikes on Russian soil. According to the Financial Times, Trump told the Europan allies he plans to continue supporting Ukraine while asking them to raise their defense spending levels to 5% of GDP. This echoes Trump&apos;s earlier appeals to Europe to take up greater responsibility both for Ukraine&apos;s defense and for their own security.	https://kyivindependent.com/european-allies-grow-optimistic-about-trump-not-abandoning-ukraine-bloomberg-reports/	2025-01-14T02:40:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/2024-12-10-19_27_27.jpg
Ukraine targets Russia's Engels airbase in 'multi-day, comprehensive operation,' drone forces report	Ukraine has targeted Russia&apos;s Engels airbase in a &quot;multi-day, comprehensive operation,&quot; Kyiv&apos;s 14th Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Regiment reported on Jan. 14. In a post on Facebook, the regiment &#x2014; part of Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces &#x2014; said the attacks were to &quot;reduce the enemy&apos;s strategic aviation capabilities,&quot; and had struck aviation fuel tanks used to supply Russian long-range bomber aircraft. &quot;We are doing our best to ensure that Engels fire crews, who have just put out the flames after the previous attack, are not left without work in the face of the increasingly difficult economic situation in Russia,&quot; it said. Earlier on Jan. 14, Russian local authorities reported an overnight drone attack had damaged an industrial facility in the city of Engels, located in Russia&apos;s Saratov Oblast, following a previous attack overnight on Jan. 8 which targeted the Kristal Plant used to supply fuel to Engels. They released no further details of what was hit on Jan. 14, but the 14th Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Regiment later claimed it had &quot;struck the infrastructure of (Engels airbase).&quot; It did not specify what type of weapon was used in the attack. A source in Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) later on Jan. 14 told the Kyiv Independent the attack had struck ammunition warehouses at the airbase storing cruise missiles and glide bombs. The SBU source added it was part of a wider operation overnight that targeted several sites across Russia, including the Aleksinsky Chemical Plant in Tula Oblast, the Saratov oil refinery, and the Bryansk chemical plant. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. Several explosions were heard in the area, according to local reports from Russian Telegram channels. Located in the Saratov Oblast, over 750 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, Engels airbase &#x2013; also known as Engels-2 &#x2013; is home to the 184th Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment and 121st Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment. It was built in 1952 and has been in service since 1954. Engels is home to three types of Russian strategic bombers &#x2013; the Tupolev Tu-95, the Tupolev Tu-22, and the Tupolev Tu-160, all regularly used to launch missiles at Ukrainian cities. The Tu-95 is the older of the three aircraft, a Soviet-era plane that made its first flight in 1952. It was originally used to carry nuclear bombs but has since evolved to launch cruise missiles. Satellite imagery from Dec 3 &amp; 4, 2022, of Engels airbase, Russia (before reports of explosions at the base), showing recent military activity at &amp; near the airfield which houses a heavy bomber aviation unit, primarily comprised of Tu-95 (Bear) &amp; Tu-60 (Blackjack) bombers. (Maxar Technologies/Twitter)Each aircraft can carry 16 cruise missiles &#x2013; either the Kh-55/Kh-555 or the newer Kh-101 and Kh-102 air-launched cruise missiles. It features turboprop propellers rather than jet engines, as during the Cold War, their increased efficiency allowed it to fly all the way to the United States without refueling. The Tu-22 carries the Kh-22 missiles, which poses a particular problem for Ukraine. It is supersonic and travels at around 4,000 kilometers per hour. Currently, the missile can only be shot down with the U.S.-made Patriot air defense system and potentially the SAMP-T, a joint Italian-French system. The Tu-160 is Russia&apos;s more modern strategic bomber, entering service in 1987. To this day, it remains the largest operational bomber in the world. It can carry a total of 12 Kh-55 missiles and up to 24 Kh-15s. Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces were established to improve Ukraine&apos;s work with drones, form special drone-specific units, and improve the production, training, and innovation of unmanned vehicles. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks throughout the full-scale with Russia. The Ukrainian military has proven to be a pioneer in drone technology, using innovative ways to undermine Russia&apos;s material and numerical advantage. Aerial drones have been used to ram into Russian helicopters or drop molten metal on ground positions, while naval drones were a key component in upending Russia&apos;s dominance in the Black Sea. In turn, Russia has also widely deployed drone capabilities during the full-scale invasion, both on the battlefield and to attack Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-targets-russias-engels-airbase-in-multi-day-comprehensive-operation-drone-forces-report/	2025-01-14T02:39:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/FjOqRPzUYAwG8-F.jpeg
NATO chief says alliance either raises defense spending or can begin taking 'Russian language courses'	NATO should raise its current 2% of GDP defense spending goal, or the allies can begin taking &quot;Russian language courses or move to New Zealand,&quot; Secretary General Mark Rutte jokingly told the European Parliament on Jan. 13. Voices calling for higher defense spending across NATO grew louder after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. &quot;Everything I&apos;m seeing at this moment is not nearly enough, and if we don&apos;t do it (raise the spending targets) we are safe now but not in four or five years. So if you don&apos;t do it, get out your Russian language courses or go to New Zealand,&quot; Rutte said. &quot;Or decide now to spend more, and that&apos;s exactly the debate we have to finalize over the next three or four months, to stay safe in this part of the world.&quot; The secretary general did not specify a new target number during his address. On Dec. 12, the Financial Times reported that European NATO foreign ministers began discussing a plan to gradually increase the alliance&#x2019;s defense spending target from 2% of their GDP to 3% by 2030. According to the outlet&apos;s sources, the alliance&#x2019;s members would first increase their spending to 2.5% of GDP before reaching 3% by the start of the next decade. Incoming U.S. President Donald Trump called for an even more radical increase, up to 5% of GDP. Trump has criticized NATO member states that do not meet the current 2% of GDP spending target. Several NATO allies, including Italy, Canada, and Spain, do not meet the current target, though the number of allies that do rose to 24 in 2024. According to NATO estimates, Poland spent the greatest portion of its GDP on defense (4.12%) in 2024, followed by Estonia (3.43%) and the U.S. (3.38%). In the face of Russia&apos;s war, Ukraine has drastically increased defense spending. Kyiv will spend 26% of its GDP on defense spending in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-chief-says-alliance-either-raises-defense-spending-or-can-begin-taking-russian-language-courses/	2025-01-14T02:07:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2188184447.jpg
Fico will not visit Kyiv, Slovak lawmaker says	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico will not visit Kyiv to discuss the halting of Russian gas transit through Ukraine, Tibor Gaspar, deputy-speaker of the Slovak Parliament told Russian state-controlled news agency TASS on Jan. 14 during a visit in Moscow. A day earlier, Fico had proposed in an open letter a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Slovakia to discuss the gas transit issue. In a response posted on social media, Zelensky agreed to the meeting but insisted Fico &quot;come to Kyiv on Friday.&quot; &#x201C;Yesterday, Prime Minister Fico published an open letter for Zelensky and invited him for talks. Zelensky replied that it was necessary to come to Kyiv on Friday. It&apos;s not possible. I think it will not happen,&#x201D; Gaspar said. The development is the latest in an escalating conflict between Ukraine and Slovakia over Kyiv&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit. While the EU has made efforts to reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuels following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many countries, including Slovakia and Hungary, remain reliant on Russian gas. Fico estimated Slovakia&apos;s alleged losses from stopping Russian gas supplies via Ukraine at 500 million euros ($510 million) per year. Fico has threatened to cut off electricity supplies to Ukraine amid increasing blackouts due to Russian attacks targeting Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure, and also threatened to limit aid to Ukrainian refugees in Slovakia. Zelensky previously said that Ukraine had offered Slovakia assistance for the adaptation period, but &quot;Fico arrogantly refused.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-will-not-visit-kyiv-slovakian-lawmaker-says/	2025-01-14T01:48:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192475502.jpg

The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify what caused the fire at the plant. Videos posted across different channels show a big fire at an industrial site. According to eyewitnesses, drones were heard flying over the village of Osinovo, and then an explosion was heard near the plant. Local authorities have not disclosed further details about the targeted site. Russia reported a large-scale Ukrainian drone attack across multiple regions overnight, with an industrial facility also purportedly set on fire in Saratov Oblast. Kazanorgsintez&#x2019;s plant produces pyrolysis, polyethylene, and polycarbonate. Ukraine has been targeting Russian plants critical for its war efforts against Ukraine, prioritizing factories related to the oil and chemical industry on its target list.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-reportedly-attack-russian-chemical-plant-in-tatarstan/	2025-01-13T23:48:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Picture1-1.png
Trump wants to meet Putin 'very quickly' after inauguration	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Jan. 13 that he plans to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;very quickly,&quot; adding that the Russian leader &quot;wants to meet&quot; as well. The incoming U.S. president echoed his previous comments on his intent to meet the Russian leader and hammer out a deal to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war, which nears its third anniversary. Trump initially declared during his presidential campaign he would end the war within 24 hours, though he recently extended this timeline to up to six months. Talking to Newsmax, Trump said that Putin wants to meet as the war &quot;hasn&apos;t gone so well for him either.&quot; &quot;I know he wants to meet, and I&apos;m gonna meet (him) very quickly,&quot; the president-elect said, adding that the meeting has to take place after his inauguration. Trump also noted that Ukraine is &quot;being decimated&quot; while both Russian and Ukrainian soldiers &quot;are being killed in large numbers.&quot; The Kremlin has already signaled Putin&apos;s willingness to meet Trump after he takes office, though no firm date has been set. Switzerland and Serbia said they are open to hosting an in-person meeting between the two leaders. According to Trump&apos;s incoming national security advisor, Mike Waltz, the president-elect and Putin are also expected to hold a telephone call &quot;in the coming days and weeks.&quot; Trump has often voiced sympathies for the Russian leader while criticizing the level of support the outgoing Biden administration threw behind Kyiv. This prompted concerns that the new U.S. leadership might cut a deal unfavorable to Ukraine. &#xA0; Trump&apos;s incoming peace envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said that the president-elect&apos;s aim is not to &quot;give something to Putin or the Russians&quot; but to &quot;save Ukraine and save their sovereignty.&quot; Trump said that specific peace proposals are still being worked out. A pitch leaked from his team &#x2014; freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2014; has already been rejected by Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-wants-to-meet-putin-very-quickly-after-inauguration/	2025-01-13T23:13:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192846806.jpg

Oil tanker crew planned more cable sabotage before capture, Finland says	Finnish investigators say the crew of an oil tanker accused of damaging undersea power and communication cables in the Baltic Sea were preparing to cut additional infrastructure before authorities intervened, according to Reuters. Last month, Finnish authorities boarded an oil tanker Eagle S, allegedly part of Moscow&#x2019;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; Since Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Baltic Sea region has faced numerous disruptions to power cables, telecom links, and gas pipelines. NATO member states surrounding the Baltic Sea are scheduled to meet in Helsinki on Jan. 14 to discuss collective measures against such threats. The Eagle S allegedly caused damage to the Estlink 2 power line and four telecommunications cables between Finland and Estonia by dragging its anchor over 100 kilometers along the seabed. Risto Lohi, head of the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation, said the ship was also at risk of damaging the Estlink 1 power line and the BalticConnector gas pipeline when authorities took action. &quot;There would have been an almost immediate danger that other cables or pipes related to our critical underwater infrastructure could have been damaged,&quot; Lohi said. Authorities are investigating nine of the ship&#x2019;s crew members, including the Georgian captain and sailors from India and Georgia. In a separate incident, Baltic Sea nations suspect the Chinese bulk carrier Yi Peng 3 of dragging its anchor to sever two undersea fiber-optic cables in November. Sweden&apos;s Civil Defense Minister, Carl-Oskar Bohlin, stated that evidence of anchor damage linked to the Yi Peng 3 was also found near the NordBalt power cable, which connects Sweden and Lithuania. &quot;This obviously illustrates the seriousness of the situation we find ourselves in,&quot; Bohlin reprotedly said.	https://kyivindependent.com/oil-tanker-crew-planned-more-cable-sabotage-before-capture-finland-says/	2025-01-13T19:38:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167101990.jpg
Drones target Russia's Tula region, local media says	Explosions were heard overnight on Jan. 14 in the city of Aleksin, Tula Oblast in an alleged mass drone attack, local media reported. Residents heard at least 10 explosions in different parts if the city. Local Governor Dmitry Milyaev claimed there were no casualties. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Hours earlier a chemical plant in Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast was reportedly damaged in an aerial attack on the eve of Jan. 13. Aleksin is located some 129.5 kilometers (80.5 miles) from Moscow, indicating increased strikes deeper into Russian territory. Ukraine regularly strikes military targets inside Russian territory in an attempt to reduce Russia&apos;s capability to wage war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-target-tula-oblast-media-says/	2025-01-13T17:57:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1249556007.jpg
Macron, Zelensky discuss 'practical steps' for deploying peacekeeping troops in Ukraine	President Volodymyr Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron discussed the situation on the front line and the possibility of sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine in a phone call on Jan. 13. The idea of deploying a peacekeeping force on the ground in Ukraine has gained traction in recent months as European nations prepare to play a greater role in Kyiv&apos;s defense once U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. &#xA0; &quot;(W)e discussed the French initiative to deploy military contingents in Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said following the call. &quot;We considered practical steps for its implementation, possible expansion, and involvement of other countries in this process.&quot; Macron has put forth the idea of sending troops to Ukraine in some capacity since February 2024. With Zelensky and Macron &#xA0;previously discussed the possibility of a peacekeeping force in a meeting on Dec. 18. In their trilateral meeting with Trump in Paris on Dec. 7, Trump reportedly said he wants European troops to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer also plans to visit Ukraine in the coming weeks to discuss the potential deployment of an international peacekeeping force, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 10. Zelensky and Macron agreed to meet in the near future to further discuss plans to achieve security guarantees, including the possible deployment of peacekeepers. The two leaders also discussed the situation in Kursk Oblast, amid a renewed offensive by Ukrainian forces in the region. Zelensky highlighted Ukraine&apos;s current air defense priorities and ongoing need for high-precision long-range weapons.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-zelensky-discuss-kursk-oblast-peacekeepers/	2025-01-13T16:13:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2155833496.jpg
Putin has failed to meet any of his strategic objectives in Ukraine, Biden says	Russian President Vladimir Putin has failed to meet any of his strategic objectives in Ukraine, U.S. President Joe Biden said at a foreign policy address on Jan. 13. Biden&apos;s remarks come as his term as president comes to an end and Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine nears its third year. Biden reflected on his foreign policy record, including his role in Ukraine&apos;s fight against Russia, one week before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office on Jan. 20. The president defending his administration&apos;s policies and said they prevented Putin from reaching his goals. &quot;When Putin invaded Ukraine, he thought he&apos;d conquer Kyiv in a matter of days,&quot; Biden said. &quot;The truth is, since that war began I&apos;m the only one that stood in the center of Kyiv, not him, Putin never has.&quot; Biden visited Kyiv in February 2023, becoming the only U.S. commander-in-chief to visit a war zone not controlled by U.S. forces. &quot;Putin has failed to achieve any of his strategic objectives,&quot; Biden said. &quot;He has failed thus far to subjugate Ukraine, failed to break the unity of NATO, and failed to make large territorial gains. There is more to do, we can&apos;t walk away.&quot; Biden praised Washington&apos;s coalition-building and readiness to provide military aid, saying the U.S. brought together 50 nations to stand with Ukraine and delivered &quot;massive numbers of munitions&quot; and other crucial assistance to Kyiv. The address also touched on the effectiveness of U.S. sanctions in weakening Russia&apos;s economy. The U.S. has &quot;enacted relentless unprecedented sanctions to keep Ukraine in the fight ... Russia is struggling to replace what they are losing on the battlefield in terms of military equipment and fighters and the ruble is under enormous pressure,&quot; Biden said. Biden echoed earlier remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who said on Jan. 12 that the White House was preparing a strong Ukraine policy foundation to hand off to the incoming Trump administration. &quot;(W)e laid the foundation for the next administration so they can protect the bright future of the Ukrainian people,&quot; Biden said. Trump has previously criticized U.S. military support for Ukraine and promised to negotiate an end to the war. He is reportedly in the process of planning an in-person meeting with Putin, set to take place at an unspecified time after his inauguration. Biden has urged the U.S. congress to continue sending aid to Ukraine even if Trump is opposed to further assistance. In a speech on Jan. 10, Biden said he did everything he could to help Ukraine during his time in office.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-and-allies-cant-walk-away-from-ukraine-biden-says/	2025-01-13T14:32:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Biden.png
Zelensky announces new sanctions on Russian financial sector	President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree on Jan. 13 imposing new sanctions on the Russian financial sector. Since the launch of full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine has been expanding its list of sanctions against individuals and enterprises that support Russia&apos;s war. The sanctions target 140 distinct entitites, Zelensky said in his evening address. Along with the decree, the president also signed a draft law introducing criminal penalties for attempts to evade sanctions. The proposed law is based on international standards for enforcing sanctions. &quot;We all understand that the more pressure we exert on the aggressor, the closer we bring peace,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Sanctions are one of the most effective tools for justly pressuring Russia and everyone associated with it or working for the war.&quot; The draft law will be next be submitted to the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s parliament. Days before Zelensky&apos;s announcement, the United States and United Kingdom imposed broad sanctions against the Russian oil industry, taking aim at Moscow&apos;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; The restrictions targeted nearly 200 vessels, along with Russian oil companies and industry officials. Zelensky praised the sanctions as a &quot;significant blow to the financial foundation of Russia&apos;s war machine.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-announces-new-sanctions-on-russian-financial-sector/	2025-01-13T13:44:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/ze.png
Bryansk chemical plant hit in aerial attack, Russian media says	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A chemical plant in Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast was allegedly damaged in an aerial attack on the night of Jan. 13, Russian media reported. Regional Governor Alexander Bogomaz reported that Russian air defense units were repelling a drone attack over Bryansk Oblast. Later in the evening, the Astra Telegram news channel reported that the Bryansk chemical plant had been hit &#x2014;&#xA0;possibly by a long-range ATACMS missile &#x2014; and posted footage showing explosions at the site. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The Bryansk chemical plant produces gunpowder and explosives, according to Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s counter-disinformation center. &quot;It is important for the production of artillery ammunition and missiles for the Russian army,&quot; Kovalenko said in a Telegram post after the alleged attack. &quot;This enterprise is one of the key elements of the Russian military industry.&quot; The plant was reportedly damaged in a previous attack in November. Kovalenko also said on Jan. 13 that explosions had occurred at the &quot;Kremniy El&quot; microelectronics plant &#xA0;in Bryansk, though Russian sources have not reported an attack on that site and the Kyiv Independent could not verify the claim. &quot;Kremniy El&quot; was previously targeted in attacks in October 2024 and August 2023. &#xA0; The plant produces components widely used in Russian defense production, including for Pantsir air defense systems and Iskander missile systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/bryansk-chemical-plant-hit-in-aerial-attack-russian-media-says/	2025-01-13T12:52:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1247635468.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia claims to occupy 2 more villages in Ukraine's east; Kyiv doesn't confirm	Key developments on Jan. 13: Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 12 that its forces had captured the villages of Yantarne in Donetsk Oblast and Kalynove in Kharkiv Oblast. Ukraine has not commented on the claims. The Russian statement could not be immediately verified. Moscow&apos;s forces have ramped up pressure in Ukraine&apos;s east as Ukrainian forces find themselves increasingly outnumbered and outgunned. Yantarne lies around 10 kilometers (6 miles) southeast of the town of Kurakhove, almost completely overrun by Russian forces. The Ukrainian military recently claimed it continues to hold positions at the Kurakhove Thermal Power Plant. Russian propagandist Vladimir Solovyov on Jan. 10 shared footage showing Russian soldiers raising flags over damaged buildings, claiming to be located in Yantarne. The estimated Russian advance in the Kurakhove sector in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 12, 2025, according to DeepState. Yantarne marked by a black symbol. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)The Ukrainian war monitoring website DeepState said that the situation in the village is still being clarified without confirming nor denying the loss of Yantarne, while Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces reported engagements in the area on Jan. 12. The northeastern village of Kalynove lies on the west bank of the Oskil River and north of Kupiansk, a key logistical hub liberated by Ukraine during a counteroffensive in the fall of 2022. Russian forces have been attempting to force the Oskil River for months in an attempt to outflank Ukrainian troops. Andrii Besedin, head of the Kupiansk military administration, said on Jan. 9 that Moscow&apos;s troops are trying to secure a bridgehead in the town of Dvorichna on the river&apos;s Ukraine-held western bank. Besedin also said that Russian forces are now within 2 kilometers (1.5 miles) of Kupiansk&apos;s outskirts, adding that the situation is &quot;very difficult.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces repelled an assault by North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the unit&apos;s press service said on Jan. 13, claiming to have killed 17 North Korean soldiers. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched on Aug. 6. Ukrainian troops have continued fighting in the region, leveraging their positions for potential future negotiations. The battle, the date of which remains undisclosed, lasted from morning until night. The unit released a video of the engagement, showing what are said to be dead North Korean soldiers. A Ukrainian group encountered one surviving North Korean fighter who had set an unsuccessful trap. The soldier attempted to mislead the Ukrainian troops and then detonated a grenade to avoid capture, fatally injuring himself, according to the Special Operations Forces. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) claimed that North Korean casualties have already reached 300 soldiers killed and 2,700 wounded. The NIS attributed the casualties to their lack of modern warfare training, including ineffective efforts to combat long-range drones. The NIS further alleged that North Korean soldiers had been forced to commit suicide to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces, a claim echoed by White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby on Dec. 27. Kirby said that captured North Korean troops fear their families would face severe retaliation if they surrendered. On Jan. 11, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the capture of two North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast. The prisoners of war (POWs), identified by the NIS as members of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea&apos;s military intelligence agency, are in Ukrainian custody and receiving medical treatment. Ukraine&apos;s government has approved a measure allowing foreign companies to participate in modernizing military equipment for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the Defense Ministry announced on Jan. 13. The initiative focuses on upgrading state aviation aircraft, ships, and their components using advanced Western technologies. The decision aims to foster joint high-tech projects with international partners while adhering to global standards and ensuring transparent cooperation. This move also aligns with Ukraine&apos;s push to expand its defense production capabilities amid the ongoing war with Russia. Foreign firms with special permits for transferring military technology and exporting defense-related goods and services will now be eligible to collaborate, according to Deputy Defense Minister Brigadier General Anatolii Klochko. &quot;Modernizing outdated equipment will significantly enhance its efficiency, leveraging high-tech solutions from foreign partners,&quot; Klochko said. Ukraine allocated Hr 55 billion ($1.3 billion) for weapons production in its 2025 budget, Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin announced on Nov. 12, 2024. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has actively sought to modernize its defense infrastructure, with an emphasis on integrating Western technologies to bolster its military efficiency and resilience. Germany delivered the first batch of the promised 54 RCH 155 self-propelled howitzers, the country&apos;s Foreign Minister Boris Pistorius said during a news conference on Jan. 13. Six out of the 54 howitzers will remain in Germany to train Ukrainian personnel. &quot;Ukraine can count on us, and this (the delivery) is a signal. And Germany is ready to take responsibility in Europe,&quot; Pistorius was quoted as saying in the German city of Kassel, where the howitzers are manufactured. Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to Germany, Oleksii Makeiev, symbolically accepted the first batch on site. Ukraine had requested the RCH 155 in July 2022. The RCH-155 self-propelled howitzer is a new combination of a GTK Boxer APC (armored personnel carrier) with an automated artillery turret of the PzH &#x200B;&#x200B;2000. It fires 155 mm shells to a distance of up to 54 kilometers. It can move quickly on or off-road at speeds of over 100 kilometers per hour due to the wheeled base similar to a heavy-duty armored vehicle. Ukraine is the first country to receive the new RCH 155. The U.K. will finance the production of air defense systems and long-range weapons in Ukraine, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Jan. 13 following a meeting with U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey in London. &quot;The U.K. has already invested in the production of our weapons, and this collaboration continues &#x2014; specifically, funding will be directed toward the production of air defense systems and long-range weapons,&quot; Umerov wrote on Facebook. Umerov met with Healey to discuss bilateral cooperation in 2025 in key security areas. &quot;The U.K. reaffirmed its commitment to providing continuous and comprehensive support to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s position both on the battlefield and on the international stage,&quot; the minister said. &quot;We anticipate enhanced military, political, and economic assistance from our British allies this year.&quot; Umerov did not provide further details on how London would finance Ukrainian defense industry. In 2025, Ukraine plans to spend a record $35 billion on arms production, of which $17 billion will be financed by the Ukrainian government, according to Umerov. The rest may be supported by allies, he added. Kyiv has ramped up domestic drone production over the past year, as well as the development of new missiles. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks throughout the full-scale war with Russia. Ukraine, in recent months, has championed the development of long-range &quot;missile-drones,&quot; upgraded UAVs with turbojet engines that can act as alternatives to cruise missiles. Kyiv unveiled its Palianytsia and Peklo hybrids in the second half of 2024. Zelensky has said Ukraine aims to produce at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025 and conducted the first successful test of a new Ukrainian missile, dubbed Ruta (Rue).	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-claims-to-occupy-2-more-villages-in-ukraines-east-kyiv-hasnt-confirmed/	2025-01-13T12:32:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192142681.jpg
Ukraine’s new Kursk push brings minor gains, raising concerns over limited resources	Since the new push in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast in early January, Ukraine has made small gains and managed to capture the first North Korean prisoners of war in the area but experts have raised concerns about Kyiv&#x2019;s use of limited resources while fierce battles rage elsewhere. The assessment comes as more &#x2013; but still limited &#x2013; open-source data emerges from the week-old Ukrainian operation around the village of Berdin in what experts believe was Kyiv&#x2019;s tactic to take advantage of a weakened Russian defense in the area. The Ukrainian military has so far remained silent on the operation, though reporting on Jan. 5 that the most intense fighting across the front line was happening in Kursk Oblast. Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the Center for Countering Disinformation (CCD) in the National Security and Defense Council, told the Kyiv Independent that Ukrainian forces had advanced over two kilometers in Kursk Oblast on the first day. He declined to comment further on operational details. In a Jan. 5 Telegram post, Kovalenko said that the Ukrainian attacks in several directions in Kursk Oblast &quot;came as a surprise&quot; for the Russian troops. Andrii Yermak, the head of the President&#x2019;s Office, praised the &#x201C;good news&#x201D; from the southwestern Russian region where Ukraine is gripping onto a narrow patch of territory at high costs, saying that &#x201C;Russia is getting what it deserves.&#x201D; Western and Ukrainian military experts warned that the scale and success of the costly Ukrainian operation were &#x201C;exaggerated,&#x201D; with Kyiv achieving minor tactical gains &#x2013; at least some of which Russia appears to have reclaimed quickly. The new Ukrainian attacks came five months after Kyiv launched its cross-border incursion into Russia in August 2024, surprising Western leaders and temporarily boosting the morale among the exhausted troops elsewhere withdrawing little by little. Some of Ukraine&#x2019;s most elite units, along with the less experienced ones, took part in the operation. However, months into the incursion, more Ukrainian soldiers have increasingly grown pessimistic toward what they believe would be a short-lived operation, with many questioning the cost of invading another country&#x2019;s territory when the defense of one&#x2019;s own is at stake. Since August, Ukraine has reportedly lost more than half of the Kursk Oblast territories it captured. Meanwhile, Russia has advanced at its quickest pace since early 2022, and the stretched-out Ukrainian troops have lost important long-time strongholds, including Vuhledar, Selydove, and, most recently, Kurakhove in the eastern Donetsk Oblast.

(Yevhenii Vasyliev/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)The Kursk incursion rages on as unpredictable U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has recently said he hopes to end the war in Ukraine in about half a year, is due to take office on Jan. 20. It is widely believed that Ukraine&#x2019;s control of Russian territory could be a bargaining chip at the possible future negotiations with Russia. Outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters in Seoul on Jan. 6 that Ukraine&#x2019;s small patch of Kursk Oblast &#x201C;is an important one because certainly it&apos;s something that would factor in any negotiation that may come about in the coming year.&#x201D; Ukraine&#x2019;s recent attacks against Russian positions in Kursk Oblast are &#x201C;very limited&#x201D; due to severe manpower and resource shortages, Ivan Stupak, a Ukrainian military commentator and former Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) officer, said. Estimating the push to involve from hundreds to 2,000 Ukrainian troops at most and dozens of heavy equipment, Stupak said that the renewed operation appears to be 70% for political purposes and 30% for military purposes. The operation appears to be Kyiv&#x2019;s attempt to inflict &#x201C;pain&#x201D; one more time on Russia and provide Ukrainians with &#x201C;a bit more victories&#x201D; in the tough time when the front-line situation continues to deteriorate, according to the expert. He added that it may also be to relieve the situation across hot spots of the war in Ukraine, such as in the Donbas, by trying to force Russia to deploy more troops to the Kursk axis, as well as to possibly disrupt Moscow&#x2019;s tactical plans in the area. &#x201C;I expect that it will be maybe a couple of weeks of offensive operation but within Kursk Oblast,&#x201D; Stupak told the Kyiv Independent. Ukraine currently controls about 450 kilometers of Kursk Oblast territory, which is roughly the size of Detroit, according to Stupak. Ukraine managed to break through the Russian defenses in some villages in the Berdin area, but it appears Ukrainians have already been pushed out of some, Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst at the Black Bird Group analyzing the war closely through open source, said. Advancing anywhere in Kursk Oblast is now difficult due to the high concentration of Russia&#x2019;s troops and its heavy use of first-person view (FPV) drones and glide bombs, according to experts. &#x201C;It is pretty clear that the Ukrainians don&apos;t have any more capabilities to rapidly advance in this area anymore,&#x201D; Kastehelmi told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;So it&apos;s more of these localized counterattacks and then just staying on the defense instead of a new offensive phase.&#x201D; Ukraine may have tried to seize the moment when there was a low number or quality of Russian soldiers deployed at this particular point, a shortage of heavy equipment in the area, or the rotation of units, according to experts. &#x201C;Currently, it seems that the Russians were able to counter some of the Ukrainian advances and then strike back,&#x201D; Kastehelmi said. The operation appears to have gained tactical gains but &quot;nothing that would change the general dynamics of the battlefield,&#x201D; he added. Spending forces to take &quot;some small, very local successes in the furthest corner of the (Kursk) salient&quot; when Ukraine is struggling to hold onto its remaining captured territories amid the serious manpower issue could be &quot;net negative,&quot; Kastehelmi suggested. Russian troops have been pushing from the flanks, particularly toward the town of Sudzha and from the western direction of the salient, so trying to advance further toward the corners without expanding the flanks may compromise Ukrainian defense, according to Kastehelmi. Yaroslav, a serviceman in the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces sabotage and reconnaissance group deployed in Kursk Oblast, agreed with Kastehelmi&#x2019;s assessment. The soldier is only identified by first name in accordance with the security protocols of the Ukrainian military. Yaroslav stressed that the situation around the strategic town of Sudzha is difficult, with Russian troops continuing to push in the areas of villages to its north and south &#x2013; Malaya Loknya and Makhovka. &#x201C;Instead of expanding our flanks, we are drilling into the enemy&apos;s depths,&#x201D; Yaroslav told the Kyiv Independent.

(Serhiy Morgunov/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)Holding onto Sudzha is crucial for Kyiv. With the only one main road used to support Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast from the adjacent Sumy Oblast in northeastern Ukraine, losing the town could jeopardize Ukrainian logistics crucial for the operation, according to Ukrainian expert Stupak. &#x201C;If Russians will manage to cut this road, it will be very difficult to supply Ukrainians with everything &#x2013; with medicine, manpower, heavy equipment, shells, etc.,&#x201D; he said. The overall Russian offensive &#x2013; supported by North Korean soldiers &#x2013; continues in Kursk Oblast despite the local Ukrainian attacks on the corner of the salient, making it extremely difficult for the Ukrainians to hold the ground. About 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast, a senior Ukrainian official familiar with the intelligence told the Kyiv Independent in December. Stupak also argued that gaining territory is just one side of the medal, the other one is holding it. &#x201C;It&apos;s a big question because we are using the best of the best soldiers in this land and of the best supplied Western equipment and lots of other directions, such as Donetsk or Zaporizhzhia oblasts, they are suffering from a shortage of shells, manpower, equipped and motivated detachments.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-new-kursk-push-brings-minor-gains-concerns-rise-over-use-of-limited-resources/	2025-01-13T12:20:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166951505.jpg
Everything we know about the North Korean POWs captured by Ukraine	Ukrainian forces fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast captured two North Korean soldiers, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Jan. 11, &quot;irrefutable evidence&quot; of Pyongyang&apos;s involvement in Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;This task was not easy,&quot; Zelensky said, claiming that North Korean military personnel usually &quot;finish off their wounded&quot; in order to hide the evidence of their participation in the war. North Korea deployed around 12,000 soldiers in Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August 2024 to bring the war to Russia, a senior Ukrainian official familiar with the intelligence told the Kyiv Independent in December 2024. Ukrainian forces captured a wounded North Korean soldier during operations in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Yonhap reported on Dec. 27, citing the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS), though he later reportedly died of his wounds. Since Zelensky&apos;s announcement on Jan. 11, a few details about the POWs have emerged, as well as questions about what could happen to them next. &quot;I know it&apos;s seen as a bit of a propaganda coup, but in the big scheme of things, I think it&apos;s of minimal significance,&quot; retired Australian Major General Mick Ryan told the Kyiv independent. Despite the capture of two North Korean POWs fighting for Russia being the first of its kind, Ryan said in terms of the war in Ukraine, and the numbers of prisoners taken by both sides, they&apos;re &quot;just two more soldiers.&quot; &quot;And we shouldn&apos;t read too much into it or give too much strategic emphasis on the capture of a couple of soldiers,&quot; he adds. Ryan also doubts that they&apos;ll be able to give Ukraine and Western intelligence agencies much more of an insight into the inner workings of the North Korean military than they already know. &quot;Remember, North Korean soldiers have defected to South Korea before. So, you know, there&apos;s already a flow every now and then of North Koreans that are exploited for intelligence value,&quot; he said. President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed a willingness to return the POWs to North Korea, if the country&apos;s leader Kim Jong Un is able to negotiate the release of Ukrainian POWs in Russia. &quot;For those North Korean soldiers who do not want to return, there may be some other ways,&quot; he added in a post on his official Telegram channel on Jan. 12. But simply swapping North Korean and Ukrainian POWs may not be that simple. According to South Korean officials, North Korean troops fighting for Russia have been ordered to kill themselves rather than be taken prisoner. &quot;Memos found on deceased soldiers indicate that the North Korean authorities pressured them to commit suicide or self-detonate before capture,&quot; lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun told reporters on Jan. 13, citing Seoul&apos;s National Intelligence Service. The claim appeared to be confirmed by a video released on the same day by Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces, showing Ukrainian soldiers storming positions manned by North Korean soldiers. The video shows one of the soldiers &#x2014; who a Ukrainian in the video identifies as &quot;Korean&quot; &#x2014; detonate a grenade near his face when Ukrainian troops approach.

(President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)A Russian ID document allegedly carried by a captured North Korean POW under the name of a Tuva Republic resident, as seen in a photo published on Jan. 11, 2025.(President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)Andrew Clapham, professor of international law at the Geneva Graduate Institute, told the Kyiv Independent that this raises &quot;complications&quot; about Ukraine&apos;s stated proposal to return them home in a prisoner swap. &quot;The complication arises if there&apos;s a substantial risk that they would be subjected to human rights violations,&quot; Clapham said, adding: &quot;There&apos;s a chance one would think that they would be punished for failing to carry out those orders (to kill themselves).&quot; Returning the POWs knowing this would be a violation of the Geneva Conventions, Clapham adds. Usually, assurances that the POWs would not be subject to human rights violations would carry some weight, but North Korea&apos;s abysmal human rights record and pariah status complicate matters further. &quot;I think most people wouldn&apos;t accept on face value what are called diplomatic assurances in this context,&quot; Clapham adds. The two North Korean POWs are currently in the custody of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) in Kyiv. Both were wounded and are reportedly receiving medical attention. In videos published by the SBU, one can be seen with his head and chin bandaged, while the other has bandaged hands. The SBU said on Jan. 11 the captured soldiers are being questioned with the help of Korean translators and South Korean intelligence. One has said he was born in 2005 and began serving as a rifleman in North Korea in 2021. &quot;It is noteworthy that the prisoner, like the Russian military at the beginning of the full-scale invasion, emphasizes that he was supposedly going for training and not for a war against Ukraine,&quot; the SBU said. According to the SBU, the other POW was born in 1999 and has served in the North Korean army since 2016 as a sniper reconnaissance officer.

(President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)The first POW was issued with an ID document under the name of another person from Russia&apos;s Tuva Republic, while the second one had no documents at all. Zelensky posted video footage of the SBU&apos;s interrogation of the two POWs, mediated by Korean translators. In the video, one of the captured soldiers says he would like to return to North Korea, while the other answers that he wants to live in Ukraine. As of now, it&apos;s unclear where they will end up. &quot;They could remain in Ukrainian hands, or, the suggestion is that they would go to South Korea,&quot; Clapham said. And with fighting ongoing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, it&apos;s unlikely that they will remain the only North Korean soldiers in such a situation. &quot;In addition to the first captured soldiers from North Korea, there will undoubtedly be others,&quot; Zelensky said on Jan. 12. &quot;It is only a matter of time before our guys manage to capture more.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/everything-we-know-about-the-north-korean-pows-captured-by-ukraine/	2025-01-13T11:24:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-11_13-23-34--2-.jpg
UK to finance production of air defense, long-range weapons in Ukraine, Umerov says	The U.K. will finance the production of air defense systems and long-range weapons in Ukraine, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Jan. 13 following a meeting with U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey in London. &quot;The U.K. has already invested in the production of our weapons, and this collaboration continues &#x2014; specifically, funding will be directed toward the production of air defense systems and long-range weapons,&quot; Umerov wrote on Facebook. Umerov met with Healey to discuss bilateral cooperation in 2025 in key security areas. &quot;The U.K. reaffirmed its commitment to providing continuous and comprehensive support to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s position both on the battlefield and on the international stage,&quot; the minister said. &quot;We anticipate enhanced military, political, and economic assistance from our British allies this year.&quot; Umerov did not provide further details on how London would finance Ukrainian defense industry. In 2025, Ukraine plans to spend a record $35 billion on arms production, of which $17 billion will be financed by the Ukrainian government, according to Umerov. The rest may be supported by allies, he added. Kyiv has ramped up domestic drone production over the past year, as well as the development of new missiles. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks throughout the full-scale war with Russia. Ukraine, in recent months, has championed the development of long-range &quot;missile-drones,&quot; upgraded UAVs with turbojet engines that can act as alternatives to cruise missiles. Kyiv unveiled its Palianytsia and Peklo hybrids in the second half of 2024. Zelensky has said Ukraine aims to produce at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025 and conducted the first successful test of a new Ukrainian missile, dubbed Ruta (Rue).	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-to-finance-production-of-air-defense-long-range-weapons-in-ukraine-umerov-says/	2025-01-13T11:18:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/473372412_998875578727449_8903502460998383258_n.jpg
Volyn exhumations in Ukraine's Ternopil Oblast to begin in April, media reports	Exhumation of the remains of Polish victims of the Volyn tragedy buried in Ternopil Oblast, where the village of Puzhnyky was located in the 1940s, will begin in April, Polish RMF FM reported on Jan. 13. Ukraine and Poland agreed in early 2025 to exhume the first victims of the Volyn tragedy. The Volyn tragedy, also known as the Volyn massacres, took place in 1943 during World War II on the territory of Nazi-occupied Ukraine. Tens of thousands of Poles were killed by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA). Thousands of Ukrainians were also killed in retaliation. The Volyn massacres are a contentious topic between Ukraine and Poland and have often led to soured diplomatic relations. Poland characterizes the events as genocide perpetrated by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), while Ukraine has called for shared acknowledgment of responsibility for the atrocities. The Freedom and Democracy Foundation, which uncovered the grave site two years ago, received permission from the Ukrainian authorities to exhume the remains and conduct further research. The exhumation&apos;s primary purpose is to identify the people whose remains were found in the pit near the former cemetery. Experts are already collecting genetic material from descendants, the media outlet reported. Following the excavation, the remains will be examined by Polish archaeologists and anthropologists, Deputy Chairman of the Freedom and Democracy Foundation Maciej Dancewicz said. The exhumations represent a significant step forward in resolving longstanding historical tensions and strengthening Polish-Ukrainian relations amid challenges posed by Russia&apos;s aggression. President Volodymyr Zelensky and Prime Minister Donald Tusk previously met in Lviv on Dec. 17 to address historical reconciliation, including the legacy of the Volyn massacre.	https://kyivindependent.com/volyn-tragedy-exhumations-in-ukraines-ternopil-oblast-to-begin-in-april-media-reports/	2025-01-13T10:30:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/ad251d9b370ace3d876b64ad229cbd6c_1734456764.jpeg
Fico invited Zelensky to Slovakia to discuss gas transit via Ukraine; Zelensky responds	Editor&apos;s note: The story was updated as President Volodymyr Zelensky responded to Fico&apos;s invitation. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico proposed President Volodymyr Zelensky a meeting in Slovakia to discuss halting the Russian gas transit through Ukraine in his video address on Jan. 13 on Facebook. &quot;Okay. Come to Kyiv on Friday,&quot; Zelensky responded a few hours later to Fico&apos;s call on X. A day prior, Zelensky reacted to Fico&apos;s threats to limit aid to Ukrainians and cut off electricity supplies due to the termination of Russian gas transit through Ukraine to Europe. Zelensky said that Ukraine had offered Slovakia assistance for the adaptation period, but &quot;Fico arrogantly refused.&quot; Fico said he would not respond to Zelensky&apos;s recent statement to avoid &quot;further escalation of tensions.&quot; Fico claimed he wanted to focus instead on &quot;resolving the situation with the shutdown of gas transit.&quot; The Slovakian prime minister said he would like to hold a meeting with Zelensky in Slovakia near the border with Ukraine &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; Fico believed that this move would establish &quot;favorable conditions&quot; for discussing gas supplies to Slovakia and other countries through Ukraine and possible &quot;technical solutions,&quot; considering the termination of the contract between Ukraine and Russia on Dec. 31, 2024. Fico also estimated Slovakia&apos;s alleged losses from stopping Russian gas supplies via Ukraine at 500 million euros ($510 million) per year. Fico and his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban have been among some of the most vocal opponents of Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit. Despite Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, Orban and Fico have continued to maintain friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting with him, and promoting pro-Russian narratives in Europe. Fico previously threatened to cut off electricity supplies to Ukraine amid increasing blackouts due to Russian attacks targeting Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure. While the EU has made efforts to reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuels following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many countries, including Slovakia and Hungary, remain reliant on Russian gas.	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-offers-zelensky-to-meet-discuss-russian-gas-transit-via-ukraine/	2025-01-13T09:05:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188638934.jpg
Vital Pokrovsk coking coal mine halts operation, Reuters reports	As Russian troops continue approaching the city of Pokrovsk, Ukraine halts the extraction of coking coal near the city, Reuters reported on Jan. 13, citing unnamed sources. &quot;They have all stopped working now,&quot; one Reuters source said. &quot;There&apos;s no production there, they&apos;re only working on the surface,&quot; another Reuters source added. The Pokrovsk coal mine, one of the largest in Eastern Europe, is located 10 km (6 miles) west of Pokrovsk. The mine produces coal for coke production needed in steelmaking, which is Ukraine&apos;s second-largest export after agriculture. The coal mine, owned by steelmaker Metinvest BV, was the only one in Ukraine producing coking coal. The eastern front near the town has been the scene of fierce fighting for several months and a focal point of Russia&apos;s offensive in Donetsk Oblast, given Pokrovsk&apos;s importance as a logistics hub for Ukrainian forces. According to trade data, exports of steel products totaled nearly $2 billion in the first eight months of 2024. Experts say Ukrainian steelmakers could have produced up to 7.5 million metric tons of steel by the end of 2024 and planned to increase production to more than 10 million tons in 2025. Losing Pokrovsk, however, would set back production to 2-3 million tons a year.	https://kyivindependent.com/vital-pokrovsk-coking-coal-mine-halts-operation-reuters-reports/	2025-01-13T08:37:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2191667263.jpg

Germany announces first deliveries of promised RCH 155 self-propelled howitzers	Germany delivered the first batch of the promised 54 RCH 155 self-propelled howitzers, the country&apos;s Foreign Minister Boris Pistorius said during a news conference on Jan. 13. Six out of the 54 howitzers will remain in Germany to train Ukrainian personnel. &quot;Ukraine can count on us, and this (the delivery) is a signal. And Germany is ready to take responsibility in Europe,&quot; Pistorius was quoted as saying in the German city of Kassel, where the howitzers are manufactured. Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to Germany, Oleksii Makeiev, symbolically accepted the first batch on site. Ukraine had requested the RCH 155 in July 2022. The RCH-155 self-propelled howitzer is a new combination of a GTK Boxer APC (armored personnel carrier) with an automated artillery turret of the PzH &#x200B;&#x200B;2000. It fires 155 mm shells to a distance of up to 54 kilometers. It can move quickly on or off-road at speeds of over 100 kilometers per hour due to the wheeled base similar to a heavy-duty armored vehicle. Ukraine is the first country to receive the new RCH 155.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-announces-first-deliveries-of-promised-rch-155-self-propelled-howitzers/	2025-01-13T07:08:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193126935-1.jpg
Russia's energy giant Gazprom plans major layoffs as Europe market shrinks, media reports	The Russian energy giant Gazprom is preparing to lay off 1,600 employees from its central office as it faces significant financial losses and dwindling market presence in Europe, Russia&apos;s local 47News media outlet reported on Jan. 13. The news comes after Ukraine halted the transit of Russian gas to other European countries, ending an arrangement dating back to Soviet times. Deputy Chairman of the Management Committee Elena Ilyukhina reportedly sent a letter to Gazprom CEO Alexey Miller, outlining the need for cost optimization due to &quot;challenges facing the Gazprom Group.&quot; The letter suggests that 50 billion rubles ($480 million) are spent annually on salaries. To address this issue, it proposes reducing the central office workforce from 4,100 to 2,500 employees. Sergey Kupriyanov, deputy chairman of Gazprom&apos;s Board of Directors, confirmed the letter&apos;s authenticity to Forbes Russia but declined to provide further comments. Gazprom has suffered massive losses following the collapse of its European gas market, with exports to Europe dropping by more than 80% since 2021. Shares of the company fell to their lowest level since January 2009, trading at 106.1 rubles ($1.01) on Dec. 17, representing a 33.5% decline since the start of 2024. Heavy taxation further burdened Gazprom, which contributed $28 billion to the Russian government in 2023, accounting for 9% of state revenue. The EU&apos;s decision to pivot to alternative gas sources after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine triggered the decline, significantly reducing Europe&apos;s reliance on Russian supplies, with the exception of countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Austria. Russia&apos;s direct pipeline gas supplies to the EU have now halted completely as Ukraine chose not to prolong the transit deal with Gazprom past Dec. 31, 2024. At the same time, the EU countries purchased record volumes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-energy-giant-gazprom-plans-major-layoffs-media-repots/	2025-01-13T06:13:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1243251198.jpg
Russia's federal budget won't fund anti-drone systems at civilian airports, media reports	Russia will not allocate federal funds to equip civilian airports with anti-drone systems as initially expected, pro-Kremlin publication Vedomosti reported on Jan. 12, citing two undisclosed sources. This decision affects airports classified as Category I transportation infrastructure facilities, raising concerns about the vulnerability of Russia&apos;s civil aviation to drone-related threats. The Russian government was originally expected to spend over 11 billion rubles ($106 million) by 2028 to equip 31 airports, including those in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Sochi, and other major cities, with drone defense systems. However, this funding was not indicated in the relevant federal strategy document on infrastructure security, Vedomosti writes. This means it will be up to the airports&apos; management to ensure security against potential drone threats, the outlet wrote. Russia&apos;s decision not to fund anti-drone systems at key airports highlights gaps in its ability to address potential threats to civil aviation. Effective airport defense systems involve long-range drone detection systems, airspace closure, and neutralization using standard air defense measures. During the full-scale war, Ukraine has launched long-range drone strikes targeting Russian energy, military, and industrial facilities. Russian airports often halt operations for security reasons amid drone attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-cancels-funding-for-anti-drone-systems-at-civilian-airports-media-reports/	2025-01-13T05:46:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-537791492.jpg
EU announces additional $143 million in humanitarian aid for Ukraine	The European Union is allocating an additional 140 million euros ($143 million) in humanitarian assistance for Ukraine, the European Commission said in a statement on Jan. 13. In addition to this sum, the EU will allocate 8 million euros ($8.16 million) to Moldova to support Ukrainian refugees and their host communities. This will bring the overall humanitarian aid provided by the EU to the two countries since 2022 to over 1.1 billion euros ($1.12 billion). &quot;The funding will be directed towards emergency assistance, including food, shelter, clean water, healthcare, and winter protection&#x2026; supporting vulnerable populations in the heavily war impacted regions of eastern and southern Ukraine,&quot; the statement read. The announcement coincides with European Commissioner for Crisis Management Hadja Lahbib&#x2019;s visit to Ukraine. &quot;As Russia continues its cruelty in the dead of winter, the EU is intensifying its support to keep the lights on and homes warm,&quot; the commissioner said in the statement. Russia&apos;s war has resulted in a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, driving millions from their homes while dealing heavy damage to residential and energy infrastructure. Amid Russia&apos;s invasion, the EU has stepped up support for Ukraine in response to Ukraine&apos;s EU aspirations. Ukraine applied for EU membership days after Russia launched its full-scale war in February 2022 and received candidate status in June of that year. In December 2023, EU leaders agreed to open accession negotiations with Ukraine, which officially began in June 2024. Previously, Katarina Mathernova, the EU ambassador to Ukraine, said 2030 is a very real date for Ukraine to join the European Union.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-announces-143-million-in-humanitarian-aid-for-ukraine/	2025-01-13T05:15:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1239977099.jpg
Ukraine opens doors to foreign firms for military equipment modernization	Ukraine&apos;s government has approved a measure allowing foreign companies to participate in modernizing military equipment for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the Defense Ministry announced on Jan. 13. The initiative focuses on upgrading state aviation aircraft, ships, and their components using advanced Western technologies. The decision aims to foster joint high-tech projects with international partners while adhering to global standards and ensuring transparent cooperation. This move also aligns with Ukraine&apos;s push to expand its defense production capabilities amid the ongoing war with Russia. Foreign firms with special permits for transferring military technology and exporting defense-related goods and services will now be eligible to collaborate, according to Deputy Defense Minister Brigadier General Anatolii Klochko. &quot;Modernizing outdated equipment will significantly enhance its efficiency, leveraging high-tech solutions from foreign partners,&quot; Klochko said. Ukraine allocated Hr 55 billion ($1.3 billion) for weapons production in its 2025 budget, Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin announced on Nov. 12, 2024. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has actively sought to modernize its defense infrastructure, with an emphasis on integrating Western technologies to bolster its military efficiency and resilience.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-opens-doors-to-foreign-firms-for-military-equipment-modernization/	2025-01-13T04:51:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1494251171-1.jpeg
Russia, Iran to sign strategic partnership agreement on Jan. 17	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Iranian counterpart, Masoud Pezeshkian, will sign a strategic partnership agreement during the latter&apos;s visit to Russia on Jan. 17, the Kremlin&apos;s press service said. The two leaders are also expected to discuss expanding Russian-Iranian bilateral cooperation in &quot;trade, investment, transport, logistics, humanitarian sphere, and current issues on the regional and international agenda,&quot; the statement read. In December 2024, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson announced plans to pen the deal by the end of January. The agreement is expected to cement the growing military and political partnership between Russia and Iran. Moscow has been Tehran&apos;s traditional partner, but their cooperation only intensified after the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022. Iran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed drones used in attacks against Ukrainian cities, as well as short-range ballistic missiles. Putin signed a similar agreement with North Korea last June, under which both parties agreed to military support each other in case of an armed attack. Months after the deal was signed, North Korea dispatched up to 12,000 troops to help fend off a Ukrainian incursion in Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-iran-to-sign-strategic-partnership-agreement-on-jan-17/	2025-01-13T04:20:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177151439.jpg
EU's Nordic, Baltic members reportedly urge lowering of Russian oil price cap	Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have urged the European Commission to further decrease the $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil set by the G7, Reuters reported on Jan. 13, citing their joint letter seen by the news agency. The countries argue that a lower cap would further restrict Russia&apos;s ability to finance its war against Ukraine while avoiding significant disruptions to global oil markets. Under current terms, Western companies can insure and transport Russian oil only if sold below the cap. In their letter to the European Commission, the six nations reportedly emphasized the need to &quot;further increase the impact of our sanctions by lowering the G7 oil price cap.&quot; The G7 initially implemented the cap to reduce Moscow&apos;s oil revenues while maintaining stability in global markets. With forecasts of a global oil surplus in 2025 and softening prices, the G7 may consider more stringent measures. Sanctions and Ukrainian drone strikes have already disrupted Russia&apos;s oil production, with refineries in Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk reducing or halting operations. These pressures have forced Russia&apos;s energy sector to sell oil at a discount and operate under high interest rates, further straining its capacity. The call to lower the price cap reflects ongoing efforts by European nations to maximize economic pressure on Russia while supporting Ukraine&apos;s defense against aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-members-russian-oil-price-cap/	2025-01-13T04:02:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
For the first time, Russia labels independent media outlet as 'terrorist group'	Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB) has designated the independent media outlet Komi Daily as a &quot;terrorist organization,&quot; several news outlets reported on Jan. 13, citing recent changes on the FSB&apos;s website. This marks the first time the FSB has applied such a label to a media outlet. Komi Daily, known for its coverage of culture and daily life in Russia&apos;s northwestern Komi Republic, has been critical of Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine. The outlet has faced escalating state pressure, including website blockages and fines against its editor for alleged incitement. The FSB claims Komi Daily is linked to the Free Nations of Post-Russia Forum, a movement advocating for the decentralization and decolonization of Russia by dismantling it into 41 autonomous states. The outlet denies any affiliation with the forum. The Supreme Court finalized the designation in late December, intensifying Russia&apos;s suppression of dissenting voices, particularly the independent media critical of the Kremlin. The Free Nations of Post-Russia Forum, founded by Ukrainian entrepreneur Oleg Magaletsky and led by exiled Bashkir activist Ruslan Gabbasov, had already been labeled &quot;undesirable&quot; and &quot;terrorist&quot; by Russian authorities. Prosecutors allege the forum supports terrorism and sabotage while promoting the independence of regions like Komi. The FSB&apos;s move is part of an expanding crackdown on independent journalism in Russia. The Kremlin has increasingly targeted media advocating for regional independence or criticizing the government, forcing many journalists into exile.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-labels-komi-daily-as-terrorist-group-first-media-outlet-to-receive-such-designation/	2025-01-13T03:47:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1249615636.jpg
Russia claims to occupy 2 more villages in Ukraine's east; Kyiv hasn't confirmed	Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 12 that its forces had captured the villages of Yantarne in Donetsk Oblast and Kalynove in Kharkiv Oblast. Ukraine has not commented on the claims, which could not be immediately verified. Moscow&apos;s forces have ramped up pressure in Ukraine&apos;s east as Ukrainian defenders find themselves increasingly outnumbered and outgunned. Yantarne lies around 10 kilometers (6 miles) southeast of the eastern town of Kurakhove, almost completely overrun by Russian forces. The Ukrainian military recently claimed it continues to hold positions at the Kurakhove Thermal Power Plant. Russian propagandist Vladimir Solovyov on Jan. 10 shared footage showing Russian soldiers raising flags over damaged buildings, claiming to be located in Yantarne. The estimated Russian advance in the Kurakhove sector in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 12, 2025, according to DeepState. Yantarne marked by a black symbol. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)The Ukrainian war monitoring website DeepState said that the situation in the village is still being clarified without confirming nor denying the loss of Yantarne, while Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces reported engagements in the area on Jan. 12. The northeastern village of Kalynove lies on the west bank of the Oskil River and north of Kupiansk, a key logistical hub liberated by Ukraine during a counteroffensive in the fall of 2022. Russian forces have been attempting to force the Oskil River for months in an attempt to outflank Ukrainian defenders. Andrii Besedin, head of the Kupiansk town military administration, said on Jan. 9 that Moscow&apos;s troops are trying to secure a bridgehead in the town of Dvorichna on the river&apos;s Ukraine-held western bank. Besedin also said that Russian forces are now within 2 kilometers (1.5 miles) of Kupiansk&apos;s outskirts, adding that the situation is &quot;very difficult.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-to-occupy-2-more-villages-in-ukraines-donetsk-kharkiv-oblasts/	2025-01-13T03:28:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190850427.jpg
The question isn't if China will turn on Russia, but when	Like Czar Nicholas II, Russian President Vladimir Putin has misidentified his primary foe. Fighting a war of choice, he allows the real menace to his country to gather strength. China, not Ukraine, constitutes Russia&#x2019;s existential threat. In the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), Nicholas fought Japan over Manchuria for concessions that Russia could not monetize, instead of investing in the railways and munitions needed to fight the country&#x2019;s actual enemy, Germany, a decade later. Defeat in World War I cost Nicholas and his family their lives after the Bolsheviks seized power. Nobles who did not suffer the same violent fate as the czar fled abroad, often dying in penury. The West and Ukraine never intended to invade Russia, let alone take its territory. Who in the West would want it? China, on the other hand, very well might. Its long list of grievances dates back centuries, to the czars who removed large swaths of territory &#x2014; an area larger than the United States east of the Mississippi River &#x2014; from China&#x2019;s sphere of influence. Putin&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine was a pivotal error &#x2014; the type that precludes a return to the pre-war status quo. Instead, such errors lead to alternatives that are far less desirable. The question is not whether Russia will lose its war against Ukraine (in strategic terms, it already has), but only how big the loss will be. The war has cost Russia more than 700,000 casualties. It has forced Russia to reorient its lucrative European energy trade to less profitable markets. It has depressed productivity through sanctions. It has led to the impoundment of its foreign-exchange reserves, with the accruing interest diverted to Ukraine. It has triggered the flight of hundreds of thousands of prime working-age citizens (often highly educated and in the crucial tech sector). It has precipitated the bombing of Russian factories, military bases, and infrastructure, as well as the first invasion of its territory (in the Kursk region) since World War II. And it has brought about the expansion and reinvigoration of NATO, with Sweden and Finland&#x2019;s accession to membership in the alliance transforming the Baltic Sea into a NATO lake. Even if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump somehow ends the war, Putin cannot reverse these losses. And the longer it continues, the weaker Russia will become, leading many to wonder when it will decide to staunch its losses. Russians ousted Nicholas II for mismanaging the war, wrecking the economy, and being profligate with the lives of his subjects. Like Nicholas&#x2019;s entourage, Putin&#x2019;s is helping him double down on his bad decision to invade Ukraine instead of bailing out while they still can. But the longer they stick with Putin, the greater their vulnerability to China will become.

(Kristina Kormilitsyna/PHOTOHOST AGENCY/Anadolu via Getty Images)The question is not whether China will turn on Russia, but when. China will eventually eat Russia&#x2019;s lunch; the only remaining uncertainty is how big the meal will be. Russia has expended much of its Cold War arsenal on Ukraine, leaving Siberia wide open to Chinese ambitions. Siberia has the resources that China covets: not only energy and minerals, but, more importantly, water. Lake Baikal is larger than Belgium and contains 20% of the world&#x2019;s fresh surface water, which North China desperately needs. Putin apparently intends to escalate his way to victory. The war started with his bungled invasion and attempt at regime change in Kyiv, followed by efforts to bludgeon Ukrainians into submission with massacres of civilians in cities like Bucha, gratuitous destruction of homes and towns, and cross-border abductions of thousands of children. Then came the targeting of civilian shelters, hospitals, schools, museums, and power stations; the summary executions and torture of POWs; the destruction of the massive Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River; threats to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (although Russia, not Ukraine, sits downwind from it); and the use of mines, Turkish drones, ballistic missiles, cluster munitions, glide bombs, and now North Korean troops. If Putin used nuclear weapons, which he has periodically threatened to do, Russians would become the pariahs of the 21st century, replacing the Nazis of the last century. Like the Germans before them, Russians also support wars of territorial conquest. After the Soviet Union&#x2019;s export of its economic model impoverished so much of the world (itself included), nuking a neighbor would cement Russia&#x2019;s status as the world&#x2019;s most regressive country, and its people as the world&#x2019;s most brutal. The negative strategic effects for Russia and Russians would last for generations &#x2014; just ask the Germans. The million-ruble question is whether Putin&#x2019;s entourage intends to stick with him for the entire ride, which would leave them at China&#x2019;s, not Putin&#x2019;s, mercy and headed toward an economic destination similar to that of North Korea. From China, they should expect retribution for Russia&#x2019;s chain of abuse going back to the mid-19th century. Russia&#x2019;s power brokers should ask whose interests the war now serves. At this stage, the answer is clear: Putin&#x2019;s alone. The rest of us can observe their unfolding national disaster as they decide between salvaging what they can and going down with the ship. To avoid the fate of the Russian nobility &#x2014; or falling from high-rise windows &#x2014; the Russian elite could incentivize Putin to retire and cut their country&#x2019;s losses by returning territory in exchange for keeping their personal wealth. Unfortunately, Russians seem to require national catastrophes to precipitate a reassessment of their strategy. Editor&#x2019;s Note: Copyright, Project Syndicate.

Slavoj Žižek: The magic tricks behind Russia’s propaganda machine	I must admit that I occasionally enjoy podcasts explaining the secrets behind well-known magic tricks (the three-shell game, mentalism, levitation, etc.). After reading recent news from Russia, I&#x2019;ve come to the conclusion that these tricks offer a clue to how Russian propaganda has achieved what seems impossible to common sense: claiming that the Russian attack on Ukraine is an act of self-defense. The standard explanation for magic tricks is that they usually rely on at least two different strategies, combining them to produce the desired effects &#x2014; and Russia is doing exactly the same. The Russian government approved a list of 48 foreign states and territories accused of implementing policies that promote destructive neoliberal ideological attitudes, which contradict traditional Russian spiritual and moral values. This list was approved under a decree signed by Putin on Aug. 19, aimed at providing humanitarian support to those &quot;sharing traditional Russian spiritual and moral values.&quot; States on this list are now officially designated as &#x201C;enemy states&#x201D; simply because they don&#x2019;t share these values &#x2014; there&#x2019;s no mention of a multi-polar world; you are an enemy of Russia just for not sharing its values. Oddly, North Korea and Afghanistan are included on this list, but Russia isn&#x2019;t being deceptive: its respect for &#x201C;traditional values&#x201D; aligns with North Korean and Taliban ideology in rejecting the European Enlightenment as the ultimate evil in history. The conflict is thus elevated to a metaphysical-religious level: beneath all the talk of a new multi-polar world lies the vision of a total war to the extinction of two opposites. When religion directly enters politics, the threat of deadly violence is never far behind. Putin recently declared a new nuclear doctrine, announcing that &#x201C;a number of clarifications ... defining the conditions for the use of nuclear weapons&#x201D; were being made to Russia&#x2019;s nuclear doctrine. He added that proposed amendments would expand &#x201C;the category of states and military alliances in relation to which nuclear deterrence is carried out.&#x201D; In a pointed warning to the West, Putin announced that any attack on Russia by a non-nuclear state, supported by a nuclear-armed nation, would be considered a &#x201C;joint attack.&#x201D; He also stated that Moscow reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in case of an attack on Belarus, as it is part of the &#x201C;Union State&#x201D; with Russia, a special partnership between the two nations. This includes cases when the enemy, using conventional weapons, &#x201C;creates critical danger to our sovereignty,&#x201D; Putin said. Russian President Vladimir Putin (C) looks on as Russian military officers lay a wreath during a ceremony at the Unknown Soldier&apos;s Tomb in Moscow, Russia, on June 22, 2022. (Contributor/Getty Images)Such statements make us nostalgic for the Cold War era, when both sides wisely avoided direct nuclear threats and announced they would use nuclear arms only in response to a nuclear strike. The threat of a direct nuclear strike was unmentionable back then. Russia has now asserted the right to a first strike and even expanded the conditions for its use. Of course, an actual Russian first strike remains unlikely, but words in the military domain are never just words &#x2014; they often lead to action. After thousands of pagers exploded in Lebanon, Iran&#x2019;s UN delegate said Israel had &#x201C;crossed a red line&#x201D; again. But today, crossing red lines happens regularly, making the situation even more dangerous because each side thinks it can do so without consequence. The catch is that you can&#x2019;t do this indefinitely: there is a real red line, though it may not be publicly acknowledged, and the only way to learn where it is is to cross it. Our response to Russia should be that Russia itself has crossed the red line by issuing nuclear threats. Those who see the Russia-Ukraine war as a proxy war between NATO and Russia would claim that Russia is under attack by NATO. In some sense, this is true, but in what sense? In the same sense that Israel claims to act in self-defense in Gaza, the West Bank, and Lebanon. The catch lies in how we define the &quot;self&quot; in self-defense. If I occupy land that isn&#x2019;t mine and declare it mine (like the West Bank or parts of Ukraine), and if the land or people there resist, I can claim that my actions to crush them are in self-defense. The two basic strategies Russian state propaganda relies on are these: accuse the opponent of doing what you are doing yourself, in a much more open and brutal way. This distracts the public&#x2019;s attention and makes them accept your basic claim that what you took from the opponent was originally yours. Russia is just defending itself &#x2014; if we accept that Crimea and Donetsk (and perhaps other regions, from the Baltic to Moldova) belong to it, and that Ukraine as a nation doesn&#x2019;t truly exist, but emerged from the minds of Lenin and the Nazis. The second strategy is to accuse the opponent of dangerously approaching a red line after you&#x2019;ve blatantly crossed the only true red line &#x2014; the use of nuclear weapons. This combination of strategies makes rational peace negotiations nearly impossible, because the very terms of negotiation are falsified from the outset. As Luka Lisjak Gabrijel&#x10D;i&#x10D; rightly wrote: &#x201C;Peace is all too precious to be left to peaceniks.&#x201D; Add to this the third strategy of deception: presenting a brutal war of conquest as a defense of spiritual values. This combination is nearly unbeatable. All our hope lies in the &#x201C;nearly.&#x201D; Editor&#x2019;s Note: The opinions expressed in the op-ed section are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/slavoj-zizek-the-magic-tricks-behind-russias-propaganda-machine/	2025-01-13T02:36:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2149287288.jpg
Ukraine's special forces claim to repel North Korean assault in Russia's Kursk Oblast, killing 17 soldiers	Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces repelled an assault by North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the unit&apos;s press service said on Jan. 13, claiming to have killed 17 North Korean soldiers. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched on Aug. 6. Ukrainian troops have continued fighting in the region, leveraging their positions for potential future negotiations. The battle, the date of which remains undisclosed, lasted from morning until night. The unit released a video of the engagement, showing what are said to be dead and dying North Korean soldiers. A Ukrainian mopping-up group encountered one surviving North Korean fighter who had set an unsuccessful trap. The soldier attempted to mislead the Ukrainian soldiers and then detonated a grenade to avoid capture, fatally injuring himself, according to the Special Operations Forces. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) claimed that North Korean casualties have already reached 300 soldiers killed and 2,700 wounded. The NIS attributed the casualties to their lack of modern warfare training, including ineffective efforts to combat long-range drones. The NIS further alleged that North Korean soldiers had been forced to commit suicide to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces, a claim echoed by White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby on Dec. 27. Kirby said that captured North Korean troops fear their families would face severe retaliation if they surrendered. On Jan. 11, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the capture of two North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast. The prisoners of war (POWs), identified by the NIS as members of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea&apos;s military intelligence agency, are in Ukrainian custody and receiving medical treatment.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-repels-north-korean-assault/	2025-01-13T02:19:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-13-at-10_55_37-AM.jpeg
Russian 'shadow fleet' tankers carrying 2 million barrels of crude idling off China’s coast, Bloomberg reports	Three tankers carrying over 2 million barrels of Russian crude oil are floating off China&apos;s coast after they were hit by fresh U.S. sanctions last week, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 13. The vessels are allegedly part of the so-called &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; a group of tankers routinely used to evade sanctions targeting Russia&apos;s oil trade. This development follows the U.S. and U.K.&apos;s most extensive sanctions on Russia&apos;s oil sector, announced on Jan. 10. The measures target over 180 vessels in the shadow fleet, along with Russian oil companies and energy officials. The Huihai Pacific, Mermar, and Olia, each carrying Eastern Siberia&#x2013;Pacific Ocean (ESPO) crude from Russia&apos;s Kozmino port, have diverted from their planned ports in China. The Huihai Pacific, initially headed for Dongjiakou in Shandong province, is now offshore, while the Mermar and Olia, bound for Yantai, are sitting in the Yellow Sea. Reuters reported on Jan. 8 that China&apos;s Shandong Port Group had prohibited U.S.-sanctioned tankers from accessing its ports in the eastern Chinese province. The shadow fleet has also been implicated in transporting sanctioned Iranian oil. The U.S. Treasury&apos;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) identified the tankers as key components of Russia&apos;s strategy to bypass restrictions on its oil exports. The sanctions aim to disrupt Moscow&apos;s ability to fund its war in Ukraine, which President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Jan. 10 a &quot;significant blow to the financial foundation of Russia&apos;s war machine.&quot; China has deepened its ties with Russia since the start of the Kremlin&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, although Beijing has denied accusations of supporting Russia&#x2019;s military efforts. The mounting economic pressure has nevertheless forced many Chinese financial institutions to scale down economic ties with Russia, fearing secondary sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-shadow-fleet-tankers-china/	2025-01-13T01:20:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/3_6978bf53.png
Biden team preparing strong Ukraine policy foundation for Trump handover, Blinken says	The Biden administration is focused on securing a strong foreign policy foundation for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s incoming administration, including on the Russia-Ukraine war, outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Jan. 12. According to Blinken, there is no sense in &quot;speculating on the point&quot; that the war may not end in Ukraine&apos;s favor under the new administration. Trump&apos;s return to the White House on Jan. 20 has sparked concern about the future of the U.S. support for Ukraine. The president-elect has previously criticized military aid for Kyiv and pledged to broker a swift end to the war. &quot;What does make sense is to make sure that we give the next administration, we give the incoming Trump administration, the strongest possible hand for it to play around the world, whether it&apos;s on Ukraine or anything else,&quot; Blinken said. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to hold a phone call soon, according to Mike Waltz, Trump&apos;s nominee for national security adviser. Trump announced on Jan. 9 that plans for a meeting with Putin are underway, though Waltz said the format of the talks remains undecided. The Kremlin welcomed Trump&apos;s readiness for dialogue but ruled out a face-to-face meeting before Trump&apos;s inauguration. Moscow previously rejected Trump&apos;s team&apos;s proposed peace plan, which included freezing front lines, delaying Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers. Outgoing President Joe Biden expressed confidence on Jan. 10 in his administration&apos;s support for Ukraine, saying, &quot;I did all I could to help,&quot; while voicing hope for continued U.S. backing under Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-team-prepares-strong-ukraine-policy-handover-to-trump-blinken-says/	2025-01-13T01:00:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170662132.jpg
Lithuania to deliver 4,500 drones to Ukraine this week	Lithuania is providing Ukraine with 4,500 drones worth 5 million euros ($5.1 million) in the coming days, Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene announced on Jan. 12. Drones have proven crucial for both sides of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Kyiv employs unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) of various types for reconnaissance and attack roles at the front lines and for long-range strikes in the Russian rear. Sakaliene&apos;s statement came shortly after the Lithuanian broadcaster LRT reported that thousands of drones, which were to be delivered to Ukraine several months ago, are still in Lithuanian warehouses as their delivery is delayed by bureaucratic obstacles. I am proud to share that Lithuania is sending 4,500 drones worth 5 million euros to Ukraine this week.In addition, during the last Government meeting, we approved a new faster procedure for transferring state assets.

Separately, Vilnius also pledged to help fund the production of Ukrainian long-range drones, focusing on Ukraine&apos;s new Palianytsia missile-like drones. &quot;In addition, during the last government meeting, we approved a new faster procedure for transferring state assets,&quot; Sakaliene said, explaining that the changes &quot;will significantly reduce the time required for procedures, ensuring that aid reaches Ukraine faster.&quot; Lithuania has been one of the staunchest supporters of Ukraine during the full-scale invasion, pledging to provide 0.25% of its GDP in military aid to Ukraine on a yearly basis. The Baltic country has supplied 840 million euros ($860 million) in security assistance to Ukraine as of October 2024, making it one of the leading donors in terms of GDP shares, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy said.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-to-deliver-4-500-drones-to-ukraine-this-week/	2025-01-13T00:50:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GhHR1TmXYAAtcJo.jpeg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 1, injure 17 over past day	Russian strikes against Ukraine killed one civilian and injured 17 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 13. Russian forces launched 110 drones at Ukraine overnight from the directions of Millerovo, Bryansk, Orel, and Primosk-Akhtarsk in Russia, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare units, and mobile firing groups shot down 78 drones in the Poltava, Sumy, Kharkiv, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi and Donetsk oblasts. Thirty-one drones were lost allegedly due to electronic warfare countermeasures. Sumy Oblast: In Sumy, debris from a Russian Shahed-type drone caused a large fire at a children&apos;s health and wellness center. No casualties were reported. An FPV drone strike in the Myropilska community damaged a bus and injured three civilians. As a result of artillery shelling, a fire broke out in a residential building in the Seredyna-Buda community, with one civilian injured, according to the regional military administration. Kherson Oblast: The Russian military attacked critical and social infrastructure facilities, as well as residential areas of the oblast&apos;s settlements. As a result of the attacks, 10 people were injured, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. Donetsk Oblast: A person was injured in Pokrovsk as a result of a Russian attack, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin Zaporizhia Oblast: Two civilians sustained blast and limb injuries during a Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia, Governor Ivan Fedorov confirmed. Kharkiv Oblast: In Kupiansk, a 70-year-old man died as a result of shelling near the territory of a civilian enterprise, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-8/	2025-01-12T23:56:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-12_16-57-51.jpg
Poland denies banning Slovak delegation's flight to Moscow through Polish airspace	The Polish Foreign Ministry denied claims by Slovak far-right lawmaker Andrej Danko that Warsaw did not permit a Slovak delegation to fly to Moscow through Polish airspace, the Polsat News channel reported on Jan. 12. &quot;We didn&apos;t refuse the flight; the Slovak side simply sent us incomplete documents... when they were asked to complete them, they informed us about the change of route,&quot; the Polish Foreign Ministry&apos;s spokesperson said. The delegation, led by Danko, Slovak National Party (SNS) chairman and deputy parliament speaker, and Tibor Gaspar, a member of Prime Minister Robert Fico&apos;s Smer (Direction) party, arrived in Moscow on Jan. 12 to discuss Russian gas supplies to Slovakia. Russian-friendly nationalist Danko earlier accused Warsaw of preventing the flight from entering its airspace, forcing the plane to travel over Czechia and Germany. &quot;I don&apos;t understand Poland&apos;s position, but I take it as a reality,&quot; he said. The Slovak delegates are expected to meet representatives of the Russian State Duma and other government officials. According to Gaspar, the group will ask whether Russia&apos;s state-owned energy company Gazprom can continue to supply gas to Slovakia despite Ukraine&apos;s decision to halt the transit of Russian gas through its territory. The stoppage of Russian gas flows via Ukraine has heightened tensions between Kyiv and Bratislava. Fico, already critical of military aid to Ukraine and sanctions against Russia, threatened to cut energy and humanitarian support after the transit deal expired. Despite the EU&apos;s attempts to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels in the wake of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, countries like Slovakia and Hungary remain heavily reliant on Russian gas. The delegation is expected to return to Slovakia on Jan. 15.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-denies-banning-slovak-delegations-flight-to-moscow-through-polish-airspace/	2025-01-12T23:15:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/473154311_18306837598206919_1258937468260133086_n.jpg
Lack of understanding of modern warfare' — Seoul reports 3,000 North Korean casualties in Russia's Kursk Oblast	At least 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and another 2,700 wounded fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) claimed on Jan. 13, according to the South Korean Yonhap news agency. The NIS attributed the high casualties to the soldiers&apos; &quot;lack of understanding of modern warfare,&quot; including their &quot;useless&quot; attempts to shoot down long-range drones. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched on Aug. 6. Ukrainian forces have continued fighting in the region, leveraging their positions for potential future negotiations. The NIS remarks follow President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s claim on Jan. 9 that North Korean forces fighting alongside Russian troops have suffered 4,000 casualties, both killed and wounded. The NIS reported that North Korea has allegedly forced its soldiers to kill themselves to avoid capture by Ukrainian troops. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby confirmed on Dec. 27 that some North Korean soldiers had taken their own lives, fearing retaliation against their families if captured. On Jan. 11, Zelensky announced the capture of two North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast. The prisoners of war (POWs), identified by the NIS as members of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea&#x2019;s military intelligence agency, are now in the custody of Ukraine&#x2019;s Security Service (SBU) and receiving medical care. Zelensky shared video footage of the SBU interrogating the POWs with the assistance of Korean translators. In the video, one soldier expressed a desire to return to North Korea, while the other said he wished to remain in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-losses-kursk/	2025-01-12T22:55:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1074306244.jpg

Russian drone strikes on Sumy Oblast spark fire at children's wellness center, 2 injured in attack on bus	Russian drones struck civilian infrastructure in Sumy Oblast on Jan. 12, leading to multiple casualties. In the regional capital Sumy, debris from a Russian Shahed-type drone caused a large fire at a children&apos;s health and wellness center, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration reported. No casualties were reported as a result of the attack, and the extent of the damage was not immediately clear. Earlier in the day, around 3:15 p.m. local time, Russian forces used a drone to strike a civilian bus in the village of Myropillia, injuring two people, the Sumy Oblast Prosecutor&apos;s Office reported. Two women, aged 30 and 42, were injured in the attack. No details were provided on the status of the victims. Shelling is a daily occurrence for the communities near Ukraine&apos;s northeastern border with Russia, with residents in the region&apos;s vulnerable border settlements experiencing multiple attacks per day. Throughout the day, Russia struck 13 communities across Sumy Oblast in 68 different attacks on the region, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration said. Russian strikes against Sumy Oblast have become increasingly destructive over the past year, amid fears that Russia may launch a new attack on Sumy Oblast in the coming months.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-strike-on-sumy-oblast-sparks-fire-in-childrens-wellness-center-2-injured-in-attack-on-bus/	2025-01-12T18:41:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-12_16-57-51.jpg
German Defense Minister denies Scholz blocked proposal for $3 billion arms package for Ukraine, says decision awaits	German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius denied media reports that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz blocked a proposal for an additional military aid package for Ukraine worth 3 billion euros ($3.09 billion), adding that a decision on the funding awaits. &quot;There is no blockade. We have prepared a new aid package for Ukraine in the Defense Ministry,&quot; Pistorius told Tagesspiegel in an interview published on Jan. 13. &quot;(A decision to approve the aid package) must now be decided politically... As soon as all questions have been clarified, I expect a corresponding decision,&quot; Pistorius added. Spiegel reported on Jan. 9, citing its undisclosed sources, that Scholz blocked a proposal for an additional military aid package, reportedly claiming that the existing allocation of 4 billion euros ($4.1 billion) for 2025, as well as funds from the $50 billion G7 loan financed by frozen Russian assets, should be sufficient support for Ukraine. Scholz also reportedly expressed concern that the new government could take on significant financial obligations after early federal elections in February if the package was allowed to go ahead. Under Scholz&apos;s leadership, Germany has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. The chancellor has nevertheless often been criticized for his cautious approach on some key issues, such as his refusal to provide Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine. The new assistance plan, proposed by German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Pistorius, was for additional weapons including three additional Iris-T air defense batteries, 10 howitzers, and more artillery ammunition, according to Spiegel. Pistorius and Baerbock hoped to gain parliamentary support for their proposal before the federal elections, and presented their proposal as &quot;a vital signal of Germany&apos;s unwavering support.&quot; Following the media reports of the blockade on Jan. 10, Baerbock neither confirmed nor denied reports of the halt in aid. Despite Scholz&apos;s lack of support, Pistorius reiterated Germany&apos;s support during a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, also known as Ramstein, on Jan. 9, according to Spiegel. Pistorius announced the provision of nearly 50 guided missiles for the Iris-T air defense system. The missiles, originally designed for the Bundeswehr, were redirected directly from production to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-defense-minister-denies-scholz-blocked-proposal-for-3-billion-arms-package-for-ukraine-says-decision-awaits/	2025-01-12T17:43:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/PistoriusRamstein.jpg
Russian-friendly incumbent Zoran Milanovic re-elected president of Croatia	Croatia&apos;s populist incumbent president, Zoran Milanovic, was re-elected to the post by a wide margin on Jan. 12, election results show. Milanovic defeated Dragan Primorac, the candidate of Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic&#x2019;s HDZ party, by a margin of 74.7% to 25.3%, with 99% of polls reporting. The total turnout sat around 44% of eligible voters. Milanovic is a staunch critic of Western aid for Ukraine as well as the country&apos;s future accession into the military alliance. He previously referred to Ukraine&apos;s 2014 Euromaidan protests as a &quot;coup d&apos;&#xE9;tat&quot; and has railed against Western allies and Ukraine for not respecting the Minsk Agreements. In October, Milanovic refused to approve the participation of Croatian soldiers in NATO&apos;s mission to support Ukraine. Milanovic&apos;s re-election to the largely symbolic position serves as a setback for Plenkovic&#x2019;s government, whose government was recently embroiled in a corruption scandal implicating a former health minister. Milanovic, who served as Croatia&apos;s prime minister from 2011 to 2016 amid the country&apos;s accession into the European Union, was first elected to the presidency in 2020 with the support of the opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP). &quot;This is the beginning of the end for Andrej Plenkovic,&quot; SDP leader Sinisa Hajdas Doncic said following Milanovic&apos;s victory. The Croatian government, mainly aligned with Plenkovic, has strongly supported military aid to Kyiv, including the delivery of 14 Mi-8 helicopters, and Plenkovic himself has made several visits to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-friendly-incumbent-zoran-milanovic-re-elected-president-of-croatia/	2025-01-12T16:09:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/gettyimages-2193017861-612x612.jpg
Sweden to increase military presence in Baltic Sea following suspected cable sabotage	Sweden will increase its military presence in the Baltic Sea through the deployment of three warships and a radar reconnaissance aircraft in response to the suspected sabotage of several underwater cables, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on Jan. 12. &quot;These warships are placed under NATO command and they are used to create better conditions for a maritime situation picture in the Baltic Sea,&quot; Kristersson said on the sidelines of a security conference in Salen. Over the past six months, several telecommunication and energy cables underneath the Baltic Sea have been damaged, with four telecom cables and one power cable severed on Dec. 25. Only two of those cables of the Christmas incident were repaired by Jan. 7. Authorities suspect the Russian shadow vessel Eagle S of the sabotage. Sweden&apos;s decisions follows soon after a decision announced by nearby NATO allies Finland and Estonia to send a fleet of up to 10 NATO vessels will guard the infrastructure under the Baltic Sea until April. The shadow fleet refers to a group of aging, poorly insured tankers Russia uses to avoid international sanctions on its oil trade. Moscow also uses these vessels for espionage. NATO previously said it is increasing its military presence in the Baltic Sea to bolster situational awareness and deter potential threats. NATO officials have raised alarm over a growing number of Russian sabotage operations in Europe since the West threw its support behind Kyiv after the outbreak of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Finland will host a summit for NATO member states with access to the Baltic Sea on Jan. 14 to address regional security threats, including the suspected Russian sabotage, the Finnish president&apos;s office announced on Jan. 8.	https://kyivindependent.com/sweden-to-increase-military-presence-in-baltic-sea-following-suspected-cable-sabotage/	2025-01-12T14:54:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1839741170.jpg
Ukrainians can help Americans protect lives' — Zelensky says Kyiv ready to send firefighters to California	Ukraine is preparing to send rescuers, including 150 firefighters, to the U.S. state of California to help combat the wildfires that have devastated the region in recent days, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 12. Wildfires have ravaged the city of Los Angeles in the past week, killing at least 16 people, displacing hundreds of thousands of residents, and destroying or damaging over 10,000 structures. &quot;Today, I instructed Ukraine&apos;s Interior Minister and our diplomats to prepare for the possible participation of our rescuers in combating the wildfires in California,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address on Jan 12. &quot;The situation there is extremely challenging, and Ukrainians can help Americans protect lives. This matter is being worked out, and through appropriate channels, we have offered our assistance to the American side. We already have 150 firefighters prepared.&quot; Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko and a team of diplomats are looking into the situation, the ministry said. Zelensky&apos;s offer of assistance comes three days after Donald Trump Jr., son of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, responded to the Los Angeles wildfires by blaming Ukraine on social media. &quot;Oh look of course the LA fire department donated a bunch of their supplies to Ukraine,&quot; Trump. Jr. said in a post on X on Jan. 8. The Los Angeles County Fire Department sent surplus materials to Ukraine back in 2022, following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The aid included boots, hoses, body armor, and medication. The donation did not likely impact the response to the current crisis, which has been exacerbated by strong winds, personnel issues, and water shortages.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-can-help-americans-protect-lives-zelensky-says-kyiv-ready-to-send-firefighters-to-california/	2025-01-12T14:31:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192311233.jpg
Serbian president offers to host Trump-Putin meeting in Belgrade	Serbia will officially offer to host the upcoming meeting between U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said in a television broadcast on Jan. 12. Trump announced on Jan. 9 that plans for a meeting with Putin were already underway, but no concrete details have been made public. Belgrade is ready to host the future meeting and can guarantee appropriate security for both leaders, Vucic told the Serbian Broadcasting Corporation (RTS). &quot;(Serbia) is the country where President Trump had the greatest support in all of Europe,&quot; Vucic said. &quot;There is no country that can compare to Serbia in terms of the level of support for President Trump. ... And on the other hand, it is a country where President Putin is still very, very popular. So, I think that this is a place on the globe that would be extremely suitable for both of them.&quot; Serbia is well-suited to host Trump and Putin because it is not a member of any military alliances, such as NATO, Vucic said. Serbia maintains a friendly attitude toward Russia and has refused to join international sanctions against Moscow in the wake of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. At the same time, Vucic has called Ukraine a &quot;friendly country&quot; and previously affirmed that Crimea and Donbas are Ukrainian sovereign territories. Switzerland has also put itself forward as a potential site for the Trump-Putin talks. Nicolas Bideau, head of communications at the Swiss Foreign Ministry, told Swiss media on Jan. 12 that Switzerland had already communicated its willingness to host the meeting. The framework of the upcoming meeting is still being determined, incoming U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said on Jan. 12. A phone call between Trump and Putin to work out the details is expected &quot;in the coming days and weeks.&quot; The Kremlin has said a face-to-face meeting between the two leaders will have to wait until after Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20.	https://kyivindependent.com/serbian-president-offers-to-host-trump-putin-meeting-in-belgrade/	2025-01-12T13:06:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192588495.jpg
The Week Ahead: Key Developments Impacting Global Politics & Markets	Editor&apos;s note: This article is an on-site version of KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter covering events from Jan. 13 to Jan. 20. Sign up here to start your week with an agenda of Ukraine-related events, delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday. With 8 eight days left until the Jan. 20 inauguration of Donald Trump, global policy makers are ramping up preparations for what a Trump 2 presidency could bring. Although the incoming administration has hardly been quite (incl. with concerning statements on NATO, Greenland, Canada and the Panama canal), the coming weeks will provide an indication on what is posturing and what is policy &#x2013; and what decisions need to be made. Military planning and security, as well as the viability of major global alliances, will be a key theme. On Jan. 13 NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte will attend a joint committee meeting at the European Parliament. The session takes place amid questions about the US commitment to European security (a live stream of Rutte&#x2019;s remarks and session transcript will be available on the NATO website). Jan. 15-16 NATO&#x2019;s Military Committee will convene in Brussels. The meeting will bring together Allied Chiefs of Defense and over 20 counterparts from NATO Partner nations to discuss strategic issues and foster cooperation in addressing global challenges. The first session will feature General Cavoli, the United States European Command commander, briefing on NATO&#x2019;s readiness to deter and defend the Euro-Atlantic region while safeguarding its one billion inhabitants. Discussions will explore NATO&#x2019;s ongoing missions and support for Ukraine, including the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU), which has taken on responsibilities to bolster Ukraine&#x2019;s defense. Rutte will join the opening session to outline key priorities and challenges for the alliance. The Ad Hoc Working Party on the Multi-Agency Donor Coordination Platform for Ukraine will convene at the European Council headquarters in Brussels on Jan. 17. This meeting will bring together representatives from EU member states, international organizations, and other stakeholders to coordinate strategies for providing aid and supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s immediate financing needs and its long-term economic recovery and reconstruction efforts. In global news, on Jan. 14 South Korea&#x2019;s Constitutional Court will begin the impeachment trial of President Yoon Suk Yeol (he will not attend, being &#x201C;holed up&#x201D; in his residence to avoid arrest). South Korea&#x2019;s internal turmoil complicates support to Ukraine, which was set to ramp up due to North Korea&#x2019;s entry into the war. In the latest chapter of France&#x2019;s tumultuous internal politics, the new centrist Prime Minister Fran&#xE7;ois Bayrou is expected to lay out his policy priorities on Tuesday Jan. 14 in his first address to the French parliament. A driving force of political disruption, TikTok is set to shut down in the US on Jan. 19 unless President-elect Donald Trump finds a way to save the platform. The Supreme Court has signaled it will uphold the ban, which could impact 170 mn US users. Looking forward, the diplomatic year will kick off in full swing with the World Economic Forum&#x2019;s Annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 20-24. Of note, Ukraine will enter a period of mostly painful historical anniversaries, starting with the Jan. 19 Hrushevskoho street riots (a turning point in the EuroMaidan revolution, following the passage of anti-protest &#x201C;dictatorial&#x201D; laws) and the Unity Day on Jan. 22 (when the West Ukrainian People&#x2019;s Republic and Ukrainian People&#x2019;s Republic formed a short-lived, independent union). This period will continue through Feb. 24, which will mark 3 years of full-scale war against Russia.

Ukraine ready to return North Korean POWs to Kim Jong Un or find 'other ways,' Zelensky says	Ukraine is prepared to send captured North Korean soldiers home if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is able to negotiate the release of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) in Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 12. Alternatively, Kyiv is willing to explore other options for North Korean soldiers who do not wish to return, he said. Zelensky&apos;s remarks come a day after the president announced on Jan. 11 that Ukrainain forces had captured two North Korean POWs in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. The wounded soldiers are in the custody of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and are reportedly receiving medical attention. &quot;In addition to the first captured soldiers from North Korea, there will undoubtedly be others,&quot; Zelensky said via his official Telegram channel on Jan. 12. &quot;It is only a matter of time before our guys manage to capture more.&quot; Ukraine is prepared to return North Korean personnel in future prisoner exchanges or explore &quot;other ways&quot; of handling those captured soldiers who do not want to go back to North Korea, according to Zelensky. &quot;Ukraine is ready to hand over his people to Kim Jong Un if he can organize their exchange for our soldiers who are held captive in Russia,&quot; he said. &quot;For those North Korean soldiers who do not want to return, there may be some other ways. In particular, those Koreans who wish to bring peace closer by spreading the truth in Korean about this war will have this opportunity.&quot; Zelensky posted video footage of the SBU&apos;s interrogation of the two POWs, mediated by Korean translators. In the video, one of the captured soldiers says he would like to return to North Korea, while the other answers that he wants to live in Ukraine. Some 12,000 North Korean soldiers have been deployed in Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August 2024. North Korean personnel have suffered high casualties while fighting alongside Russian forces, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Dec. 27 that some North Korean soldiers have reportedly taken their own lives rather than surrender to Ukrainian troops, out of fear their families will be targeted over their capture. Zelensky said on Jan. 11 that the capture of the North Korean POWs was a difficult task to carry out, as Russian and North Korean forces go to greath lengths to suppress evidence of Pyongyang&apos;s involvement.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-ready-to-return-north-korean-pows-to-kim-jong-un-or-find-other-ways-zelensky-says/	2025-01-12T12:07:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-11_13-23-36--2-.jpg
Fico refused Kyiv's offers to help with gas supplies, Zelensky says	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico refused Ukraine&apos;s offers of assistance following the discontinuation of Russian gas flows via Ukrainian territory, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 12. Zelensky&apos;s comments come shortly after Fico lambasted Ukraine as an unreliable partner and accused Zelensky of &quot;begging and blackmailing&quot; European leaders. &quot;We offered our assistance to the people of Slovakia during their adaptation to the absence of Russian gas transit, but Fico arrogantly refused,&quot; Zelensky said in a post on X. &quot;Many in Europe warned him that doing nothing and waiting was not an option. Now, he&apos;s resorting to PR, lies, and loud accusations to shift the blame away from himself onto someone else.&quot; Ukraine did not renew a pre-war agreement to transit Russian gas to Europe via Ukrainian territory, instead allowing the deal to expire on Jan. 1. Kyiv warned repeatedly that it would not extend the deal in order to stop financing Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Slovakia, still heavily reliant on Russian gas even as other EU countries find alternative energy providers, harshly criticized Ukraine&apos;s decision. Fico has threatened to cut off humanitarian aid and electricity supplies to Ukraine in retaliation. Zelensky condemned Fico&apos;s threat, accusing him of opening &quot;a second energy front against Ukraine&quot; at the behest of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Fico met with Putin in Moscow on Dec. 22, a week before the transit deal was set to expire. A delegation of Slovak far-right MPs also departed for Moscow on Jan. 12 to hold talks with Russian government officials on continuing gas supplies and other issues. Zelensky said that Fico&apos;s refusal to find an alternative energy supplier was the result of his misplaced loyalty to Russia. &quot;But the real problem is that he bet on Moscow, not on his own country, not on a united Europe, and certainly not on common sense,&quot; Zelensky said on Jan. 12. &quot;From the beginning, it was a losing bet.&quot; Zelensky said he hoped that Europe and the U.S. would collaborate effectively to diversify energy supplies to Europe and &#xA0;&quot;address the challenges caused by the shortsightedness of certain European figures.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-refused-kyivs-offers-to-help-with-gas-supplies-zelensky-says/	2025-01-12T11:19:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187689001.jpg
Far-right Slovak delegation flies to Moscow for talks on Russian gas supplies	A group of far-right Slovak MPs departed for Moscow on Jan. 12 to hold talks with Russian government officials on the continuation of Russian gas supplies and other issues, the Slovak news agency TASR reported. The visit comes weeks after Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin on Dec. 22. The delegation is led by Andrej Danko, the chair of the co-ruling far-right Slovak National Party (SNS) and current deputy speaker of parliament, and Tibor Gaspar, a member of Fico&apos;s Smer (Direction) party, TASR reported. Danko, a Russian-friendly nationalist, said on Jan. 5 that the visit aims to &quot;restore some relations with Russia.&quot; Danko also claimed that Poland refused to allow the delegation&apos;s flight to enter their airspace, and that their plane had to be rerouted via Czechia and Germany. &quot;I don&apos;t understand Poland&apos;s position, but I take it as a reality,&quot; he said. The Slovak delegates will reportedly meet with representatives from the Russian State Duma and other government officials. According to Gaspar, the group will ask whether Russia&apos;s state-owned energy company Gazprom can continue to supply gas to Slovakia despite Ukraine&apos;s decision to halt the transit of Russian gas through its territory. The stoppage of Russian gas flows via Ukraine has heightened tensions between Kyiv and Bratislava. Fico, already critical of military aid to Ukraine and sanctions against Russia, threatened to cut energy and humanitarian support after the transit deal expired. Despite the EU&apos;s attempts to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels in the wake of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, countries like Slovakia and Hungary remain heavily reliant on Russian gas. The delegation is expected to return to Slovakia on Jan. 15.	https://kyivindependent.com/far-right-slovak-delegation-flies-to-moscow-for-talks-on-russian-gas-supplies/	2025-01-12T10:19:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/danko-1.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: 'Irrefutable evidence of North Korea's involvement' — Ukraine says it captured 2 North Korean POWs in Kursk Oblast	Key developments on Jan. 12: Ukrainian troops captured two North Korean soldiers as prisoners of war (POWs) in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 11. &quot;This task was not easy,&quot; he said in a Telegram post. &quot;Usually, Russia and other North Korean military personnel finish off their wounded and do everything possible to ensure that no evidence of the participation of another state &#x2014; North Korea &#x2014; in the war against Ukraine is preserved.&quot; The two wounded soldiers received necessary medical care and are in the custody of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) in Kyiv, according to Zelensky. The president applauded Ukrainian paratroopers and soldiers from the Special Operation Forces for capturing the North Koreans. North Korea deployed around 12,000 soldiers in Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August 2024 to bring the war to Russia, a senior Ukrainian official familiar with the intelligence told the Kyiv Independent in December 2024. Zelensky&apos;s statement comes nearly two weeks after the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS) said that Ukrainian troops had captured a wounded North Korean soldier in late December who died soon of his wounds. &quot;We confirmed through a friendly nation&apos;s intelligence organization that a North Korean soldier, captured alive on Dec. 26, died a short while ago as (his) wounds worsened,&quot; the NIS said on Dec. 27, as cited by South Korean Yonhap News Agency. Applauding the &quot;irrefutable evidence&quot; of North Korean soldiers&apos; participation in the Russian war against Ukraine, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on Jan. 11 that the POWs are being questioned with the help of Korean translators and South Korean intelligence. A Ukrainian drone hit the Taneko oil refinery in Tatarstan, Russian Telegram channel ASTRA reported on Jan. 11. The refinery is one of the country&apos;s largest oil-processing facilities. Workers at the refinery in Nizhnekamsk were evacuated amid the attack, and local footage showed smoke rising from the site. Andrii Kovalenko, Head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation, confirmed the strike, and emphasized its strategic importance. &quot;The refinery plays a key role in providing fuel to the Russian military. Taking out refineries and oil depots directly affects Russia&apos;s ability to wage an intensive war,&quot; he said. The refinery, which processes over 16 million tons of oil annually, was previously targeted in a drone attack in spring 2024, causing damage to its primary processing unit. Taneko refinery is located in the city of Nizhnekamsk, around 1,300 kilometers from the country&apos;s border with Ukraine. Russian troops have carried out a double airstrike on a nursing home in the Ukrainian-occupied Russian town of Sudzha, Kursk Oblast, Ukrainian military spokesperson Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, said on Jan. 12. According to Dmytrashkivskyi, the attack, which took place on the evening of Jan. 11, left one woman with severe arm injuries, who died later in the morning of Jan. 12. The attack also dealt heavy damage to the nursing home, with all windows and doors blown out, Dmytrashkivskyi added, speaking on national television. According to him, around 2,000 Russian civilians remain in areas under Ukrainian control. Over 70 people are currently staying in the nursing home that came under attack. &quot;The question now is where to relocate these people. Most are elderly, and many suffer from disabilities, Parkinson&apos;s disease, post-stroke conditions, and one individual has a mental illness. The current state of these people is quite severe,&quot; the spokesperson said. In a comment to the Kyiv Independent, Dmytrashkivskyi confirmed that the facility damaged was the same nursing home visited by media, including the Kyiv Independent, on press tours of Sudzha organized by the Ukrainian military. The news comes days after Ukraine reportedly launched renewed offensive operations in Kursk Oblast, which is seen as a crucial bargaining chip for potential peace negotiations. Russian troops have been spotted dressing in civilian clothing to mask their movements in Toretsk, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s 28th Mechanized Brigade reported on Jan. 12. Aerial reconnaissance footage posted by the brigade on Facebook shows a couple of alleged Russian soldiers dressed in civilian clothes. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the images. The brigade said it was &quot;another violation of the rules of warfare&quot; by Russian troops, as it can be classified as a war crime under international law. According to the brigade, Russian infantrymen &quot;attempt to divert attention and disguise themselves&quot; in this way. &quot;However, they are exposed by their identical clothing, behavior, and sometimes even their weapons,&quot; the brigade wrote. &quot;Nevertheless, this still complicates the work of our soldiers, as the Ukrainian Armed Forces do not &apos;shoot at everything that moves,&apos; unlike (Russian) occupiers.&quot; Back in September, Ukraine accused Russian forces of 137,000 war crimes carried out as part of its full-scale invasion. Crimes include the mass abduction of Ukrainian children, the torture of residents in occupied territories, and the murder of civilians and Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs). Earlier on Jan. 6, Ukraine&#x2019;s Ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, reported that Russian troops had allegedly killed three Ukrainian POWs in the southwest of Donetsk Oblast. &quot;We are once again witnessing atrocities that demonstrate Russia&apos;s true face,&quot; the ombudsman said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-irrefutable-evidence-of-north-koreas-involvement-ukraine-says-it-captured-2-north-korean-pows-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-01-12T09:28:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/uwl.jpeg
Trump, Putin call expected in near future, incoming national security adviser says	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to hold a telephone call &quot;in the coming days and weeks,&quot; Mike Waltz, Trump&apos;s nominee for national security adviser, told ABC News on Jan. 12. Waltz&apos;s comments come shortly after Trump announced on Jan. 9 that plans for a meeting between the two leaders were already in the works. &quot;The preparations are underway,&quot; Waltz told ABC News in response to a question about the upcoming meeting. &quot;You can&apos;t enter a deal if you don&apos;t have some type of relationship or dialogue with the other side and we will absolutely establish that in the coming months.&quot; Waltz did not set a date for the planned meeting. When asked if the talks would include President Volodymyr Zelensky, he said the format of the meeting had not yet been determined. &quot;Well, we haven&apos;t set the exact framework for it yet, we&apos;re working on that, but I do expect a call, at least in the coming days and weeks, so that would be a step, and we&apos;ll take it from there,&quot; Waltz said. Switzerland has indicated its willingness to host an in-person meeting between Trump and Putin, Nicolas Bideau, head of communications at the Swiss Foreign Ministry, said on Jan. 12. Waltz did not provide any information on where the upcoming meeting might take place. The Kremlin on Jan. 10 said it &quot;welcomed&quot; Trump&apos;s readiness for dialogue on Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, but said no concrete plans had been made and a face-to-face meeting would not occur until after Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20. Moscow has previously rejected the terms of a peace proposal leaked by Trump&apos;s team, one that involved freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground. While Waltz did not go into specifics regarding the content of the talks or plans for peace, he did mention Ukraine&apos;s &quot;manpower issues&quot; and said Kyiv could resolve them by lowering the draft age from 26 to 18. &quot;If Ukrainians have asked the entire world to be all in for democracy, we need them to be all in for democracy ... We need to see those manpower issues addressed,&quot; he said. Waltz also said it wasn&apos;t &quot;realistic&quot; to expect a complete withdrawal of Russian troops from occupied regions of Ukraine, including Crimea. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-putin-call-expected-in-near-future-incoming-national-security-adviser-says/	2025-01-12T08:55:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1229490488.jpg

Earlier on Jan. 6, Ukraine&#x2019;s Ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, reported that Russian troops had allegedly killed three Ukrainian POWs in the southwest of Donetsk Oblast. &quot;We are once again witnessing atrocities that demonstrate Russia&apos;s true face,&quot; the ombudsman said. &#x200C; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;&#x200C;	https://kyivindependent.com/military-russian-troops-dress-as-civilians-in-toretsk-donetsk-oblast/	2025-01-12T07:37:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-12-17_04_54.jpeg
New Kursk offensive and French-trained brigade scandal | Ukraine This Week	This Sunday, the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Anna Belokur covers the trending news of the week from developments on the front lines to the Ramstein meeting with top officials.

Russia launched double airstrike on nursing home in Kursk Oblast, military claims	Russian troops have carried out a double airstrike on a nursing home in the Ukrainian-occupied Russian town of Sudzha, Kursk Oblast, Ukrainian military spokesperson Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, said on Jan. 12. According to Dmytrashkivskyi, the attack, which took place on the evening of Jan. 11, left one woman with severe arm injuries, who died later in the morning of Jan. 12. The attack also damaged a nursing home heavily, with all windows and doors shattered, Dmytrashkivskyi added, speaking on national television. According to him, around 2,000 Russian civilians remain in areas under Ukrainian control. Over 70 people are currently staying in the nursing home that came under attack. &quot;The question now is where to relocate these people. Most are elderly, and many suffer from disabilities, Parkinson&apos;s disease, post-stroke conditions, and one individual has a mental illness. The current state of these people is quite severe,&quot; the spokesperson said. A nursing home in Sudzha, Kursk Oblast, Russia, damaged by a Russian airstrike on Jan. 11, 2024. (TRO Media/Courtesy)In a comment to the Kyiv Indpendent, Dmytrashkivskyi confirmed that the facility damaged was the same nursing home visited by media, including the Kyiv Independent, on press tours of Sudzha. The news comes days after Ukraine reportedly launched renewed offensive operations in Kursk Oblast, which is seen as a crucial bargaining chip for potential peace negotiations. Ukrainian forces launched a large-scale operation in Kursk Oblast in early August, allegedly capturing up to 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian soil. Since then, Russia has deployed reinforcements &#x2014; including North Korean soldiers &#x2014; in the area and reportedly retook around half of the lost territory. Earlier on Jan. 11, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Ukrainian troops captured two North Korean soldiers as prisoners of war (POWs) in Kursk Oblast. &quot;This task was not easy,&quot; he said in a Telegram post. &quot;Usually, Russia and other North Korean military personnel finish off their wounded and do everything possible to ensure that no evidence of the participation of another state &#x2014; North Korea &#x2014; in the war against Ukraine is preserved.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launched-double-airstrike-on-nursing-home-in-kursk-oblast-military-claims/	2025-01-12T06:00:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/signal-2025-01-12-154342_003.jpeg
Switzerland ready to host Trump-Putin meeting	Switzerland has expressed its readiness to host a high-level meeting between U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Nicolas Bideau, head of communications at the Swiss Foreign Ministry, told Swiss newspaper Le Temps. According to the publication, Bideau referenced the global peace summit held in Switzerland in June, saying that following the summit, Ukraine, Russia, and the United States have been regularly informed of Switzerland&apos;s willingness to facilitate diplomatic initiatives. &quot;Following the B&#xFC;rgenstock summit, Ukraine, Russia and the United States were regularly informed of our willingness to support diplomatic efforts to find peace,&quot; Bideau said, as quoted by Le Temps. Bideau&#x2019;a address comes as the Kremlin signaled willingness to meet Trump to hammer out a deal on ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. No concrete plans or date have been set, though Moscow said any face-to-face meeting would occur only after Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table and swiftly end the full-scale war that nears its third anniversary. Earlier this week, he told reporters that arrangements for a meeting with Putin are underway. The U.S. president-elect also said that specific peace proposals are still being worked out. A pitch leaked from Trump&apos;s team &#x2014; freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2014; has already been rejected by Russia. However, one obstacle to a Trump-Putin meeting could be an arrest warrant that the International Criminal Court issued for Putin in March 2023, for allegedly overseeing the forced deportations of Ukrainian children to Russia. According to the Ukrainian national database, Russia has forcibly deported over 19,500 Ukrainian children since the start of the full-scale war. Less than 400 have been brought back to Ukraine. As a signatory to the Rome Statute, Switzerland is legally required to arrest Putin. According to Le Temps, Bideau said the Federal Council has the authority to grant exceptions in situations involving peace negotiations. The push for peace talks comes as both Kyiv and Moscow face mounting challenges connected to the ongoing war. Ukrainian forces struggle to hold back Russia&apos;s advance in the east due to manpower shortages while the future of Western support grows uncertain under Trump. Chances of retaking the fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory that Russia occupies appear increasingly slim, at least in the foreseeable future. In turn, Russia is grappling with soaring inflation caused by record military spending, and its casualties are believed to range between 600,000-800,000 dead and wounded, exceeding all of Moscow&apos;s post-World War II conflicts combined.	https://kyivindependent.com/switzerland-ready-to-host-trump-putin-meeting/	2025-01-12T03:34:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1152488863.jpg
Over 130 people, including 12 children, evacuated from Donetsk Oblast on Jan. 11	Over the past day, 132 people, including 12 children, were evacuated from the front-line area of Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on the morning of Jan. 12. Amid fierce Russian offensives and daily attacks on the area, Donetsk Oblast authorities intensified evacuation efforts during the summer and autumn, with police, military, and volunteers helping civilians flee the region. However, despite calls from officials, as of early January, around 307,000 civilians reportedly remained in Ukrainian-controlled parts of Donetsk Oblast. According to Filashkin, Russian troops shelled the settlements of Donetsk Oblast 20 times over the past day, killing one person in the village of Hryshyne, not far from Pokrovsk. Five people were injured in the village of Bilytske and two more in Kostiantynivka, Filashkin wrote on Facebook. The aftermath of Russian attacks on Donetsk Oblast on Jan. 11. (Vadym Filashkin/Facebook) Over 60 houses suffered damage due to Russian attacks on Donetsk Oblast on Jan. 11, according to Filashkin. Russian troops are continuing to push on the Lyman, Siversk, Kramatorsk, Toretsk, Pokrovsk and Kurakhove axes, according to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. Pokrovsk and Kurakhove remain the focal points of the Russian eastern offensive, now in its fifth month.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-130-people-including-12-children-evacuated-from-front-line-area-of-donetsk-oblast/	2025-01-12T02:37:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-12-12_03_09.jpeg
Ukraine downs 60 Russian drones overnight, Air Force reports	Ukrainian forces shot down 60 Russian attack drones overnight, the Air Force reported on the morning of Jan. 12. Russia launched a total of 94 Shahed-type and decoy drones from the areas of its Millerovo, Oryol, Bryansk, and Kursk, according to the report. The Air Force said it also lost track of the 34 decoy drones that Russia launched alongside the attack ones. The drones were shot down over Poltava, Sumy, Kharkiv, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kirovohrad, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, and Donetsk oblasts. Falling debris from downed drones caused damage to several residential houses in Kharkiv, Sumy, and Poltava regions, the Air Force said. However, there were no casualties. Russian drone attacks across Ukraine surged to record levels in the last months of 2024, with Moscow aiming to ramp up UAV production in the new year. Drone strikes have targeted Ukrainian residential neighborhoods and critical energy infrastructure. On Dec. 29, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia has escalated its aerial assault on Ukraine, launching more than 280 glide bombs, nearly 370 attack drones, and over 80 missiles in the past week. &quot;Our cities and communities are under constant Russian attacks. Even on Christmas night, Russia organized a massive air attack,&quot; Zelensky wrote on Telegram, sharing footage of the destruction across Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-downs-60-russian-drones-overnight-air-force-reports/	2025-01-12T00:27:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183433232.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 808,250 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 808,250 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 12. This number includes 1,750 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,756 tanks, 20,289 armored fighting vehicles, 33,598 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,839 artillery systems, 1,260 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,042 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 22,021 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-808-250-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-11T23:44:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188757384.jpg
Transnistria eases blackouts amid gas shortage	Authorities in Moldova&apos;s Russian-controlled region of Transnistria announced on Jan. 11 that energy-saving measures have allowed them to ease restrictions caused by a halt of Russian gas supplies. The duration of rolling blackouts is set to decrease further. Moldova&apos;s pro-European central government said Moscow is responsible for the energy crisis. Transnistria, a Russian-occupied region since the Soviet Union&apos;s collapse, has historically relied on Russian gas transported via Ukraine. The region has faced industrial collapse due to widespread power outages and heating failures. The Russian state energy company Gazprom halted gas deliveries to Moldova on Jan. 1, as Ukraine declined to extend a gas transit agreement into 2025, triggering an energy emergency in the Russian-occupied region. The self-proclaimed authorities in Transnistria never paid Gazprom for the gas they consumed, while Moscow continued to charge Moldova for it. Chisinau refused to cover the cost. Transnistria&apos;s Russian-installed officials reported on the region&apos;s Telegram channel that rolling blackouts, initially lasting eight hours earlier this week, were cut to five hours on Jan. 10 and would be reduced to three hours on Sunday. First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Obolonik said: &quot;With current super efficiencies in consumption, Transnistria has enough gas until the end of January.&quot; To manage the shortages, many factories have shifted to night shifts to reduce grid strain. However, a cement factory in Rybnitsa has shut down, along with a critical steel mill in another city, according to Reuters. Russian gas to Transnistria powers a thermal plant that supplies electricity to the separatist region and much of Moldova&apos;s government-controlled areas. Daniel Voda, press secretary for Moldova&apos;s central government, criticized Moscow&apos;s role in the crisis, adding that Russia uses energy as a political weapon. &quot;Every time that Russia wants to show its might, it cuts off vital resources and turns people into hostages,&quot; Voda reportedly said. &quot;This is an experiment using people that shows that Moscow is not worried about residents&#x2019; comfort and security. ... No one deserves to live in fear and in the cold.&quot; Although the Moldovan government has offered assistance to help Transnistria address its energy shortages, the region&apos;s leadership denies receiving any formal proposals.	https://kyivindependent.com/transnistria-eases-blackouts-amid-gas-shortage/	2025-01-11T20:40:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1247343791.jpg
Russia condemns new US sanctions on energy sector, says it will continue oil and gas projects	Russia criticized the latest U.S. sanctions targeting its energy sector on Jan. 11, describing them as an effort to harm Russia&apos;s economy while risking instability in global markets. Despite this, the country&apos;s Foreign Ministry said Russia would continue pursuing major oil and gas projects. The ministry condemned Washington&apos;s &quot;hostile&quot; actions, announced on Jan. 10, and noted that Russia would craft its foreign policy strategy in response. The ministry argued the sanctions represented &quot;an attempt to inflict at least some damage to the Russian economy, even at the cost of the risk of destabilising world markets as the end approaches of President Joe Biden&apos;s inglorious tenure in power.&quot; The sanctions mark the most extensive U.S. measures yet against Russia&apos;s oil and gas revenue streams. They aim to provide Kyiv and the incoming administration of Donald Trump with leverage to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned Gazprom Neft, Surgutneftegas, and 183 vessels involved in transporting Russian oil, many of which belong to the so-called shadow fleet of aging tankers operated by non-Western companies. Combined, Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas reportedly produce over 1 million barrels of oil daily, generating an estimated $23 billion of revenue annually, according to the U.S. Treasury. President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the sanctions, saying they would &quot;deliver a significant blow&quot; to Russia. &quot;The less revenue Russia earns from oil ... the sooner peace will be restored,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-condemns-new-us-sanctions-on-energy-sector-says-it-will-continue-oil-and-gas-projects/	2025-01-11T17:46:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1601789399.jpg
EU to start drafting new sanctions against Russia next week, media reports	The European Commission plans to begin drafting new sanctions against Russia next week, with the goal of approving the package on Feb. 24 &#x2014; the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Polish RMF FM reports. Starting Jan. 14, the European Commission will hold consultations with EU member states on the 16th sanctions package, according to European diplomats. During these discussions, EU ambassadors will share their proposals and address concerns related to the upcoming measures. Once this process is complete, the European Commission will present its own proposals, which require unanimous support from all EU countries. Poland, currently holding the EU presidency, is pushing for the sanctions package to be finalized by the war&apos;s anniversary on Feb. 24. Slovakia and Hungary are likely to oppose the new sanctions package, complicating the process, according to the outlet. The EU approved its 15th package against Moscow on Dec. 16. That package targeted 54 individuals and 30 organizations from Russia, China, and North Korea as well as shipping companies helping Russia to sell its crude oil, filling Moscow&apos;s coffers amid the full-scale war. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-to-start-drafting-new-sanctions-against-russia-next-week-media-reports/	2025-01-11T15:56:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1882258789.jpg
Ukrainian drone hits large oil refinery in Russia’s Tatarstan, head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation confirms	A Ukrainian drone hit the Taneko oil refinery in Tatarstan, Russian Telegram channel ASTRA reported on Jan. 11. The refinery is one of the country&apos;s largest oil-processing facilities. Workers at the refinery in Nizhnekamsk were evacuated amid the attack, and local footage showed smoke rising from the site. Andrii Kovalenko, Head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation, confirmed the strike, and emphasized its strategic importance. &quot;The refinery plays a key role in providing fuel to the Russian military. Taking out refineries and oil depots directly affects Russia&apos;s ability to wage an intensive war,&quot; he said. The refinery, which processes over 16 million tons of oil annually, was previously targeted in a drone attack in spring 2024, causing damage to its primary processing unit. Taneko refinery is located in the city of Nizhnekamsk, around 1,300 kilometers from the country&apos;s border with Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drone-hits-large-oil-refinery-in-russias-tatarstan-head-of-ukraines-center-for-countering-disinformation-confirms/	2025-01-11T13:11:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/astra.jpg
Fico accuses Zelensky of 'begging' and 'blackmailing' European leaders for support	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico called Ukraine an unreliable partner and accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of blackmailing European leaders for support at a parliamentary meeting on Jan. 10. &quot;He [Zelensky] goes around Europe, just begging and blackmailing others, asking for money,&#x201D; he said. Fico posted a video from the meeting on his Facebook page afterward, with some of his quotes. The meeting, convened by the opposition, sought explanations for Fico&#x2019;s recent meeting with Vladimir Putin in Moscow and questioned Slovakia&#x2019;s future energy policies. Fico claimed that Zelensky disrupted a gas transit agreement between Russia and Azerbaijan that would have benefited Slovakia. Kyiv terminated Russian gas transit on Jan. 1, citing its refusal to finance Russia&#x2019;s war. Slovakia, which had previously imported Russian gas through Ukraine, has voiced concerns over the decision&apos;s economic impact. Fico said that Slovakia could halt its humanitarian aid to Ukraine, cut or cancel social benefits for Ukrainian refugees, and cease emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine. He also suggested using Slovakia&apos;s veto power over EU decisions as leverage against Kyiv. &quot;It just has to stop,&quot; he said, and added that he was sometimes &quot;fed up with&#x201D; Zelensky. Fico then described Russia as a reliable energy partner, stating, &quot;Russia has never deceived us, unlike Ukraine.&quot; He also recalled a 2009 incident where he claimed Ukraine&#x2019;s leadership refused to supply Slovakia with gas during a crisis, referring to it as &quot;typical Ukrainians.&quot; Fico met with Putin at the Kremlin during a visit on Dec. 22 to discuss gas supplies. The visit by the Russian-friendly leader was heavily criticized by EU and Ukrainian officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-accuses-zelensky-of-begging-and-blackmailing-european-leaders-for-support/	2025-01-11T11:04:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190743977.jpg
Taliban-led Afghanistan became leading purchaser of Russian flour in 2024	Afghanistan became the largest importer of Russian flour in 2024, Russia&apos;s state agricultural export agency Agroexport reported on Jan. 10. The purchases doubled, compared to the previous year, to nearly $80 million. This surge aligns with Russia&#x2019;s efforts to strengthen ties with the Taliban government, including recent steps toward officially recognizing the regime. Afghanistan depends on imported flour due to limited domestic production capacity. Russia&#x2019;s overall flour exports reached $300 million in 2024, with China and Turkmenistan also among the top buyers. Russia has maintained contact with the Taliban-ruled Afghanistan without officially recognizing the new authorities. Russia&apos;s Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu visited Afghanistan on Nov. 25, saying that the removal of the Taliban from the list of terrorist groups is in its &quot;final stage.&quot; &quot;Let me confirm our readiness to establish a constructive political dialogue between our countries and among the goals would be providing an impulse for the process of a settlement among Afghans,&quot; Shoigu reportedly said. &quot;We have tried to ensure conditions for a growth in exports of Afghan goods and a growth in foreign investment.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/taliban-led-afghanistan-became-leading-purchaser-of-russian-flour-in-2024/	2025-01-11T10:18:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1233884544.jpg
41-year-old Latvian volunteer soldier killed in Luhansk Oblast on Christmas	Edgars Platonovs, a 41-year-old Latvian volunteer soldier fighting for Ukraine, was killed in action in December on the eastern front, the Latvian Armed Forces reported on Jan. 10. Platonovs was fighting in the areas near the village of Novoiehorivka in the largely Russian-occupied Luhansk Oblast as part of the Ukrainian military&apos;s International Legion, composed of mostly foreign volunteers, according to the Latvian Armed Forces. The military said that the volunteer was killed on Dec. 25, 2024. Platonovs&apos; death is among the huge costs that Ukraine and those helping the country have had to pay to fend off the relentless Russian offensives since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Many foreign fighters &#x2013;&#xA0;like Platonovs &#x2013; were killed and wounded in Ukraine, but Kyiv has not disclosed the casualty figures. &quot;Another of our volunteer soldiers has died defending the freedom and independence of Ukraine. Our deepest condolences to the relatives and comrades of Edgars Platonovs,&quot; Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics said on social media platform X, adding: &quot;Eternal memory to the hero!&quot; Unlike many other foreign volunteers, Platonovs had not served in the Latvian Armed Forces before arriving in Ukraine. His family praised him as a &quot;loving son, our older, strong and caring brother, who always did everything with all his heart and conviction,&quot; as cited by Delfi news website. &quot;Edgars was a kind, sincere and always positive person who never lost faith in himself and his principles,&quot; his family said, according to Delfi. Earlier in October 2023, a Russian drone attack had killed another Lithuanian &#x2013; 28-year-old Vitalijs Smirnovs &#x2013; in the Lyman area of Donetsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/41-year-old-latvian-volunteer-soldier-killed-in-luhansk-oblast-on-christmas/	2025-01-11T07:58:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Latvia-1.jpeg
West must show Putin that 'Russia is no longer an empire,' Boris Johnson says	The West must get it across to Vladimir Putin that Russia is no longer an empire, former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in an online interview with Delfi published on Jan. 10, calling the Russian leader a &quot;f***ing idiot.&quot; Johnson made a parallel to the British Empire, saying that though almost nothing is left of the once-greatest empire in the world, the U.K. is content in its post-imperialist role. Talking in the context of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, the ex-prime minister called for Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO and criticized the alliance&apos;s &quot;chronically ambiguous&quot; approach toward Kyiv. In office between 2019 and 2022, Johnson was one of the staunchest supporters of Ukraine at the onset of the full-scale invasion, visiting the country several times during the war. The former head of the British government told the Baltic news outlet that Russia&apos;s war is &quot;archaic and barbaric&quot; and that Moscow needs to learn that Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and other countries are also not part of the Russian empire anymore. As Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion nears its third anniversary, Russian forces continue to occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine&apos;s sovereign territory. Moscow illegally declared the annexation of four partially occupied regions in September 2022, in addition to Ukraine&apos;s Crimean Peninsula seized in 2014.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-must-understand-that-russia-is-no-longer-an-empire-boris-johnson-says/	2025-01-11T07:46:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2184238205.jpg
Ukraine mulls buying Italian air defenses with frozen Russian assets' proceeds	Kyiv and Rome are discussing the possibility of purchasing Italian-made air defense systems and ammunition using profits from immobilized Russian assets, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said on Jan. 11. &quot;We are interested, among other things, in ammunition of various calibers and air defense systems,&quot; Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Anatolii Klochko said after talks with Italian defense officials. Italy delivered a highly advanced SAMP/T system to Ukraine in cooperation with France in 2023. The second system was said to have been in late September 2024. Last December, the Italian government approved a decree extending Italy&apos;s military support for Ukraine through the year 2025. The Western countries and other partners immobilized around $300 billion in sovereign Russian assets placed in their bank accounts at the start of the full-scale war. While Kyiv called for the full confiscation of these funds, the G7 has instead announced a $50 billion loan for Ukraine that will be paid back through profits generated by the frozen assets. The funds will be used for the country&apos;s reconstruction and military needs. The scheme allows Ukraine to obtain arms without relying on Western donations or further straining its already tight budget.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-wants-to-buy-italian-air-defenses-with-russian-frozen-asset-proceeds/	2025-01-11T05:59:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/whatsapp-image-2025-01-11-at-10-25-46-95670da282.webp
Ukraine captures 2 North Korean soldiers in Russia's Kursk Oblast, Zelensky says	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. Ukrainian troops captured two North Korean soldiers as prisoners of war (POWs) in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 11. &quot;This task was not easy,&quot; he said in a Telegram post. &quot;Usually, Russia and other North Korean military personnel finish off their wounded and do everything possible to ensure that no evidence of the participation of another state &#x2013; North Korea &#x2013; in the war against Ukraine is preserved.&quot; The two wounded soldiers received necessary medical care and are in the custody of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) in Kyiv, according to Zelensky. The president applauded Ukrainian paratroopers and soldiers from the Special Operation Forces for capturing the North Koreans. North Korea deployed around 12,000 soldiers in Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August to bring the war to Russia, a senior Ukrainian official familiar with the intelligence told the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-captured-2-north-korean-soldiers-as-pows-in-russias-kursk-oblast-zelensky-says/	2025-01-11T04:11:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-11_13-23-34.jpg
Putin to push for barring Ukraine's NATO accession in expected talks with Trump, FT reports	Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s main goals in any peace negotiations include prohibiting Ukraine from ever entering NATO and reducing allied military presence in the eastern flank, the Financial Times reported on Jan. 10, citing a former Kremlin official and a source who discussed the matter with Putin. The news comes as the Kremlin signaled willingness to meet U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to hammer out a deal on ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. No concrete plans or date have been set, though Moscow said any face-to-face meeting would occur only after Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table and swiftly end the full-scale war that nears its third anniversary. Earlier this week, he told reporters that arrangements for a meeting with Putin are underway. The U.S. president-elect said previously that specific peace proposals are still being worked out. A pitch leaked from Trump&apos;s team &#x2014; freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2014; has already been rejected by Russia. Trump&apos;s incoming peace envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said that the president-elect&apos;s aim is not to &quot;give something to Putin or the Russians&quot; but to &quot;save Ukraine and save their sovereignty.&quot; Nevertheless, Trump has often voiced sympathies for the Russian leader, prompting fears he might cut a deal unfavorable to Ukraine. Putin&apos;s two reported main goals mirror demands raised by Moscow shortly before the start of the full-scale invasion. The Biden administration and NATO allies rejected the demands at the time. Ukraine has ramped up its efforts to join the alliance after the outbreak of the full-scale war, calling in the best possible guarantee that Russia will not resume its aggression in the future. President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested that Ukraine could enter NATO gradually, with the collective defense principle initially not extending to occupied territories. The push for peace talks comes as both Kyiv and Moscow face mounting challenges connected to the ongoing war. Ukrainian forces struggle to hold back Russia&apos;s advance in the east due to manpower shortages while the future of Western support grows uncertain under Trump. Chances of retaking the fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory that Russia occupies appear increasingly slim, at least in the foreseeable future. In turn, Russia grapples with soaring inflation caused by record military spending, and its casualties are believed to range between 600,000-800,000 dead and wounded, outpacing all of Moscow&apos;s post-World War II conflicts combined.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-to-push-for-barring-ukraines-nato-accession-in-potential-talks-with-trump-ft-reports/	2025-01-11T04:01:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1229490488.jpg
Germany towing disabled tanker from Russia's 'shadow fleet' in Baltic Sea	Germany said on Jan. 11 that it had established towing connections with a disabled tanker Eventin, which it said was part of Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; used to avert sanctions, to prevent an oil spill in the Baltic Sea. &quot;The towing convoy is moving eastwards to a position northeast of Cape Arkona (R&#xFC;gen),&quot; Germany&apos;s Central Command for Maritime Emergencies (CCME) said, referring to the German island in the southwestern part of the Baltic Sea. &quot;The emergency command is continuously assessing the situation in order to be able to react to any changes,&quot; the command said, adding that the towing convoy is moving at the speed of 2.5 kilometers per hour, navigating through strong winds. Russia has used murky ships for oil exports to circumvent sanctions imposed by Western nations for waging its brutal war against Ukraine. The Panamanian-flagged tanker, loaded with about 99,000 tons of oil, was sailing from Russia to Egypt, according to the CCME. The tanker was unable to maneuver since Jan. 10 and has been slowly drifting in the Baltic Sea coastal waters, north of R&#xFC;gen, the CCME said in its daily updates. Speaking to the press on Jan. 10, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock slammed Russia for threatening European security with its use of &quot;dilapidated oil tankers,&quot; AFP reported. &quot;By ruthlessly deploying a fleet of rusty tankers, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is not only circumventing the sanctions, but is also willingly accepting that tourism on the Baltic Sea will come to a standstill&quot; if an accident occurs, Baerbock said, as cited by AFP. The reports of the stricken vessel come a month after two Russian tankers were damaged by a storm in December in the Kerch Strait. The vessels, each reportedly carrying 4,000 tons of fuel, began leaking into the Black Sea. Russia has caused massive environmental damage in and outside Ukraine, including the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka Dam in June 2023 and subsequent flooding, widespread forest fires, and the devastation of wide stretches of farmland. Germany said that no oil leaks had been detected after the Jan. 10 incident. By the time of the publication, it was unclear whether there were suspicions of sabotage that may have caused the adrift. &#xA0; &quot;Since Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, the dark fleet of old vessels that lack proper insurance, have opaque ownership, and &apos;flag hop&apos; between different permissive ship registries has grown explosively, to an estimated 1,400 ships,&quot; the U.S.-think tank Atlantic Council wrote in its January 2024 report. &quot;Their presence poses considerable risk to other ships, to the environment, and to countries experiencing maritime accidents caused by the vessels,&quot; it added.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-towing-shadow-fleet-tanker/	2025-01-11T03:30:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192693454.jpg
Police dismantle almost 50 illegal border crossing schemes in massive crackdown	The Ukrainian National Police broke up nearly 50 schemes for draft-age Ukrainian men to illegally cross the border, the police said on Jan. 11 after a large-scale operation. The announcement follows 600 simultaneous raids across the country on Jan. 10 aimed at preventing fighting-age men from fleeing abroad. Ukraine prohibits men aged 18-60 from leaving the country under martial law, which was instituted at the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale war in 2022. Sixty suspects were charged in schemes that included crossing the border outside of checkpoints, forging health documents, and inputting falsified entries into an electronic information system, the police said. The defendants included heads of state institutions, hospital managers, military enlistment officers, medical commission officials, and ordinary civilians. According to the statement, men seeking to leave the country paid between $5,000 and $22,000 to the suspects to help them cross the border. The suspects face up to nine years in prison, property confiscation, and a ban on holding certain official positions. The police noted that this concludes the first stage of the operation, as efforts to identify other suspects are underway. Though Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko admitted last June that dozens of men try to illegally cross the border every day, Ukrainian authorities have largely avoided providing exact figures. According to the Romanian police, 11,000 Ukrainian men have illegally crossed the border into Romania between the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and May 2024. As many as 23,500 illegally entered Moldova between February 2022 and last July, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported. Illegal border crossing schemes only deepen the manpower shortages facing the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which then struggle to hold back the Russian advance in Donetsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/police-dismantle-almost-50-illegal-border-crossing-schemes/	2025-01-11T02:49:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/15d5fb17d4c126d08e08ecb6d52de769.jpg
